Executive Summary
Moldova, the poorest country in Europe, has made significant progress in reducing poverty and promoting
inclusive growth since the early 2000s. Economic growth has been largely consumption-driven and fueled
by remittances. Poverty changes are largely derived from remittances and pensions. Employment has
fallen, limiting the role of labor markets in improving living standards. Given that the growth in remittances
and pensions will continue to slow, sustainable progress requires a new growth model driven by higher
private sector growth and job creation (pathway 1: creating more and better jobs), accompanied by
urbanization, and better connectivity and inclusive access to economic opportunities and services (pathway
2: building up and protecting the stock of assets of the population). For Moldova to navigate these two
pathways, the report identifies six critical priorities. The top three include governance challenges that affect
both pathways: (1) strengthening the rule of law and the accountability of institutions, particularly to
unlock the main constraint identified to firm growth and job creation, (2) improving the efficiency and
equity of service delivery, for an enabling environment for firms and individuals to access better economic
opportunities across Moldova and particularly in rural areas,, and (3) increasing the quality, equity, and
relevance of education and training systems, so that Moldovans may become well prepared to access
productive jobs. Priority areas also include (4) improving the business regulatory framework, (5) ensuring
sound macroeconomic and fiscal management, and (6) reforming the social protection system, particularly
pensions. The solutions must reflect Moldova’s specificities: its geography and openness, its legacy , and
its demographics.


                                                    * * *


The economy of Moldova has grown rapidly in the past decade, and growth has been accompanied
by significant progress in reducing poverty and boosting the welfare of the less well off, namely, the
bottom 40 of the consumption distribution (shared prosperity) (the bottom 40). Since the early 2000s,
the economy has expanded by an average of 5 percent a year. Defined according to the national poverty
line, poverty declined substantially and stood at 11 percent in 2014, compared with 26 percent in 2007 and
much higher levels earlier in the decade. Consumption growth among the bottom 40 was consistently higher
than the average consumption growth across the population. In recent years, however, the country has faced
many new adversities, from the financial sector crisis revealed in 2014 and a series of summer droughts, to
the economic slowdown in the European Union (EU) and the Russian Federation on which Moldova is
highly dependent for trade and remittances.
Moldova is considered unique in its openness, its demographics, and its legacy, which, combined,
characterize the past development and future prospects of the country. It is a landlocked country, and
Moldova’s small size (a population of 3.6 million) and central location (bordered by the E U and close to
Russia) have contributed to it being an open economy. Foreign trade represents 120 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), surpassing regional peers of similar size. Remittances account for a quarter of
GDP, among the highest shares in the world. Nonetheless, large-scale emigration, combined with
decreasing fertility rates, has hastened the pace of aging in Moldova. Moldova’s legacy as part of the former
Soviet Union is reflected in an ethnically diverse population, highly fragmented local administration, and
the unresolved status of Transnistria, a frozen conflict.
                                                       1
This report takes a close look at the drivers of past progress and identifies the priorities if Moldova
is to sustain progress in inclusive growth in the future. It finds that, despite progress, poverty remains a
rural phenomenon (Figure E1), with large differences across regions in access to services, assets, and
economic opportunities. The diagnostic shows that the overall progress in poverty reduction so far has been
driven largely by remittances and pensions. Remittances have made a significant contribution to domestic
income, which has fueled private consumption and, together with exports, ignited economic growth.
Remittances, mainly going to rural areas where many of the poor are, have also contributed to poverty
reduction and the welfare improvement of the bottom 40. Pensions have also played an important role in
raising incomes among the population, although mainly in urban areas. At the same time, employment has
declined, led by falling labor force participation rates among both men and women which have reached
very low levels compared to other countries (Figure E2). This declining labor supply is largely explained
by a combination of greater emigration flows, the segment of the inactive who have future migration plans,
and informal workers who drop out of the labor force, all symptoms of low labor demand and very limited
availability of good jobs. In fact, the lack of jobs and the wage differential with richer country neighbors
continue to motivate emigration. Increases in nonagricultural wage income, rather than job creation, have
contributed to inclusive growth in Moldova.

The uncertainty about the drivers of poverty reduction and shared prosperity of the past can
jeopardize the sustainability of future progress. Given the economic slowdown in migrant destination
countries and the eventual detachment of long-term migrants, remittance growth will continue to decline.
Similarly, substantial informality, low labor force participation, and demographic aging will increase the
dependency ratio of the pension system, while reducing system coverage, thereby limiting the role of
                                                             2
pensions in welfare improvement. Finally, because the economy is open and depends significantly on
agriculture, Moldova is highly vulnerable to external demand and climate-related shocks. It is also subject
to potential risks because of high external debt and political instability.
Sustainable progress requires a rebalancing of the growth model for Moldova. As the impact of
remittances and public transfers moderates, this growth model needs to be increasingly driven by higher
private sector growth and job creation, accompanied by urbanization, better connectivity and inclusion for
equitable access to economic opportunities and services. For this, the report proposes two pathways to
achieving the World Bank’s twin goals of reducing poverty and expanding shared prosperity, as follows
(Figure E.3):
   Promoting private sector–led job         Figure E.3. Pathways to the twin goals, Moldova
    creation and higher productivity.
   Ensuring that individuals have the
    human capital stock and ability to
    take on the new jobs and that they are
    protected from shocks that could
    affect their living standards.
The report explores the main constraints
as Moldova navigates the two pathways
toward reducing poverty and boosting
the welfare of the bottom 40. It finds as
follows:
   Firms face multiple obstacles to
    creating jobs. The obstacles relate to
    (a) the access to inputs such as
    infrastructure services, finance, and
    human capital; (b) the regulatory environment, including specific sectoral regulations, particularly in
    the financial and energy sectors, and regulations influencing trade integration; and (c) the
    implementation of regulations, with substantial challenges in terms of rule of law (Figure E.4), the
    judicial system, financial sector weaknesses, and unfair competition, as well as pressures affecting
    sound macroeconomic management.
   The population is not well prepared for a modern labor market. The reasons for the lack of
    preparation include the poor quality, equitability, and relevance of education and training and the
    barriers and disincentives to work. The latter are, in some cases, more pronounced among women.
    Building up the stock of human capital is additionally hampered by poor access to services, reflecting
    the low quality of institutions and inefficient public spending. These constraints are systematically more
    severe in rural areas. Furthermore, households are increasingly vulnerable to shocks, including climatic
    shocks, and social protection systems are not yet adequate to protect them. Pensions, in particular, are
    becoming increasingly inadequate (Figure E.5).

Six priorities are identified in the effort to create jobs and to build up and protect the stock of assets
among the population, with the ultimate goal of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity in
a sustainable manner. Figure E.6 shows that the challenges in governance strongly emerge in following
the two pathways and as top priorities. This suggests that the rule of law and the accountability of
institutions should be strengthened, including in the financial sector, as governance-related indicators have
deteriorated and corruption is cited as the main constraint to operations by firms. In addition, the efficiency
and equity of service delivery should be improved, since limited access to services, especially in rural and
remote areas, has contributed to social exclusion. Raising the quality, equity, and relevance of education
and training systems is a top priority as well, as education and training systems are not keeping up with
labor markets or producing good-quality, equitable educational outcomes. Supporting priorities include
reforming the social protection system, particularly pensions, improving the business regulatory
framework, and ensuring sound macroeconomic and fiscal management. By creating non-farm job
opportunities in rural areas, especially for the large share of farmers with limited potential to commercialize,
and by promoting urbanization, connectivity and equitable service delivery, these priority areas can increase
economic opportunities for those in rural areas, where the poor are concentrated.

The solutions across priorities must reflect Moldova’s specificities. The geography and openness of the
economy, the legacy of the past, and demographic factors permeate the diagnostic. Openness represents the
background for Moldova’s shift from migration- to competitiveness-based growth. The territorial and
ethnolinguistic fragmentation of the country and the high share of the rural population (legacy) are the
context of the spatial disparities and deficiencies in service provision. Similarly, the rapid shrinking and
aging of the population cannot be detached from discussions on fiscal pressures, pensions, productivity,
and labor market participation. Moldova is unique, and so must be its pathway to prosperity.

I. Introduction
Moldova is a small lower-middle-income European economy. The country declared its independence
from the Soviet Union on August 27, 1991 and is considered an intermediate modernizer in the transition
to a market economy.1 Its population is estimated at 3.6 million, although many expect that this will be
adjusted downward after the publication of the 2014 population census. Moldova is a relatively resource-
poor economy: 57 percent of the population was living in rural areas in 2014.2 With a gross domestic
product (GDP) per capita of $4,754 in 2014 (2011 purchasing power parity [PPP]) and a regional poverty
headcount ($5 a day, PPP) of 41 percent, Moldova is one of the poorest countries in the region and the
poorest country in Europe.
Moldova’s growth performance over the last 20 years has been volatile, but , overall, it has been
growing rapidly. There have been three distinct growth episodes in recent years: a period of adjustment
and sharp decline in economic activity in 1995–98, high economic growth—at an average of 5 percent a
year—in 1998–2008, and, after the global financial crisis of 2008–09, in which the economy was greatly
affected, the highest cumulative GDP growth of all regional partners, averaging 5.4 percent in 2010 –15.
Annex A presents key macroeconomic indicators on Moldova during this last period.
In the context of high economic growth, Moldova has made significant progress in reducing poverty
and boosting shared prosperity. After a sharp increase in poverty in 1999 because of the financial crisis
in the Russian Federation (the poverty rate rose by around 20 percentage points, to 71 percent), the national
poverty rate declined substantially, from 68 percent in 2000 to 27 percent in 2004. Based on a different
measurement method, poverty shrank by more than half between 2007 and 2014, from 26 percent to 11
percent. Moldova has also showed good performance in promoting shared prosperity, with 4.8 percent
growth in consumption among the bottom 40 percent of the consumption distribution (the bottom 40) in
2009–14, compared with 1.3 percent across the entire population.
An adverse external environment, a summer drought, and a banking crisis hindered economic
growth and the growth prospects in Moldova in 2015. First, the deep recession of eastern partners and
the trade restrictions Russia imposed on imports from Moldova sharply reduced remittances and cut
Moldova’s exports to Russia in half, while exchange rate rebalancing led to higher inflation. Second, hot
weather and low precipitation caused a double-digit decline in agricultural GDP. Indeed, weather shocks,
particularly droughts, have taken a toll in the past decade: from 2000 to 2012, the country experienced four
devastating droughts (2000, 2003, 2007, and 2012). The annual economic loss caused by natural disasters
was 3.5 percent to 7.0 percent of GDP and even higher in some instances. Finally, a banking crisis brought
on by massive fraud in three banks lowered confidence in the banking sector, leading to significant interest
rate increases and reduced credit to the private sector. The monetary and fiscal cost involved in rescuing
the three insolvent banks (amounting to 12 percent of GDP) led to higher public debt and lower foreign
exchange reserves, damaged business confidence, and reduced the macroeconomic buffers against
economic shocks. The economy contracted by 0.5 percent in 2015, and growth was projected to be limited
in 2016.3

European integration has anchored the government’s policy reform agenda since 2009, but political
instability and corruption have slowed the pace of reform. Negotiations between Moldova and the
European Union (EU) on an Association Agreement and a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement
(DCFTA) began in 2010 and were concluded on June 27, 2014, with the signing of both documents. Visa-
free access for Moldovan citizens travelling to the Schengen area went into effect in April 2014. However,
periodic breakdowns in pro-European coalitions made progress uneven. A series of short-lived governments
stalled the progress of reform, particularly the modernization of public administration. The resulting high
turnover of civil servants in key institutions led to inconsistency in the reform agenda, establishing
additional barriers to reform through governance challenges and corruption.
Governance challenges have continued to take center stage. Transparency, accountability, and
corruption have emerged as crucial concerns. Moldova’s position in the Transparency International
corruption perceptions index has deteriorated since 2012, falling from 94th to 103rd among 175 countries
in 2015, and trust in institutions is low.4 According to the 2014 Eurobarometer Survey, 31 percent of
Moldovans identified corruption as the most important issue facing the country, compared with an average
of 12 percent in the European Neighbourhood and Partnership East Region and 0 percent in Georgia.5 More
recently, 87 percent of citizens stated that corruption is a big problem in Moldova (October 2015).
Corruption in Moldova is also becoming more sophisticated. State capture and grand corruption are
becoming more prevalent, as exemplified by the banking fraud revealed in November 2014 that involved
the loss of the equivalent of 12 percent of the country’s GDP. Three Moldovan banks participated, and a
former prime minister was subsequently arrested. The links between business and political power have
eroded the independence and effectiveness of many regulatory and accountability institutions.
Demonstrations to protest the banking scandal and grand corruption more generally that began in spring
2015 continued when approximately 20,000 people protested in Chișinău in September. The protesters
raised tent cities outside government buildings and Parliament.
This Systematic Country Diagnostic seeks to identify the key constraints and opportunities in the
effort to sustain progress toward the twin goals in Moldova (Box 1). The twin goals adopted by the
World Bank are reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Beyond the traditional goal of poverty
reduction, the shared prosperity goal captures two key elements, economic growth and equity, and focuses
on fostering income and consumption growth among the bottom 40 percent of a country’s population. Thus,
improvements in the shared prosperity indicator require that growth reaches the less well off. The diagnostic
exercise relies on existing knowledge and evidence, complemented by additional analysis, to propose
priority areas where the country might reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity in a sustainable manner.
Box 1. What is Systematic Country Diagnostic?

    The Systematic Country Diagnostic is an evidence-based diagnostic exercise that is upstream of the World Bank
    Country Partnership Framework and that provides the analytical underpinnings for the Country Partnership
    Framework discussions. It is conducted by the World Bank and involves technical consultations with national
    authorities and other stakeholders, including civil society, development partners, and academia. The diagnostics

    Its objective is to address the question: what are the most critical constraints (and opportunities) facing a country
    in accelerating progress toward the goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a
    sustainable manner? Interpreted in a particular country context, these goals can refer to the notion of alleviating
    the poverty and enhancing the welfare of those at the bottom of the distribution, for example, the bottom two
    quintiles. The diagnostic is meant to be a concise report based on the best possible analysis, drawing on available
    evidence, and not limited a priori to areas or sectors where the World Bank is currently active or expects government
    demand.


The remainder of this document is organized as follows. Section II presents three key contextual factors
that make Moldova different from other countries in the region and the world. Section III describes
Moldova’s progress toward the twin goals in the past decade, and Section IV unpacks the drivers of the
progress. Section V lays out some challenges to sustainability. Sections VI and VII present the core of the
diagnostic of the main constraints on sustainable progress. Section VIII outlines the priorities if Moldova
is to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity. Section IX provides details on the knowledge and data
gaps identified in the report.

II. What makes Moldova unique?
Relative to other countries, three main factors make Moldova unique and shape the current context
and performance of the country as well as the policy options available to achieve sustainable progress
toward the twin goals: geography and openness, demographics, and legacy.
Geography and openness
Moldova is a small country. With a population of 3.6 million and a size of 33,800 square kilometers,
Moldova is one of the smallest countries in Europe. Bordered by the EU to the west (Romania) and by
Ukraine to the north and south, the country is landlocked.
Moldova is an open economy. Moldova is highly integrated into the global marketplace, exceeding the
levels of openness of other countries at comparable income per capita. Figure 1 shows that Moldova is more
open and more integrated into the global economy than expected given its development level. Indeed, with
a trade-to-GDP ratio of 120 percent, Moldova’s trade openness surpasses that of regional peers of
comparable size, such as Albania, Georgia, and Serbia. However, most of the trade openness is explained
by the high share of imports, including the energy imports on which Moldova is almost entirely dependent.6
In addition, because of the possibility of the free movement of people both to the EU and to the countries
of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Moldova is highly open in terms of international mobility.7
Beginning with the year 2000, official statistical data on migration show an almost threefold increase in the

6Moldova is in the 95 percentile worldwide in the share of imported energy, at 96.2 percent of the energy used.
7 The share of citizens holding dual nationality has increased incrementally since the 2002 passage of a law allowing dual
nationality. An estimated 2.4 million Moldovans are eligible for Romanian citizenship, of whom over 300,000 have taken advantage
of the opportunity, and between 800,000 and 1.5 million have applied. The Commonwealth of Independent States was formed
when the former Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. It now consists of nine full members. All are former Soviet Republics: Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.

population in 2014).8 Remittances from Moldovans abroad represent the equivalent of a quarter of
Moldova’s GDP, one of the highest shares in the region and the world (Figure 2).

Demographics
The population of Moldova has been shrinking since the country’s independence in 1991 and at a
much faster pace than other countries in Europe and Central Asia. From 1990 to 2015, the population
dwindled by 21 percent (Figure 3), which is likely an underestimation given the lack of recent census data.9
Three concurrent trends contributed to this: emigration among the youth population, sharply declining
fertility rates, and slow progress in life expectancy. Declining fertility rates stem from decreasing child
mortality and high modern contraceptive uptake, as well as from the increase in wages and in educational
attainment among women, which raised the opportunity costs of children.10 Longevity, on the other hand,
has been slowed by unhealthy behaviors (smoking and drinking) and low access to health care.11 If these
trends continue, Moldova can expect to see its population shrink by another 31 percent, or a reduction of
1.2 million people, by 2060. The future Moldovan population would, as a result, be much smaller and older.


8 There is a huge discrepancy in the number of Moldovan migrants presented in various sources; some argue as many as 1 million
people may be working abroad.
9 The population of Moldova, estimated by the United Nations, does not include Transnistria. See World Population Prospects: The

2015 Revision (database), Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations, New York,

The average age would increase from 38 in 2015 to 47 in 2060. In the same period, the share of the elderly
would more than double, to 27 percent, and women in their 60s and 70s would account for a major part of
the population.
Moldova faces the starkest demographic challenges of the Europe and Central Asia region. A ranking
of all the countries in the Europe and Central Asia region in terms of eight socioeconomic indicators related
to aging shows that Moldova is in the most challenging situation (Figure 4).12 Its fertility rate in 2015 was
among the lowest in the region, and its net emigration was among the highest. These two factors have
resulted in a steady decrease in the working–age population. In addition, Moldova’s labor force
participation rate is particularly low, with 1.5 inactive adults (aged 15 and above) for every active one. This
high dependency ratio, together with relatively high old-age morbidity and mortality rates—in 2012, life
expectancy at birth was 59 years among men and 66 among women in 2012, compared with 65 and 69,
respectively, in the region—represents a substantial challenge.

 Note: Figure 3: the population forecast beyond 2015 is based on the medium fertility, normal mortality, and normal migration
 scenario. This scenario assumes that fertility rates follow a trend from high to low then fluctuate around the replacement rate
 (2.1 children per woman) and life expectancy at birth and that migration follows the historical trends of each country and similar
 countries in the region. For Moldova, the estimates are taken from the 2012 Revision, which does not include Transnistria.
 Regional averages are simple averages. Details on the indicators included are supplied in the text.




12The indicators include the total fertility rate, healthy life expectancy, net immigration, the economic dependency ratio (the ratio
of the inactive to the active among the 15+ population), PISA scores in science, gross debt as a share of GDP, the ratio of relative
poverty among the elderly (ages 65+) to the young (ages 15–24), and the ratio of voting participation among the elderly to the
young (Bussolo, Koettl, and Sinnott 2015).

Moldova’s ethnic and linguistic diversity has also shaped the development of the country.14 Moldova’s
population comprises, alongside ethnic Moldovans and Romanians, a number of other ethnic groups,
including Ukrainians, Russians, Gagauz, Bulgarians, and others, who account for about 22 percent of the
population. Similarly, around 25 percent do not speak Romanian/Moldovan as their first language.15 The
2004 census revealed that about 15 percent of households have mixed nationality, and a much larger number
of households—around 35 percent—may have a mixed ethnic background. Political and electoral
preferences are influenced by membership in ethnic groups. Popular opinion remains divided between two
supranational entities, the EU and the Eurasian Economic Union. Opinion polls show roughly equal



13 This does not include five raions in Transnistria.
14 On August 31, 1989 the Moldovan language, which is written in the Latin script and shares the same literary standard as
Romanian, was declared the official language of the country. Previously, Russian had been the official language of the Moldavian
SSR, while Moldovan, written in the Cyrillic script, was also taught in schools and used widely informally. Russian is still the
predominant language of all national minorities in Moldova (about a quarter of the population), who typically attend Russian-
language schools, though some also take additional courses in their mother tongue (Bulgarian, Gagauz, Ukrainian).

access to markets in various larger regional economies such as Romania, Russia, and Ukraine.
Furthermore, Transnistria, located in the eastern part of the country, remains a frozen conflict.
Having declared independence from Moldova in 1990, Transnistria has no international recognition, and
the status of the region remains unresolved and subject to ongoing settlement negotiations (Box 2).
Box 2. Transnistria
Transnistria remains in unresolved status, but dialogue continues. Authorities in Transnistria, the territory of the
Republic of Moldova located on the eastern side of the Nistru/Dniestr River, proclaimed the area an autonomous
republic in 1990. In March 1992, violence erupted and escalated into a five-month civil war. Transnistria operates as
a de facto state, but is not recognized by any international party. This situation has c ontinued to weigh on Moldova’s
development path, including on negotiations for the EU-Moldova Association Agreement and DCFTA.
The resumption of dialogue—the 5 + 2 settlement process—in February 2012, after stalling for six years, provides an
opportunity for progress on the settlement process, although recent developments in eastern Ukraine and Transnistria’s
difficult economic situation due in part to wider regional challenges are new sources of risk. a The framework for
international support for the settlement process is based on confidence-building, seen as cementing the positive
developments in the negotiation process. Confidence-building measures and negotiations brokered by the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe play an important development function in keeping
infrastructure and supply networks open between the regions and eastward.
Assessing poverty, poverty reduction, and broader development needs in the Transnistria region has been a challenge
because of the lack of reliable household survey data. Some human development indicators (for example, on HIV
prevalence) reveal that development challenges may be significantly starker in Transnistria. Transnistria also
comprises diverse ethnic language groups; about a third of the population are estimated to be Romanian/Moldovan
speakers. The education system and curricula in Moldova and Transnistria are diverging, which obstructs the mobility
of young people in tertiary education, jobs, and so on. Enhanced social and economic cooperation on both sides of the
Nistru/Dniester River can only serve to increase resilience in the face of escalating conflict in the future.
a. Moldova, Russia, Transnistria, Ukraine, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe are direct participants in
this process, and the United States and the EU act as external observers. Ukraine assumed the chairmanship of the Organization for
Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2013, and additional momentum was expected at that time.

Contextual and structural factors have shaped the country’s development and its prospects and
suggest appropriate comparator countries for Moldova to facilitate the core diagnostics of this report
(Figure 6). Benchmarking Moldova’s performance using countries with which it shares commonalities can
strengthen the analysis and be a powerful input into identifying the main constraints facing the country. To
identify comparators in a transparent way, a set of indicators aligned with Moldova’s country factors have
been selected: population (for size), trade and remittances as a share of GDP (for openness), fertility rates
(for demographics), and rural population share (for legacy). Driven by these indicators and selected
thresholds, the comparator countries selected from a worldwide pool of countries are Albania, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, the Slovak
Republic, and Slovenia.17 The comparator countries are limited to the Europe and Central Asia region

III.      How has Moldova fared in advancing toward the twin goals?18
Moldova has made significant progress in reducing poverty. Before the Russian financial crisis of 1999,
the consumption-based national absolute poverty rate stood at 52 percent. This skyrocketed to around 71
percent in 1999.19 Poverty declined significantly after that economic shock, from 68 percent in 2000 to 40
percent in 2002 and 27 percent in 2004. Poverty measured at the regional extreme and moderate poverty
lines, calculated at $2.50 a day and $5.00 a day, respectively, also showed a downward trend. Moderate
poverty declined, for example, from 95 percent to 83 percent in the first half of the 2000s (Figure 7). Despite
a change in the methodology for poverty calculation in 2006 that limits comparability with poverty in
previous years, poverty rates continued the downward trend (Figure 8). From 2007 to 2014, national poverty
fell by more than half, dropping from 26 percent to 11 percent, although the global financial crisis and
climatic and external shocks decelerated the downward trend. The regional poverty lines portray a similar
picture of progress. The depth and severity of poverty in Moldova have also declined in the past decade and
a half.

Upward economic mobility in Moldova underlies the observed trends in poverty. During the last
decade, a large share of poor households was able to improve their living standards and escape poverty,
while few nonpoor households fell into poverty. Since the domestic financial crisis, the share of people who
have been persistently stuck in poverty is low, and churning—the phenomenon of people exiting and
reentering poverty even repeatedly—seems to be limited.20
The performance of Moldova in reducing inequality and boosting shared prosperity has also been
positive. Inequality fell, and the Gini coefficient went from 0.30 to 0.23 between 2007 and 2014 (Figure
9). The consumption growth of the bottom 40—the indicator of shared prosperity—averaged 4.8 percent
over 2009–14, compared with an average 1.3 percent across the entire population (Figure 10). Relative to
other countries in the region, the performance of Moldova in promoting shared prosperity has been good
(Figure 11).

This progress notwithstanding, Moldova is one of the poorest countries in the region and the poorest
country in Europe. GDP per capita was $4,754 (2011 PPP) in 2014, which is lower than in most countries
in Europe and Central Asia. Its regional moderate poverty rate ($5.00 a day) stands at 40.7 percent, only
surpassed by a few countries in the region (Figure 12). Furthermore, a large share of the population—44.6
percent—was concentrated among the vulnerable ($5.00–$10.00-a-day consumption), meaning that they
are not poor, but at risk of falling back into poverty.

Poverty in Moldova remains a rural phenomenon, and large spatial disparities remain. The rural
poverty rate stands at 19 percent, compared with 5 percent in urban areas (Figure 13). While 57 percent of
the population lives in rural areas, 84 percent of the poor are concentrated there. The poor and nonpoor in
rural areas rely more on agriculture and remittances for income relative to their urban counterparts, who
derive more income from nonagricultural employment (Figure 14). Thus, rural areas felt the shock of the
2007 drought much more than urban areas, and poverty rose from 31 percent in 2007 to a peak of 36 percent
in 2009, although the downward trend quickly resumed in 2010. Poverty also varies significantly between
regions. The lowest poverty rate is in the capital city, Chișinău, and the highest poverty rate is in the center
and southern regions (Figure 15). These two regions account for around 66 percent of the poor, but a little
less than half of Moldova’s total population.

The poor and the bottom 40 have a lower stock of human capital, limiting their income-generating
opportunities. The poor and bottom 40 exhibit lower levels of educational attainment. Thus, 28 percent of
the poor had attained tertiary education in 2014, compared with 53 percent of the nonpoor (Figure 16).
Access to services is also particularly constrained among the poor and the bottom 40. For example, 47
percent of the poor have access to piped water, compared with 77 percent of the nonpoor.21 Similarly, only
29 percent of the poor have access to a sewerage system, and 11 percent have toilets inside the household,
whereas this share is 68 percent and 44 percent among the nonpoor, respectively. Deprivations are more
severe among some population groups. The Roma, a small ethnic minority estimated to account for around
0.4 percent of the population, are deprived across more dimensions than the non-Roma in the same
locality.22
Disparities also exist across groups. Poverty has been decreasing in recent years among all age-groups,
but the elderly and children remain slightly more likely to be living in poverty. Similarly, households with
members who are children and members who are elderly, as well as households consisting only of elderly
members show higher poverty rates relative to the rest of the population. Poor households typically have
more members than nonpoor households and significantly higher dependency ratios, especially the child
dependency ratio (ages 0–14 years) (Figure 17).

The poor and the bottom 40 also typically hold lower-quality jobs, particularly those people in rural
areas. Although employment rates are low across the board, there are substantial differences in the quality
of employment across socioeconomic groups. The poor are more likely to be self-employed and less likely
to engage in wage employment (Figure 18) than the nonpoor, and a higher share of both groups were in
self-employment in 2014 than in 2007. Even among the employed, the poor and the bottom 40 are more
concentrated than the nonpoor in the agricultural sector. This is related to the higher concentration of the
bottom 40 in rural areas, especially in 2014 (Figure 19). Given the high informality in agriculture compared
with other sectors, this dependence on agricultural employment means that the informality rate among the
poor and the bottom 40 is high. Accordingly, the reliance on agricultural income of the poor means that
they are more prone to shocks related to natural hazards.

In sum, Moldova has made significant progress in poverty reduction and shared prosperity.
Nonetheless, it needs to sustain this progress to catch up with the living standards of other countries in the
region. The important question is whether the progress achieved so far can be sustained moving forward
given the remaining challenges, particularly the large spatial disparities revealed in the profile of the poor.
Identifying the drivers of this progress is therefore key. The next section explores this issue.

IV. What has driven progress toward the twin goals?
High, pro-poor economic growth has contributed to improved living standards and declines in
inequality in Moldova. Moldova’s economy has grown on average by 5 percent annually since 2000
(Figure 20). Compared with countries in the region, its growth performance has been stellar, even in the
postcrisis period, with the exception of the drought in 2012 and the downturn in 2015 (Figure 21). The rapid
economic growth translated into consumption growth for each quintile of the population in 2000–05 and
2007–14. (In Moldova, trends show that GDP growth and household consumption and income growth move
in tandem.)23 Even though growth slowed during the second period, it was particularly pro-poor, continuing
the process of poverty and inequality reduction (Figure 22). Consistently, a decomposition of poverty
changes between increases in mean consumption growth and changes in consumption distribution shows
that mean consumption growth led the poverty changes in the first half of the 2000s, while both
consumption growth and redistribution had a role in the second half and onward.

However, the high, pro-poor consumption growth experienced by Moldova was not underpinned by
the creation of good jobs. Official employment rates of men and women ages 15 or above in both urban
and rural areas, consistently declined over the 2000s; the average fell from 55 percent in 2000 to 39 percent
in 2010. The service sector was the only sector with net new job creation in the first decade of the 2000s
up to the global financial crisis in 2008–09, but the trend has faded since then. Urban areas and the service
sector accounted for most of the gains in better jobs during that earlier period.24 Since 2010, employment
has remained relatively stable (Figure 23), but particularly low among women and rural residents. This
stable trend masks spatial inequalities, however. Employment rose in Chișinău, while it decreased in most
other regions.25 Of equal concern is the prevalence of underemployment, especially among those who are
self-employed and those who work in rural areas or in agriculture. Some of the underemployment may be
voluntary, but the high level of underemployment suggests that jobs in these areas were lower quality
(Figure 24).

more pronounced in rural areas, is explained by a

period. Between 2000 and 2006, about 7–8 percent of the labor force was unemployed; the unemployment
rate then fell dramatically to 4 percent by 2008, rising back to more than 7 percent by 2010 and again
declining at a rapid pace to 4 percent by 2014.
Moldova also stands out as a country with low worker productivity, reflecting an incomplete
transition from a planned economy, with a large primary sector and pervasive informal employment.
Informal employment is high in Moldova relative to other countries in the region. The incidence of total
informal employment is around 30 percent, while it is 10 percent among wage employees, who are
concentrated mostly in micro and small enterprises.29 This reflects a large agricultural sector dominated by
many small subsistence farms. Although smaller than in the past, a large share of employment remains in

28 In accordance with the international recommendations currently in force, the definition of employment adopted by the National

Bureau of Statistics excludes persons who worked for less than 20 hours in the production of agricultural goods exclusively for
own consumption by their household or persons who render unpaid domestic or personal services to their own household.
Moreover, following international definitions and to harmonize employment statistics with national accounts statistics, those
working abroad are defined as inactive (Ronnås 2015).
29 The definition of informal employment in Moldova comprises the self-employed in the informal sector, unpaid family workers,

and wage workers who do not receive any of the following three benefits: (a) social contributions paid by the employer, (b) paid
annual leave, or (c) sick leave (World Bank 2014b).

the agricultural sector. Over the first decade of the 2000s, the share of agricultural employment in total
employment decreased, falling to 28 percent in 2010 compared with 51 percent in 2000. Both industry and
agriculture saw sharp declines in employment, particularly up to 2010 (thus, there were over 450,000 fewer
jobs in agriculture between 2000 and 2010), in line with changes in the productive structure of the economy:
by 2010, compared with 1995, the share of the industrial and agricultural sectors in GDP had decreased 29
percentage points in favor of nontradable sectors (Figure 26 and Figure 27). The decline in agricultural jobs
in the early and middle years of the first decade of the 2000s was associated with the migration of
agricultural workers abroad. For instance, a 2012 survey of labor migration revealed that more than two
migrants in five had worked in agriculture in their home country (43.3 percent).30 Whereas most working-
age Moldovans are still rural, an increasing share of the workforce is becoming urban, given the domestic
and high international emigration from rural areas. From 2010 onward, employment in agriculture rose at
the expense of employment in other sectors; the number of agricultural jobs climbed from 315,000 to
361,000 between 2010 and 2014.
In addition, an increasing number of people are working in subsistence agriculture. Expanding the
official definition of employment used in Moldova so as to include people in self-employment in agriculture
for own consumption who are working less than 20 hours a week reveals that the share of people with these
types of jobs rose from 15 percent of those working in agriculture in 2007 to 24 percent in 2014. This
suggests that a larger share of people—mainly older people and the less well educated—now engage in
unpaid, low-intensity agricultural jobs. Many of these people are likely to be among the poor.

While the gender gaps in employment are relatively narrow, segregation by economic sector has given
rise to gender inequalities. For instance, 75 percent of working women are concentrated in three sectors:
public administration and education, agriculture, and trade and hotel services. Only 21 percent of firms

employ women as top managers. This segregation underpins a gender wage gap of 26 percent, even in
sectors in which women predominate.31
Wages have increased, but not enough to compensate for the employment trends. Throughout the
2000s, real average wages were on an upward trend, significantly exceeding the labor productivity growth
and contributing to an import and consumption boom. Since 2009, the trend has reversed: wage growth has
moderated and has become more sustainable, in line with (or even lagging) underlying labor productivity
growth (Figure 28). Compared with neighboring countries, however, productivity is low in Moldova
(Figure 29), and the relatively lower wage growth, especially in rural areas, may limit the role of labor in
poverty reduction and shared prosperity. A closer look at wages reveals that the wage gap between the
public and private sectors has widened in recent years, given that there has been no wage indexation in
public wages since October 2014 and that wage inequalities between men and women persist, particularly
in more highly skilled sectors.32

The deteriorating labor market has led to a reduction in the labor income share in the total income
of the poor and the bottom 40. The slowdown in nonagricultural wage increases, the high volatility in
agricultural incomes because of climatic shocks, and the limited overall employment growth resulted in a
declining share of labor income among the poor and the bottom 40. Among the poor, the share of total
income represented by nonagricultural labor income fell from 38 percent in 2007 to 34 percent in 2014, and
the share represented by agricultural income dropped from 21 percent to 17 percent.

32The gender wage gap is significant in higher-income, more highly skilled sectors. For example, it is 9 percent in agriculture and
28 percent in financial services (Spear et al. 2016).

Labor markets contributed to household income growth and poverty reduction mostly through
nonagricultural wages, as the quantity of jobs fell. Household income data are not available prior to 2006
to explore the dynamics in the early 2000s. Evidence from 2007 onward shows that the contribution of
domestic labor income to the income growth of the bottom 40 (Figure 30) was driven by higher wages in
the nonagricultural sector. However, the positive impacts were partially offset by the destruction of
nonagricultural jobs between 2007 and 2010. Fluctuations in agricultural income in both jobs and earnings
over the period undermined the overall contribution of the sector to household income growth. The same
patterns are evident in the contribution to poverty reduction (Figure 31).

Employment growth and labor productivity contributed little to economic growth in line with the
aggregate labor market trend of falling employment. Their contribution has actually decreased since the
economic and financial crisis of 2008–09 (Figure 32). The small contribution of labor to growth
distinguished Moldova among peers, including lower-middle-income countries (Figure 33). Most of the
growth in the past 15 years is explained by total factor productivity and capital accumulation. The former
led economic growth in Moldova. Although patterns changed following the global economic crisis – total
factor productivity’s contribution to GDP growth decreased, substituted by a more dynamic accumulation
of capital – the role of labor remained negligible.

If the labor market is not the main engine behind rapid economic growth and progress in
poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Moldova, what is?
Progress toward the twin goals in Moldova has been underpinned by consumption-driven growth,
fueled by remittances. Private consumption and, to a lesser extent, exports ignited the economic growth
in Moldova in the past decades. They contributed as much as 7 percentage points to GDP growth in 1999–
2008, prior to the global economic crisis Figure 34). In the 2000s up to the global economic crisis, Moldova
was in the 95th percentile worldwide in private consumption growth, and today is in the 97th percentile
worldwide on consumption expenditure as a share of GDP.33 The limited productive capacity of the
economy is reflected in low productivity and little employment creation. Remittance inflows were driving
both the private sector consumption boom and the surge in imports of the 2000s, benefiting especially the
trade and transport sector and communication services, which contributed an average 1.4 percentage points
to the annual growth rate. Indeed, the dependence on remittance inflows tripled in the first half of the 2000s.
The share of remittances in GDP rose from 11.5 percent in 2000 to a peak of 32.8 percent in 2006, a period
of significant poverty reduction and declines in domestic employment.34 The growth of remittances
complemented the high GDP growth and made significant contributions to domestic income (Figure 35).
From 2010 to 2014, for example, remittances accounted for around 21 percent of the income growth of the
bottom 40 (Figure 30). They represented an important source of income for households, accounting, in
2014, for almost one-quarter of total income among the rural nonpoor (who are the most dependent on

but ahead of foreign direct investment (FDI), loans, and external assistance.

Moldova’s growth model triggered a cycle in which men and women mi grated in search of better
economic opportunities and sent remittances home that continued to support consumption-driven
growth. The wage differential with richer countries in Western Europe and Russia (Figure 36) and the lack
of jobs at home were likely push factors for emigration. Together with weak industrial capacity, which was
producing mainly food products, and high internal demand, remittance inflows led to an increase in imports
and widening trade deficits, although with no evidence of a Dutch Disease.35 This and a lack of
entrepreneurial activity undermined export growth in domestically produced products, which limited
business expansion, investment possibilities, and job creation. Under these circumstances, many
Moldovans continued to seek better opportunities abroad. More remittance inflows were generated, and the
cycle repeated itself (Figure 37). Migration and remittances affect the labor market decisions not only of
those traveling abroad for work, but also of those who stay behind: people with family members abroad
show a lower probability of participating in the labor market (by around 8 percentage points), and the
correlation is two times greater in the case of migrants away for a year or more.36 Moreover, the gender
differences in the jobs available were similar at home and in destination countries, so that women tended
to be left behind.37

2014. The pension share of income rose from 11
percent in 2007 to 18 percent in 2014, and pensions have had a major role in the increase in incomes and
the reduction in poverty among the bottom 40 (Figure 30 and Figure 31). The contribution of social
assistance to household income growth has been limited, but it is important for the poor and helped propel
people out of poverty, particularly following the contraction in GDP in 2009.
The fiscal proceeds of this remittance-fueled, consumption-driven economic growth have contributed
to fiscal stability and the strengthening of social programs, but there is scope for improvement. Since

the 2008–09 crisis, the government has used the proceeds of economic growth to bring fiscal deficits down
and to increase the allocation for public capital expenditure and social assistance. The fiscal deficit
narrowed from over 6 percent in 2009 to some 2 percent in 2012–15 (Figure 38). Capital expenditure,
financed by general government accounts, increased from 5 percent of GDP in 2009–11 to over 8 percent
of GDP in 2014. The targeting of social assistance improved because of the well-targeted program Ajutor
Social and the heating allowance, although these represent a small share of total social transfers. However,
there is a scope for improvement within the overall expenditure envelope, including in the allocation of
social benefits, the procurement of goods and services, capital investments, and the rationalization of
employment within the public sector. In 2015, a combination of an economic downturn, tighter monetary
policy, and political instability triggered an ad hoc adjustment in public expenditures and a sharp reduction
in capital and other nonsalary and pension expenditure.

V. Can progress toward the twin goals be sustained?
Given good progress in reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity, the emerging question is
then the following: are the positive trends in the current drivers of poverty reduction and shared
prosperity sustainable? The answer is probably not.
Moldova has made good progress in reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity, but the
sustainability of these and future gains is doubtful. Progress that relies on private and public transfers
without job creation does not offer a sustainable path for improving the living standards of the population,
particularly in the context of an aging society. Beyond concerns over the sustainability of the drivers of
progress toward the twin goals, economic growth has become increasingly volatile.
In particular, there are three critical pressure points inhibiting the achievement of sustained progress
toward the twin goals (Figure 39).

  Note: Growth of remittances in real values (nominal U.S. dollars Even before the recent decline, moreover,
  deflated by the consumer price index).                           the growth of remittances had slowed over
the last decade (Figure 40), and, considering a longer time horizon, the growth of remittance inflows will
likely diminish further as a large share of the Moldovan population is already living and working abroad,
and the attachment of second-generation migrants and subsequent-generation migrants to Moldova will
likely loosen.
Migration and dependence on remittances have also raised serious social issues, which have
encouraged a call for additional drivers of growth. First, in a situation of uncertain remittance inflows,
a share of households may face economic stress if alternative sources of income, such as pensions and social
assistance, are not sufficient to cover basic needs. Households composed of pensioners and children in rural
areas are particularly at risk. Second, beyond economic concerns, children deprived of parental care seem
to struggle with their emotional development, social relations, and school performance.39 Migrants working
abroad have left around 146,000 children (21 percent of all children) without one or both parents.40
Grandparents assume the role of the main caretakers in most cases, limiting the potential for participation
of these older workers in the labor market. In households in which both parents migrate abroad, older people
become the responsible carers in 91 percent of cases, especially the older women, and, if one parent is
abroad, 36 percent of children are being cared for by older people, even if one parent remains in Moldova.41
Moldova’s history of large-scale emigration can create social challenges in the long term as older migrants
return and face difficulties in reintegration.

research has highlighted the extremely important role of older people in childcare and education if the parents of the children
migrate for work abroad. Older people also replace the parents as legal representatives of children, having guardianship or tutorship
in 34.7 percent of the multigenerational households affected by migration (HelpAge International and UNICEF 2010).

The role of pensions is unsustainable
Low labor force participation and high informality, coupled with population aging, will drive up
Moldova’s economic dependency ratio, straining the fiscal system and limiting the role of public
transfers in reducing poverty. Because of the low (formal) employment rate, driven by an unsustainably
low retirement age and the persistent decline in labor force participation among both men and women, there
were 1.4 inactive adults per active adult (ages 15+) by 2015. Combined with the growing share of the
elderly in the population, most of whom are inactive, Moldova already faces an exceptionally high
economic dependency ratio. This is expected to persist under various scenarios in labor force participation
(Figure 41), unless this manages to raise the labor force participation rate and converge toward, for instance,
the labor force participation rate in Georgia, which has the highest activity rate among comparators.
However, even sustaining current public spending would imply a higher fiscal burden, and may not be
sufficient to provide support for the elderly population.
A shrinking contribution base would undermine the pension system’s sustainability and reduce the
pension coverage of the population. Pensions have played an important role in poverty reduction and
shared prosperity in the past decade.42 However, there is serious concern about the fiscal sustainability and
coverage of pensions. If the system fails, this could put the population at risk that relies on the system,
particularly elderly women given their longer life expectancy and low formal employment rate. Pension
spending has already increased significantly: the cost of pensions doubled to 8 percent of GDP between
1999 and 2014, requiring subsidies of 10 percent of pension spending from the state budget. This level of
spending is higher than the corresponding spending in many European countries that are more advanced in
both economic development and population aging, such as Croatia, Estonia, and the Slovak Republic.43
According to current demographic projections, the pension system dependency ratio (the number of
pensioners per contributor) will increase from 77 percent in 2014 to a peak of 108 percent in 2055 because
the future workforce, the contributor base, will be smaller than the current workforce (the future retirees)
(Figure 42). This dependency ratio of the contributory pension system will eventually narrow with shrinking
pension coverage given the decline in formality and in the contributions to social insurance, but this raises
concerns about the risk of poverty among those left out of the pension system (see section VII). Labor
migrants do not tend to contribute to the pension system, exacerbating the decreasing pension contribution
rates. Furthermore, without a reform of the pension system, the average replacement rate is projected to fall
steadily from 28 percent to almost 13 percent in 2047, which would be socially unsustainable.

The increase in the volatility of the climate and in the economy and politics
Vulnerability to climate-related shocks is substantial, and this is having an impact on the economy.
Episodes of drought, most recently in the summer of 2015, are increasingly driving fluctuations in overall
GDP (Figure 43) and household consumption. The severe drought in 1994 resulted in a decline in GDP by
30 percent, while the 2007 drought affected 84 percent of the country’s arable land, household food security,
and access to water.44 The drought led to estimated losses in the agricultural sector of about $1 billion, or
23 percent of GDP. Drought patterns also show spatial variation. On average, northern Moldova
experiences a drought once every 10 years; central Moldova, once every 5 or 6 years; and southern
Moldova, once every 3 or 4 years. Drought has become more frequent and intense during the last two
decades, occurring ten times (1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2007, 2012, and 2015), leading
to significant crop losses. In 1990, 1992, 2003, and 2007, drought was observed during the entire growing
season. In the remaining years, drought struck during summer.

                                                         The Notre Dame global adaptation index
                                                         methodology ranks Moldova as the most climate
vulnerable country in Europe based on a range of social and economic indicators, including low adaptation
capacity.46
The agricultural sector, critical for the livelihoods of the rural poor, is highly and increasingly
volatile. Climate change can impact productivity through direct losses in yields, which affect small farmers
who rely on self-production for subsistence, but also through higher food prices, which affect consumers.
Climate change impacts the yields of pastures and most crops, including wheat, maize, alfalfa, grapes, and
vegetables. However, apple yields may remain constant.47 The effects of climate change, if not properly
managed, could therefore undermine the progress that has been made in poverty reduction, food security,
and economic growth in vulnerable rural areas.
External shocks have become a growing source of uncertainty and volatility in recent years. As a
small and open economy, Moldova is extremely vulnerable to external demand shocks. Beyond the effects
of the economic slowdown of countries in the region, Moldova has faced restrictions on exports to Russia.
In 2006, exports of wine and other alcoholic beverages, fruits, vegetables, and meat were restricted, and, in
2013–14, exports of fruits and vegetables, processed foods, wine, and meat products were restricted.48
Moreover, external debt is high in Moldova relative to other countries at similar income levels; it is
dominated by short-term debt, making the country highly vulnerable to rollovers. The stock of total
external debt reached 98 percent of GDP by the end of 2015, when short-term debt accounted for more than
60 percent (Figure 44). Private external debt dominates in the structure of debt with a share of over 70
percent, consisting mostly of short-term trade credits and longer-term borrowing in the nonbanking sector
(see Table 1). Significant private sector external debt represents a rollover risk.49

The government’s substantial reliance on foreign borrowing may also pose risks. While the share of
public debt is relatively small (35.4 percent in 2015), it has played an important role in deficit financing in
recent years. In 2010–15, an average of 64 percent of the fiscal deficit was financed by net external
borrowing. While official long-term financing dominates the composition of public external debt, a large
part of it represents budget support that depends on progress in the implementation of reform. Political
instability and delays in reform could substantially reduce the available financing, especially because the
domestic government securities market is relatively small and illiquid.
Fiscal sustainability is challenged by contingent liabilities stemming from major shortcomings in the
financial sector. Joint IMF-WB debt sustainability analysis assesses Moldova’s risk of debt distress as
low.50 Moldova maintained a low public debt of 30 percent of GDP until late 2014. In 2014–15, however,
the government guaranteed deposits in failed banks worth 12 percent of GDP. These guarantees are to be
converted into direct public debt in 2016 to be repaid over 25 years. The risks of additional contingent
liabilities, especially in the financial sector, are nonnegligible, as the root causes of the previous banking
crisis have not been fully mitigated. In addition, the reliance of public coffers on donor support is
substantial, and corruption and slippages in the implementation of reform can lead to delays in donor
financing and further reduce the government’s ability to finance planned expenditure, as witnessed in 2015.
Political instability has also increased, and trust in government plummeted in recent years. The latter is
linked to the banking fraud that revealed large deficiencies in the regulation, supervision, and governance
of the sector (see below).

gains in poverty reduction and shared
prosperity mean there must be new
drivers of inclusive growth. Given the
dwindling role of remittances and public
transfers and the increasing pressures
because     of     aging,    strengthening
household earning capacity is essential.
In particular, the agenda should focus on
(a) promoting private sector–led job
creation and higher productivity (section
VI) and (b) ensuring that individuals have
the human capital to take on the new jobs
and that they are protected from shocks to
their living standards (section VII)
(Figure 45).
These pathways will support a
rebalanced growth model in Moldova.
This growth model may continue to rely on remittances, but needs to be largely driven by private sector
growth and job creation across sectors, accompanied by urbanization and better connectivity and inclusion
for equitable access to economic opportunities and services. Because of its cross-cutting nature, the
potential role of governance in deterring progress along the two pathways must be evaluated. Issues such
as the quality of institutions, the efficiency of the judicial system, the application of the rule of law, and the
perceptions of corruption need to be explored.

VI. Creating more and better jobs




The aggregate decline in employment is consistent with the failure of the private sector to create jobs.
Firms are not creating jobs on a net basis (Figure 46, left panel), mostly because the firing firms are
shrinking much more quickly than the hiring firms are expanding.51 Until the global crisis, service and trade
firms and firms in Chișinău were creating jobs, although not sufficiently to offset the job losses in
agriculture and construction. Net job loss in recent years has taken place across sectors (Figure 46, right
panel) and across regions. The few jobs created tend to benefit skilled older male workers in urban areas.52

Low employment creation seems to be related to the low entry and survival rates of firms. Firm entry
has declined in Moldova, and the survival rate is extremely low, particularly among small firms. Most new
entrants are small and face difficulties expanding and surviving. Between 2003 and 2014, around 55.6
percent of firms with less than 10 employees exited before they had reached the fifth year of operation; 50.0
percent exited within three years. After five years, firms enjoy a higher probability of surviving and
growing. These small, young firms are among the most productive. The inability of these more-productive
new entrants to break through thus limits the creation of better, higher-productivity jobs and also
undermines the link between a rise in productivity and higher wages that has been observed in Moldova.53
The patterns result in an increase in the concentration of employment in large and older firms, which also
tend to be public or foreign firms.
Although aggregate productivity has been increasing, evidence shows that labor has been allocated
toward less-productive firms. Firm-level data, including data on commercial agricultural firms, show that
productivity has been rising across sectors and is not totally explained by the shedding of jobs (as can be
seen in the trends in total factor productivity).54 The enterprise data also suggest that firms in commercial
agriculture have been catching up in productivity with manufacturing firms (Figure 47). Moreover, there
are some sectors in services where workers have been allocated toward more-productive firms, but not so
in manufacturing and agriculture. Data show that there are productivity gains within firms and that the gains
also arise because of the net effects of labor shedding among the less-productive firms. However, the data
also indicate that labor shares are shifting upward in firms with lower-than-average productivity (the cross
term in decompositions in total factor productivity is negative), which may depress the future growth of
higher-paying jobs because productivity-increasing firms tend to pay higher wages.55

FDI inflows grew strongly between 2003 and 2008, but were severely affected by the 2008–09 global crisis
and have not yet recovered to precrisis levels. At 4.4 percent, the share of FDI in GDP in Moldova in 2014
was slightly higher than the average in the region and among lower-middle-income countries. However, its
performance in terms of FDI attraction is poor if benchmarked against other economies in the comparator
group, such as Albania, Croatia, and Georgia.
Meanwhile, a large share of the FDI stock has demonstrated few spillovers associated with export-
oriented investments. FDI in Moldova as of September 2015 was concentrated as follows: 26 percent in
the financial sector, 23 percent in the manufacturing and processing industry, 15 percent in real estate and
rental services, and 14 percent in wholesale and retail trade. However, a substantial part of the FDI stock
may not be genuine foreign investment, but rather recycled funds of local origin seeking anonymity or the
legal protection of foreign jurisdictions. For instance, a significant share of the FDI flowing into the
financial sector originated from nontransparent beneficial owners, a major source of vulnerability (see
below).

In this context, to boost employment creation and thereby support inclusive and sustainable growth,
the government needs to address the constraints that foreign and domestic firms, particularly smaller
firms, face in trying to become established, survive, and grow. These constraints systematically affect
firms and entrepreneurs across sectors. They lead to a situation in which older unproductive firms have no
incentive to exit the market, while younger firms, with the potential to create jobs and be more highly
productive, are unable to survive. Net job loss occurs across sectors and across regions (regions other than
Chișinău presented this pattern prior to the global economic crisis), indicating that the bottlenecks holding
up private sector growth are not sector specific.
Thus, constraints in access to assets and services may limit the use by firms of productive inputs (the input
gap). The environment in which firms operate may exert additional constraints related to a suboptimal
regulatory framework (the regulation gap). Even if regulations are in place, firms cannot thrive if
governance bottlenecks hold them back (the implementation gap). These potential gaps are interrelated in
many cases and can hinder job creation and productivity growth.

banking fraud in 2013–14 (see Box 3)
revealed that fraudulent loans (usually made without any economic basis, often to shell companies)
amounted to 15 percent of GDP. So, credit to GDP ratios should be adjusted in 2014 and 2015 from 39
percent to 24 percent.58
Firms in Moldova rely more heavily than firms in comparator countries on internal finance for
investment and for working capital and enjoy less access to loans. The BEEPS 2009 and 2013 surveys
show that Moldovan firms face a financing gap that is partially filled through internal funds.59 Indeed,
almost 70 percent of all investments in fixed assets are financed using internal funds. The substantial
reliance on internal funds and the high collateral requirements are associated with lower productivity. Thus,
a 1 percent increase in the collateral required is associated with a productivity decline of 0.5 percent.60
Moreover, Moldova’s financial sector primarily serves large firms, while micro, small, and medium
enterprises remain credit constrained. A World Bank (2013) study on access to finance found large


57 From 2000 to 2008, credit in Moldova expanded from 8 percent of GDP to 42 percent of GDP. Following a contraction during
the international financial crisis, credit expanded again, to 39 percent by 2015.
58 Because the fraud exposed in late 2014 had been occurring for at least a few years and likely longer, the credit to GDP ratio in

earlier years during this rapid credit expansion should also be adjusted.
59 According to the BEEPS 2009 survey, 70 percent of enterprises in Moldova reported they needed a loan, compared with 60

percent in the Europe and Central Asia region and worldwide, but only 39 percent of enterprises in Moldova had a loan or a line of
credit. Most enterprises therefore had to rely on internal financing, but the average capacity to finance investment internally was
56 percent of the funding needed, compared with 60 percent and 69 percent in the region and worldwide, respectively.

inequalities in access to credit between large and small firms. The credit market for large borrowers was
near saturation, and the credit available to smaller borrowers was much more limited anyway: 80 percent
of the credit was provided to 3 percent of borrowers, while the other 20 percent was being provided to the
remaining 97 percent of borrowers. Micro and small enterprises are generally unbanked and rely on internal
finance as well as small, short-term, high-interest loans from microfinance institutions and credit unions.
Due to the lack of functioning capital markets, banks are not moving down-market to serve micro, small,
and medium enterprises, and interest rates are high. Among these enterprises, access to finance is further
hampered by weak financial reporting standards and practices among the enterprises. Yet, these small firms
have the potential to become engines of job creation.

Electricity and water
Access to core services such as electricity and water can also impact the productivity of firms. Around
20 percent of firms reported electricity as a major constraint to operations (Figure 50), and Moldova stands
out in Eastern Europe as the country with the longest average power outage (Figure 52). Power outages are
associated with lower productivity. Similarly, the longer a firm must wait to establish a water connection
in a new facility, the greater the productivity loss. For each additional day a firm must wait to obtain water,
productivity falls by 0.11 percent.61 The quality of water and electricity services exhibits significant regional
differences (Figure 53), likely a factor behind regional disparities in productivity. The poor access to
services is related to the deterioration and inefficiency of Moldova’s municipal utilities (see section VII).

Connectivity
Since 2007, Moldova has slowly improved its transport and logistics performance. Moldova’s ranking
in the logistics performance index fell from 106 in 2007 to 94 in 2014. This limited progress was driven by
improvements in customs and infrastructure (Table 2). Furthermore, the government adopted the transport
and logistics strategy 2013–22 to make the transport and logistics sector an enabling factor in the
development of the economy and export trade. The strategy supports the ongoing process of harmonizing

the transport system and the related legislation with EU standards, legislation, and regulations (see below).62
Despite these improvements, Moldova’s performance is limited compared with peers (Figure 54).

While sufficient capacity for transport and logistics exists, at least to meet current needs, the quality
of the existing infrastructure has deteriorated and is currently lagging infrastructure among
neighbors (Figure 55). With over 10,500 kilometers of roads, 1,200 kilometers of railway tracks, an
international airport, and a large fluvial port, Moldova has an extensive infrastructure network for a country
of its size. The railway density (32 kilometers of railway lines per 1,000 square kilometers) is comparable
with the networks of Romania and Ukraine. The problem is that underinvestment in maintenance and
improvement since the end of the Soviet era in 1992 has left the railway network in poor condition (Figure
56). It is technologically underdeveloped in Moldova relative to other countries. However, actual and
projected funds for road maintenance have increased considerably and will need to increase further in
accordance with the transport and logistics strategy.63




62 The transport and logistics strategy covers issues such as trade facilitation, customs and borders, airports and aviation, ports, and
maritime and river transport. This is particularly relevant in the context of the EU Association Agreement.

located in the capital (52.2 percent).64
This skills gap is not trivial for firm growth and job creation in Moldova given that more than 30 percent
of firms report that skills have become a severe constraint to their growth, a greater constraint than in most
comparator countries in the region (Figure 57). Accordingly, recent studies report a low-skilled labor force
and the current education and training system among the key constraints to the development of private
business.65 For the country to be able to face stiffer competition including through the DCFTA with the EU,

systems that lead to this mismatch between the supply and demand in skills is explored in section VII.
Strengthening the regulatory environment: closing the regulation gap
The overall regulatory framework
Promoting job creation requires an adequate regulatory environment for private sector investment.
Easing regulatory burdens on firms and ensuring a level playing field require inspection reform and the
streamlining of licenses and permits.

Moldovan firms remains limited by
a business environment characterized by regulatory uncertainty and high transaction costs.
Moldova’s poor Doing Business rankings on dealing with construction permits (170th) and obtaining
electricity (104th), followed by paying taxes (78th) and enforcing contracts (67th), illustrate persistent
problems in the business environment that revolve around complex processes and procedures.66 Companies
have to handle multiple and overlapping requirements locally and at the national level in licensing, permits,
and authorizations. Managing over 430 permits, licenses, and authorizations costs businesses an estimated
MDL 240 million a year. At the same time, permits generate indirect costs, such as waiting times for
obtaining permits, which may reach more than 60 days per firm; 92 percent of centrally issued permits,
locally issued permits, and licenses do not comply with regulation principles prescribed by legislation.
Furthermore, onerous business inspections create additional hurdles to business operations. Around 15
separate inspections are carried out at each business each year, and a majority of firms report that the process

seems unfair. Specifically, only 19 percent of the respondents during the Doing Business surveys in 2015
thought that businesses are treated equally by inspectors.
Sectoral regulations
Regulations in key sectors of the economy can have important impacts on all firms. This is the case in
the energy and financial sectors, as well as in labor regulations.
Given the obstacle that access to finance represents for firms, financial sector regulation and
supervision can be improved. The laws and regulations that currently govern the financial sector could be
strengthened to reduce discretionary actions by various stakeholders that can jeopardize the transparency,
stability, and functioning of the sector. In particular, these laws and regulations allow each bank’s board to
fulfill the interests of the bank owners rather than acting in the best interests of the bank, its depositors,
external stakeholders, and other clients. For example, they do not adequately define related parties or
regulate disclosure requirements, and they do not adequately enumerate the basic roles and responsibilities
of bank owners, board members, and managers. Instead, they allow the role of bank boards to be determined
by each bank’s board charter rather than enumerating the responsibilities of the boards in law or in
regulation.67 Given the massive banking fraud in Moldova (Box 3), a sound regulatory framework in the
financial sector is critical. Access to finance for MSMEs should be enhanced by strengthening laws and
regulations related to secured transaction, credit information, business insolvency, and accounting standards
of firms.
In the energy sector, improvements are also needed to promote the diversification of energy providers
and create more competition in the sector to reduce costs and improve the reliability of supply.
Practically all natural gas, including the gas used for power generation, is sourced from Gazprom, the
Russian natural gas company, and 90 percent of power is purchased from Transnistria, which is not
controlled by a recognized state. The Moldovan market is too small for meaningful domestic competition.
Annual bilateral contracts are negotiated every year for energy imports, resulting in a nontransparent
monopoly.68 Physical investment in regional integration and a transparent and competitive import regime
are therefore needed. The government of Moldova has approved in principle new power and gas
interconnections with Romania.69
Labor regulations do not appear to be the main constraint on job creation. According to the 2013
BEEPS, only 3 percent of Moldovan firms identified labor regulations as a major constraint to business.
Indeed, labor regulations ranked last in the list of all constraints reported by firms. Although labor
regulations tend to be generous to employees, there are positive government plans to align the Labor Code
with EU regulations.70 There is a belief among entrepreneurs and some civil society organizations that
strong maternity leave regulations (job security for up to six years) discourage the employment of women.

68 Although there are eight licensed suppliers at nonregulated tariffs, Energocom, a state-owned enterprise (SOE), acts as the de
facto single buyer of imports from the Moldovan State Regional Electric Station (and from Ukraine until November 2014),
operating also through Energocapital, a company registered in Transnistria and outside the Moldovan legal framework.
69 Also proposed in World Bank (2015a).
70 In November 2015, around 40 amendments were introduced in the Labor Code that sought to harmonize it with other normative

acts. Some relaxed employer obligations (such as inserting conditions on the obligation for employers to offer all redundant workers
reassignment in the firm), while others benefited employees (such as establishing restrictions on fixed-term contracts). The new
government also proposed amendments to align the Labor Code with EU directives, including the national action plan on the
implementation of the Moldova-EU Association Agreement for 2014–16.
                                                                44
Trade facilitation and the framework for integration
Moldova is highly integrated into global markets. The composition of the main export basket has shifted
in the past decade. The share of machinery and fruits and vegetables increased at the expense of foodstuffs
and textiles. Moldova has also progressively decreased its traditional export dependence on the Russian
market (annex C). A steady growth in product diversification has contributed substantially to export growth.
In 2010–13, 60 percent of export growth resulted from diversification in market destination, that is, more
exports of the same products to new markets (Figure 59). The export basket also experienced a quality
upgrade between 2003 and 2013. However, the sophistication of exports has not changed substantially in
the last 10 years, and export survival rates are significantly below those of comparators.71 Annex D provides
details on Moldova’s foreign trade performance relative to comparators.72

Moldova’s performance on the Doing Business indicator for ease of trading across borders has
improved, but issues remain. Moldova ranked 33rd among 189 countries in the trading across borders
indicator in 2016.74 The government formally requires seven documents to export and six documents to
import, which is approximately the regional average. The time needed to achieve documentary compliance
for export is 48.0 hours, while the regional average is 30.7 hours. On other indicators, Moldova is a middle

burdensome controls. Border agency reforms may include greater automation of cargo processing, the
reduction of the number of paper-based documents required, the systematic use of risk management and
selectivity, more transparency in customs document requirements, and closer collaboration between
customs and other border agencies.
Improving public and private sector governance: closing the implementation gap
An adequate business environment so firms can thrive and create higher-productivity jobs requires
good governance, including the effective rule of law, good-quality institutions, secure property rights,
and a fair justice system. In Moldova, governance-related indicators have deteriorated, and firms have
suffered the consequences. This has eroded the trust of citizens. Governance is impacting private sector
development through state capture, corruption, and the politicization of regulatory institutions as well as
the judiciary, customs, tax services and the Competition Council.
The rule of law and the judicial system
Moldova’s political and economic development continues to be hampered by high-level systemic
corruption. Corruption is by far the biggest obstacle reported by firms, at 24 percent, followed by political
instability (18 percent). These two indicators have deteriorated appreciably since 2009 (Figure 60). The
sectors most vulnerable to corruption include the judiciary, customs, land oversight, public procurement,
health care, and education.76 In 2015, according to the Gallup World Poll, 88 percent of Moldovans
perceived the business sector and the government as corrupt.77 Similarly, Moldova’s score on the control
of corruption index has been consistently lower than the regional average and has deteriorated since 2012
(Figure 61). According to the Freedom House annual Nations in Transit study, Moldova’s corruption score
remained unchanged in 2013–15 at 5.75, but decreased to 6.00 in 2016, which is worse than Armenia (5.25),
Romania, and Slovakia (3.75 each).78 The 2013 Global Corruption Barometer showed that nearly 50 percent
of people stated that, to a large extent, the government is run by a few big entities acting in their own best
interests.79 A similar perception applies to the independence of the judiciary (see below).80 Since July 2016,
the Economist Intelligence Unit’s political instability risk rating for Moldova has risen from 65 to 70 (100+
high risk).81 Moldova scores at the highest level of risk for quality of bureaucracy, vested interests and

76 According to Transparency International, corruption in the land sector ranks among the highest, after the police and judiciary.

The risk of corruption is particularly high if there is a lack of defined inventory, the delimitation and management of public lands,
and overlapping or unclear institutional responsibilities. In Moldova, 90 percent of state-owned lands are not assigned to any
responsible institution or agency, which provides fertile ground for corruption and causes conflicts and insecurity for people with
land rights adjacent to or within public lands. This also causes significant income losses among state and local authorities because
of the unauthorized use of public lands and other resources and encroachment. See World Bank (2016h); CPI (Corruption

critical governance weaknesses, leading to a massive fraud in three banks and high risks in other banks (see

Moldovan firms face a corruption tax. Firms that perceive corruption as an obstacle to their operations
are 5.4 percent less productive than those that do not. Moreover, firms that reported they had relied on
informal payments or gifts to deal with customs officials or with courts are less productive than those that
did not. Specifically, firms that engaged in bribing were between 6 and 7 percent less productive than firms
of similar characteristics that did not (Figure 62). The cost of using bribes to obtain business licenses, on
the other hand, is high. Firms that allegedly relied on bribes in their applications for a business license were
50 percent less productive than counterparts.82

Low levels of trust in courts and the judicial system undermine the performance of businesses. The
World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2015–2016 ranks Moldova 134rd of 140
countries in judicial independence.83 Moreover, according to the latest perception survey on corruption and
justice reform conducted by the Legal Resources Center of Moldova in late 2015, 68 percent of prosecutors
and 81 percent of lawyers believe that corruption has remained the same or increased since 2011.84
According to the 2013 Enterprise Survey, only 31.9 percent of economic agents in Moldova consider the
courts to be reasonable, impartial, and incorrupt, compared with 38.9 percent of economic agents in Eastern
Europe.85 Business associations noted that judges seem reluctant to reach decisions in favor of businesses
in commercial cases because they are afraid of political retribution.86 Data from the same survey also appear
to show that about 70 percent of economic agents do not believe the courts will protect their property rights,
and this negatively impacts their intentions to invest. Moldova likewise lags its European comparators in
the demand for justice services, a sign that citizens and enterprises see little value in taking disputes to
court. Total cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Moldova are about half the EU average.87
Strengthening the rule of law is essential for private sector development. This entails the
implementation and enforcement of regulations and increasing the independence of regulatory and judicial

Justice Sector Reform Strategy 2011–16 for sectoral modernization.89 However, implementation appears to
have been hamstrung by low technical capacity, inadequate funding, and a critical lack of sustained, high-
level commitment to action.
Box 3. A banking fraud cost 12 percent of GDP and revealed huge governance challenges

Weak governance in Moldova’s financial system has severely distorted financial resource allocation, led to
severe fraud, and constrained the provision of financial services to businesses and households. Specifically, a
financial pyramid scheme carried out by Banca de Economii, Banca Sociala, and Unibank in 2013–14 culminated in
losses that may cost the government budget the equivalent of about 12 percent of GDP. All three banks are believed
to have been controlled by a Moldovan business tycoon and his associates, with senior political patronage. The origins
of the crisis were in the flawed recapitalization of Banca de Economii in August 2013, when control of the bank
effectively passed to private agents. However, this control was nontransparent as the ultimate beneficial owners were
not disclosed. In late 2013, this group also gained control of Unibank and Banca Sociala to tap their deposits for further
lending. These takeovers were also not transparent, and the ultimate beneficial owners were not disclosed. Because
the ultimate beneficial owners were not identified, loans to them – which mostly were not repaid –were difficult to
identify and monitor.
The alleged fraud in these three banks merely exemplifies profound weaknesses in governance in the financial
sector. Changes in the control of banks have escaped the fit and proper vetting of the National Bank of Moldova
(NBM), thereby allowing undisclosed parties to operate in the country’s financial sector with unclear and dubious
intentions. The controlling ownership of financial institutions have been changed without proper supervision, and this
has involved nontransparent appointments of board members and chief executive officers. This has led to substantial
blurring of the roles and responsibilities of ownership, oversight (board), and management, resulting in no clear
accountability. The Joint Stock Company Law and the Law on Financial Institutions do not adequately define related
parties or regulate disclosure requirements and do not adequately enumerate the basic roles and responsibilities of
bank owners, board members, and managers. The boards have a particular duty to act in the best interests of all
stakeholders (including depositors and the public) and to act responsibly and with integrity; in practice, however, they
appear to operate primarily and often solely in the interests of owners. While banks are required to adopt a recognized
corporate governance code, few banks appear to pay close attention to or disclose their compliance with this code, and
NBM does not supervise and enforce compliance; moreover, the guidance on the code falls short of good practice.
There is insufficient attention paid to the control environment as evidenced by the underdevelopment of critical risk
control and internal audit functions.
The illicit raider attacks (that is, the capture of shares) used to gain control of the majority of the banking
sector’s assets illustrate other crucial weaknesses. These have been perpetrated by unidentified individuals whose
subsequent de facto, related-party transactions have caused the deterioration of bank balance sheets. Raider attacks
have involved the judicial system, bailiffs, and share registries. As a result, prior to the closure of the three defrauded
banks, close to 80 percent of the Moldovan banking sector and 70 percent of the nonbank financial sector had come
under the control of two or three undisclosed individuals.
Raider attacks have additional adverse implications for the economy. First, the financial sector has been unable
to grow in a sustainable manner. Second, weak property rights, the lack of a transparent and predictable judicial

system, and the climate of impunity reduce domestic and foreign investment. Therefore, these attacks and the
subsequent fraud have harmed growth and employment.
The enforcement capacity of the two financial sector regulators and supervisors—the NBM (banking
supervision) and the National Commission for Financial Markets (NCFM, nonbank supervision) —has been
limited by a series of court challenges and deficiencies in the law. Constitutional Court decisions in 2012 and 2013
significantly curtailed the powers of the NCFM and NBM, respectively (these powers were largely restored for NBM
in mid-2014, but not yet for NCFM). In addition, NBM and NCFM board members and staff have lacked sufficient
protection against personal lawsuits, while carrying out their duties in good faith. NBM and NCFM regulatory
initiatives also often got backlogged in the Ministry of Justice, which has the power to require changes before these
may go into effect, thus compromising NBM’s powers and independence.
Despite these shortcomings in law and governance practices, NBM and NCFM could do more. Poor risk
management in banks is partly caused by insufficient regulatory standards, which NBM could improve. Moreover,
the Law on Financial Institutions provides the NBM with a wide range of instruments to address problems in banks
or violations of regulatory obligations, particularly in the case of persistent deficiencies in the same institutions.
Recommendations by NBM supervisory staff in the recent past were often tied up by the board, which failed to act on
them. As a result, efforts by the NBM to address changes in control, require disclosure of ultimate beneficial owners,
and take other actions were blocked to the detriment of the safety of the banking system. NCFM, the regulator-
supervisor in charge of providing licenses to the 11 independent registries, does not perform fit and proper reviews
upon changes in registry ownership, nor does it rigorously vet board members and chief executive officers. NCFM’s
supervision of the insurance sector, which has also suffered from raider attacks and other malfeasance, has also been
restricted, resulting in the possible expulsion of Moldova from Europe’s Green Card system of insurance.
Following the public disclosure of the alleged fraud in Banca de Economii, Unibank, and Banca Sociala in late
2014, the government, NBM, and NCFM began to take the first steps to address the governance problems
throughout the financial sector. In 2015, NBM imposed special supervision in the next three largest banks and
ordered them to undergo special diagnostic audits to identify potential risks. NBM subsequently suspended and
ordered the sale of 44 percent of the shares of Moldova Agroindbank after finding that the shareholders were acting
in concert. NBM has prepared a draft strategy to address the other issues raised by these audits. In 2016, Parliament
passed legal amendments to (a) give legal protection to NBM and NCFM staff carrying out their duties in good faith,
(b) eliminate the Ministry of Justice’s authority to review and delay registration of NBM and NCFM regulations, and
(c) create a single securities registry in NBM in which the shares of financial institutions would be registered. The
authorities will need to continue the momentum of reform to (a) strengthen the bank resolution regime, (b) strengthen
the independence and the regulatory and supervisory powers of supervisors, (c) adopt and implement a strengthened
corporate governance framework in the financial sector, (d) establish the new securities depository in NBM and ensure
the transfer of registrations and data from the 11 private registries, and (e) ensure the accountability of those
institutions responsible to control fraud and other malfeasance in the financial sector.


Governance and Competition
Poor governance is also reflected in weak competitive conditions and competition policies, which are
perceived to contribute to high risk among firms. Competition perception indicators of the World
Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2015–2016 indicate that, among 140 countries,
Moldova ranks 103rd on the intensity of local competition, 124th on the extent of market dominance, and
135th on the effectiveness of antimonopoly policy (in each case, a low rank indicates poor performance).90
Accordingly, investors in Moldova perceive that they face one of the greatest business risks because of the

weak competitive environment with respect to neighboring countries, particularly: (a) vested interests and
discrimination against foreign firms that may hinder innovation and preclude more efficient firms from
gaining market share and (b) price controls and the control of other market variables that limit the benefits
that firms may obtain by competing effectively (Figure 63).
Moldova’s key sectors are controlled by a limited number of firms. Among the markets for
manufactured goods, 15 percent are dominated by monopolies, compared with an average of 4 percent in
other countries in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region, and 20 percent of Moldovan markets for
manufactured goods have a duopolistic or monopolistic structure.91 This is consistent with the concentration
of employment in larger firms and the increase in the dominance of large and older firms in employment
over time. Furthermore, some prices are still regulated, especially prices for socially important domestic
products, including food and nonfood products, while the margins on some of these products produced
domestically cannot exceed 20 percent.92

there has been substantial progress with respect to the time to comply with tax requirements (Figure 64).94
This declining trend in compliance transaction costs has been brought about through the introduction of the
e-declaration system, online payment for some taxes, and the reduction in the number of declarations.
However, improvements in services are hampered by perceptions of corruption and weakness in the tax
administration. According to the BEEPS, about 14 percent of companies had to pay bribes in their
interaction with tax administrators. Small businesses were disproportionally affected. At the same time,
weaknesses in tax administration, including inadequate attention to large taxpayers, a focus on minor
compliance matters, a lack of integrity of taxpayer registration, and underdeveloped risk management
throughout the tax process, promote the informal economy. This leads to unfair competition. In the 2013
BEEPS survey, 32.3 percent of companies reported they had to compete against unregistered or informal
firms.

For foreign firms, the low level of investment protection is an important discouragement. Moldova
has signed bilateral investment agreements with Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Turkey, and
the United States, and the country’s legal framework for FDI entry and establishment is close to best
practice. However, the implementation of investor protections is uneven. Coupled with weak governance
in the judicial system, such issues can escalate to costly international investor –state disputes. Since 1999,
Moldova has had to respond to at least nine cases of international arbitration.95 Moreover, investment
promotion remains underdeveloped. The Moldova Investment and Export Promotion Organization is the
national entity responsible for promoting FDI and exports. It has been in operation since 1999, but was only
assigned the investment promotion mandate in 2014. A World Bank survey among foreign investors

suggests that investors often lack awareness about available investment incentives, or find the
administration of incentives complex.96
The business environment in which firms operate is also hampered by the preferential treatment of
state-owned enterprises (SOEs). SOEs continue to play an important role in the economy. They
represented about 10 percent of the assets in the corporate sector and 19 percent of GDP in 2012 and have
a strong presence in real estate and business services, transport, communications, and other sectors where
the private sector could play a more substantial role.97 Because the regulatory framework is not aligned
with OECD best practice guidelines and because compliance with the existing regional regulatory
requirements is low, SOEs do not operate efficiently or in a transparent or accountable manner. SOEs that
are monopolies can manipulate the market and regulatory powers to restrict healthy competition. In some
cases, SOEs compete in markets, but also perform a regulatory role in the same markets, generating clear
conflicts of interest.98 Reports have shown that SOEs that have received a large number and amount of
government contracts provide substantial contributions to political parties.99 Conventional regulations do
not always effectively address SOE management problems, information asymmetries, and lack of
transparency that are significant contributors to poor SOE performance. Moreover, through their control of
government institutions, oligarch-owned businesses and oligarch-controlled SOEs have access to loans and
subsidies and participate in public tenders that are tilted in their favor.
The implementation of competition and state aid control policies can be strengthened, particularly
to combat anticompetitive conduct, tackle anticompetitive regulations in key sectors (for example, in
transport, energy, and retail distribution), and minimize the competition distortions associated with
unlawful state aid. This would contribute to promoting more productive resource allocations and job
creation through efficiencies associated with less market distortion and through state aid that is properly
managed to support regional development, the development of small and medium enterprises, and research
and development. The government adopted new competition and state aid laws in 2012 in line with EU
rules. The Competition Council was set up as an independent agency reporting to Parliament and started to
operate effectively in 2014. Greater emphasis should be placed on eliminating and preventing the most
harmful anticompetitive practices (such as hardcore cartels), pursuing sustained competition advocacy
activities through the active role of the Competition Council in the design of procompetitive regulations
and stronger collaboration of the Council with sectoral regulators, promoting a competition culture among
businesses and civil society, enhancing state aid review to minimize firm-specific aid and its distortive
effects and promote better public spending, and strengthening the Council’s standing relative to the
judiciary and its capacity (financial and human resources) to implement properly its mandate on
competition and state aid control.

98 Two specific examples currently being assessed include the SOE that provides personal security services and acts in competition

with private sector providers, while also regulating the security services industry. There are also SOEs that provide training in
accreditation for certain business licenses in competition with other providers in the private sector and that also act as a regulator
on the conditions and eligibility for such licenses.
99 Research has shown that, during the 2015 election campaign, the Democratic Party received donations from over 50 companies

that benefited from public contracts, including RED Nord joint stock company, the main electricity distributor in the north of
Moldova that was awarded a large contract valued at over MDL 1 million in 2013. Staff of another joint stock company,
Moldtelecom, donated over MDL 700,000 to the Democratic Party after benefiting from contracts worth MDL 35.8 million in
2011–15. See Colun (2015). Similar links are found with donations to other political parties, including the Liberal Democratic
Party and the European People’s Party of Moldova.

Macroeconomic management
Moldova has recently improved macroeconomic management, but faces risks that could derail
macroeconomic stability. The risks relate to weaknesses in financial sector governance and attempts to
undermine the independence of NBM. NBM has shifted to an inflation targeting framework and allowed a
flexible exchange rate to absorb external shocks. As a result, the level and volatility of inflation have
markedly decreased (Figure 65). The government has been implementing low fiscal deficits, and kept the
public debt at low levels. However, banking sector fraud significantly complicated monetary policy making
in 2014–15 and led to additional public debt that will constrain the fiscal space for the medium term because
of higher debt servicing. Furthermore, the sharp tightening of monetary policy in 2015 to mitigate the
inflationary impact of the banking fraud led to political pressure on NBM leadership, culminating in the
resignation of the NBM governor in September 2015. Given that the poor financial sector governance, the
root cause of the previous banking crisis, has not been fully addressed, the risk that it will derail
macroeconomic management is elevated.
The fiscal pressures that Moldova Figure 65. Consumer inflation, Moldova, % year-on-year

government has been protecting the
public sector wage bill and social protection spending. However, this may not be a sustainable solution.
International benchmarking of Moldova’s revenues and expenditures to peer countries and country groups
suggests that, through the budget, the government spends and collects more than countries at similar levels
of income per capita or other countries in the region. General government revenues were 5 percentage
points higher than the regional average during 2000–14 and 7 percentage points higher than countries at a
similar income level, that is, the lower-middle-income group (Figure 66). Moldova’s dependence on
external grants has been gradually increasing, reaching 3.7 percent of GDP in 2014. While some large
countries in the region, such as Poland and Turkey, have a higher share of fiscal collections relative to
Moldova, countries of similar size (Albania, Georgia, and Lithuania) and Romania show a lower fiscal
load.100
Moldova could restructure the public budget, while supporting growth, fiscal sustainability, and the
living standards of the poor and vulnerable. At 37.8 percent of GDP on average over 2000–14,
Moldova’s general government expenditures were 3.7 percentage points higher than the regional average

and 8.5 percentage points higher than the average in lower-middle-income countries. Overall, lower-
middle-income countries with higher per capita GDP than Moldova tend to spend less than Moldova as a
share of GDP. Moldova’s recurrent expenditures exceed regional and income-group peers, limiting the
room for much-needed public investment. Expenditures on social security, the wage bill, and purchases of
goods and services were, on average, higher than in the region and in lower-middle-income countries
(Figure 67). Subsidies and other transfers comprise more than half of expenditures and are among the
highest such expenditures in the region. Meanwhile, substantial spending on education and health care does
not translate directly into quality of service (see below).

This section describes the potential constraints along Pathway 1; it indicates that the private sector
faces major challenges in generating jobs. Access to inputs, including finance and services, is unequal
across firms of different sizes and in different locations. Some of these access limitations are linked to the
regulatory framework. However, the diagnostic clearly shows that the business environment is hampered
by a high level of corruption, a weak judiciary, and weak competition policies.
Addressing the constraints is essential to boosting employment in agriculture and the nonagricultural
sector. Increasing labor demand across sectors is crucial. Given the high concentration of the poor and the
bottom 40 in agriculture and in rural areas, improving the quality of jobs and productivity in the sector is
important. However, the agricultural sector has a strong dualistic structure. Among the relatively small
share of farms that are commercial or have commercial potential, the focus should be on removing sector-
specific and more general constraints so these farms can expand and modernize (Box 4).101 However, most

people in rural areas have little capacity to commercialize, and, among people in urban areas, the creation
of nonagricultural jobs is the way forward.
Box 4. Assets and services for the agricultural sector

The fragmentation of landholdings, the limited access to finance and to export markets, and other constraints
undermine the growth potential of agriculture. The agricultural sector is burdened with high informality and low
productivity because of the following:
Fragmentation of landholdings and the ensuing lack of scale: Agriculture has a dual farm structure. The 2011 general
agricultural census revealed that more than half the farms cultivate less than 0.5 hectares, and about 95 percent have
an area less than 3.0 hectares and occupy only 26.8 percent of the total agricultural land. Smallholders have limited
opportunities to commercialize and increase the size of their farms; so, many end up leasing their land (around 30
percent) or leaving a considerable share of their land fallow (up to 20 percent). a (Semi)subsistence farms accounted
for 74 percent of all farm households and 71 percent of total agricultural output in 2013. b Generally, small farms show
higher land productivity because of the more intense use of labor and the higher-value products (vegetables, wine, and
livestock). The large commercial farms own most of the land, machinery, and resources, but offer mostly seasonal
low-paid labor, which cannot provide a significant income source to rural families.
Lack of access to finance: The lack of finance is mainly caused by (a) insufficient collateral, (b) almost no available
long-term loans, (c) the scarcity of support instruments to facilitate access to credit, and (d) high interest rates.c Low
nonfarm income also means smallholders do not have sufficient savings to reinvest.d They usually borrow money
from large local commercial farms at the beginning of the agricultural season to finance the purchase of seeds or the
provision of machinery services.
Limited penetration of export markets: Moldovan agricultural products are in the low-price segment on international
markets because of deficiencies in terms of quality and food safety standards. Within the sector, only large commercial
farms are able to serve export markets because they specialize in the production of commodities, given their
advantages in terms of low production costs, the availability of machinery, and cheap postharvest processes. Small
farms, meanwhile, are less well integrated in the market because they produce mainly for own consumption and show
a limited surplus of high–value added crops sold in local markets.d
The outdated education system: The agricultural education system is weak at every level. The agricultural professions
prepared for in vocational education and training schools are the same ones taught to kolkhoz (collective) workers
more than 20 years ago: tractor driver, shovel operator, grape grower, beekeeper, and so on. Because most of the
agricultural population consists of family farmers, the level of specialization of vocational education and training
institutions is too narrow.
Deteriorating extension services: The national extension services established in early 2000 with strong donor support
are struggling to survive with inadequate resources. The network has been covering about 40 percent of the country
with a focus on small subsistence farms. However, insufficient public funding since donor support dried up in 2013
has led to weakening capacities, inadequate skills, and declining coverage.
Business regulation in agribusiness: Business regulation constrains sector growth and investment. Restrictive and
cumbersome regulations in input markets negatively affect the access of agricultural producers to new technology and
impose additional costs on private agricultural input dealers. This results in higher prices for inputs paid by farmers.
(Private sector sources indicate that the prices of fertilizers and pesticides in Moldova are at least 15 percent higher
than the market reference prices in neighboring countries.) The 2013 Enterprise Survey revealed that 17 food safety
authorizations have imposed costs on the private sector amounting to about $6 million, while the cost to the National
Food Safety Agency to issue the relevant documents amounted to $1.5 million.e Improvements in the current food
safety management system, including legislative harmonization as well as regulatory streamlining, are paramount to
supporting Moldova’s agenda to achieve EU market access.

rental conditions and, in addition, prevent medium-sized farms from competing and expanding.
b. Volk et al. (2015).
c. An important condition for gaining access to a mortgage is the possession of property that has been properly registered in an
authorized, secure system. In Moldova, there are still almost 600,000 pieces of property that are not registered, mainly in rural
areas, and the owners and potential investors therefore do not have access to a mortgage. This limits the development of a land
market and the emergence of larger and more productive farms. See also Moroz et al. (2015).

VII. Building up and protecting the stock of assets of the population




Preparing people for the labor market
Building up the stock of human capital—education, skills, and health—is critical to improving
people’s capacity to work and generate income. The diagnostic of the labor market shows that job
opportunities are becoming less inclusive. Wage growth is limited to services, and urban dwellers with
higher educational attainment are more likely to find (formal) jobs. Education is thus a key determinant of
the access and returns to jobs. Ensuring that individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status or other
characteristics, can develop and use their human capital intensively, particularly in labor markets, requires
that they be enabled to access relevant, good-quality education and training opportunities and that the
barriers and disincentives they face in engaging in gainful employment be removed.
Education and skills
Skills development through education is a first step in increasing the opportunities for individuals to
find more and better (more highly productive) jobs. The stock of human capital has expanded. A higher
share of men and women are attaining secondary education, and the population is gradually becoming more
well educated. The gender gap in educational attainment is small in secondary education and below, and it
is widening in favor of women in higher education. There are significant returns to education in terms of
finding formal wage jobs and achieving higher earnings. Figure 68 shows that the education level is
positively correlated with labor market participation and also positively correlated with the formality of
jobs. Among youth, educational attainment appears to have a considerable impact on the formality of
employment even compared with other countries in the region.102 Moreover, individuals with higher
educational attainment are less likely to work in agriculture and more likely to work as self-employed or


102The difference in formal employment rates among youth (ages 15–29 years) between youth with tertiary educational attainment
and youth with primary educational attainment was about 90 percent in 2013, which is the largest gap observed among countries
with a legacy of central planning that are covered in the relevant survey. See Elder et al. (2015).

family workers. Important urban and rural differences exist: the share of the adult population with
postsecondary education in urban areas is higher, and their returns to higher education are higher as well
(Figure 69) relative to rural areas.103
However, throughout the life cycle of individuals, the education and training system is not sufficiently
geared to the skills demanded on the labor market. Issues of access, quality, equity, and relevance
permeate the system. Early in the life cycle, even if there is demand for early childhood education (for
children ages 0–3 years) and given how critical these years are for building up human capital, there is no
legal framework or financing for the public provision of early childhood education for this age-group.104
The lack of access to affordable good-quality childcare can also impact the access of mothers to jobs. For
preschool-age children (3–6 years), discrepancies in access exist between rural and urban populations (71
percent and 82 percent gross enrolment for rural and urban children, respectively).105

Despite the 21 percent of public spending going to education, serious gaps in the supply and quality
of basic education remain, including an urban-rural divide. Moldova is in the 90th percentile worldwide

by James Heckman, The Heckman Equation (database), Center for the Economics of Human Development, University of Chicago,
Chicago, http://heckmanequation.org/.) In Moldova, the importance of early childhood education was recognized in the Education
for All National Strategy, which aims to support children from disadvantaged environments who have few opportunities for early
literacy and language development as well as the increasing number of children whose parents are absent because of migration.

reading, mathematics, and science in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is among
the lowest in the region and more than two years behind OECD peers (Figure 70), including relative to
former centrally planned economies that have similar education systems. Overall, 57 percent of 15-year-
olds in Moldova lack the basic levels of proficiency in reading literacy (61 percent in mathematics and 47
percent in science) needed to participate effectively and productively in society.107 The gaps with peers
appear to be caused to a great extent by weak and outdated teaching and learning practices. PISA measures
applied knowledge, while Moldova focuses on theoretical knowledge.108 The 2015 national student
assessment of 4th and 9th graders shows that the differences in performance between urban and rural
students are mostly explained by the socioeconomic level of the students, particularly in 4th grade.109 In
addition, the education system has not fully accommodated ethnic language diversity, thus limiting the
accumulation of human capital among some language groups in Moldova.110

110 In regions where non-Moldovan groups are more prominent, there are not enough qualified Romanian-speaking teachers or

teachers willing to help improve the quality of learning of the national language. In 2011, 10 percent of high school graduates in
Gagaúzia failed to pass (that is, failed to achieve even the minimum passing score) their Romanian language exams and were in
jeopardy of not graduating. Similarly, one Roma in five is unable to read or write, and about a third of Roma complete only primary
education. These gaps in education can translate into disparities in human capital, which undermine the capacity to obtain quality
employment (Cace et al. 2007).

education and training system displays substantial deficiencies. It suffers from a weak strategic framework,
poor service delivery mechanism, and, especially, an underdeveloped and ineffective oversight
mechanism.112 These characteristics are not conducive to equipping the students with the skills they need
to enter and prosper in the labor market. Among the adult workforce, adult learning is underdeveloped, thus
depriving the adult population of opportunities for skill upgrading, particularly important in a rapidly
changing labor market.
In sum, the current education system is not considered successful in equipping students with the skills
necessary to thrive in today’s labor market. General education should prepare students more carefully
in applying knowledge and acquiring basic cognitive skills, and technical and vocational education and
training should equip students with more relevant job-specific technical skills. While no data on the matter
are available on Moldova, there is reason to assume that similar systemic weaknesses also hamper higher
education. In line with the responses of firms on the issue, graduates of secondary vocational education
report significant mismatches between their education and the jobs open to them. Indeed, there appears to
be an increasing oversupply of workers with higher education, from 11,700 workers in 2000 to about 51,000
workers in 2015. The number started rising appreciably in 2008.113 There is also evidence of a widening
education-job mismatch among workers with higher education: many are employed in areas unrelated to
their fields of study. The mismatch suggests that the system of colleges inherited from the Soviet Union is
not effective in meeting modern market needs and requires reform.
Overall, policies to improve the alignment of the supply of skills with labor demand are being
adjusted, but additional efforts are needed to enhance the relevance, quality, and equity of education
and training. For example, the government has taken steps to upgrade resource allocation by adopting per
capita financing and an enabling legislative framework for general education; a reform program for
technical and vocational education and training is in place and is being implemented (albeit slowly); and
the ministries of education and of labor, social protection, and the family are holding discussions on
establishing a quality control mechanism in continuing vocational education and training. Sustaining and
advancing these reforms are fundamental to favoring equitable, sustainable gains in welfare.114 Countries
characterized by a wide range of economic conditions and social settings have demonstrated the ability to
raise the quality of educational outcomes substantially and equitably despite large social disparities and
limited economic resources.115 Moldova can do the same.
Health care
Health is essential if individuals wish to participate in economic life and achieve higher
productivity.116 At 5.3 percent of GDP, the public expenditures on health care are relatively high compared
with other countries in the region.

Nonetheless, Moldova faces a substantial disease burden. There has been significant progress in the
under-5 mortality rate, now at 16 deaths per 1,000 live births, half the 1990 value. However, the country is
the worst performer in terms of longevity in the Europe and Central Asia region: life expectancy at birth is
lower there than in any comparator country (Figure 71), despite the high public expenditure. Life
expectancy and healthy life expectancy are low (71.3 and 62.0 years, respectively) compared with other
countries.117 Life expectancy at age 60 was low, at 16.4 years, in 2015. The indicator revealed an important
gender gap, standing at 14.3 years among men and 18.2 years among women in 2015. Beyond being an end
in itself, low life and health life expectancies limits households’ economic opportunities, particularly in the
labor market, and shrinks the human capital of the country with implications to its growth prospects.

the rate of registered patients doubled
between 2000 and 2014.119 In Moldova, health outcomes are poor across the board. The number of people
with various degrees of disability and chronic disease is equally distributed between, for example, the
bottom 40 and the top 60. Even self-rated health status is not necessarily worse among the bottom 40 and
the poor relative to the top 60 and the nonpoor.120
Among the poorest households, financial protection against health shocks is low, and health service
utilization is low. First, although more than 85 percent of the population is currently covered by health
insurance, financial protection from health expenditure shock is limited, as evidenced by the high share of
out-of-pocket payments in total household health expenditure. Almost half of all spending on health care
comes out of the pockets of patients. Even relatively low health-related out-of-pocket payments can push

poor households farther into poverty. Recent evidence shows that medical expenditures pushed otherwise
nonpoor people into poverty or deeper into poverty.121 High out-of-pocket payments could reflect a number
of factors, including high drug prices and lack of awareness among patients about their insurance
coverage.122 Service utilization is also low among the poorest households. According to the health
utilization and expenditure survey 2013, the bottom 20 were two times less likely to report they had used
inpatient services in the previous 12 months. Thus, these households were not protected, but rather were
forgoing essential medical services, limiting their human capital accumulation and human capital stock.

young people (ages 15–24) are more likely than

employment.125 It is possible that low wages in

youth act as obstacles to the search for work by
graduates.126 However, this situation largely reflects the low labor demand and labor-related emigration and
can be attributed, at least partly, to skill mismatches.
Better education and health care are not sufficient to ensure that people are able to work: the
working-age population faces multiple barriers that contribute to high inactivity and labor
migration. Limited access to information can affect labor market opportunities, particularly among
youth.127 Incomplete information about educational pathways, occupational options, and labor market
trends can lead to suboptimal occupational decisions by youth, especially the disadvantaged. Current career
guidance practices do not provide students with adequate and systematic information for making their
schooling and occupational decisions. The 2014/15 Moldova Jobs and Schooling Decisions Survey
revealed the presence of self-reported and objective gaps in the information about the labor market available

122 Spending on pharmaceuticals accounts for nearly three-quarters of out-of-pocket expenditures, according to the 2007–13
household budget surveys. Reimbursement rates for medicines are comparatively low in Moldova. Moreover, pharmaceutical
regulations are at odds with international trends because substitutions with generic medicines are prohibited. Thus, even if medicine
reimbursement rates were to increase, affordability might still be an issue. The World Bank (2015b) suggests that patients may not
be aware of what health insurance coverage entails, specifically which services they should receive free of charge, and that this
may be contributing to the anecdotally high frequency of informal payments that patients make to receive even essential services.

to 9th and 12th grade students, as well as the lack of preparedness among parents and teachers to provide
relevant advice on educational and occupational decisions. Students with less well educated parents
demonstrate the highest information deficits, which can exacerbate inequality of opportunity. Making
existing educational and labor market information more accessible and improving career guidance tools for
men and women, especially those that provide students with real exposure to the labor market, can help
address the observed information gaps and improve efficiency as well as equity in education and in the
labor market at a relatively low cost. This may also contribute to reducing the gender segregation in sectors
of employment.

production.129 Even though the gender gap in
labor force participation is small, it is increasing with income, which suggests that women in richer
households may be disincentivized to work, especially if the jobs available to them are often at lower wages.
If formal care facilities are not in place, the burden of care on women, particularly for the elderly, could
worsen in the context of an aging population. In Moldova, migration may act as an additional disincentive
to work, either through income compensation or imposing care duties. Women of working age (15–64) in
remittance and nonremittance households have similar educational profiles, but the former group is 13
percentage points less likely to be active. Working-age grandparents, likely mostly women, also bear some
of the responsibility for caring for the children of migrants.130
Strengthened intermediation and employment services could improve the access to jobs among
vulnerable groups, those facing employment barriers, and youth. The legislation on unemployment
support benefits and services, active labor market policies, and social benefit programs all need to be
reviewed and aligned to ensure that they encourage job creation and improved labor market participation

of registered job-seekers, the unemployed, and the inactive population. The financing and scope of
employment services should be aligned to the needs of the population, particularly, the needs of inactive
educated women, highly skilled youth, and people with fewer skills living in rural areas (Figure 68 and
Figure 72). While services are limited because of budget constraints, there is no evidence that they have a
positive impact on the employment status or earnings of registered job-seekers. Significant improvements
are also needed to enhance the capacity of employment services to monitor and analyze labor market trends
and the impact of active labor market measures and to disseminate information to end users (employers,
the unemployed, educational institutions, and others). This will help reduce information gaps on labor
supply and demand and skills mismatches and enhance the effectiveness of intermediation (counseling and
employer outreach). The Ministry of Labor and the National Employment Agency have proposed
amendments to the existing legislation on support for unemployed persons along these lines and are
receiving technical support from various partners to refocus and improve their services. Over the long term,
adequate financing to support these policies will be crucial.
Experts in the social protection system should review and address potential work disincentives
associated with system programs. A 2014 World Bank study identified significant disincentives for
formal work among low-wage earners receiving social assistance through Ajutor Social.131 The government
has therefore introduced employment-related requirements for continued eligibility. However, the pension
system still includes significant disincentives for (formal) work among older workers, which is particularly
detrimental in an aging society in which active labor participation among the elderly is imperative.
Currently, labor force participation rates drop significantly among people ages 55 and above. Among
inactive men and women in 2014 (ages 15–65), 39 percent and 47 percent are pensioners, respectively. The
inactivity rate increases sharply from age 57 onward. More than 60 percent of people ages 60 and above
are inactive, and the share is growing. The low retirement age may partly explain the high inactivity among
the elderly, while inadequate valorization of past earnings in the pension formula may increase the
incentives to informality.132 For example, retirement ages are 62 for men and 57 for women in Moldova,
while they are 65 and 60, respectively, in Albania, Georgia, and Romania; the labor force participation rate
among people ages 50+ is 41 percent in Albania, 64 percent in Georgia, and 38 percent in Romania,
compared with 33 percent in Moldova.133

of the economically active people in Moldova), the
high rates of ownership of land and housing, particularly in rural areas in which ownership is nearly
universal, may be limiting longer-term urbanization.135 As part of land reform after the transition, as in
other former Soviet republics, land was transferred from the state to private ownership, followed by the
allocation of individual titles, and finally, registration of those private, individual rights. Privatization
occurred quickly and was completed by 2004, but the registration process was performed later.136 As a
result, almost every rural household owns a dwelling and some land. Yet, more than a half million properties
and more than 200,000 land parcels have not been registered, and, without registration, the transaction risks
associated with selling or mortgaging these assets are high and potentially costly to owners.137 Nonetheless,
while property registration reduces the transaction costs, the larger hurdle for internal mobility is more
likely associated with significant differences in the market value of rural and urban properties. That the
majority of the population and poor households are concentrated in rural areas, where the ownership of
housing and land are nearly universal (Figure 74), raises the concern that poorer households may become
trapped in rural areas because their assets, mainly homes and land, are associated with a market value that
is less than the equity value to the homeowners, while an equivalent home in an urban location would not
be affordable. Beyond the constraint to mobility, inadequate registry can undermine owner rights and the
ability of owners to capitalize on the value of their assets (for example, using land as collateral for access
to finance).138

137 There are an estimated 5.5 million properties in Moldova. During the First Cadastre Project (1998 –2007), about 85 percent of

all properties, or 4.7 million real properties, were registered, including 4.2 million through the systematic process, and 0.5 million
through the sporadic procedure. Today, there are an estimated 580,600 unregistered properties (including housing plots and garden
plots) in some 290 localities throughout the country. The majority of urban properties were registered during the systematic process,
and any new subdivisions have likely been registered sporadically in urban areas (World Bank 2016f).
138 Cadastral and property registers have been recognized by international organizations, namely, the Food and Agriculture

Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, and the World Bank, as important for
sustainable social, economic, and environmental development. The importance of property rights registration, valuation, and
taxation are highlighted within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals related to (a) property rights as part of poverty
reduction under goals 1 (target 4), 2 (3), and 5 (7) and (b) improving the domestic capacity for tax collection under goal 17 (1). See

The increasing equity, quality and coverage of services
As described in World Development Report 2004: Making Services Work for Poor People, beyond
health care and education services, infrastructure services such as water, sanitation, and energy
directly contribute to improving human capital and thus to poverty reduction.139 This section explores
gaps in service delivery, as well as the potential underlying obstacles for more equitable, higher-quality and
higher-coverage services. These obstacles may hamper access to services for households and firms. As
discussed in this section, several of these challenges are also related to governance issues.
Infrastructure services
Gaps exist in Moldova in the coverage and equity of the infrastructure for basic services, particularly
in rural areas where the less well off are concentrated. The previous section described outcomes in
education and health care that reflect poor health and education services. Focusing on infrastructure
services, Moldova is the only country in Europe which missed both the water supply and the sanitation
Millennium Development Goals of reducing the proportion of people without access to such services by
half between 1990 and 2015.140 The rate of access to an improved water source rose only marginally, from
84 percent in the early 1990s to 88 percent in the latest estimate.141 An estimated 55 percent of the
population have access to piped water on their premises.142 Drinking water quality at tap remains an issue,
resulting in illness, and poses a special challenge in rural areas where most households rely on groundwater
wells in which the water is not suitable for drinking.143 Similarly, the rate of access to sanitation has risen
from 72 percent to 76 percent in the last 25 years.144 Both measures compare unfavorably with neighboring
countries and represent a formidable challenge to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.145
The poor and the bottom 40 in Moldova have less access to public network services such as water,
sanitation, and heating (Figure 75), and limited evidence on ethnic minorities also reveals poorer
access.146 This may be partly because poorer households are concentrated in rural areas (Figure 76).
Accordingly, access to public network services is highest in the capital region, Chișinău. While 95 percent
of the population is connected to piped water in urban areas, the corresponding share is only 54 percent in
rural areas, of which only 39 percent have the service within the dwelling. In sanitation, access to collective,

140 UNICEF and WHO (2015). Although the information is based on the country’s own report, the country did meet the Millennium

Development Goal on water.
141 An improved drinking water source is one that, by the nature of its construction and proper use, adequately protects the source

from outside contamination, particularly fecal matter.
142 JMP (2015).
143 Among water samples, 10 percent to 14 percent fail to comply with microbiological requirements. An estimated 22 percent to

25 percent of diarrheal diseases, 15 percent to 20 percent of viral hepatitis A, and 100 percent of fluorosis are caused by poor
drinking water quality (Mediu 2014). This situation is aggravated by the lack of adequate laboratories to test tap water quality
regularly. See also National Center of Public Health (2013).
144 UNICEF and WHO (2015).
145 The Sustainable Development Goals not only set the bar much higher in terms of level of services, namely, safely managed

drinking water that is accessible on the premises, reliable in quantity and quality, and affordable, but also in the target to achieve
universal access by 2030. Similarly, the goals advocate for universal access to safely managed sanitation and to reducing by half
the proportion of wastewater that remains untreated.
146 According to Cace et al. (2007), housing deprivation is much more widespread among Roma than among the rest of the

population. One-third of Roma households live in an insecure dwelling, and more than 80 percent do not benefit from basic housing
conditions such as potable water supply and sanitation facilities.


                                                                 66
sewerage-based systems is rare in rural areas. Less than 20 percent of villages have some type of sewerage
system in place. Only 10 percent of people in rural areas have private flush toilets within their dwellings.147
In sum, the low urbanization level in Moldova, with an urbanization profile more similar to Central Asia
than to Eastern Europe, combined with the acute spatial disparities in the provision of services, has left
many without access to basic services.148 A large share live in small settlements, pointing to the need for
sectoral strategies and programs to address the particular challenges of small, remote areas.
The poor state of transport infrastructure and services limits access to key services and to economic
opportunities for rural residents. Despite considerable progress in improving the national road network
over the past decade, connectivity in regions and rural areas is still poor. In most rural areas, there is no
public transport service, and only about half the small towns have an organized transport service of variable
frequency.149 Furthermore, the state of roads, coupled with limited transport services, may impact access to
services in rural areas. Thus, as a consequence of the ongoing school optimization program, many children
in rural areas will have to travel farther to school. Similarly, as the much-needed hospital reform and public
hospital network restructuring takes place (discussed below), the distance between hospitals will increase,
and the state of roads will become even more crucial for rapid access.

Quality of institutions
Many issues related to the disparities in the access to and quality of services, particularly spatial
disparities, can be traced to poorly performing, inefficient public administration. First, because of
governance challenges, social capital is dwindling, including public trust, public participation, and voice
and accountability. Moldova’s scores on the Gallup community basics index were consistently lower than

those of comparator countries such as Georgia and Romania between 2006 and 2013, but there has been
some improvement in the value of the index since 2010 (Figure 77).
Moldova’s public administration continues to face a number of challenges in developing and
implementing policies and delivering services to individuals and businesses. Starting in 2009,
improvements were initiated in public administration. A new legal and institutional foundation for civil
service and public administration was established; procedures in the management of the civil service were
aligned with good practices recognized by the EU; and the groundwork was laid for a meritocratic civil
service with a well-defined pay- and performance-management system. Since 2011, the government,
through the E-Governance Center, has established a robust information and communication technology
infrastructure for e-services delivery. As of 2016, the government has made available online access to
information on 490 central government administrative services (of an estimated total of 570 services);
electronic applications can be submitted for 112 of these services. However, business process reengineering
has lagged both at the center and in local government, and is the most important public administration
challenge ahead. According to the most recent review by the European Commission, Moldova made limited
progress on depoliticizing and professionalizing its central public administration, in the absence of a clear
strategy for public administration reform. The average salaries of civil servants remained low, and the civil
service remained structurally weak due to staff moving to the private sector or to international organizations
and because of corruption.150 Interviews at line ministries indicate that the problem is especially acute in
retaining graduates because of low pay, frustration about career opportunities, and a work environment that
discourages initiative.151 The continuing difficulty of attracting and retaining qualified staff in the civil
service is widely acknowledged.152 Meanwhile, inefficient, fragmented, and often corrupt service delivery
increases the cost of doing business, harms growth, and limits access, especially among the poor and rural
people.
In addition, the institutional framework for water and sanitation provision undermines spatial equity
because rural areas are marginalized. The national government regulates and provides most investment
funding, while local governments are formally responsible for service provision.153 Yet, none of the national
water institutions have an explicit mandate to cater to the specific needs of those living beyond the reach
of public utilities, and rural water and sanitation services do not have a dedicated institutional home at the
national level.154 About 50 percent of the population without service access lives in settlements of a size
below 2,500 inhabitants. Thus, sector strategies, programs, and management models need to address the
specific realities of small and more remote settlements. Currently, there is no specific legal framework
defining accepted forms of service provision in rural areas; so, many service providers do not operate under
a license or comply with any of the law’s requirements, resulting in variable quality.155 Limited attention is

this effort does not address equitable access to key services such as education, health care, water and sanitation.

given to rural areas and small towns below 5,000 inhabitants even with the recent adoption of the 2014–28
sectoral strategy.156 This institutional gap calls for a leading agency to coordinate targeted efforts to close
access inequalities and for adjustments of existing polices to take into account the special requirements of
service provision in rural areas. This means taking into account the diseconomies of scale, the limited ability
of rural poor populations to pay at full cost, and alternative models of service provision, ranging from
community-operated systems to raion-centered systems, depending on population size and capacity.
Moldovans also lack knowledge about their entitlements to services, and trust in the government has
declined. Lack of understanding of available health protection mechanisms has potentially led to low
utilization of services and out-of-pocket cost increases. Moldovans have been consistently less satisfied
than respondents in other countries with the quality of public services, such as health care and education.
Satisfaction with the education system has been declining since 2009, while satisfaction with health care
has been relatively constant, at around 40 percent.157 The political instability of recent years, including the
banking scandal, has negatively impacted the population’s trust in institutions. The share of people
reporting they trusted the national government fell from 40.7 percent in 2006 to 14.5 percent in 2013. In a
2015 poll, only 7 percent expressed some trust or much trust in government; 6 percent, in Parliament; and
5 percent, in the president (Figure 78). The lack of accommodation for the cultural and language diversity
across ethnic groups and regions partly led to the inadequate provision of services to minority groups.

in urban areas. These utility companies operate under the supervision of the national economic regulator, ANRE, as well as health
and environmental agencies. The rest of the population is served by hundreds of informal, often community-based providers, or
relies on self-provision. No specific legal framework or institution regulates operation in rural areas, which is a challenge given the
much lower level of access and quality. As part of an upcoming village development study, the World Bank is currently conducting
a countrywide review of water services beyond the reach of public utilities (World Bank 2016g).

Efficiency and spatial equity of spending
Inefficient public spending limits the fiscal space for improving service delivery. Funds for hospital
services account for 50 percent of public health expenditure. These are spread thinly across 73 hospitals,
soaking up funds that could go toward financial protection for individuals, infrastructure, equipment, and
incentives for personnel. First, it is expensive to maintain infrastructure and equipment, especially if
utilization rates are low. Moldova is in the 88th percentile worldwide in hospital beds per 1,000 people, and
in the 73rd and 97th percentiles compared with the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region and lower-
middle-income countries, respectively.158 Second, health worker shortages imply that human resources are
spread thinly across many facilities. Hospital volumes are low, which jeopardizes the quality of care
because both facilities and individual providers need to perform a certain number of procedures a year to
maintain skills. As in other countries, Moldova could consider stipulating minimum service volumes per
hospital or incorporating these kinds of thresholds in regulations.
Improving the efficiency of spending can open up much-needed fiscal space to improve service
coverage and quality, particularly in rural areas. For example, closing the coverage, quality, and equity
gaps in water provision, which disproportionately affect rural areas and thus the less well off, requires much
higher investment and a shift of attention toward rural areas. The 0.02 percent of GDP invested annually in
the water sector in Moldova is well below the 1.2 percent to 6.0 percent recommended by the OECD for
low-income countries.159 Furthermore, only about one-third of the resources goes toward rural settlements,
although these represent three-quarters of the overall needs.160 Priority should therefore be directed toward
settlements where no system was ever built, rather than the rehabilitation of existing systems.
The efficiency of public service delivery is hampered by the extremely high administrative-territorial
fragmentation of Moldova and the limited capacity of local governments to raise revenues. Moldova
has suboptimally small local governments (see Figure 5). By consolidating villages and decentralizing
services through territorial administrative reform, the government may address the underlying issues of low
institutional capacity and inefficient spending. However, there are significant political economy challenges
and limited support in Parliament for this reform, including the consolidation of territories, budget controls,
and discretion over budget spending.161 In addition, local governments have limited economic capacity to
generate revenues to finance service provision. They mainly rely on intergovernmental fiscal transfers and
their share of income taxes (75 percent of the revenues raised within their jurisdictions). Given low
economic activity (and high emigration) in rural areas, local government revenues from fees are low and
have been declining as a share of total revenues. There is currently no legal framework to create new taxes

159 See OECD (2011). During 2009–13, investments represented a small contribution, only €2 per capita per year. Within the

framework of the new strategy for the water sector, investment should increase to €11 per capita per year to extend water and
sewerage networks, increasing the number of users connected to public water and sewerage utilities and rehabilitating and building
water and wastewater treatment plants (Eptisa 2012).
160 The frequent argument that urban utilities must be fixed before they can help improve services in rural areas might not hold

given the slow pace of improvement even in the urban sector. Although the aggregate water utility performance index for urban
utilities in Moldova has improved from 40 to 59 (with 100 being international good practices) according to the DANUBIS.org
database, the current value is still significantly below the regional average of 69, and progress in the last five years has slowed
considerably (World Bank 2016g).

at the local level. Property taxes could provide an ideal local government revenue source because they are
borne mainly by residents and can be designed as a progressive tax to balance the more regressive taxes
such as value added taxes. However, this requires addressing many issues related to property registration
and valuation.162 If local governments are to fulfill their service delivery mandate, they need support in both
capacity and revenue.
Given the great need for investment in basic services, the government should invest in municipal
infrastructure and explore the scope for private involvement.
Reducing vulnerability and improving the resilience of the population
Climate change and environment risks
Moldova’s natural resource base is degrading, and climate change is likely to increase the incidence
of extreme climatic events and their impact on the economy. The country’s development depends to a
large extent on the availability and quality of natural resources and the environment. Moldova has unique
agricultural land resources that are critical to the livelihoods of many and are characterized by highly
productive black soils (about 70 percent) and a high agricultural utilization rate (more than 75 percent).
However, low levels of forest coverage and poor land management contribute to soil erosion, floods, and
landslides, which have resulted in large areas of totally degraded agricultural lands and to a significant
decline in agricultural productivity.163 Land privatization and parceling, lack of crop rotation and
antierosion measures, and nonimplementation of best practices for soil conservation have complicated the
prospects of efficient land resource management. In terms of the quality of the environment, Moldova is
subject to increased water pollution, especially of groundwater (the major source of rural drinking water)
as well as vehicular air pollution in urban areas. Furthermore, climate-related shocks, such as droughts have
made the agricultural sector highly volatile. Moldova is among countries expected to show significant water
stress in 2040.164 In this regard, the country is among those at highest risk in Europe, and the availability of
water resources is considered a major challenge for future development.165 Extreme climatic events may
worsen in the future, with important implications for economic growth and consumption growth (see Figure
43). Negative GDP impacts in the next 15 years may be expected to be driven mostly by the effects of
climate change on productivity through rises in temperature.166
The poor and the bottom 40 are more dependent on natural resources and more vulnerable to
climate-related shocks, given their concentration in rural areas and in the agricultural sector. The
large share of the poor living in rural areas and relying on farm income are highly vulnerable to climate



162 The lack of complete national systematic registration impedes effective property tax collection, local development, planning,
and other activities, particularly among local governments. Periodic revaluations can help reduce tax evasion and are essential to
maintaining equity in property taxation and the buoyancy of tax revenues because property values fluctuate over time and across
regions. Periodic revaluations also enable local public authorities to share in the increase in property values generated by economic
and urban growth to which property owners have not contributed. The land sector note (World Bank 2016h) provides a deeper
discussion on the importance of increasing the incomes of local governments through property taxation.
163 Moldova also has a limited afforested area, 12 percent, while the average across Europe is about 30 percent (World Bank 2015d).

shocks.167 Given their low levels of productivity, a highly variable climate, and a substantial reliance on
rainfed agriculture, these groups are particularly at risk of food insecurity.
It is thus necessary to ensure that the agricultural sector becomes more resilient to droughts and
other climate-related shocks. The resilience of Moldova farmers is already stressed by changes in weather
patterns. The combination of heat waves, droughts, and intense storms is especially disruptive. Adaptation
measures implemented now would have immediate benefits in improving current yields, in addition to
protecting farmers from future changes. Attempts at farm adaptation have been numerous and partially
successful, but farmers believe larger investments in infrastructure are needed.168 More generally, better
management of the risks related to climate events would require a combination of (a) investment and
policies that help mitigate the risks (such as irrigation and the introduction of improved seeds and
technologies), (b) risk-transfer instruments (improving agricultural insurance schemes), and (c) risk-coping
options. Specifically, policy changes and institutional capacity improvements that should be undertaken
immediately include (a) investment in improving access to irrigation and in training farmers in water use,
(b) enhancing the access of farmers to new varieties, technology, and information on resilient practices such
as drought- and pest-resistant varieties and hail protection, (c) timely meteorological information, (d)
investigating options to reform crop insurance to decrease administration costs and improve affordability. 169
Full cadastral and property registration is likely to improve land management and therefore reduce the
vulnerability to natural disasters and facilitate disaster management and recovery.
In addition, the conservation of natural ecosystems is needed for sustainability. Proactive measures
need to be taken to implement biodiversity conservation strategies through the expansion and consolidation
of the protected areas in the north and center. The Second National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan
specifies that, by 2020, protected areas will be expanded by about 8 percent.170 Long-term adaptation
measures for achieving sustainable development include an integrated landscape approach for biodiversity
protection and developing river management action plans.171
However, reducing the vulnerability of the less well off in rural areas and promoting their economic
mobility need to go beyond agricultural and climate change policies. A large share of people in the
agricultural sector have little interest and potential for commercialization.172 For these households, access
to rural services, social protection, and nonfarm jobs will determine their ability to adapt to climate change.
Social protection systems
Moldova operates an extensive social protection system, with a focus on social security. The system
includes both contributory social insurance and noncontributory social assistance cash benefits and social
care services. In 2014, the country spent over 12 percent of GDP on multiple social protection programs,
which is close to the Eastern Europe and Central Asia regional average. Social protection programs cover
55 percent of the population because of the extensive coverage of pensions.

Social assistance programs remain limited and cover only a small share of the poor. Social assistance
programs (social safety nets) are not extensive. In 2014, they covered only about 14 percent of the
population and 31 percent of the poorest quintile. Slightly pro-poor (34 percent of social assistance benefits
accrue to the bottom 20), they are fragmented and have low targeting accuracy. Many cash benefits are
provided under poorly targeted categorical programs. As a result, of the overall social assistance spending
that makes up 2 percent of GDP, about 20 percent leaks to people in the top 60, and some benefits channel
well above 30 percent of their budgets to more well off people. The targeted Ajutor Social and heating
allowance demonstrate the highest targeting accuracy (over 70 percent of benefits are received by the
bottom 20). The Heating Allowance Program, for instance, has emerged as the major safety net to mitigate
the poverty impact of energy tariff increases. In the 2015–16 heating season, when residential energy tariffs
rose, the program increased coverage by around 4 percent of the population.173 Nonetheless, it remains
small and covers only 9 percent of the total population. Improving the efficiency and equity of the social
safety net would require consolidation of multiple categorical programs to reallocate the funds toward
expanding the coverage of poverty-targeted cash transfers.
Pension outlays constitute about 8 percent of GDP, but fail to provide adequate benefits for the
elderly. The level of pensions relative to wages is low. In 2013, the replacement rate was 27.0 percent,
which is among the lowest gross replacement rates in the region, and is projected to fall to 13.5 percent by
2050 (Figure 80). The pension system runs a fiscal deficit, underperforms on pension benefit adequacy,
struggles with compliance, and weakens the incentive to participate and contribute to the system. Aging,
other demographic trends, and the low formal employment rate are exacerbating these structural issues.174

Noncontributory schemes currently cover only 1 percent of retirees. Parametric reforms of the public
pension system, such as valorization of past earnings in the pension formula, indexation of pensions, and
adjusting retirement ages, could help address the looming old-age poverty risks for those covered by
pension insurance, thereby avoiding a sharp decline in the replacement rate (Figure 81) and easing fiscal
pressures.175 However, the fiscal space to protect those not covered by pension insurance must be provided,
potentially through an efficient and equitable social assistance system.

Social care is fragmented. Social services cost around 1 percent of GDP. Although Moldova has made
some progress in deinstitutionalizing care and developing community-based service provision, certain
services remain residential. In addition, the spatial distribution of services does not match needs; social care
is decentralized to local governments, and the poorest raions have fewer resources to fund it. Moreover,
local authorities frequently lack capacity to assess needs and plan service delivery. The country has made
progress in engaging nongovernmental organizations to provide services. However, such service
commissioning is achieved mostly by drawing on donor and external funding rather than local budgets.176
Access to finance is a limited option for households in seeking to protect themselves against income
shocks. For example, in 2011, only 4.6 percent of households in Moldova had a bank loan, compared with
49.2 percent in Central and Eastern Europe and 21.6 percent in lower-middle-income countries.177

populations and ethnic minorities are less well connected and thus excluded from public services and
economic opportunities. The poorly performing public administration, with its fragmented local structures,
is partly contributing to the inefficiency of spending and the inadequacy of service delivery. Inefficient
spending is also leaving little room for Moldova to invest in infrastructure, social protection, and other
adaption measures to mitigate shocks.

VIII. Priorities for poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Moldova
The diagnostics presented in this report offer a backward- and forward-looking view of the progress
and prospects of Moldova in reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. In sum, it finds as
follows:
   The performance of Moldova in poverty reduction and boosting shared prosperity has been good
    in the past decade and a half. Economic growth has been high and consumption-driven, fueled by
    remittances. Remittances and pensions, in particular, have played an important role in the upward
    economic mobility of households. Given the systematic decline in employment rates, labor markets
    have contributed mostly through increases in nonfarm wages. The decline in employment is driven by
    falling labor force participation.
   The current drivers of poverty reduction and shared prosperity are not sustainable, given that (a)
    the previous driver of growth, remittances, will continue to slow down; (b) the role of pensions is
    unsustainable, and fiscal pressures will mount as the population ages; and (c) climate change and
    economic and political volatility have increased, making the economy and households vulnerable to
    frequent shocks.
   These risks to the sustainability of gains in poverty reduction and boosting shared prosperity call
    for new drivers of inclusive growth, centered on strengthening household earning capacity. The
    report proposes two pathways, as follows: (a) promote private sector–led job creation and higher
    productivity and (b) ensure that individuals have the human capital stock and ability to take on the new
    jobs and that they are protected from shocks that could affect their living standards.
   These pathways support a rebalanced growth model for Moldova. This growth model will be
    mainly driven by higher private sector growth and job creation (pathway 1), accompanied by
    urbanization and better connectivity and inclusion for equitable access to economic opportunities and
    services (pathway 2). The diagnostic identified many systematic issues that undermine the past progress
    along the two pathways. In the labor market, in particular, challenges to job creation center on both the
    demand and supply sides (Box 5).
   Firms face multiple obstacles in creating jobs (pathway 1). The obstacles revolve around (a) access
    to inputs such as infrastructure services, finance, and human capital; (b) the regulatory environment,
    including specific sectoral regulations, particularly in the financial and energy sectors and in trade
    integration; and (c) the implementation of regulations in a context of substantial challenges in the rule
    of law and the judicial system, unfair competition, and pressures on sound macroeconomic
    management.
   People are not well prepared for a modern labor market and are highly vulnerable to shocks
    (pathway 2). The reasons include the low quality, equity, and relevance of education and training and

                                                     75
    barriers and disincentives to work. The latter are in some cases more pronounced among women.
    Building up the stock of human capital is further hampered by poor access to services, particularly in
    rural areas, reflecting the low quality among institutions and inefficient public spending. Furthermore,
    households are increasingly vulnerable to shocks, including climatic shocks, and social protection
    systems are not yet adequate to protect them. These constraints are systematically more severe in rural
    areas.
Box 5. A Summary: Challenges of Moldova’s labor market
The preceding analysis has highlighted Moldova’s need to move toward a private sector–led, employment-
based model of growth and prosperity. Throughout the exposition, many aspects of the demand for and supply of
labor have appeared as challenges to the creation of good jobs. This box pulls together these different observations of
the labor market into a summary of how employment trend has been on the decline and wage growth in the private
sector has been weak (Figure B5.1).
The main challenge to employment in Moldova is the lack of job creation in the private sector. Firms shrink and
exit rather than expand, and firm entry has been declining. Large firms show higher survival rates and employ more
people, but they are also less productive, whereas productive firms, including foreign and small domestic firms, face
barriers to entry and growth. These disparities are partly a result of weak competitive conditions and poor rule of law.
Preferential treatment, price and market controls, and low investment protection are some of the issues that discourage
or block investments by foreign and small firms, thereby enhancing the dominance of large and older firms in key
sectors, including the SOEs. Critical governance weaknesses, including corruption and the politicization of regulatory
and judicial institutions, have lowered the goodwill and trust enjoyed among firms. In addition, the competitiveness
of firms is hindered by regulatory uncertainty and high transaction costs: businesses are burdened with lengthy
processes in obtaining licenses and permits and in undergoing inspections. The deficiencies in three key areas
exemplify the regulatory and governance weaknesses and how they have limited the productive potential of firms. In
the financial sector, the credit market for small firms is limited, and gaps in regulations potentially jeopardize the
sector’s transparency and stability. The bank fraud was a result of the flawed supervision of banks and the inadequate
mandate of the role of bank owners and managers. The fraud has weakened the credit market. In the utility sector,
inadequate competition keeps costs high and quality low. Moldova is highly integrated into the global market, and its
trade regulations and logistics have improved, but the deteriorating quality of infrastructure hinders the connectivity
of firms.
The challenges faced by firms have dampened labor demand and productivity growth, which have limited labor
supply. The lack of job opportunities and the large wage differentials with neighboring countries (Figure B5.2) are
the main push factors for emigration, but even if adjustments are made for emigrants, the activity rate of the domestic
labor force is low relative to comparators. This vicious cycle of low labor supply and demand emerges in many areas:
productive firms tend to pay higher wages, but constraints on their survival and expansion reduce job opportunities
and wage growth, which reduces the opportunities and incentives to enter the labor market. This last outcome affects
especially youth with high reservation wages, people with access to remittances, and women with family care
responsibilities in a context of formal care facilities that are inexistent, expensive or poor in quality. Moreover, the
educational system is not yet equipped to produce the skills needed by firms, resulting in mismatches between the
skills that firms require to expand and increase productivity and the skills that the people have. In 2014, 37.3 percent
of the employed adults are assessed to be either overeducated or undereducated for the job and up to 45.2 percent
believe they are.a Unequal access to services affects firm productivity and individuals, especially those in rural and
small settlements where institutional capacity is low and revenues are limited, thereby further hampering the ability
of such individuals to access and prepare for the labor market. The rapid aging and shrinking of the working-age
population have the potential to exacerbate the labor supply challenges in Moldova.
Overall, these challenges call for many reforms to address the constraints on the emergence of a more vibrant
private sector that can create jobs and to remove the disincentives and barriers to work.

This final section uses the evidence presented in the diagnostic to identify six priority constraints that
prevent Moldova from making sustainable progress toward the twin goals in the short and medium
to long terms. A constraint can earn a place on the priority list if it is a foundational problem the resolution
of which would unlock other related constraints, if it is a striking outlier in the benchmarking against other
countries, and it appears emphatically and repeatedly in stakeholder consultations. This does not mean that
there are no other challenges, but these emerged as the six main bottlenecks. Three of them emerge as
particularly important challenges, with impacts on both pathways.
Priority areas for making progress toward the twin goals
The six main priorities if Moldova is to create jobs and build up and protect the stock of assets of
people, with the ultimate goal of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable
manner are presented in Figure 82. It illustrates that there are three top priorities if Moldova is to navigate
these two pathways of creating more and better jobs and building up and protecting the stock of assets of
the population. It must address important cross-cutting governance challenges on two fronts:
(a) strengthening the rule of law and the accountability of institutions and (b) improving the efficiency of
and equity in service delivery. Another top priority is to (c) increase the quality, equity, and relevance of
education and training systems so firms may increase productivity and households may increase economic
opportunities. In addition, supporting policy priorities include (d) improving the business regulatory
framework, (e) ensuring sound macroeconomic and fiscal management, and (f) reforming the social
protection system, particularly pensions.

Table 3 summarizes the six priorities and includes, in broad terms, the constraints identified in the
diagnostics, broad examples of a policy agenda, and the pathways through which the policy agenda can
unlock the constraints. It also includes considerations on the expected timeline for impact on the twin goals.
The priority areas are discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs.
1. Strengthening the rule of law and the accountability of institutions. Promoting a sound business
environment so foreign and domestic private sector firms can create jobs calls for a significant improvement
in governance, including anticorruption measures, secure property rights, sound justice and financial
systems, and fair competitive conditions. The diagnostics reveal that governance-related indicators have
deteriorated in Moldova, representing significant constraints to firms across sectors; corruption is a top
constraint. Moldova also scores poorly in terms of trust in the courts and the judicial system and the intensity
of local competition, all of which undermine business performance and productivity and, thus, job creation.
Addressing these challenges requires action on many fronts, including but not limited to the following: (a)
enhancing the independence, integrity, and accountability of the courts and prosecutors by monitoring and
publishing data on justice sector performance; improving the speed and transparency of judicial decisions;
and strengthening the management and utilization of justice sector resources, particularly to benefit poor
and vulnerable groups; (b) strengthening competition and state aid control policies in key sectors and
combating anticompetitive conduct by the private or public sector; aligning SOE governance with OECD
Guidelines on Corporate Governance to improve efficiency, accountability, and transparency; (c)
strengthening the independence, powers, and supervision capacity of the NBM and the NCFM; in addition,
ensuring shareholder transparency and good corporate governance in financial institutions; (d) publicly
monitoring the results of government reform programs to improve the accountability of government
agencies; and (e) actions related to the tax system for a unified, centralized, and fair tax administration,
such as harmonizing the tax system with EU directives and standards and introducing risk management for

key tax administration functions—such as registration, filing, payment, and enforcement—to reduce the
informal economy and improve compliance.

2. Improving efficiency and equity in service delivery. The provision of equitable, good-quality services,
such as transport infrastructure, energy, and water, is critical for increasing the productivity of firms and
the human capital stock. Limited access to services, especially in rural and remote areas, has contributed to
social exclusion, particularly to spatial (regional and urban or rural) gaps in opportunities and in the quality
of life. The need for improving service delivery is linked to two issues identified as priorities: the low
capacity of public administration and the inefficiency of spending.
   Enhancing the quality of institutions. The central and local governments continue to face challenges
    in attracting and retaining qualified civil servants because the work environment is burdened with
    corruption, and the pay is too low to compete with the private sector. Political instability and lack of
    transparency have also eroded public trust and participation in government service provision.
    Strengthening the accountability of public administration would require (a) professionalizing the civil
    service by competitive selection and objective evaluations, (b) establishing clear responsibilities across
    government agencies and regularly monitoring the quality of services based on citizen feedback, and
    (c) increasing digital access to central government administrative services at the local level. Such
    institutional changes would be conditional on the improvements in governance specified above.
   Improving efficiency of spending. Moldova is not a low spender on public services, but its spending
    is, in many cases, not efficient or not directed toward the most needed areas, crowding out the fiscal
    space for critical investments in other important areas and across regions. Highly inefficient health
    spending is an example. Moreover, the fragmentation of administrative organizations means that
    resources are stretched across many small local government units, many of which lack the capacity to
    generate revenues to finance service provision. Improving the efficiency of spending can have
    important complementary effects in tackling constraints in other areas as resources are freed up. For
    instance, redirecting fiscal resources toward providing better coverage of social assistance and
    increasing access to infrastructure services such as water, particularly for those in rural areas, can help
    mitigate the impact of climate change and other shocks to households.
Examples of policy actions include the consolidation of local units through territorial administrative reform,
given the high territorial fragmentation of Moldova. Short of such structural reform in the short term, a
priority should be to direct more investments toward excluded geographic areas and enhance the capacity
of the local governments responsible for such areas. Other policy options include reducing the average
number of documents citizens need to obtain to be eligible to apply for selected services, and improving
the legal and regulatory framework for public service delivery. More broadly, other options can also be
explored, including alternative models of service provision that incorporate the involvement of
communities and the private sector. Policies to improve the efficiency of spending in specific sectors need
to be considered. In education, for instance, policy options could include promoting efficiency and
transparency in the allocation of education resources through the use of a per capita financing formula and
establishing a functional education management information system covering all education levels. This can
have important complementarities with the next priority area related to education.
3. Increasing the quality, equity, and relevance of education and training systems. Firms in Moldova
encounter difficulties in finding workers with the desired competencies and skills. The education and
training systems are not keeping up with the demand of labor markets or producing quality and equitable
educational outcomes. Reforms should focus on (a) establishing a teacher recruitment system and career
path that promotes teacher performance, (b) promoting the acquisition of strong generic skills from early
                                                      80
ages and throughout the educational cycle, (c) increasing the alignment of academic curricula (by
introducing mandatory occupational standards) with market demands, through better coordination with the
private sector, and monitoring of information to promote skill matches in the labor market.
4. Reforming the social protection system, particularly pensions. In the context of an aging society,
Moldova needs to ensure that its increasing elderly population is not at risk of poverty. The pension systems
are not fiscally sustainable, underperform on pension benefit adequacy, struggle with compliance, and
weaken the incentive to participate in the labor market and contribute to the system. Parametric reforms of
the public pension system are critical not only for the economic security of the elderly, but also given
complementarities with much-needed incentives to work. Policy actions to reform social protection,
particularly pensions, include (a) introducing the valorization of past earnings in the pension formula, along
with an adequate indexation pattern and lower accrual rate, and (b) gradually equalizing the retirement age
at 62 and then increasing it for both genders to 65. There is room for improving social assistance programs,
by consolidating multiple categorical programs to reallocate the funds toward expanding the coverage of
poverty-targeted cash transfers.
5. Improving the business regulatory framework. Improving the predictability of the regulatory
environment and reducing transaction costs are key if the private sector is to grow in Moldova. Despite
improvements, there are still weaknesses in the regulatory framework both in terms of cross-cutting
regulations and sectoral regulations in financial and energy markets that have negative spillovers in the
entire private sector. Reforming the business environment—addressing, in particular, pockets of poor
performance—is a priority area for Moldova. Policy options include reducing unjustifiable regulatory
compliance costs carried by businesses, particularly those related to excessive numbers of licenses, permits,
authorizations, certifications, and acts of registration. Moreover, policies should reduce the burden of
inspections, focusing on those that are duplicative and overlapping, and not based on risk analysis and risk
assessment.
6. Ensuring sound macroeconomic and fiscal management. Maintaining macroeconomic stability,
especially in a country highly exposed to external economic and climatic shocks, is essential for private
sector growth and for the well-being of people. While Moldova has improved macroeconomic management
with the shift to inflation targeting, the repercussions of the weaknesses in financial sector governance and
attempts to undermine the independence of the NBM could derail macroeconomic stability. The root cause
of the previous banking crisis, financial sector misgovernance, has not been fully addressed; so, the risk of
derailing macroeconomic management remains. In addition, current fiscal pressures call for a need to
rethink the size of the fiscal envelope, as it spends and collects through the budget more than comparators.
The authorities should preserve NBM’s independence in monetary policy, while the government carefully
monitors potential contingent liabilities, first and foremost, in the financial sector, but also in energy and
SOE sectors. In addition, the government could improve the current fiscal rule as an anchor for
sustainability and output stabilization. Promoting the development of the domestic government securities
market can enable the government to finance an increasing share of its financing requirements.
Solutions across priorities must reflect Moldova’s specificities. The geography and openness of the
country, its legacy, and its demographics permeate the diagnostic. Openness will be the background for
Moldova’s shift from migration- to competitiveness-based growth. The territorial and ethnolinguistic
fragmentation of the country and its high share of rural population (legacy) are the context for spatial
disparities and deficiencies in service provision. Similarly, the rapid shrinking and aging of the population

                                                     81
cannot be detached from discussions of fiscal pressures, of pensions, of productivity, and of labor market
participation. Moldova is unique, and so must be its pathways to prosperity.

IX. Knowledge and data gaps
Although the datasets on Moldova are rich in many areas, the scope of the diagnostics is limited by three
priority data gaps:
   2014 census: the census data were collected, but have not yet been released. The main obstacles for
    completing the data analysis put forward by the government relate to lack of financial resources. This
    data gap has important implications for the analysis, including findings on the severity of the
    demographics challenge, labor force participation, and key indicators on GDP per capita and poverty.
    At the urging of donors, the Moldova National Bureau of Statistics recently announced the recruitment
    of 200 consultants to finalize the census.
   Data on Transnistria: the lack of data on Transnistria in all aspects of the diagnostics, including survey
    data on the socioeconomic characteristics of the population, limits substantially what can be said about
    poverty, shared prosperity, and economic growth at the national level.
   Data for minorities: data on ethnic and language minorities are lacking, given the underrepresentation
    of these groups in regular household surveys and the lack of availability of recent census data.
Beyond these main data gaps, additional data and knowledge gaps exist, as follows:
