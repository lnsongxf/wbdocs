BOX O.1  How Would You Want El Salvador To Be in the Future?

Throughout the preparation of this SCD the team often wondered about the hopes and
aspirations of the new generation of Salvadorans. This helped us to keep in mind the for-
­
ward-looking nature of this work. In this spirit, the World Bank’s Country Office asked fifth
grade students in schools across El Salvador to picture how they would like their country to
be in the future. One of the most common themes in the drawings was the wish for a future
without violence.

  Box 1.1  Country Context

  El Salvador is a small middle-income country with a large diaspora. With a population
  of 6.3 million and a gross domestic product (GDP) of $23.8 billion in 2012, El Salvador’s
  per capita GDP stands at around $3,800 in nominal terms. El Salvador is the smallest and
  most densely populated country in Central America. Population density is ten times the
  average for the Latin America and the Caribbean region. Almost two-thirds of the people
  live in urban areas and less than 1 percent is considered to be indigenous.
  Around 2 million people of Salvadoran origin live in the U.S. and remittances accounted
  to around $3.9 billion in 2012 (over 16 percent of GDP). El Salvador is exposed to numer-
  ous natural hazards, including tropical storms, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. With
  a homicide rate of around 41 deaths per 100,000 people El Salvador’s is one of the highest
  in the world. Besides a high level of homicides the country also suffers from high levels of
  extortion and other crimes related to street gangs, so-called maras. The services sector ac-
  counts for more than 60 percent of GDP and the economy has been officially dollarized
  since 2001.
  Since the end of the twelve-year civil war in 1991, El Salvador has made progress in con-
  solidating peace and democracy, but politics remains polarized. The national political
  stage is dominated by two main political parties—the National Republic Alliance (ARENA)
  and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN). ARENA held the executive
  branch of the Government from 1991 until March 2009, when the FMLN candidate,
  Mauricio Funes, won the presidential election. While the smooth handover of political
  power marked an important landmark in the country’s political history the political envi-
  ronment remained highly polarized.
  The FMLN narrowly won the presidential election held in March 2014 and President Salvador
  Sánchez Cerén assumed office on June 1, 2014. The twin goals of ending extreme poverty
  and boosting shared prosperity are fully aligned with the objectives of the new adminis-
  tration which released its Five-Year Development Plan in January 2015. The 2014–19
  Development Plan lays out the high-level objectives of a country that is more productive,
  educated, and safe (El Salvador: Productivo, Educado y Seguro).

      Box 1.2  Benchmarking with Peer Countries

      This SCD benchmarks El Salvador vis-à-vis countries in the same region (Latin America
      and the Caribbean), countries in the same income classification (lower middle income)
      and a set of structurally similar countries (“structural peers”).
      Structural peers are countries anywhere in the world that meet three criteria that also de-
      fine El Salvador:
      ■■ Population between 3 and 12 million (El Salvador’s population is 6.4 million)
      ■■ GDP per capita between $2,500 and $6,000 (El Salvador’s GDP per capita is $3,800)
      ■■ Positive net outmigration and remittance inflows at least 3 percent of GDP
      Using the above criteria the structural peers for El Salvador are: Armenia, Bosnia and
      Herzegovina, the Dominican Republic, Georgia, Serbia, and Tunisia. References to
      “Structural peers average” in this SCD indicate the unweighted average for these countries
      (including El Salvador).

Determinants of Economic Growth	39
  Knowledge Gap  How Does Limited Domestic Competition Affect
  Shared Prosperity?

  Measures of product market regulations, data on firm creation, and available microeconomic
  studies such as the one on the trucking industry, air transport, electricity and agriculture
  sectors, all suggest some room for increasing competition in El Salvador. This may be one
  of the reasons behind limited innovation in the country, as illustrated for example by the
  fact that the percentage of firms introducing a new product in a given period is fewer in El
  Salvador than in the majority of countries for which this data is available (Lederman et al.
  2014, 8). Limited competition is likely affecting innovation and the ability to enter export
  markets, undermining the growth potential and therefore job prospects. In addition, lim-
  ited competition may push domestic prices up and thus undermine welfare for the popu-
  lation as a whole, including the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. For example,
  in 2008 the national Regulatory Agency for Competition detected a cartel agreement be-
  tween the most important wheat flour companies. This market-sharing agreement was
  particularly harmful for consumers as an average household in El Salvador spends 13 percent
  of its total consumption on bread. However, there is limited evidence that documents sys-
  tematically how competition conditions affect in practice shared prosperity.

  Knowledge Gap  The Paradox of a Widespread Perception of
  Corruption but Low Bribe Payments

  The data collected through various sources (Latino Barometer, Latin American Public Opin-
  ion Poll, Worldwide Governance Indicators, Enterprise Surveys) report widespread cor-
  ruption (by citizens and businesses). For example, 87 percent of respondents feel the police
  is corrupt or extremely corrupt and 81 percent feel the judiciary is corrupt or extremely
  (Transparency International’s 2013 Global Corruption Barometer for El Salvador). Accord-
  ing to the Enterprise Surveys 60 percent of Salvadoran firms consider corruption as a major
  constraint in doing business, compared to 40 percent on average in Latin America. How-
  ever the actual percentage of respondents reporting to pay a bribe is about 11 percent—a
  low number and in contradiction with the widespread perception of corruption. A few
  factors could help explain this apparent contradiction in the data:

  1.	 Respondents may be reticent to admit to have paid a bribe (a well-known phenomenon
      recently studied by Kraay and Murrell 2013);
  2.	 An open and lively press may influence respondents and bias them toward believing
      that corruption is more widespread and common than what it is in reality;
  3.	 Bribe payment is only one form of corruption and this may not be the most common
      and/or threatening to the country. Other forms may be more common (like nepotism
      or corruption in public procurement or elite capture) that have not been captured in
      the existing surveys

  To reconcile this apparent contradiction it would be important to gather additional data
  on different types of corruption present in the country. The data collection should be de-
  tailed and rich enough to explore whether firms of different size and/or located in differ-
  ent provinces and/or working in different sectors are more or less affected by different
  types of corruption. This exercise could help understand the most significant challenges
  faced by firms and identify clear policy measures to address them. It would also help bet-
  ter understand the extent and the mechanisms through elite capture by a small group of
  vested interests may be operating in the country.

Source: World Bank staff calculations with data from SEDLAC.
Note: Lower bound estimates using synthetic panels constructed as in Dang et al. (2011). Chronic refers to households who were poor in all
three periods (income below US$ 4 a day per person PPP). Upward refers to households poor in 2004 but not-poor in both 2007 and 2012.
Downward refers to households non-poor in 2004 but poor in the following two periods. Vulnerable are those that have moved into and out
of poverty. Non-vulnerable those who have been non-poor throughout. Education, sector and gender variables refer to the characteristics of
the head of household in 2004.

  Box 3.1  Uneven Progress Toward Gender Equality—With Self-
  Reinforcing Dynamics

  El Salvador has made important efforts to recognize and advance the rights of women by
  signing and ratifying major international treaties and passing several important pieces of
  domestic legislation. However improvements in the legal framework have not fully trans-
  lated into comparable progress in gender equality of endowments, such as health, educa-
  tion, economic opportunities, family dynamics voice and agency. Many of these factors
  entail mutually-reinforcing dynamics, for example, with interactions between dropping
  out of school, teenage pregnancy, female labor force participation, economic dependence
  on remittances from absent male partners and fathers who have migrated, and differenti-
  ated impacts of crime and violence.
  Reproductive health and teenage pregnancy: El Salvador has made progress on all of the
  reproductive health indicators over the last decade. Maternal mortality has decreased, the
  share of women receiving prenatal care increased, and the prevalence of contraceptive use
  grew. These improvements, however, have not been equally enjoyed throughout the coun-
  try as socioeconomic characteristics, including poverty, education, and location greatly
  impact health indicators. Abortion is illegal under any circumstances, which has
  prompted the UN’s Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to
  call for a national dialogue on the consequences of that restrictive legal framework in
  2008. Similar concerns have been reiterated more recently by the UN’s Committee on
  Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 2014. Adolescent fertility, an important proxy

  indicator for women’s agency, has decreased from 100 to 76 births per 1,000 women aged
  15 to 19 between 2000 and 2012, but remains high among rural and less educated teens
  (see also World Bank 2012e). UNFPA reports that 32 percent of prenatal inscriptions in El
  Salvador in 2013 were for women under the age of 19, and two percent of these were for
  very young girls, ages 10–14.
  Education—and the ninis: Secondary school dropout is high overall for El Salvador (only
  40 percent of Salvadorans ages 25 to 20 have completed high school). Gender differences
  for school exit are small overall, but drop-out rates are higher for girls in upper secondary
  school. The self-claimed reasons for dropping out are different, with girls more likely to
  declare “lack of interest” or “personal reason” for not being in school (possibly related to
  household duties) and boys more likely to leave school for “economic reasons.” Moreover,
  what teen boys and girls do after leaving school differs significantly. Gender norms that af-
  fect young men and women’s roles within the family and society are likely to impact indi-
  vidual decisions to continue or to leave school. Among the youth aged 15 to 24, women
  are more likely than men to be neither studying nor working: 35 percent of women vs.
  10 percent of men in that age group are so-called ninis, short for ni trabajan, ni estudian.
  Female ninis often mention the need to do household work as a predominant reason to
  drop out of school and 45 percent of them are either married or living with a partner,
  compared to 10 percent of male ninis.
  Labor force participation and economic opportunity: Female labor force participation
  lags behind regional averages and, as identified in the main text above, the factors contrib-
  uting to this low female labor force participation constitute a knowledge gap. However, fe-
  male unemployment rate is lower than the regional average and the male unemployment
  rate. Women in El Salvador are also less likely than men to have an informal job. In addi-
  tion, the gender wage gap is among the lowest in the region: in 2010 women received on
  average 87 percent of men’s remuneration. The combination of low participation rates and
  relatively good indicators of the quality of labor force participation suggests the existence
  of some barriers to entering labor force, which discourage the less qualified. Gender norms
  may constitute one such barrier. However, this hypothesis needs further investigation.
  Migration, dependency, parental absence, and family dynamics: Males are significantly
  more likely to migrate than females, and females in households that receive remittances
  have lower labor force participation rates. Micro-econometric evidence has uncovered
  that remittances reduce labor force participation for women at all ages, with a higher neg-
  ative impact at younger ages, presumably allowing maternity options or home-based
  ­
  activities (Acosta 2006). However, this can put young women in a situation of being de-
  pendent on income support from remittances of male partners living abroad. It also raises

  the issue of parental absence—particularly for fathers. About one third (35 percent) of
  all minor children in El Salvador are being raised in households with a single parent (or
  none). A quarter (24 percent) of children are being raised by a single mother. Fathers ac-
  count for 93 percent of “absent parents” (and this figure has remained stable over the years
  from 2010–13).
  Crime and violence: Young men are much more likely to be victims of homicide, while
  women are much more likely to suffer violence in private and at the hands of those they
  know. Household survey data suggests that women are more likely to report physical or
  sexual partner violence in El Salvador than elsewhere in LAC; 36 percent of women ever
  married or in union (age 15–49) sought institutional help, and 65.5 percent told family
  and friends.
  Political participation, voice and agency: In national-level politics female participation
  grew significantly after a national political party reform establishing a 30 percent quota of
  women on electoral ballots. In 2013, with 26 percent female representation in parliament,
  El Salvador exceeds the LAC average. Gains in municipal-level representation remain small,
  with women making up only ten percent of Salvadoran mayors.

  Knowledge Gap  Why Do So Many Students Drop Out of School?

  The majority of Salvadoran students drop out before completing high-school. Without ed-
  ucated and skilled workers it will be challenging for El Salvador to create enough good
  jobs. Understanding what drives the decision to drop out is an important input for design-
  ing policies to address the situation.
  A number of factors may be behind the phenomenon of dropping out of school. First, re-
  maining at school has an opportunity cost for households. In fact, in the poorest quintile
  of the income distribution 15–18 year olds contribute an average of 8 percent of total
  household income. There are also social factors, like migration, crime, and teenage preg-
  nancies, that likely affect the decision to stay in school. When asked directly about why
  they dropped out, Salvadoran youth’s most frequent answers are “lack of interest” (34
  percent), “need or want to work” (19 percent), “cannot afford to continue” (18 percent),
  and “household responsibilities” (17 percent) (World Bank 2015a). There may also be sup-
  ply constraints, including lack of schools and/or seats particularly in rural areas; fees and
  other costs at the secondary level may present barriers to continuing. In addition, the
  overall poor quality at primary level may undermine performance of students at second-
  ary levels and motivation to stay in school.

  Knowledge Gap  What Is the Impact of Frequent Natural Disasters on
  the More Vulnerable?

  Identifying the causal effects of disasters on poverty and shared prosperity is challenging
  but necessary. Although the occurrence of a natural hazard could be considered exoge-
  nous, its transformation into a disaster is not. Less resourceful households located in haz-
  ard-prone areas are more vulnerable to the impacts of disasters and have less resilience to
  recover from them. While an exercise to understand the intersection of local exposure to
  climate sensitive hazards and social vulnerability was recently carried out for El Salvador
  (Amaya and Cabrera 2012), there is still a need to better understand this relationship and
  importantly fully integrate hazard exposure and social vulnerability into a comprehensive
  vulnerability assessment for the country, the linkages between disaster and poverty in El
  Salvador and how to improve coping and adaptive capacities for the poor.

   Knowledge Gap  How Does Crime Affect the Welfare of the Bottom
   40 Percent?

   There is limited information as to how crime affects the welfare of the bottom 40 percent.
   However, data collection in this area is necessarily difficult and existing surveys of percep-
   tions or victimization are not without caveats. Efforts to improve data and to analyze it
   would be critical to support an evidence-based approach to policy-making in this area.

  Box 5.1  Implications of Remittances: Results from a CGE Model
  Estimation

  Using a CGE model, Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), we simulate an increase
  in the amount of remittances equal to seven percentage points of total household in-
  come. This figure was selected given that remittances were growing at annual rate of
  around 7 percent in the pre-2008 period. We assume that all of the simulated income
  change comes from the household income in North America and is transferred to the
  households in El Salvador without incurring any cost. We also assume that the change
  in remittance income would not affect government consumption in nominal terms.
  Furthermore, we assume that capital and labor are fully mobile across sectors while
  land is partly specific to crops.
  The results suggest that the simulated increase in remittances would raise domestic prices in
  El Salvador by 1.4 percent. The commodities with the greatest increase in domestic prices in-
  clude services (1.6–2.3 percent) with food prices rising more modestly (1.2–1.4 percent).
  Not all incomes are expected to keep up with the pace of general price increase following
  the increase in remittances. While the nominal increase in the return to skilled labor is ex-
  pected to be 3.2 percent, unskilled wages are likely to grow by 1.5 percent, barely exceed-
  ing the level of consumer inflation.
  The simulated increase in household incomes would result in an increase in real GDP
  equal to 0.3 percent. However, not all sectors would grow as a result—in fact many would
  shrink considerably, especially the production of textiles and apparel (a reduction of 7.2
  percent), followed by the manufacturing (a reduction of 2 percent). The main sectors ex-
  periencing an expansion are various service sectors (0.1–1.9 percent) and meat and live-
  stock production (1.8 percent).
  Finally, the increase in remittances would increase the volume of imports into El Salvador
  (5.1 percent) and reduce exports (9 percent). Most of the increase in imports would in-
  volve the importation of meat and livestock products (7.6 percent), followed by processed
  foods (5.8 percent) and manufactured goods (5.6 percent). Exports of all major categories
  would experience a decline, for example exports of textile and apparel and manufactured
  goods would decline by around 10 percent.

  Box 5.2  Implications of Lowering Trading Costs: Results from a CGE
  Model Estimation

  Using a CGE model, GTAP, we simulate an increase in the efficiency of trading costs for
  trade between the US and El Salvador which would bring its costs down to the level of
  Costa Rica, which is the best regional performer in terms of import costs with the US.
  Bilateral trade costs between the US and Costa Rica are reported at $80 per shipment in
  2011, while they stand at $95 for El Salvador; we therefore simulate an 18.7 percent im-
  provement in the efficiency of transport services for trade.
  The general macroeconomic impact of the reduction in trading costs is expected to be
  small due to the size of the shock, increasing domestic prices by only 0.1 percent and un-
  skilled wages by 0.5 percent. The largest decline in prices is expected among textile and
  apparel (0.3 percent) manufactured goods (0.1 percent).
  Even though the overall output of El Salvador would barely change, some sectors are ex-
  pected to experience noticeable changes in output as a result of the simulated change in
  trading costs. The largest growth is expected to occur in textiles and apparel which would
  grow by 1.9 percent. The largest reduction is expected in the sector of other manufactured
  goods which is expected to contract by 0.9 percent.
  The reduction in trading costs would also have a noticeable implication for El Salvador’s
  exports, whose volume is expected to grow by 1 percent, and imports which are expected
  to grow by 1.5 percent. At the sectoral level, the largest increase in imports is expected for
  grains (3 percent) and textiles and apparel (2.4 percent). The greatest increase in exports is
  predicted for textiles and apparel (3.4 percent).

Box 5.3  The Story of Texas Instruments in El Salvador (And the Almost
Complete Loss of an Export Cluster)

Long before the arrival of Intel in Costa Rica another electronic leading firm of the day
set its eyes in Central America. In 1973 Texas Instruments opened in El Salvador what
would eventually become its most significant manufacturing plant outside the US. Texas
Instruments was not alone. At its heyday in the late 1970 there were manufacturing
plants for many other electronics companies, including IBM, Xerox, AVX Ceramics, and
Dataram. The product space that maps the country’s exports (denoted with black squares
in the network of products shown in the right column of this box) shows that El Salvador
had a significant presence in exporting electronics in 1980 (see figure B5.3.1). Electronics
components, like the one pictured below, proudly displayed a reference to being made in
El Salvador:

  The arrival of Texas Instruments to El Salvador followed the adoption of the 1974
  Export Promotion Law, which provided for tax holidays, unrestricted repatriation
  of profits, guarantees against expropriation, and a specialized recruiting agency for
  laborers. Texas Instruments operated out of the San Bartolo Free Trade Zone and
  employed at its peak around 5,000 workers in two manufacturing facilities and drew
  on 300 local suppliers.

  Like most other foreign firms, Texas Instruments closed its operations in El Salvador in
  the early- to mid-1980s due in part to difficult operating conditions in the midst of the
  civil war. In the first three years of the 1980s it is estimated that capital outflows exceeded
  $1 billion. The promising electronics cluster did not survive. The product space for 1995
  shows a much diminished presence in the exports of electronics, and indeed a significant
  reduction in the diversification of exports. While it is difficult to regain a footing in a rap-
  idly evolving market such as electronics, and indeed the electronics sector has yet to make
  a comeback in El Salvador, the product space for 2009 shows a promising increased in the
  diversification of exports.

   Making the Most of the Still Large Manufacturing Base
   The sole survivor of the electronics cluster discussed in box 5.3 was a subsidiary of AVX
   Corporation. Founded in 1977, the plant in El Salvador manufactured passive electronic
   components, interconnection devices, and related products. It grew to become the largest
   employer in the local area with 1,600 employees in 1992 (up from 350 at the start of oper-
   ations). With the help of MIGA to cover the risk of war and civil disturbance, the com-
   pany continued expanding its production capacity during the 1990s, reaching 3,000
   workers in 2010 and total annual sales of over $120 million. The plant, still located in the
   San Bartolo Free Trade Zone, absorbed production lines of other AVX affiliates that were
   closed in Mexico and the Czech Republic when the holding company vertically integrated
   its production of capacitors. This case exemplifies how El Salvador can make the most of
   its still large manufacturing base.

   Making the Most of Regional Integration
   Bon Appetit was established in 1982 by the Zablah family with the idea to export ethnic
   foods towards migrant workers in the US (a “nostalgic” market). Although nostalgic ex-
   ports did not take off at that time the company survived through the 1980s by supplying
   the Salvadoran army. Trying to diversify its revenue sources, the company started experi-
   menting with non-carbonated beverages and launched the bottled flavored drink called
   Frutsi, which was a success and prompted the opening of a new plant in La Libertad. The
   new plant allowed them to reach a packaging and royalty deal with Del Monte drinks.
   With the opening up of the economy in the early 1990s the country lowered tariffs on im-
   ported goods, bringing in competition. The army contract ended and Del Monte changed
   its royalty agreement into a manufacturing agreement with reduced profit margins. The
   company needed to reinvent itself and raised $2 million of equity through the sale of 30
   percent of its shares to the Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC), to upgrade its
   plant and the Gatorade sports drink for Quaker (which meant letting go of the food busi-
   ness lines). The company grew and increased its productivity by obtaining the permit for
   12 hour shifts (which was seen as key to profitability and further growth).
   In 2000 Quaker was bought by PepsiCo, opening the door for dialogue with the regional
   bottler Central American Bottling Corporation (CABCORP)—the preferred bottling
   partner of PepsiCo. CABCORP acquired 50 percent of the company in 2002 and ex-
   panded production capacity. The company continued to grow and began exporting large
   volumes to Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. After 6 years of increased product
   lines, CABCORP increased its ownership stake to 95 percent in 2009 (changing the
   company name to Livsmart). By being part of a larger company, Livsmart was able to
   face increasing competition, since in 2008 the Mexican Company Jumex inaugurated its
   state-of-the art processing and bottling juice plant in El Salvador ($20 million invest-
   ment), from where it exports to over 20 countries and serves the Central America mar-
   ket. As the end of 2012, Livsmart generated 17 percent of all of CABCORP’s EBITDA,
   or approximately $21.3 million, with sales of over $130 million. It served markets in
   Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Puerto Rico, Haiti,
   the Dominican Republic, Mexico and United States (mainly south Florida and Texas).

   Making the Most of Proximity to Large Markets
   Aeroman is a company dedicated to the aeronautic maintenance, repair and overhaul
   (MRO) of airplanes (fuselage maintenance, not turbine maintenance). Its history is di-
   rectly linked to that of TACA (now Avianca), which dates back to 1931 in Honduras.
   TACA was founded by New Zealander Lowell Yerex, with the idea of having a TACA

franchise in each Latin-American country to provide air transportation services. After
financial troubles, only TACA International based out of San Salvador remained, and
­
which was sold to Howard Hughes in the mid-1940s and to the Kriette family of El
Salvador. In 1985 the maintenance department of the company moved to El Salvador and
created Aeroman to be able to operate locally. The company operated normally during the
next five years servicing TACA’s 7 planes but, in 1992, TACA signed a strategic alliance
with Copa Airlines of Panama and subsequently took control of AVIATECA of Guatemala,
LACSA of Costa Rica, and NICA of Nicaragua. This more than quadrupled TACA’s fleet
to 30 planes, and Aeroman needed to grow its service capacity. Aeroman built a new han-
gar in 1994 with the capacity of 4 bays (measurement of the capacity to service a plane
at the same time, where 1 bay = 1 plane), in order to service TACA’s fleet and leaving 25
percent of spare capacity to service third parties. By now Aeroman employed 700 highly
skilled workers. In general terms, the highest cost of an MRO is the salary of its employ-
ees (70 percent), and the higher the productivity of its workers the higher the chances of
getting new customers (since it will offer lower prices for its services).
The growth strategy worked and new clients were signed up for the maintenance service, tak-
ing advantage of the strategic geographic location of San Salvador’s airport and in particular
its proximity to the North American market. Despite the challenging market conditions after
September 11, by 2003 the 4 bays were fully utilized. To continue growing Aeroman decided
to find a partner with a world class reputation as an MRO. In 2006 Air Canada’s Technical
Services (ACTS) bought 80 percent of Aeroman for $44.7 million and planned to invest $110
million to expand capacity from 4 to 16 bays by 2016. Aeroman continued to add one addi-
tional bay per year, reaching 12 “production lines” by 2011. The results in El Salvador were
phenomenal with over 2,300 employees and revenues of around $120 million. In contrast
Canada’s operations of ACTS were struggling and Aeroman was put on sale. After a bidding
process, the Kriette family bought back control of the 80 percent of Aeroman.
Demand for Aeroman’s services kept rising and by 2014 all 12 bays were fully utilized. Once
again Aeroman has new plans for expansion. The expansion will break new ground globally,
since no single MRO worldwide has more than 12 bays in a single location. Besides the ad-
vantages of the proximity to the North American market Aeroman’s expansion has been
possible thanks to the well-functioning laws and regulations regarding the airport, the port
­
authority, the tax exceptions for free trade zones (the airport being one of them), the excellent
hand labor found in El Salvador, and a memorandum of understanding signed with govern-
ment authorities to keep the operating environment as is. Future growth will likely depend on
a reform of the Aeronautical Law that facilitates the entrance of new airlines and customers.

Since the end of the Civil War in 1992, El Salvador has advanced on both the social and political fronts. Despite
this progress and the recent reductions in income inequality, poverty remains high, largely as a result of low
economic growth. This Systematic Country Diagnostic argues that the challenge in El Salvador is not to iden­
tify the proximate constraints to growth, but how those constraints are inter-connected and what entry
points may help break what can be characterized as “vicious circles.”

The Systematic Country Diagnostic identifies three inter-connected vicious circles that hamper growth and
shared prosperity: (1) a cycle of low growth and violence; (2) a cycle of low growth and migration; and (3) a cycle
of low growth, savings and investment. Moreover, it also notes action on the identified entry points will
require a “big push” (rather than marginal interventions) that helps break the existing development dynamics.
But this Systematic Country Diagnostic also identifies some strengths that El Salvador could build on to
propel growth. Areas of opportunity include migration with the positive impact of diaspora on development,
geographic and cultural proximity to large export markets, particularly the U.S., and an industrial base that
can support an expansion of the tradable sector. At 20 percent of GDP, the manufacturing sector is large
by Latina American and by middle-income country standards.
