Introduction and Country Context	                                                              15
      Box 1.1  Historical Underpinnings of Costa Rica’s Social Compact

      Costa Rica’s social contract has its roots in the pattern of its colonial settlement and the
      structure of coffee production. Largely isolated, sparsely populated, and without precious
      metals to export, Costa Rica was a uniformly poor subsistence economy during the colo-
      nial period (1600–1800). The farmers of the Central Valley worked their own land on
      homesteads. Given the dominance of the farm household, Costa Rica has been described
      as a “rural democracy” during this period, with minimal social divisions and few class dis-
      tinctions, in contrast to neighboring countries.
      Following independence in 1821, coffee production grew rapidly and became the en-
      gine of Costa Rica’s economic growth. Coffee became a driver for the development of
      the country’s infrastructure, institutional organization, and productive structure.
      Roads were built to export coffee to Europe. Coffee production accelerated moving
      from communal land rights to the privatization of land, and the predominance of
      small landholdings and the notion of individual property rights contributed to low in-
      equality and shared wealth. Abundant land supply and labor scarcity contributed to
      high wages, contributing to a more equitable distribution of the income from coffee
      exports. As international demand increased, large exporters were forced to buy coffee
      from the smallholders, while in turn smallholders depended on large exporters for the
      beneficio—the hullery where coffee is washed, dried, and packaged for export—thereby
      creating a strong mutual interdependence. By the middle of the 19th century, this facili-
      tated the consolidation of the Coffee Pact—the implicit contract developed between
      the large exporters and smaller producers. In part, this pact was feasible because Costa
      Rica had a small territory with a small population concentrated in the Central Valley,
      where all faced the same adversities and risks. The implicit contract was a social mech-
      anism for dealing with these risks and overcoming the shortcomings of small size.
      The social relationships implicit in the Coffee Pact gradually led to the emergence of a na-
      tional egalitarian ideology that validated the participation of small producers and the
      landless workers not only in the distribution of the economy’s product but also in the po-
      litical arena. This led to Costa Rica’s version of the liberal state, in which the interests of
      different sectors could be democratically expressed, rules were universally applicable, and
      institutions and legal codes promoted the growth of economic activity and a democratic
      society. Liberal governments created a legal framework that protected individual and pro­
      perty rights, guaranteed market freedom, and placed multiple limits and counterbalances
      on power.
      This egalitarian ideology provided the underpinnings for Costa Rica’s notable Welfare
      State. In 1941, President Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia created the social security sys-
      tem (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, CCSS) to provide public health services, which

   have become universal since then. In 1943, a Labor Code was enacted and an article on
   social rights (garantías sociales) was written into the Constitution of 1949. The social
   rights included health, housing, social assistance, public services, taxes, and minimum
   wages, among others.

   Box 1.2  Costa Rica’s Celebrated Green Trademark

   Costa Rica takes up only 0.03 percent of the earth’s surface but is considered to be one of
   the 20 countries with the greatest biodiversity in the world, with 52 percent covered by
   forests and 26 percent in protected areas. This was not always the case. Although more
   than half of the country was covered by forest in 1950, deforestation had stripped this to
   just 26 percent by 1983 under the pressures of a growing population and massive conver-
   sion of forest to pasture, underpinned by ­policies that supported cattle ranching and agri-
   cultural development.
   Green Framework and Payments for Environmental Services. Recognizing the potential
   economic and global value of the forests and the risks to environmental degradation of
   rapid deforestation, several framework laws established the basic principles of Costa Rica’s
   “Green Trademark” aimed at rehabilitating wooded lands and setting aside vast areas of
   land as protected areas. It took years of policy debate and consensus building to develop
   a national approach of paying for environmental services—which now takes the form of
   the world-renowned Payments for Environmental Services (PES) program. This program
   builds on a long chain of earlier legislation that made the costs of reforestation tax de-
   ductible (Forest Law No. 4475 of 1969), established reforestation as a legal imperative
   (Forest Law No. 6184 of 1977), and established fiscal incentives through the creation of
   certificates that rewarded landowners for reforestation and allowed for significant forest
   authority intervention in the use of forest resources (Forest Laws No. 7032 of 1986 and
   7174 of 1990).
   The PES was formally established in 1995 when the government adopted Forest Law
   No. 7575. This law established a framework for payments to landowners for these eco-
   system services, and established the National Fund for Forestry Financing (Fondo
   Nacional de Financiamiento Forestal, FONAFIFO), to manage the PES and established
   a new certificate for forest conservation to reward landholders for their ecosystem ser-
   vices. Besides the 1995 Forest Law, the government enacted other environmentally re-
   lated laws: (i) the 1995 Environment Law No. 7554, which mandates a “balanced and
   ecologically driven environment for all”; (ii) the 1996 Forest Law No. 7575, which man-
   dates “rational use” of all natural resources and prohibits land cover change in forests;
   and (iii) the 1998 Biodiversity Law, which promotes the conservation and “rational use”
   of biodiversity resources and includes measures to conserve, protect, and sustainably
   exploit biological resources to ensure quality of life for future generations and the sur-
   vival of natural heritage. Subsequently, the Fiscal Simplification and Efficiency Law No.

  de Áreas de Conservación, SINAC) was created in 1994 to organize the country into 11
  large conservation areas, most of which are based around a major national park, to avoid a
  situation in which the protected areas would serve as isolated “green islands” in an other-
  wise improperly managed landscape. SINAC oversees over 160 protected areas, of which
  26 are designated national parks. Other areas are designated wildlife refuges, biological re-
  serves, national monuments, forest reserves, national wetlands, and protected zones.
  Carbon Neutrality. In May 2007, the Costa Rican government announced its intention to
  become 100 percent carbon neutral by 2021. Efforts are underway to begin offsetting all of
  the country’s carbon dioxide emissions using a wide range of budgetary, legal, and finan-
  cial incentives including measures to promote biofuels, hybrid vehicles, and clean energy.
  Another key component of the national strategy will be a “C-Neutral” label to certify
  that tourism and certain industrial practices mitigate all of the carbon dioxide they emit.
  Under the new certification system, tourists and businesses would be charged a voluntary
  “tax” to offset their carbon emissions, with one ton of carbon valued at US$10. The funds
  would be used for conservation, reforestation, and research in protected areas.

2. Poverty and Shared Prosperity
Poverty rates in Costa Rica are among the lowest in Latin America and the Caribbean, and
the middle class is the predominant group. Nonetheless, poverty increased and then stagnated
during and after the global crisis. The patterns of poverty show an uneven level of develop­
ment in the country, with the Central region being more prosperous relative to the peripheral
regions. Moreover, income inequality is rising, in contrast with the historical decline observed
in most countries in Latin America. Consequently, inequality offset the poverty-reducing im­
pact of growth in the late 2000s, with poverty rising instead of declining despite economic
growth.

    Box 2.1  How Have Methodological Changes Affected Poverty Measures
    in Costa Rica?

    The analysis of trends in poverty and inequality over time must be treated with some
    caution due to changes in methodologies used both for the collection of household survey
    data and for the calculation of poverty lines in Costa Rica.
    Two household surveys are used to measure poverty from 1989 to 2014, but they do not
    allow for comparisons on poverty rates. The surveys are Encuesta de Hogares de Propósitos
    Múltiples (EHPM) up to 2009 and the Encuesta Nacional de Hogares (ENAHO) from 2010
    to 2014. Several improvements in the methodology to estimate household incomes were
    introduced in the ENAHO. For example, the new questionnaire includes more and better
    questions on labor and non-labor income; the consumption basket was revised using the
    consumption patterns found in the 2004 National Income and Expenditure Survey; and
    there were methodological changes in how to adjust for under-declaration of incomes and
    the imputation of labor income.

  Costa Rica uses two income-based poverty lines, one for extreme poverty and another for
  overall poverty. The extreme, or “food,” poverty line is the value of the basic food basket
  required for an individual to meet the minimum caloric intake. The overall poverty line
  considers other basic resources beyond food.
  A methodological change in calculating the poverty line was also introduced with the
  ENAHO. Before 2010, both components of the poverty line were adjusted using the food
  consumer price index (CPI). This was likely to have resulted in overestimation of poverty
  when food prices were rising faster than overall prices, as happened in 2007–2009. In 2009,
  for example, the poverty rate would have been 18.7 percent, about three percentage points
  lower, if the non-food component of the poverty line had been updated using the general
  CPI (Figure B2.1.1). Since 2010, the official poverty line is adjusted using the food CPI for
  the food component of the poverty line and the non-food CPI for the non-food part.
  Comparing Costa Rica’s poverty rates with those of other countries presents a series of
  challenges, but harmonized survey data are available for that purpose from the Socio-
  Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC). The harmoniza-
  tion was developed by the Center for Distributional Labor and Social Studies (CEDLAS)
  at the University of La Plata, Argentina, and the World Bank. The harmonized survey
  data allow for cross-country comparability of poverty and inequality measures. However,
  per capita income and poverty lines from SEDLAC differ from official estimates. Extreme
  poor are individuals with a harmonized per capita income lower than US$2.50 a day,
  while poor are individuals with a harmonized per capita income lower than US$4 a day
  (2005 PPP). International comparable data from SEDLAC are available only up to 2012.

   Disadvantaged Minority

   Costa Rica’s indigenous population is small, but occupies a vast share of the land. In the Latin
   American region as a whole, indigenous people make up about seven percent of the total
   population (over 36.6 million people). In comparison, in Costa Rica they represent 2.4 percent
   of the population (104,143 indigenous people). As such, Costa Rica, along with El Salvador, is
   the country with the smallest proportion of indigenous people in the entire region. In terms of
   land, legally established indigenous territories cover about seven percent of the Costa Rican
   territory (about 350 thousand hectares), but 91 percent of the indigenous population is
   concentrated in three cantons—Talamanca, Buenos Aires, and Hojancha (figure B2.2.1).
   In the first decade of the 2000s, the indigenous population experienced a similar demo-
   graphic transition as the rest of the Costa Rican population, with a falling share of chil-
   dren and a growing share of elderly adults. The dependency rate fell from 108 percent in

  sulted from a decline in fertility rates, from 9.6 to two between 2000 and 2011, together
  with an increase in the share of elderly adults, from four percent to 8.8 percent. Even if in-
  digenous households are still larger than non-­  indigenous (3.6 versus 3.4 people per house-
  hold) these differences have been falling over time.
  Historically, indigenous populations have had lower access to basic services than the non-­
  indigenous. Despite a broad coverage of basic services to most of the population of Costa Rica,
  indigenous people still lag behind in access to electricity, water supply, and sewage. According
  to the 2011 Census, 80 percent of indigenous households had an electricity connection,
  against 99 percent of non-indigenous. Still, compared to other indigenous populations in
  LAC, access to electricity is higher than in Colombia (58 percent), El Salvador (62 percent),
  Nicaragua (50 ­                          percent). As for access to clean water, 31 percent of the

  indigenous population had no access to sewage (public or private), against four percent of
  non-​indigenous. And only 67 percent had access to piped water, against 94 percent of non-­
  indigenous (­ figure B2.2.2). However, these indicators have improved significantly since 2000,
  as the 2000 Census reported that only 53 percent of households had access to clean water,
  50 percent had access to some form of sewage, and 67 percent had electricity. In addition the
  share of households living in overcrowded conditions fell from 30 percent to 11 percent.
  Human capital accumulation and income generating opportunities are also lower for in-
  digenous populations. Indigenous people report lower educational attainment than non-­
  indigenous: average years of education among the indigenous is 6.1, against 7.7 for
  non-indigenous (although this shows progress from the 3.9 years on average in 2000).

   Illiteracy is at 7.7 among indigenous and 2.2 among non-indigenous, and attendance to
   formal education among people 5–24 years old is 64.9 against 71.7 for non-indigenous.
   This translates into lower employment and income opportunities among the indigenous,

Note: Poor are individuals with a per capita income lower than $4 a day (2005 US$ Purchasing Parity Power per day). Vulnerable are those
living with a per capita income between US$4 and US$10 a day. Middle class is defined as the proportion of individuals with an income
between US$10 and US$50 a day. Rich are those with an income higher than US$50 a day. Regional estimates are population-weighted
averages of country-specific estimates for Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. SEDLAC international comparable data is available only up

unavailable. Due to comparability issues, Costa Rica estimates come from 2010–2012 surveys in panel b. International comparable SEDLAC

Costa Rica’s inequality trends over the last two decades present a dilemma. The widening income
gap between the top and bottom quintiles of the population reflects changes in the labor market
and a mismatch between the patterns of growth versus the skills profile of the workforce. With
weak educational outcomes, the Costa Rican labor force is not well adapted to a labor market
that increasingly demands high skills, and unemployment has increased among the poor and low-
skilled workers, particularly since the global crisis. The earnings gaps between rich and poor, and
between the skilled and unskilled, have widened. Furthermore, despite Costa Rica’s ambitious So­
cial Compact, taxes and transfers have not proven to be effective in redistributing income to com­
pensate for these disparities.

  Box 3.1  Female Household Heads and Immigrants Face a Tough
  Labor Market

  In the last two decades, the Costa Rican population has seen a significant change in the
  composition of households, with an important increase in the share of households headed
  by women. Between 1990 and 2013, the share of households headed by women doubled
  from 18 percent to 36 percent. According to some studies, this increase implied a higher
  female participation in the labor market, especially among women who are low skilled
  and more likely to live in poverty. Indeed, the participation of female household heads in
  the labor force is much higher than the average female participation, although it is espe-
  cially high among non-poor household heads (figure B3.1.1a).

    Poor women who are heads-of-household experience particularly high unemployment
    rates. Female heads-of-household who are poor, and in particular single mothers, have an
    unemployment rate of over twice the average for women (figure B3.1.1b). Given that these
    women are more likely to have low skills, their employment opportunities are fewer, and
    as a result they experience higher unemployment.
    Immigrant women have even higher unemployment rates. Immigrants, particularly from
    Nicaragua, represent a large share of the labor force in Costa Rica, in particular in low-
    skilled employment. As shown in figure B3.1.2, women born in Nicaragua and other
    Central American countries have an unemployment rate around twice the average for
    women, whereas for men the rate is below average.

   Parental education is defined as the average education level of all adults 18 years and older in the household. A “low” level corresponds to an
  average of less than primary; “medium” corresponds to complete primary and incomplete secondary; and “high” corresponds to complete
  secondary and above.

   Knowledge gap 3.1  Why Are So Many Kids Dropping Out of School in
   Costa Rica?

   The skill-biased development that Costa Rica has experienced has raised returns to
   education, particularly secondary and tertiary. Given a large secondary school network in
   the country and universal primary completion, it is therefore surprising that more than
   half of the children who finish primary fail to complete secondary education. Although
   some general factors are known (see figure K3.1.1), such as lack of motivation, distance
   (in rural areas), and gender bias, the specific factors that push children out of school are
   still unknown, as are the critical ages at which early signs of dropout can be detected.

                 Knowledge gap 3.2  Are Reservation Wages High in Costa Rica?

                 The increase in unemployment rates, especially among poor workers, and the marginal
                 changes in self-employment, a proxy for informal employment, is a puzzling finding. Most
                 LAC countries respond to a decrease of jobs in the formal sector with a surge in informal
                 employment, in the absence of a safety net that enables workers to look for other formal jobs.
                 In Costa Rica, however, this did not happen, even if there is no clear evidence that the social
                 safety net provides sufficient income support to those who are unemployed. Thus, the ques-
                 tion arises of how high reservation wages are in Costa Rica, in a context of high average wages
                 and a high cost of living relative to other countries in the region.a

   Box 3.2  Nicaraguan Workers in Costa Rica Do Not Appear to Drive
   Down Native Workers’ Wages

   Immigrants, particularly from Nicaragua, represent a large share of the labor force in
   Costa Rica, in particular in low-skilled employment. In 2013, over 10 percent of those
   employed in Costa Rica were foreign-born, of which eight percent were Nicaraguan.
   Nicaraguan immigrants in Costa Rica are largely unskilled: less than 20 percent com-
   pleted secondary school while over a third (35 percent) did not complete primary
   school.a However, Costa Ricans also have low schooling on average—in fact, 46 percent
   of both Nicaraguan and native-born adults finished primary school but did not complete
   secondary. This significant overlap in educational attainment suggests the potential for
   competition between these two groups for low- or unskilled jobs. This can be particularly
   true in specific sectors and specific parts of the country due to the non-random disper-
   sion patterns of immigrants. Four sectors of employment—agriculture, domestic service,
   commerce and hotels/restaurants, and construction—account for 75 percent of low-
   skilled immigrant employment in 2013. For context, these same four sectors accounted
   for only 59 percent of low-skilled native-born employment. In some parts of the country,
   foreign-born workers account for significant shares of workers in these four sectors,
   including over 20 percent of all workers in domestic services and construction in Huetar
   Norte and the Central regions.
   The presence of immigrant workers has little bearing on the wages of low-skilled Costa
   Rican workers—and is actually correlated with higher wages among higher-skilled Costa
   Ricans. Exploiting the sectoral and geographical differences in immigrant employment in
   Costa Rica, log wage regressions reveal positive correlations between native wages and the
   proportion of ­foreign-born workers in the same employment category as natives, where
   the employment category is defined at the region and sector level. This suggests positive
   complementarities between immigrant labor and skilled native labor. This is a sizeable
   relationship, with native workers who completed secondary receiving a wage premium of
   22 percent at the average share of immigrants for this group (8.3 percent).b At the same
   time, no statistically significant relationship is evident between unskilled native workers
   and immigrants—suggesting that wages of native workers are not being lowered by
   immigrant labor. Similar analysis found no evidence of increased unemployment among
   native labor in regions with more immigrants.

   a. These education rates are calculated for the adult population 20 and above using the 2011 Costa Rica Census.
   b. Note that this is not necessarily a causal relationship—for example, it could be that immigrant workers are more likely to migrate
   to higher-paying regions and/or work in higher-wage sectors resulting in a higher share of immigrant workers in these higher-paying
   sectors.

Note: All Gini are computed using 2009, except for Mexico and Costa Rica, which is 2010. The figure shows the Gini coefficient for different
income definitions. Market Income is the income received before any fiscal intervention. Net Market Income subtracts direct income and
payroll taxes to Market Income. Disposable Income is Net Market Income plus direct transfers. Post-Fiscal Income adds indirect subsidies
and subtracts taxes from disposable income. Final Income is Post-Fiscal Income plus in-kind public transfers on health and education
(World Bank 2014e).

   The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and
4. 
   Its Constraints
Costa Rica’s small and open economy has achieved solid growth with an outward-oriented model
combined with macroeconomic and political stability. This model has encouraged export diversifi­
cation towards higher value-added sectors and increasing labor productivity. However, the economy
is showing signs of built-up vulnerabilities, resulting in weak job creation and loss of competitive­
ness. How can Costa Rica achieve higher levels of growth? Evidence points to three priority areas:
education & skills, infrastructure, and government effectiveness and regulatory quality.

  Costa Rica has seen a significant contraction in employment in the construction, manu-

  emerged during the global crisis for all three sectors, compounded by the Roya coffee rust
  fungus and weather factors in agriculture. However, the contraction in jobs has persisted,
  which is particularly worrisome given that these sectors employ a higher share of the poor
  and lower-skilled workers—and given the sustained rise in unemployment. What are the
  structural factors in these sectors that are causing this sustained contraction?

   Box 4.1  Intel and Development of the High-Tech Sector in Costa Rica

   In 1996, Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker, announced plans for the
   establishment of its US$300 million semiconductor assembly and test plant in Costa
   Rica. The country’s economic and political stability, its proximity to the United States,
   and its pro-business environment were all important. Some bottlenecks in Costa Rica’s
   investment climate raised some concerns, however, such as inadequate supply of skilled
   labor, infrastructure and logistics (airport upgrades), tax incentives, and improvements
   in permits and construction processes.a The country’s tertiary educational system was
   strengthened with the introduction of a series of programs to increase both the
   number of graduates with engineering and technical degrees and the proficiency of the
   graduates.b The stock of graduates from engineering programs in Costa Rica reportedly
   increased by almost 40 percent between 2002 and 2011.c CINDE also worked with
   existing investors to “back link” potential suppliers—both local, through the Costa
   Rica PROVEE program, and foreign—of products and services that transcended
   sectors, identifying commonalities between medical devices and electronics in their
   procurement of clean room services, plastics, and metal mechanics.d
   Intel contributed to the development of the high-tech sector through three channels: (i) it
   had a direct impact on employment, investment, trade, output, and the development of
   the technology cluster; (ii) it served as a catalyst for repositioning Costa Rica as an attrac-
   tive investment location, through its impact on the country’s technical education, incen-
   tives laws and regulations, and infrastructure;e and (iii) it increased the confidence of
   foreign investors through the demonstration effect. Intel’s decision to invest in Costa Rica
   gave a “signaling effect” that helped solidify the country’s emergence as an attractive desti-
   nation for FDI in high-tech manufacturing. Companies that followed Intel in establishing
   manufacturing and global service operations in Costa Rica included Abbott Laboratories
   (now Hospira), Procter & Gamble (P&G), and Hewlett Packard.
   In April 2014, Intel announced its decision to close its Costa Rican microchip assembly fac-
   tory and move its assembly operations to China, Malaysia, and Vietnam. While all micro-
   chip assembly operations will move to Asia, Intel will keep its engineering and design
   departments and its global service center in Costa Rica, a move that showcases Costa Rica’s
   competitiveness in high value-­  added segments. It is unclear what the repercussions will be
   of Intel’s decision to leave because Costa Rica’s high-tech exports have become increasingly
   diversified. As it has in the past, Costa Rica will need to strategically position itself and capi-
   talize on its strengths to continue to attract FDI and increase job creation.

   Box 4.2  Corporate Governance of State-Owned Electric Utility ICE

   The corporate governance of state-owned electric utility ICE was considered poor when
   evaluated in 2009 against five key components of corporate governance (legal soundness,
   board and CEO competitiveness, professional management, performance orientation, and
   transparency and disclosure). ICE ranked 10th in the aggregated “corporate governance
   index” when compared to a peer group of 13 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) operating in
   the Latin American region. ICE ranked 11th in the group, in terms of performance orienta-
   tion (process of setting objectives, the instruments used to set objectives and their en-
   forcement, and the authority that conducts the assessments). This is indeed one of the
   areas where ICE seems to be weak.

   Sustainability of Costa Rica’s
5. 
   Development Model
The sustainability of its development model is at risk due to the deterioration of fiscal balances, tensions
in the Social Compact, and various threats to the Green Trademark. The fiscal situation stands out as
one of the most pressing development challenges facing Costa Rica. The recent deterioration stems from
a combination of countercyclical measures undertaken during the crisis and structural forces. Without
fiscal consolidation, the deficit could push public debt to unsustainable levels and threaten the country’s
social and economic gains. Indeed, fiscal pressures, as well as rising inequality and increasing dissatis­
faction with social services, all combine to create tensions in the Social Compact. Costa Rica’s leader­
ship in environmental conservation faces the challenge of growing pressures on the use of resources and
of urbanization. Changing economic incentives threaten the gains in reforestation, and the use of
agro-chemicals is worrisome. Urbanization has increased energy use and air and water pollution, and
the country has not developed a long-term plan to protect the environment from these threats. Finally,
the current political landscape and institutional framework add an additional layer of complexity for
approving and implementing key reforms needed to address these emerging challenges.

            Knowledge gap 5.1  How Can Costa Rica Improve the Effectiveness
            and Coordination of its Social Programs?

            Social policy is fragmented across numerous institutions in Costa Rica, many of them
            autonomous agencies. Consequently, more than two dozen social programs operate in
            parallel, often with similar target groups. What is the mapping of social programs by
            agency, objectives, coverage, and performance? How can these duplications (and resulting
            gaps in coverage for some population groups) be reduced, either through consolidation of
            programs, integration of Social Registries (such as the SIPO, operated by IMAS, and the
            SINIRUBE [National System of Registration of Beneficiaries], operated by FODESAF), or
            more ambitious institutional consolidation? This is the topic of a new non-lending techni-
            cal assistance being requested by the Government of Costa Rica.

   Knowledge gap 5.2  How Can Costa Rica Link Sustainable Production
   and Rural Landscapes to its Conservation Model?

   Costa Rica’s well-known Green Trademark has been centered on a conservation approach,
   supported by public sector economic incentives for conservation and reforestation (the
   PES mechanism) and eco-tourism resources. Fiscal and economic pressures, as well as
   scope, bring into question the sustainability of that model. How can Costa Rica adapt to
   the next generation of the green agenda, going beyond conservation and nature protection
   towards innovative ways for mainstreaming conservation into productive landscapes,
   and beyond carbon neutrality towards resilience? Further work under the programmatic
   NLTA on Green and Inclusive Growth seeks to bring further evidence to this important
   policy question.

   each step of the process. Rice subsidies (in the form of guaranteed prices), amount to 45
   percent of the domestic price, higher than in the United States or the European Union
   (EU). Ironically, the policies that protect rice prices under a banner of food security and
   equity have brought them well above international prices, benefiting a handful of large
   producers and harming the budget of the poor.
   The Corporación Arrocera Nacional (CONARROZ), created in 2002, has been effective in
   protecting producers from international price shocks, but not in improving local produc-
   tion conditions. CONARROZ gathers a very diverse set of rice producers and processors,
   most of them very small producers. Its lobbying efforts are presented as a way of defend-
   ing these small producers and protecting jobs in the agricultural sector. However, most
   of the rice produced in Costa Rica (about 80 percent) comes from a minority of large
   producers and processors, who also benefit from tariff-free import quotas (assigned
   proportionally to their processing capacity). Thus, they can purchase rice at international
   market prices, and sell the processed rice domestically with a high profit. It is estimated
   that from 1995 to 2005, consumers transferred US$396 million to rice producers, which
   for the poorest households represents seven to eight percent of their per capita income.
   Price controls have done little to improve productivity among rice producers but have
   created incentives to maintain the status quo. Although consumer prices have continu-
   ously increased since 2008, producer prices have remained flat or decreased, mostly due to
   low quality. The average yield per hectare has gone down from 4.8 tons in 1999/2000 to
   3.39 tons in 2011/2012. As a result, most domestic rice producers, particularly the smaller
   ones, would not be profitable at international prices, and thus have a strong interest to
   maintain the status quo.

   and databases) for the recording, control, and generation of different pieces of information.
   The information generated by these independent IT tools needs to be aggregated and
   reconciled. In a highly decentralized environment, having excessive manual controls is not
   effective and has consequences in terms of added transaction costs and difficulties in
   producing information that could assist with service delivery.
   The preparation of financial statements provides a good example of the challenges that
   CCSS faces to adequately monitor the use of its resources. Information from over 20 IT
   systems and databases is manually collected and aggregated Because these systems and
   databases are not linked, the CCSS has developed burdensome and manual reconciliations
   across the organization, as well as additional manual controls, in order to ensure that
   errors are prevented or detected in a timely manner. The lack of an integrated IT platform
   does not allow the timely and systematic recording of financial and accounting transac-
   tions. While these manual and compensating controls allow for the timely preparation of
   budgetary reports and financial statements (including budget monitoring, reconciliations
   of accounts, analyses of fluctuations, aging of accounts, and manual and supervisory
   reviews), given the nature of the CCSS more meaningful financial information—such as
   financial information by service delivery units or by cost centers—might be needed to
   support decision-making and monitoring financial performance.

   Various factors are named as obstacles to implementation of public infrastructure and
   social projects in the various line ministries, such as cumbersome processes in the Public
   Procurement Law, deficiencies in the environmental regulatory framework, cumbersome
   checks and reviews by the Contraloria, and deficiencies in the expropriations law. Further
   evidence on the trajectory of investment projects—and the time delays and costs of each
   step along the way—would help inform the debate about how to reduce the “chokes and

Costa Rica stands out for being among the most politically stable, progressive, prosperous, and environmentally
conscious nations in the Latin America and the Caribbean region. Its development model has brought impor-
tant economic, social, and environmental dividends, with sustained growth, upward mobility for a large
share of the population, important gains in social indicators, and significant achievements in reforestation
and conservation. However, there are a number of development challenges that need to be addressed to
maintain the country’s successful development path. This Systematic Country Diagnostic takes stock of
    poverty, inequality, and growth trends, addressing the following questions:
the ­

•	   To what extent has the Costa Rican development model been inclusive?
•	   What has driven growth in Costa Rica in recent years, and what are the bottlenecks that need to be
     addressed?
•	   How sustainable is the development model of Costa Rica economically, socially, and environmentally?
