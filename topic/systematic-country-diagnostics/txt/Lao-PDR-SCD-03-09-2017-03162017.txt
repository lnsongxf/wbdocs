mainly driven by a growing use of
natural resources, gradual opening up, and integration in the region.
Still, some development outcomes have fallen short of potential. The increase in
incomes for most of the population was not commensurate to the GDP growth. This is due to
growth being driven by natural resources where job creation was limited, stagnant
productivity in agriculture where most of the labor force continues to be engaged, and the

Continued environmental degradation will hurt livelihoods and undermine growth
prospects, and together with climate change will increase the already high risks from natural
disasters. If any of these risks materialize, the poor are likely to be most affected as they have
the least options to mitigate risks.
Looking ahead, the report identifies three pathways through which the country can
achieve more inclusive growth. For resource-rich economies like Lao PDR, it is very
important to advance integration, get a fair share of resource rents, and convert these into
human and physical assets. To accomplish this, progress will be needed on the three
pathways: (a) sustainable and efficient management of natural resources, (b) unlocking the
potential in non-resource sectors, and (c) building the assets of the people to be able to take
on increased opportunities as well as mitigate risks and protect gains. With resource rents
making institutions more vulnerable to capture, the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD)
argues for strengthening key institutions as a cross-cutting theme, including the institutions
to manage macroeconomic volatility, strengthen accountability of service providers, and
ensure a level-playing field and promote competition.
The SCD identifies the constraints to the functioning of the three pathways and
prioritizes the interventions which are expected to have the biggest impact over the
twin goals. Agriculture growth is pro-poor and with productivity levels well below regional
peers the remaining potential is large. Strategic and environmentally responsible use of
natural resources is critical to growth as well as livelihoods. Furthermore, the 44 percent of
under-five-year-olds who were stunted in 2012 makes improving nutrition a top priority.
More and better education improves the productivity of farmers and prepares people for the
transition toward non-farm jobs which have been key drivers of poverty reduction. Risks in
the fiscal and financial sectors could undermine growth and lead to instability that will affect
delivery of public services and affect the vulnerable the most. Improving the trade and
business environment and investing in infrastructure have high pay-offs; however, benefits
will be lessened in case there is no progress on the top priorities. Putting in place a
strengthened disaster risk management (DRM) framework and a basic social protection
system would be important to sustain gains, but addressed on their own are likely to have
limited impact.

Executive summary
1.      Lao PDR has made important gains in development in recent decades. Incomes
rose, poverty declined, access to several key public services improved, and Lao PDR met a
number of its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). With an average growth rate of 7.8
percent per year over the last decade, it was the second-fastest-growing economy in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region and the 13th fastest-growing
economy globally. Today, Lao PDR is a lower-middle-income country with a GNI per capita
of US$1,740 in 2015. However, there is growing evidence of the importance for growth to be
shared more equitably and to be less vulnerable, including on environmental degradation.
The 8th National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP) 2016–2020 provides an
important opportunity to introduce polices that may put Lao PDR on a path that more
effectively reduces poverty and promotes shared prosperity in a sustainable manner and
prepares Lao PDR to graduate from Least Developed Country (LDC) status.

2.      Lao PDR’s asset endowments, geography, and economic and social legacies
have intertwined to shape a development experience of strong growth, limited
inclusion, and considerable risks to sustainability. This reflects relative abundance of
natural resources; landlocked and small size, ethnically diverse but part of a rapidly growing
region; and institutions that have not kept pace with the changes in the economy. This
reinforced the already low human development outcomes, including persistence of
malnutrition and teenage pregnancies; resulted in high environmental cost of economic
activity and vulnerability to shocks and disasters; and amplified the pattern of limited
inclusion and elevated risks to sustainability. More specifically:



                                                                                            i|Page
The World Bank Group                                 Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


  •   Lao PDR is rich in natural resources. Its water resources represent a hydropower
      potential of up to 25,000 MW. They are rich in biodiversity and provide almost half of
      the animal protein consumption of the population. The forest cover declined to
      around 40 percent in 2010 (from 47 percent in 1995), but is still among the highest
      in the region. The value of minerals’ deposits is likely to be substantial.

  •   Lao PDR is the only landlocked, the smallest, and the most sparsely populated
      country in Southeast Asia. While the rapid growth in the region fueled the demand
      for Lao PDR’s natural resources, the difficult geography and low levels of human and
      physical capital lowered the country’s competitiveness outside the few resource
      sectors and also complicated the provision of public services, especially in remote and
      rural areas where a large part of the 49 non-Lao ethnic groups live.

  •   While embracing market economy concepts, Lao PDR’s governance
      arrangements to support the transition have been evolving very gradually. The
      arrangements provide for stability; however, rule of law is weak, the appetite to
      improve the regulatory quality is subdued, and the ability to control corruption is
      constrained, which also has consequences for creating a dynamic private sector.

  •   Human development outcomes have been improving slowly. The population of
      6.5 million is rapidly increasing, but only one-third of the workforce has secondary
      education while over 30 percent of second graders were unable to read a single word
      in 2012. Malnutrition, at 44 percent in 2012, has remained persistently high with
      irreversible effects for the individuals affected and the society. The country is an
      outlier on early marriages with 35 percent of girls aged 18 being married in 2012.
      This reduces economic potential, reinforces malnutrition, and increases health risks.
      Indicators are persistently worse for minority ethnic groups across all dimensions
      while a gender gap remains in education and health. About two-thirds of the poor in
      Lao PDR are ethnic minorities, even though they constitute a third of the population.

  •   Economic growth has come with a large environmental footprint. The rate of
      depletion of natural resources is more than double compared to countries at a similar
      level of development which may put into question the ability of resources to continue
      propelling growth and providing important environmental services. In addition, Lao
      PDR is vulnerable to natural disasters and ill-prepared to deal with climate change
      and the future structural transformation (urbanization, migration, pollution).

                           implies that the total capital stock per capita (the sum of natural, human, and
                           physical capital relative to the population) should not decline. In other words,
                           natural capital may decline in value as long as one or more of the other forms
                           of capital increase so as to keep to total value at least as high.1

3.    This SCD aims to identify interventions that would deliver sustained growth
and edge Lao PDR toward the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting
shared prosperity. The SCD seeks to answer three important questions to inform the
foundations of the proposed more inclusive and sustainable development path. These are:
(a) What is the nature of growth? (b) How inclusive is it? and (c) How sustainable is it?

What is the nature of growth?

4.      Lao PDR’s GDP growth has been driven by a growing use, and indeed depletion,
of natural resources. The mining sector

5.      Competitiveness outside of natural resources is low. Agriculture, where two-
thirds of the labor force is engaged, grew at 3.7 percent on average in the past decade, just
slightly faster than growth in hours worked and mainly driven by an increase in acreage

1 However, the substitutability of natural capital with other forms of capital is limited by the essential
environmental services they provide. An obvious example would be clean air. Another example may be a level
of ecologically intact forest that is essential to maintain valuable biodiversity.

rather than productivity. There are signs of greater commercialization and diversification
recently; however, subsistence rice farming continues to dominate. Manufacturing growth
was stagnant for most of the last decade. A few sectors emerged recently (parts and
components) which are better integrated in regional value chains, albeit from a low base and
largely confined to the special economic zones (SEZs). Non-tradables fared slightly better.
Investments in the power sector boosted construction, with growing public investment and
foreign direct investment (FDI) in real-estate adding later on. Services expanded, but remain
concentrated in traditional, low-value-added activities. Various measures of productivity
(output per worker, capital intensity, total factor productivity [TFP]) in Lao PDR are low
compared to countries at similar level of development and have not improved significantly.

6.      Being a small, landlocked economy, Lao PDR faces natural disadvantages,
further compounded by weak skills and technological readiness and limited
innovation and business sophistication. There are too few firms and the few which do
exist struggle to grow. High informality, limited skills, a burdensome business environment
that is discriminately enforced, and limited competition have prevented an emergence of a
vibrant private sector. Lao PDR producers have difficulties accessing foreign markets, partly
due to inability to meet quality and quantity standards, but also due to market restrictions.
The infrastructure stock is largely in line with what is expected from the level of
development; though a few critical upgrades are needed. Where good jobs are available,
firms complain about an inadequate workforce and few applicants. The 2014 Lao PDR
Development Report found that many workers lack foundational skills such as the ability to
read. This means workers struggle even in most basic jobs and teaching them more skills is
challenging.

7.      As a consequence of this

jobs were created, in services, they were mostly in low-value-added services. Manufacturing,
the main engine of transformation in other East Asia and Pacific (EAP) countries, added only
6,000 jobs between 2008 and 2013, keeping employment in the sector at around 220,000.

How inclusive is the growth?

8.     Between 2002/03 and 2012/13, absolute poverty, based on the national
poverty line, declined from 33.5 percent of the population to 23.2 percent. This was
driven by increasing human capital, access to land, and creation of off-farm jobs. For
example, the proportion of working-age adults with a secondary certificate increased from
26.7 percent to 35 percent, facilitating the transition to higher-paying wage jobs and also
allowing the few, more educated farmers to be more productive. Access to agriculture land
in rural areas increased by 26 percent and 400,000 non-farm jobs were created.

9.    Still, growth can be more inclusive. Given the high GDP growth rates, the pace of
poverty reduction was modest when compared to regional peers. Each percent increase in

                                                                                         v|Page

GDP per capita contributed to a 0.4 percent reduction in poverty in Lao PDR, compared to a
1.2 percent reduction in poverty in Cambodia and most regional and structural peers.
Furthermore, inequality widened, with the Gini coefficient increasing from 32.5 to 36.2, as
the gains for the bottom 40 percent were lower than for the rest of the population. Inequality
is still in the same range as Vietnam (Gini of 35.6 in 2012) and Indonesia (37.2 in 2013) but
higher than in Cambodia (28 in 2011).

10.    A large part of the population is at risk of falling into poverty due to frequent
shocks and the absence of a safety net and risk mitigation measures. Half of the poor
people in 2012/13 were not poor half a decade ago. Households in agriculture are twice
more likely than non-farm households to fall back into poverty due to their exposure to
shocks from farm produce price fluctuations, loss of land, and adverse weather. In addition,
with fragmented health financing programs and limited health insurance coverage, health
shocks and catastrophic out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures pose a significant risk. Low
financial inclusion and the absence of safety nets limit the ability of households to mitigate
risks.

11.     Non-Lao Tai ethnic groups have seen slower progress in poverty reduction and
are    lagging    in    most      human
development aspects. About two-thirds Figure 6: Poverty is higher among non-Lao Tai

even though they constitute a third of the
population in the country. Poverty rates
are highest among the MonKmer (42                 Lao Tai
percent) and Hmong (40 percent) at
nearly three times the incidence of
                                              MonKhmer
poverty among the majority Lao Tai

majority of working-age ethnic minorities     ChineTiber
(55 percent) have incomplete primary or

pregnancies, and school dropouts are the
highest among ethnic minorities, further dimming their prospects.

12.     Non-monetary dimensions of welfare which drive poverty reduction in the long
term are improving, but more slowly for the vulnerable, and also define gender gaps.
Malnutrition remains persistently high, mainly caused by poor dietary diversity (driven by
poor nutrition habits but also low education, especially among mothers) and lack of access
to improved water and sanitation. The proportion of stunted under-five-year-olds declined
by only 4 percentage points over a decade, from 48 percent in 2001 to 44 percent in 2012,2
while poverty declined by more than 8 percentage points. Consequently, Lao PDR failed to
meet the MDG on stunting even as it achieved the goal of halving extreme poverty. Access to
basic services is improving, but remains unequal and is often of poor quality. Almost half of
the bottom 40 percent had no toilet in 2012/13, compared to 18 percent without a toilet
among the top 60 percent. Secondary enrollment, at 54 percent, is low, but even much lower
among poor households (28 percent). Transport connectivity and proximity to schools and
health centers are also lower for the bottom 40 percent, while 15 percent of villages—the
most remote ones—do not have access to electricity. Household air pollution from unclean
cooking sources remains a major health concern, especially among the poor. Due to a culture
of early marriages, teenage pregnancies are high, which is both a cause and consequence of
high school dropout rates. This also contributes to high maternal mortality, which along with
low literacy among women is a defining feature of the gender gaps in the country.




2Two surveys in 2015 reported information on the nutrition status. While both sources suggest a reduction in
the stunting rates (according to one of the surveys to 35 percent), direct comparison is not possible.

How sustainable is the growth?

13.    Growing public debt, risks in the financial sector, and low buffers may test
macroeconomic stability. Under current policies the country is likely to return to high risk
of debt distress while systemic risks in the financial system are high. Existing buffers,
including capital levels in large banks, government deposits, and foreign exchange reserves,
are insufficient to be able to absorb shocks. Macroeconomic instability can ignite inflation,
lower living standards, and hurt public services delivery.

14.     The rapid rate of depletion of Lao PDR’s natural resources puts into question
the sustainability of the development path. The rate of natural resource depletion is much
faster than in lower-middle-income countries, including in Vietnam and in Cambodia, as well
as in structural peers. Deforestation rates were estimated to be above 1 percent per year
until recently. Excessive use of natural resources can stall the main engine of growth at a
time when the competitiveness of the non-resource sector is yet to improve. These risks are
further exacerbated by the impact of climate change which is increasing the frequency and
severity of natural disasters. Continued environmental degradation will hurt livelihoods and
create economic costs. The poor will be most affected as they have the least options to
mitigate risks.

Toward an agenda for the twin goals

15.     For Lao PDR, accelerating progress toward the twin goals of ending extreme
poverty and boosting shared prosperity means maintaining the current robust growth
rates while increasing inclusiveness and lowering vulnerability. Importantly, this will
be a greener and more resilient growth pattern. The SCD employs a framework with three
main pathways toward the twin goals, each addressing weaknesses identified in the
diagnostics. Sustainably and efficiently managing the country’s natural resources, including
collecting and managing resource rents, (Pathway 1) is critical to delivering strong growth
and securing resources to build Lao PDR’s endowments of human and physical capital.
Pathway 2 focuses on unlocking opportunities in the non-resource sectors to increase
farmers’ incomes and create non-farm jobs, while Pathway 3 emphasizes improvements in
human capital required to increase the ability of people to take on these opportunities.
Measures to address the high vulnerability of people in Lao PDR further inform Pathway 3.
The SCD also highlights the importance of strengthening institutions and governance—a
critical cross-cutting challenge that affects progress in each of the three areas above. The
pathways can be easily mapped to the three main outcomes of the 8th NSEDP.

Pathway 1: Sustainable and efficient management of natural resources

16.     With its relative abundance of natural resources compared to other assets, Lao
PDR’s growth prospects in the near future will be closely linked to the resource
sectors. While Lao PDR has used its resources to advance integration and support growth,
current practices may have contributed to excessive resource use which may undermine
future growth prospects. A more strategic and environmentally responsible use of natural
resources can ensure that the resources are used in a sustainable manner and that social and
environmental impacts are mitigated. The proposed stronger selectivity of hydropower and
mining investments is likely to lead to fewer investments but with higher economic and
social returns and with a noticeably smaller footprint with regard to land and water use.
Integrated Spatial Planning (ISP) can address competing demand on the country’s natural
resources. Such a planning process should take into account that in some cases conservation
is a more attractive option than exploitation, especially until institutions to manage natural
resources and rents are strengthened. Conservation can also open economic opportunities
in more environmentally friendly sectors, such as nature-based tourism and clean
agriculture. With improved management and protection of natural resources, Lao PDR will
be well on its way to a greener and more resilient growth path. Stricter standards and
strengthened monitoring and enforcement against pollution will also be important.

17.     Few sector-specific interventions need to be addressed as a priority. Reversing
the process of deforestation and forest degradation is important. This would include
stronger oversight arrangements over salvage logging and implementing the ban on illegal
timber trade,3 combating poaching and wildlife trafficking, and preventing illegal mining. In
parallel, a stronger capacity to manage forests and greater central-level management of
conservation and protection forests can help. An integrated approach to water management
would provide a more careful hydropower project selection process and identify operating
rules that avoid conflicts between facilities and across water users, including transboundary

3 The    Prime Minister Order No.15 from May 2016 is a good start and signals greater willingness to address this
issue.

                                                                                                    ix | P a g e

priorities. While it may reduce the pace of hydropower expansion, it will still allow for
sizeable growth and will better match the growth in installed capacity with infrastructure
improvements and demand. In mining, an immediate priority is to improve the management
of existing concessions (resolve overlapping land allocations and enforce regulations on
environmental and social impacts effectively). Next, putting in place a sound regulatory
framework, including assurance for finder’s right and simplified and transparent licensing,
can encourage entry of reputable and socially responsible investors.

18.     Lao PDR should also do more to share more widely the benefits from natural
resources use. The country did not always put its resources to their best possible use,
favoring in some cases short-term gains over long-term development; was able to convert
relatively little of the resource rents into government revenues; and didn’t always invest
these efficiently into human and physical capital. Revenue leakage and weak PFM prevented
the sharing of benefits across all population subgroups. Doing more in this area would be
critical to the successful functioning of the remaining two pathways.

Pathway 2: Unlocking the potential in non-resource sectors to create opportunities

19.     Meeting the goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity
will mean an accelerated structural transformation, including a more productive
agriculture and a vibrant private sector. Increasing productivity of agriculture is critical
to increase income of farmers, create jobs in agribusiness and agro-processing, reduce stress
on the environment, and enhance nutritional outcomes. This will require a shift from a focus
on rice self-sufficiency to competitiveness of rice-based farming systems and support to
clean, organic, and niche products. Expanding multipurpose irrigation, improving
availability of quality seeds and fertilizers and extension services, and increasing educational
attainment of farmers can facilitate this shift. Improved food value chains, through greater
availability of information, better rural roads and transport services, promotion of contract
farming, and improving access to finance, can accelerate commercialization and
diversification.

20.     A more productive private sector can create more and better jobs. This will
facilitate further structural transformation and help those already making the transition out
of primary agriculture but trapped in low productivity, often informal activities. Investing in
infrastructure (closing gaps, especially on upgrading corridors and constructing the
transmission level connections with potential electricity markets); adopting policies that
encourage competition and address barriers to the flow of goods and services; and making
it easier to do business (increasing transparency and predictability and streamlining
procedures) can improve competitiveness and allow the private sector to invest in emerging
business opportunities. Geography and some of the challenges outlined in the SCD may lower
the likelihood of a large-scale export-led industrialization seen in other EAP countries taking
place in Lao PDR. Still, tourism, electricity, agriculture, and labor markets offer opportunities
for greater integration even today. Over time, improved human and physical capital will
increase the areas in which Lao PDR would be able to participate in regional flows.

Pathway 3: Building the assets of people to be able to take on these opportunities and to
mitigate risks and protect gains

21.    Households exit poverty by accumulating human capital and physical assets.
This opens up opportunities for transition into better-paid jobs—be it domestically or
through migration—but also improves the prospects for those that remain in agriculture.
Importantly, building household assets should be tailored to address specific challenges in
Lao PDR. In particular, investments should also take into account the additional constraints
faced by minority ethnic groups who primarily lag in human capital and access to services
that has both limited their economic opportunities and their ability to make the best out of
opportunities available to them, thus trapping them in a vicious circle of poverty.

22.     Building skills begins with investing and ensuring good nutrition status in the
early years of life (from pre-conception through a child’s entry into primary school at
age 6) during which there is a limited window to maximize on each individual’s ability
to reach his or her full potential. Such investments includes reproductive, maternal, and
child health services; nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive services; parenting education
and safe, nurturing, stimulating home environments; and early childhood education. While
aspiring for universal coverage with water and sanitation facilities, interventions should
prioritize high-stunting, low-access areas as well as developing an information system on
service coverage and functionality. Beyond improved nutrition, building skills will also
require increasing the quantity and quality of education people receive, as well as improved
access to and quality of health services, including preventive and primary care services that
cater to emerging and noncommunicable diseases. Aiming for improved access to basic
infrastructure services will improve opportunities. More investment in local roads and
improved road maintenance with strengthened disaster resilience can ensure universal
year-round road access. Completing electrification will require innovative and low-cost
options for grid extension and scaling-up of off-grid electrification. Dealing with unexploded
ordnances (UXOs) will increase economic opportunities and lower risks to life.

23.     Building resilience and mitigating risks will be important for ensuring the
sustainability of poverty reduction going forward. Key areas include (a) increasing
resilience to disaster risks and climate change, especially in agriculture since farming
households are mostly exposed to unpredictable weather hazards; (b) introducing elements
of a basic social safety net system—especially in health insurance; and (c) deepening
financial inclusion to expand options available for households to cope with shocks.

24.     Coordinated and targeted interventions based on realistic projections of future
demand for services will be most effective. Importantly, addressing key human
development weaknesses (such as poor child nutrition and development in early years)
requires a multisector approach involving interventions in a number of priority areas.
Furthermore, the concentration of poor outcomes within ethnic groups raises the
importance of targeted approaches and extensive outreach to generate demand for services.
Given the relatively higher dependence of non-Lao Tai ethnic groups on agriculture and
natural resources, they are expected to benefit from efforts to improve the productivity and
resilience in these areas. However, additional efforts will be needed, including efforts to

                                                                                   xi | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                   Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


lower language barriers (for example, recruiting health and education professionals from
non-majority ethnic groups or providing services in local languages), improve availability
and quality of services and activities to nudge behavior, and remove social and cultural
barriers. Finally, policies and interventions should be driven by the insight that, over the long
term, migration will likely be a pathway to economic integration for a big part of the
population, especially the ones in remote and rural areas where economic opportunities will
continue to remain limited while the ability to deliver public services will be constrained.

Cross-cutting theme: Strengthening institutions

25.    Strengthened institutions will be critical for realizing opportunities through
each of the three pathways. While ‘institutions’ is a much-used term, the experience of
developed, resource-rich countries points to the most important ones. It is the institutions
that (a) ensure stable public finances and dampen volatility; (b) increase accountability of
service providers; and (c) ensure a level-playing field and promote competition.

26.     Stronger institutions can reduce macroeconomic fragility. Healthier fiscal
accounts underpinned by stronger tax base and more efficient public expenditures can
stabilize public debt (as percent of GDP). Strong corporate governance of Electricité du Lao
(EdL) will be important for fiscal solvency, but even more for the prospects of the power
sector. Dealing with weak banks, adopting international practices in banking sector
supervision, and ensuring effective enforcement can lower risks in the financial sector.
Beyond macroeconomic stability, reforms to enhance governance and provide a level-
playing field can help unleash the potential of the private sector, including by transforming
state and market relationships (regulating conflict of interest, improving public
procurement); improving procedures in the administration (clarifying central-local
government relations, building coordinating capacity at the center); and increasing
accountability (strengthening the role of the National Assembly and inspection agencies,
improving transparency and budgeting).

Prioritized agenda
27.     While the list of development challenges is extensive, the SCD aims to identify
the most critical factors for achieving the twin goals. The prioritization was largely
guided by the expected impact of the identified policies over the twin goals, defined to also
include sustainability. Greater weight was given to policy areas that address constraints for
lagging groups (such as minority ethnic groups) and address gender gaps. The SCD
prioritizes actions that require immediate attention, either because they address a pressing
challenge (malnutrition, teenage pregnancies, and rapid depletion of natural resources) or
the long period it takes to yield results calls for early intervention (skills and improved
governance). The prioritization was complemented by the findings of an extensive
engagement process with a range of stakeholders, including representatives of central and
local governments, the business sector, nonprofit organizations, and development partners.

28.    In the Lao PDR context, a focus on the impact over the twin goals meant
prioritizing policy areas that increase incomes in agriculture, create and facilitate
transition to good non-farm opportunities, and lower risks to sustainability of growth.

                                                                                     xii | P a g e

Agriculture growth is pro-poor, with the sector accounting for 44 percent of the poverty
reduction between 2002/03 and 2012/13. Also, with productivity levels well below regional
peers and almost two-thirds of the population engaged in agriculture, the remaining
potential is large, making this a top priority. Making more strategic and environmentally
responsible use of natural resources a top priority reflects the criticality of the natural
resource sector to growth as well as livelihoods. Furthermore, the 44 percent of under-five-
year-olds that were stunted in 2012 makes improving nutrition a top priority. More and
better education improves the productivity of farmers and better prepares people to make
the transition toward non-farm jobs. Both have been key drivers of poverty reduction in Lao
PDR, making this also a top priority. Lowering risks in the fiscal and financial sectors is a high
priority as these could undermine growth and lead to instability that will impact delivery of
public services and affect the vulnerable the most. Improving the business environment and
investing in infrastructure have high pay-offs; however, benefits will be lessened in case
there is no progress on the top priorities. Putting in place a strengthened DRM framework
and a basic social protection system would be important to sustaining gains, but addressed
on their own these priorities are likely to have limited impact.

29.     Significant efforts are needed to address the knowledge and data gaps in Lao
PDR. The findings of this SCD are based on benchmarking of Lao PDR, to the extent possible,
in relation to countries in the same region (ASEAN and EAP countries), countries in the same
income classification (lower-middle-income), as well as countries that share certain
similarities (‘peers’) with Lao PDR. The peers selected were Cambodia (similar demographic
profile, same income and region group and reliance on agriculture); Botswana (landlocked;
resource rich; small population and income level to which Lao PDR aspires); Bolivia
(landlocked, small population, resource rich); Nepal (landlocked, rich hydro potential, small
population, and same income group); and Zambia (landlocked, resource rich, same income
group). In addition, additional insights were gained in a few areas during the SCD

                                                                                                xiii | P a g e

preparation, especially on long-term growth prospects, the outlook for power generation,
the linkages between various causes of malnutrition, and the issues affecting businesses.
However, a significant gap remains, especially with regard to fiscal and financial sector
issues, labor market developments, as well as the agenda for moving toward a greener and
more resilient growth path. Furthermore, the understanding of a few sector issues may
require additional breadth, such as the functioning of the supply chain in agriculture, value
of natural wealth, prospects for the energy sector, as well as the potential of information and
communication technologies in improving the business environment and service delivery.

   1. Country context
1.      Lao PDR is a small and diverse country in a rapidly changing region. The country
borders a region with a combined GDP of US$1,050 billion and population of around 280
million (Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Yunnan Province of China). Lao PDR’s
population of 6.5 million comprises four main ethnolinguistic groups, divided further into
49 ethnic groups with a corresponding number of different languages, cultures, and
traditions. The Lao, the largest ethnic group, accounts for around 67 percent of the
population. Its geography is equally diverse, with highlands in the North and lowlands in the
South. Administratively, the country is divided into northern, central, and southern regions,
further split into the capital, Vientiane, 17 provinces, 143 districts, and 8,507 villages. Gross
domestic product (GDP) reached US$12.5 billion by 2015, while a gross national income
(GNI) per capita of US$1,740 in 2015 makes Lao PDR a lower-middle-income country. Using
the typology of the East Asia and Pacific at Work Report (World Bank, 2014a), with two-
thirds of the population living in rural areas, Lao PDR is an agrarian economy. Still, the
country is urbanizing, with the urban population increasing by 40 percent between 2005
and 2015. Finally, it is endowed with significant natural capital, giving grounds to its
aspirations to provide increasing amounts of clean energy to the Association of South East
Asia Nations (ASEAN), to use its spectacular landscapes and rich biodiversity to develop
tourism, and to rely on its minerals to develop and reduce poverty.

2.     Over the 40 years since its establishment in 1975, Lao PDR made significant
gains. Lao PDR met a number of its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (Box 1); incomes
rose, poverty declined, and access to some key public services improved. However, there is
increasing evidence that growth needs to become more inclusive and less vulnerable,
including on environmental degradation. The 8th National Socio-Economic Development

                                                                                      1|Page
 The World Bank Group                                           Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


Plan (NSEDP) 2016–2020 provides an important opportunity to introduce polices that will
put Lao PDR on a path that reduces poverty and promotes shared prosperity in a sustainable
manner and opens the door for graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status.

Population is rapidly growing with significant changes in demographics

3.      Population growth is driven by high, though slowly declining, fertility rates and
falling mortality rates. The fertility rate (births per woman) is around 3, one of the highest
in the East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region (1.9 on average in EAP and in Myanmar and 1.7 in
Vietnam and China). Mortality rates have also fallen, especially for early years. Population
aged 0–14 accounts for more than a third of the total population in Lao PDR, compared to
around 20 percent in EAP on average. Life expectancy has increased, but it reached 65 only
around the middle of the last decade. Only 3.8 percent of the population is older than 65,
compared to 8.1 percent in EAP on average. The population is projected to increase to
around 10 million by 2050 (United Nations Population Fund, 2015). Aging is unlikely to
affect the country for a few decades at least.

                       Box 1: MDG attainment and LDC graduation criteria
 The country made significant progress in achieving the MDGs. The country halved extreme poverty from
 46 percent in 1992 to 23 percent in 2012/13; more than halved maternal mortality (from 796 per 100,000
 live births in 1995); lowered child mortality (from 170 per 1,000 in 1993 to 79 per 1,000 in 2011);
 increased the enrollment rate in primary education from 58.8 percent in 1992 to 98.7 percent in 2014;
 achieved gender parity in primary and secondary education; and advanced on access to safe water and
 sanitation. Still, a few MDGs remain off-track, including on reducing chronic undernutrition. More progress
 is needed toward full and productive employment, achieving the completion of primary education, and
 advancing on secondary and tertiary education. Lao PDR also needs to achieve gender equity at higher
 levels of education and improve the role of women in employment and political participation. The target
 of reducing child mortality to one-third of 1990 levels is yet to be met. Tuberculosis prevalence, although
 declining, is high, while the rising incidence of HIV and malaria pose challenges. Improving environmental
 sustainability, reversing forest degradation and loss, and clearing unexploded ordnances (UXOs)
 contaminated land are areas where more progress is needed.

 Lao PDR aims to become eligible for graduation from LDC status by 2020. At the 2015 review, Lao PDR was
 found not eligible for graduation. While GNI per capita is just below the threshold, the gap on the Human
 Assets and Economic Vulnerability indices is larger.

4.     The fertility rates are also high due to large unmet demand for family planning
and incidence of teenage pregnancy. Lao PDR has the highest rates of adolescent
pregnancies in Asia, with 4 in 10 Lao girls becoming pregnant before the age of 19. In 2012,
35 percent of girls aged 18 were married, compared to 9 percent in Vietnam and 18 percent
in Cambodia. Also, 20 percent of women have unmet family planning needs. This reduces
economic potential, reinforces the intergenerational transfer of malnutrition, and increases
health risks. Economic development and urbanization, expansion of education, and building
up of human capital (including through meeting unmet need for family planning and tackling
early marriage) are expected to help.

5.     Population density is low with a growing urban segment. Lao PDR is the most
sparsely populated country in EAP, after Mongolia, having less than 30 persons per km2.
Two-thirds of the population is rural but urbanization is taking place and could reach 50
percent by 2030. This would imply a stable rural population and an urban population that
accounts for the bulk of the increase and will impact delivery of public services, including in
education, health, transport, and utilities.

Asset endowments

6.      Lao PDR is rich in natural resources including forests, wildlife, water, and
mineral resources, which are increasingly rare in neighboring countries and provide
opportunities if properly managed. At the last update of the Wealth of Nations database,
44 percent of Lao PDR’s wealth was in the form of natural resources. The country’s rich water
resources serve multiple purposes. The annual water discharge is around 270–333 billion
m3, representing a hydropower potential of up to 25,000 MW and providing an opportunity
for growth and poverty reduction, through investments, provision of reliable, clean, and
affordable energy, higher exports, and government revenues. The 1,700 km of the Mekong
River flowing through Lao PDR is also the second-most-diverse watershed in the world in
fish biodiversity. Fisheries provide almost half of the total animal protein consumption of
the population. The forest cover has declined to around 40 percent in 2010 (from 47 percent
in 1995), but is still among the highest in the region with the timber and non-timber forest
products valued at US$10,740 (constant 2010 U.S. dollar) per capita. Lao PDR boasts
spectacular landscape, caves, waterfalls, and protected areas covering about 14 percent of
the country’s land area, with ‘natural sites’ accounting for almost 60 percent of the nearly
2,000 government-designated tourism sites (Annex 4). It has ratified the Convention
Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage, and Luang Prabang and
Vat Phou are United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
World Heritage locations. Subsoil assets add around 2010 constant US$3,000 per capita,
mostly in copper, gold, potash, bauxite, and coal.

7.     But has relatively little of other assets. Human development outcomes are
especially worrisome, given the slow improvement and weak relation to economic growth.
Only a third of the workforce has secondary education while over 30 percent of second
graders in 2012 were unable to read a single word. Malnutrition is high and persistent, with
stunting affecting 44 percent of children under the age of five in 2012. Indicators are
persistently worse for ethnic minorities. Physical infrastructure is improving, with better

                                                                                    3|Page

roads, new bridges, extensions to the transmission and distribution networks, and airports
improving connectivity. However, gaps in coverage continue to exist, especially in remote
and rural areas where the ethnic diversity is most visible.

Government agenda

8.     The objective of the 2016–2020 8th NSEDP is to reduce poverty and prepare
Lao PDR for LDC graduation. The NSEDP has three main outcomes: (a) strong economic
growth and lower vulnerability; (b) enhanced human development, poverty reduction, and
access to quality education and health services; and (c) sustainable management of natural
resources and reduced impact of natural shocks and climate change. More specifically, the
NSEDP prioritizes (a) a stronger non-resource sector with a focus on agro-processing,
tourism, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs); (b) continued use of hydro and mining
with stronger environmental and social safeguards; (c) enhanced rule of law; and (d)
improved access to education, health, and social protection systems. Implementation of the
8th NSEDP aims to see GDP growth average 7.5 percent per year and GDP per capita increase
to US$3,100 by 2020; however, these targets were recently revised slightly downwards as
economic activity moderated in 2016 reflecting external and domestic headwinds (lower
commodity prices, tax shortfalls, and so on).

9.      Lao PDR mainstreamed the MDGs into its national development plans and is
embedding the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The NSEDP’s focus on growth,
vulnerability, and inclusion allows for integration of MDGs and SDGs in the national
strategies with around half of the proposed NSEDP’s monitoring and evaluation indicators
linked to the 17 SDGs with an additional goal added in Lao PDR on reduced impact of UXOs.
Lao PDR is one of six countries in which a program for the localization of SDGs is being rolled
out, which is currently ongoing. While the NSEDP provides limited guidance on the
prioritization, off-track MDGs (such as nutrition, child mortality, immunization, productive
and decent work, school completion, and advancing to higher grades) would need to
continue to receive attention, as well as SDGs that continue to advance the agenda on poverty
reduction and inclusion. In many cases the SDGs are moving the post by requiring not only
basic access but also improved quality of services; for example, in water supply and
sanitation, education, and so on. The SDGs focus on resilient infrastructure and protection
and sustainable use of resources is also very relevant in the Lao PDR context, given the
importance of natural resources to growth and livelihoods and the significant disaster risks.

10.    Lao PDR recognizes the link between development, sustainability, and the need
to mainstream environmental considerations, including on climate change. The
country has ambitious plans to lower its greenhouse gas emissions (even though it accounts
for a negligible amount of global emissions), while increasing resilience to climate change.
The 2015 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution identified increasing forest cover,
expanding electrification and hydropower, growing the role of renewable energy, and
improving the road network and public transport as key mitigating actions. On adaptation,
the focus is on agriculture, land use, water management, transport, urban development, and
public health (Lao PDR, 2015). Lao PDR is dedicated to the implementation of its
commitments; however, it will require significant support.

                                                                                    4|Page

11.    The ownership of this agenda exists, but is challenged by the lack of a rules-
based environment. Improving living conditions and developing the economy and catching
up with more advanced ASEAN neighbors are high on the agenda and the developments of
China and Vietnam serve as models pointing in the same direction. However, these incentives
appear to have had limited impact over the ability to pursue more vigorous economic
reforms reflecting also strong capture of political institutions by vested interests. While the
domestic environment doesn’t generate a strong push for reform, international forums have
proved more effective. Lao PDR’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2013
and more recently the efforts to implement Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
recommendations are examples when Lao PDR was able to design and implement important
reforms. In this regard, the advent of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) could spur
efforts across the region to address protracted policy issues. With a weakened effort
following WTO accession, the AEC could offer a new anchor for reforms.

Governance arrangements

12.    While embracing market economy concepts, the governance arrangements to
support the new path have been evolving very gradually. The governance arrangements
provide for stability but with limited voice and accountability. Lao PDR is governed by a
single party, the Lao PDR People’s Revolutionary Party, headed by the Party’s Central
Committee and managed by the Politburo. The 2016 Party Congress provided continuity on
most policy orientations and signaled willingness to tackle corruption and advance toward
more inclusive and sustainable growth. Four mass organizations (the Lao Front for National
Construction, the Lao’s Women’s Union, the Lao People’s Revolutionary Youth Union, and
the Federation of Lao Trade Unions) are expected to allow for representation of the wider
population. According to the Constitution, all state organizations function by a process of
“democratic centralism,” that is, they are organized as hierarchical organizations in which
information (about social issues and concerns, for example) flows up the hierarchy and
decisions flow down (Stuart-Fox, Countries at the Crossroads 2011: Laos, 2011).
Representation of women in government is mixed, with Lao PDR having a respectable
proportion of women in the National Assembly (25 percent), while the proportion of women
in other decision-making institutions is still low (5 percent in 2012).

13.    There has been some progress in strengthening governance, but Lao PDR
continues to rank poorly on a number of governance indicators. The understanding of
the need to improve the quality of public services for people and businesses is very slowly
evolving and mechanisms to solicit feedback and consultation are gradually being
introduced (for example, consultations in drafting regulations, participatory approach to
planning); however, in many instances even the few options that exist to provide voice to
citizens and businesses are not effectively implemented. As a result, civil society leverage
over policy making remains very limited while the opportunities for the private sector are
constrained. Lao PDR is ranked 107 out of 144 countries on the World Economic Forum’s
(WEF’s) indicator for transparency of government policy making. This extends to all aspects
of government operations with basic fiscal and sectoral information not available, even in
some cases within the government. As a result, rule of law is weak, the appetite to improve
the regulatory quality is suppressed, and the ability to control corruption is limited. Lao PDR

ranks only around the 25th percentile on Worldwide Governance Indicators and it is 139th

According to Global Financial Integrity, illicit financial flows were estimated at around 13
percent of GDP on average between 2006 and 2013.

14.    The size of the government has increased rapidly in recent years. A 2010 report
estimated the civil service at around 1.8 percent of the population, which is not excessive,
with an additional around 1.5 percent estimated to be employed by the police and the army
(World Bank, 2010c). By end-2015, the civil service expanded to 2.8 percent of the
population. In education alone, employment increased by 40 percent between 2010 and
2015 to reach around 1.4 percent of the population. The pace of increase is a cause for
concern since it came at a significant fiscal cost and does not appear to be linked to strategic
decisions about the role of the civil service and its appropriate size.

15.     The administration has limited capacity to design good policies, but this is
going to be a smaller problem going forward. Few in the public service demonstrate
sufficient understanding of the requirement of modern institutions. Still, there is some
evidence of a growing body of well-educated technocrats taking up senior decision-making
positions in the administration.

16.     Frequently, institutional effectiveness is hampered by lack of clear hierarchy
and assignment of roles and responsibilities within the central government and
between the center and the provinces. Operating arrangements in the government result
in suboptimal efforts and deployment of resources. Within government agencies, decision
making is centralized and hierarchical, and even the most minor technical matters get passed
up the hierarchy where decisions are made (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2016). Also, overlapping
jurisdictions among the different ministries and within the ministries contribute to varying

                                                                                                   6|Page

interpretations and implementation of government policies (Soukamneuth, 2006).
Interministerial coordination is weak, while regionalism remains strong. Poorly articulated
organizational lines of responsibilities between Governors and Ministers results in policies
and regulations being selectively enforced at the local level which undermines rule of law.

17.     Still, there appears to be sufficient capacity to push projects where there is
commitment. According to the Worldwide Governance Indicators, government
effectiveness is above the average for lower-middle-income countries, though it lags the
average for upper-middle-income countries and the EAP average. On one hand, large-scale
projects such as hydropower dams and other infrastructure are implemented with the full
support of the state, albeit with at times insufficient attention to environment and social
safeguards. Similarly, the success in stemming the illegal exports of timber in 2016 reflects
a fair degree of coordination and implementation across various agencies. On the other hand,
reforms aimed at improving the functioning of the market economy or supporting civil
society which may undermine political interests are left unimplemented (Bertelsmann
Stiftung, 2016).

18.    The culture of formal institutional checks and balances is only gradually
developing. The traditional division of powers into executive, legislative, judicial, and
monetary powers at arm’s length of each other is slowly starting to become visible; however,
key positions still hold significant powers in more than one branch with a strong oversight
function by the Party. The judiciary is yet to emerge as a guarantor of personal and property
rights guaranteed by the Constitution. In the Lao PDR context, some checks and balances
roles are provided by the Party, but it is unclear how effective these are. The National
Assembly, whose members are elected directly by the people from a vetted list, is
increasingly playing a stronger oversight role; however, it is yet to emerge as a more effective
check and balance to the executive.

   2. The nature of Lao PDR’s growth and its constraints
Opening up in the late 1980s brought dynamism to the economy; however, most
of the potential was exhausted by the end of the 1990s

19.     The adoption of the New Economic Mechanism in 1986 signaled a profound
change in Lao PDR’s economic model. A decade after it was introduced, the planned
socialist economy model came under strain in the mid-1980s. Growth averaged 5 percent
during 1975–1986, but it was accompanied with high current account and fiscal deficits and
inflation rates. This prompted the launch of market-oriented reforms, including liberalizing
prices, improving management of some state enterprises, removing restrictions on domestic
trade, allowing increased private sector activities in trade, initiation of fiscal, trade, and
banking policy reforms, and devaluing the exchange rate and unifying the parallel and official
rates (World Bank, 1988). Output initially declined as the central planning and subsidies
schemes were dismantled; however, the reforms eventually stabilized the economy and
introduced a shift towards a market-based growth strategy (World Bank, 1994).

20.    The supply response to the opening up was robust and a limited structural
transformation was initiated. Output expanded on average by 6.3 percent per year during
the 1990s, including due to the expansion of the export-oriented labor-intensive garments
production. However, the second half of the 1990s also saw the launch of large hydropower
projects which defines Lao PDR’s growth model even today. Services shifted from public
sector to commercial activities (transport, trade). The reforms put into motion a process of
structural transformation driven by strong productivity gains. Total factor productivity
(TFP) explained most of output growth during the early 1990s; however, its contribution
declined as the pace of reforms was not sustained.

21.    With increased opportunities, openness brought risks which, combined with
underdeveloped economic management resulted in an uncertain end to the 1990s. Lao
PDR’s strong links to Thailand (three-quarters of all foreign direct investment [FDI] in Lao

                                                                                   8|Page

PDR and 30 percent of all exports at the time) made it vulnerable to the 1997 Asian financial
crisis and resulted in lower investment and trade flows. This was compounded by weak
economic management domestically and led to a massive loss in the value of the domestic
currency and high inflation (International Monetary Fund, 1999) adversely affecting living
conditions and private consumption. By 1999, income per capita was US$268, a modest
increase from US$216 at the start of the decade. While the economy recovered quickly, the
spillovers from the crisis shape the views on integration even today.

Natural resources became the growth engine in the 2000s

22.    Growth picked up during the 2000s reflecting a buoyant global economy and a
surge in resource-related investment. Average GDP growth accelerated to around 7
percent as tighter macroeconomic policies after 2001 reduced inflation and stabilized the
exchange rate, while a favorable external outlook brought in large investments in mining and
hydropower. These trickled down into higher output in other sectors of the economy; but,
had a modest impact over fiscal revenues (Box 5) and created few good jobs. Compared to
regional peers, the extent of structural transformation lagged as non-resource sectors
performed weakly. Still, by 2015, GNI per capita reached US$1,740 reflecting strong growth
but also appreciation of the currency.

23.     The power sector started a robust export-led expansion in the mid-2000s as
investors began to tap into the ample hydro potential to meet the demand from the
fast-growing region. The construction of the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) power plant (project cost
of US$1.2 billion, or around 25 percent of annual GDP in the construction period, and
installed capacity of 1,080 MW) signaled the start of rapid development of the sector (Box
2). The projects that followed boosted investment in the sector from US$183 million in 2005
to above US$2 billion by 2015. Installed capacity increased from less than 700 MW in 2005
to around 6,000 MW in 2016. When it started production in 2010, NT2 alone more than
doubled the total power output adding 2.7 percentage points to the overall growth of 8.5
percent. Hongsa lignite plant is projected to have a similar contribution to growth in 2016
and 2017. While around two-thirds of the installed capacity is exported, the fragmentation
of the transmission system as well as rapid demand growth keeps Lao PDR reliant on power
imports. The sector generated few jobs directly (around 20,000 jobs) and contributed up to
US$132 million to fiscal revenues in FY14/15, or 1.1 percent of GDP and 4.7 percent of
government revenues. It also improved the domestic supply allowing for electrification to
reach close to 90 percent of households and providing a reliable input to businesses. Tax
exemptions and low royalty rates may mean that fiscal revenue growth will be less than
commensurate to the increase in production; however, will increase substantially after 2030
as the concession arrangements expire and assets are transferred to the Government.

24.   Going forward, it will be important for Lao PDR to adequately manage and
monitor the large number of hydropower projects under construction and operation
and to secure markets for its rapidly growing power generation capacity. The rapid
growth in the sector imposes high demands on the Government with regard to management
and monitoring of the construction and operation of power facilities to assure that there are
no shortcomings in the construction and operation that could pose public safety and

                                                                                  9|Page

structural sustainability issues as well as in ensuring the social and environmental aspects
of water use are adequately addressed. In addition, power generation may be growing faster
than the ability to sell the produced electricity putting a growing burden on Electricité du
Lao (EdL) and a contingent liability for the budget. EdL’s role as off-taker of power generated
in Lao PDR is increasing and as early as 2017 some of this could be surplus power.4 The
precise magnitude of the surplus and arrangements for its marketing are uncertain, but
much, if not all, would need to be purchased by EdL because it is either the project developer
or signatory to a Power Purchase Agreement that commits the company to purchase the
project’s power. Therefore, poor financial performance and high indebtedness of EdL could
pose significant risks to the budget solvency, as well as to sustainable sector development.

25.     Following an initial boom in the mid-2000s, the mining sector has not been able
to emulate the success of the power sector. A ‘boom’ period began in 2003 with the start
of exploitation at the Sepon mine (copper cathode and gold)5 followed by the commissioning
of the Phu Bia mine (copper concentrate and gold). Both mines have posted sound economic
and social performance records.6 The rest of the sector includes smaller-scale operators,
with often poor operational, environmental, and fiscal performance, as well as a segment of
small-scale and artisanal domestic miners. Output growth stagnated after 2011 in response
to lower demand and prices as well as maturing of operations at the two big mines and
contributions to the budget are down from US$290 million in FY12/13 to an estimated
US$195 million in FY14/15. The two large mines face an effective tax rate which is not low
when compared internationally; however, the contribution from the rest of the sector is very
low. A number of ambitious plans have been proposed, but none appear to be underpinned
by reliable reserve estimates. There is general perception that the State and local economy,
particularly the poor and vulnerable rural population, have not received a fair share of the
benefits due to generous tax concessions, weak enforcement of environmental and social
standards, and limited linkages with the rest of the economy. This prompted the authorities
to extend the moratorium on issuing new licenses to review operators’ compliance with
environment, social, and other contract requirements.7 Still, despite the moratorium being
in place, the number of issued licenses increased from 230 to 285. A review of the existing
licenses found out significant shortcomings in the performance of concessioners with the
authorities reporting that around 50 licenses have recently been revoked. Without a clear
legislative framework and with poor governance, investment in exploration has been low
resulting in limited understanding of the geology and mineral resource base.

Other exemptions have also been granted for new license approvals in areas where industrial development is
promoted or for license applications received before the moratorium was announced.

           Box 2: Lao PDR’s power sector – driving growth but in need of better direction
    Lao PDR is capitalizing on its hydropower potential and aiming to increasingly provide more power to
    Southeast Asia. A massive investment program increased the installed capacity in the system from 640 MW
    in 2000 to around 6,000 MW by 2016. Most energy is supplied from around 30 hydropower dams. In
    addition, the Hongsa lignite plant (1,878 MW), few biomass plants (35 MW), and local industry thermal
    plants also provide electricity. More than 40 dams are currently under construction and once completed
    (by around 2020) will boost installed capacity to above 10,000 MW. Additional 24 projects (installed
    capacity 1,624 MW) are in design/negotiations phase. So far, most dams are on tributaries to Mekong which
    limited the transboundary implications; however, some proposed dams are contested in the broader
    region. Lao PDR is also exploring other renewable energy projects (solar, wind); but there is only limited
    analysis of the potential.

    With limited domestic financing, Lao PDR encouraged foreign participation in the sector, largely through
    ‘build-operate-transfer (BOT)’ arrangements with concession periods of around 30 years. Power
    production is largely exported (mostly to Thailand, generating exports of US$600 million and fiscal receipts
    of US$132 million in 2014) via dedicated transmission lines, while around 5–10 percent of production is
    delivered to the national power grid. Power purchase agreements with Electricity Generation Authority of
    Thailand (EGAT) have allowed developers access to long-term affordable financing. Western companies
    account for around 40 percent of the existing installed capacity; however, Thailand is the largest investor
    in the projects currently under construction (above 50 percent of installed capacity) due to its strong
    demand, need to diversify its energy mix, and reluctance to build new energy infrastructure domestically.
    Chinese companies, supported by near-concessional financing from China’s EXIM Bank and Development
    Bank, are having an increasing role. Vietnam’s role remains limited with few plants that appear to have
    faced some delays due to price negotiations and technical issues.

    The transmission grid has not kept pace. The central part of the country is not yet connected to the southern
    part, while parts of the country cannot be supplied by domestic generation and require imports of
    electricity. On the distribution side, the electrification rate increased from 15 percent in 1995 to close to 90
    percent in 2015; though the remaining unserved areas are remote and difficult to reach. Information on
    quality of supply is not easily available; however, according to the 2012 Enterprise Survey fewer firms
    report electricity-related problems compared to their peers in EAP.


26.    Depletion of forests added to demand, however, it also undermined long-term
growth. The country has the highest percentage of forest cover in Southeast Asia and one of
the highest global rates of species endemism (that is, being unique to Lao PDR). However,
deforestation and forest degradation is rapid: the estimated forest cover has declined to
around 40 percent of the territory in 2010 (from 70 percent in 1940 and 47 percent in 1992).
Excessive salvage logging associated with mining and hydropower development, illegal
logging, expansion of agriculture and urbanization, and infrastructure development have all
contributed. Based on mirror data,8 the value of Lao PDR wood exports in 2014 was
US$1,675 million, a fivefold increase from 2010, making it one of the biggest export items. At
the same time, fiscal revenues were negligible until recently (up to US$20 million a year), but
increased to US$67 million, or around 0.5 percent of GDP in 2015. Importantly, such trade
flows took place at a time when a government decision banned most exports of timber
suggesting a disconnect between policies and their implementation and pointing to

8 Mirror data refers to trade data produced by Lao PDR’s trading partners. Data reported by Lao PDR Customs
is significantly below mirror data. Data on logging and trade flows are unreliable and these calculations should
only be considered as approximate.

weaknesses in tax, inspection, and customs agencies. Encouragingly, the experience with the
implementation of the May 2016 decree on timber management is more positive.

27.    Out of natural resources, strong growth in construction and services was offset
by mediocre performance in agriculture and manufacturing. Agriculture, where up to
two-thirds of the labor force is engaged, grew at about 3.7 percent on average in the past
decade, just slightly above the growth in hours worked. There are signs of greater
commercialization and diversification of agriculture in recent years; however, subsistence
rice farming continues to dominate. Manufacturing growth has been stagnant, keeping
employment in the sector at around 220,000 in 2012 (in comparison, the number of Lao PDR
migrants to Thailand is estimated conservatively at 250,000). The sector remains small and
dominated by garments and food processing. A few sectors have emerged recently (assembly
and equipment parts), albeit from a low base and largely confined to the special economic
zones (SEZs). Investments in the power sector boosted output in construction while more
recently, the sector benefited from growth in public investment and FDI in commercial and
residential real estate.

28.     Services expanded strongly but remain underdeveloped and concentrated in
traditional, lower-value-added activities. Trade increased as incomes grew; however, it
remains characterized by low technology and productivity reflecting prevalence of
traditional small-scale family-run shops creating low-paid vulnerable jobs. None of the
leading global retailers, already well-established in the region, are operating in Lao PDR.
While the low average household incomes, population density, and car ownership rates may
prevent their expansion in Lao PDR, restrictions on market entry are also contributing with
Lao PDR scoring 100 (most restrictive) on the Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI)
for retail trade. In tourism, improved connectivity and the growing affluence of Asia resulted
in a 17 percent average growth rate in arrivals between 2005 and 2015, with tourism
revenues estimated at US$725 million making it one of the biggest foreign exchange earners.

Few goods jobs were created keeping underemployment high and encouraging
migration

29.     Most labor remains engaged in agriculture and self-employment. Total
employment reached 3.2 million in 2012/13, with 62 percent of it engaged in subsistence
agriculture (down from around three-quarters a decade ago) and another 20 percent in self-
employment. The participation rate is around 88 percent, with insignificant gender
differences and is among the highest in ASEAN. Most of those out of the labor force are in
school, which is expected given the young demographic profile. The official unemployment
rate is 1.7 percent; though this is unlikely to reflect a functioning labor market. Most jobs are
in low-productivity and informal sector activities and underemployment is high. About 40
percent and 56 percent of people self-employed in household businesses and family farms,
respectively, work less than 40 hours a week. This compares to only 22 percent among those
in paid work. The depth of underemployment is especially acute in agriculture, where a third
of those employed in the sector worked for just 25 hours a week or less in 2012/13.

30.     Employment expanded but few good jobs were created in the private sector.
Almost 500,000 jobs (farm and non-farm combined) were added between 2003 and 2013.
However, a few issues raise concerns. First, growth created few jobs in the private sector.
Only 160,000 non-agriculture wage jobs in the private sector were created over 10 years,
clearly insufficient to absorb the growing labor force. Second, a large proportion of jobs
created were in low-productivity domestic-oriented sectors such as retail trade (23 percent)
and agriculture (18 percent), while manufacturing job creation disappointed, especially in
the second half of the decade, adding less than 6,000 jobs. This pattern is at odds with
developments in the rest of the EAP region, where strong job creation in industry and

services offset job reduction in agriculture. Third, even though wage employment nearly
doubled from 9 percent in 2002/03 to almost 18 percent in 2012/13 (with the public sector
accounting for a third of the increase), still, Lao PDR has far more people engaged in primary
sectors and very few wage earners (Figure 11). The EAP experience suggests that wage
employment is associated with higher quintiles in the income distribution.

31.     Wages are low, but it is unclear if it is sufficient to compensate for the low level
of labor productivity. The minimum wage was US$120 per month in 2015 and 2016; a level
that is higher compared to Myanmar, comparable to Cambodia, and not excessive compared
to countries at similar levels of development including the selected peers (Botswana
US$100; Bolivia US$240; Nepal US$94, and Zambia US$212). Still, the increase in labor costs
has outpaced productivity improvements, especially in manufacturing. This has pushed unit
labor costs up closer to the regional average, potentially reducing the labor cost advantage.

32.     The returns to higher education are significant. These range from three to four
percent for each additional year of education and could be as high as 7 percent for women.
More education endows workers with better skills, but also with opportunities to access
better jobs that provide higher returns on their investment (World Bank, 2013). Over half of
the wage earners have a vocational or university education, and workers with higher
education are more likely to pursue wage employment than self-employment.

33.    The limited labor market dynamics mask an increasingly mobile labor force,
both domestically and outwards. The labor market is relatively fluid (The World Bank
Group, 2016); though agriculture workers find it most difficult to move to other sectors. In
addition, survey data (Finmark Trust, 2015) suggest that 23 percent of the population
receives remittances, 14 percent from internal migrants and 11.5 percent from abroad.

   •    Despite somewhat burdensome internal mobility requirements, domestic migration
        is significant. A large part of it is rural-urban, in many cases to Vientiane. Between

       2005 and 2015, the urban population increased by 40 percent compared to a 6
       percent increase in the rural population. Also, migration between provinces takes
       place. Population growth between 2005 and 2015 averaged 1.4 percent per year at
       the national level, ranging from 0.3 percent in Huaphanh to 2.9 percent in Sekong,
       which is unlikely to be explained by vital statistics.

   •   Labor mobility costs do not appear to be excessive when compared to other ASEAN
       countries (The World Bank Group, 2016). Wholesale and retail trade, and hotels and
       restaurants are important stepping-stone sectors out of agriculture. Female workers
       entering the garment sector are most likely to come from agriculture; however, this
       does not appear to be a stepping-stone sector as workers exiting garments are most
       likely to return to agriculture.

   •   With limited job creation domestically, external migration provided opportunities for
       a large part of the population, especially the highly educated. The stock of emigrants
       was estimated at around 5.7 percent of the population in 2010 with 37.4 percent of
       the tertiary-educated population emigrating (World Bank, 2010b). Later studies
       increased the estimate of migrants to close to 10 percent of the population.
       Established networks, cultural and linguistic similarities, and higher wages make
       Thailand the preferred migration destination.

34.    However, outward migration is already creating challenges. The country is losing
its brightest and domestic firms are competing with external labor demand which is
increasing their costs even for unskilled labor. Furthermore, the illegal aspects of migration
(human rights violations; trafficking and prostitution) are widespread.

35.     Migration also has a gender dimension. The majority of irregular migrants from
Lao PDR to Thailand are women, most of whom work as domestic helpers. (United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime, 2015). Formalizing migration flows and providing better access
to social services will improve the well-being of these migrants.

approved investments between 2005 and 2015 with agriculture adding another 13 percent.
At the same time, consumption grew much slower, slightly more than doubling in per capita
terms over a period of three decades with its share in GDP declining from 90 percent of GDP
in 1985 to around 52 percent by 2014. With limited gains from job creation and wage
growth, consumption was supplemented by increasing remittances and inflows from illicit
activities. In the absence of a well-functioning and comprehensive social safety net, public
transfers did not contribute to consumption growth. Imports increased due to high import
content of investment, which translated later into growing exports of electricity and
minerals.

                                    Box 3: Illegal activities in Lao PDR
 Porous borders and ineffective enforcement has facilitated a range of illegal activities in Lao PDR. Lao PDR
 is source of and a major transit point for illicit trade in wildlife largely destined for China. Illegal trade in
 timber is large. Drugs are a significant problem with 1.4 percent of adults using methamphetamine in 2010,
 on par with Thailand but significantly above the rest of the region. The country accounts for 1.3–3 percent
 of the global area under opium cultivation with current production levels only a fraction of the output in
 the 1990s (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2014) . Poppy cultivation is linked mostly to villages
 in peripheral, difficult to access locations (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2013). At the same
 time, Lao PDR is a major transit point supplying drugs, mostly produced in Myanmar, to neighboring
 countries. The country has taken steps to ensure compliance with a number of Financial Action Task Force
 recommendations on anti-money laundering; however, this will be a longer-term agenda. In addition, illegal
 migration is an issue with around 80 percent of the 44,000 people estimated to migrate to Thailand annually
 from Lao PDR, being irregular migrants.

Competitiveness challenges affecting the non-resource sectors

37.     Productivity growth has been low in Lao PDR compared to peers. Capital
accumulation, mostly in the power and mining sectors, propelled growth, while the
contribution of TFP to overall growth over the last decade was only 1.5 percentage points,9
the smallest in the region and actually below its levels in the 1990s as the catch-up potential
introduced with the early reforms was exhausted. At the same time, TFP contribution to
overall growth was in line with levels seen in some of the structural peers (Bolivia, Nepal,
and Zambia). Low TFP actually meant that Lao PDR workers did not become much more
efficient and not a lot workers moved from less-productive to more-productive sectors.

Agriculture has potential but is held back by economy-wide and sector-specific
constraints

Snapshot of the sector

contribution to poverty reduction. Agriculture was estimated to have contributed to 44
percent of the reduction in poverty in Lao PDR, the largest contribution among all sectors.

                                      will increase farm incomes, improve nutrition and make agriculture
                                      more climate smart. Still, this change is unlikely to be endorsed before
                                      the country achieves higher rice surpluses. Now, rice production only
                                      marginally exceeds domestic consumption with the surplus estimated
                                      at 7 percent of production compared to 23 and 27 percent in Vietnam
                                      and Thailand, respectively.
            Commercialization of      Only 30 percent of farm households in 2010/11 reported to produce
               production is low      mainly for sale, a significant improvement from 6 percent in 1989/90,
                                      but still below the rates of commercialization seen internationally.
         Quality of produce is low.   Although most of the country’s rice is glutinous and of higher value
                                      than other types of rice, Lao milled rice suffers from low milling quality
                                      and weak branding and marketing campaigns, making it unattractive
                                      to consumers in neighboring countries (and lowering its price). The
                                      same applies to other crops, such as coffee and other fruits and
                                      vegetables.


39.    Agriculture suffers from some of the competitiveness challenges that keep the
costs of doing business high for other sectors as well. Improved connectivity, from
hinterlands to domestic markets and to processors and consumers across borders, and a
more efficient business environment can reduce costs and increase competitiveness of
agriculture. Non-tariff barriers have a disproportionate impact over agriculture. For
example, the inability to certify sanitary and phytosanitary standards effectively excludes
Lao PDR produce from foreign markets and requires significant upgrading of the product
quality infrastructure in Lao PDR. Also, anecdotal evidence suggests that non-automatic
licenses in large neighboring countries restrict market access, for example by limiting the
number of importers of Lao products on their markets.

40.     In addition, a range of sector-specific issues affects productivity and
profitability. A better-functioning food supply chain can increase value added and incomes
in agriculture, but currently, there are weaknesses along the entire chain. More specifically:

     •   At the farm level, low farm productivity reflects poor availability of high-quality seeds
         and other inputs,10 weak farm advisory services, limited irrigation and drainage
         infrastructure, and regional differences in social and climatic characteristics (World
         Bank, IRRI, and FAO, 2012). Consequently, the volume and quality of produce is not
         consistent. Land under irrigation needs to increase, but also irrigation practices need
         to change and include drainage and plot-controlled options (currently, most
         irrigation systems use flood irrigation which is not suitable for non-rice products).
         Presently, in many cases the Government provides the pumps but requires farmers
         to build the canals and organize water user groups without capacity building which
         does not provide incentives for efficient management of the infrastructure.

     •   Also, unsecure land tenure and the lack of off-farm jobs in rural areas hamper a
         farmland rental market that could promote market-based land consolidation, which
         keeps farms small (1.7 ha of cultivable land per rural family). This may be changing
         gradually with increasing use of contract farming (where farmers provide land and
         labor, more typical for the uplands) or through concessions for large-scale agriculture
         plantations (more typical for the lowlands). The larger land plots have facilitated
         greater commercialization and diversification, including into production of coffee,
         tobacco, bananas, beans, and so on.

     •   While large-scale plantations promote commercialization, in some cases they had a
         questionable impact on communities. Information on experience with plantations is
         limited and fragmented, but it points to shortcomings in some cases. Some
         plantations increased incomes and jobs and improved connectivity; however,
         frequently they also resulted in loss of livelihoods (no compensation, reduced
         livestock, and non-timber food products), pollution, and land conflicts prompting the
         introduction of a moratorium on new concessions.

     •   Market fragmentation on the supply side and concentration on the demand side
         further weaken the supply chain. Prices decline following the harvest as farmers rush
         to sell their produce while only few larger millers and agro-processors have the
         financial resources to purchase larger quantities of raw materials. For rice, there are
         around 9,000 medium and large mills; however, only half of the capacity is utilized as
         millers lack affordable finance to purchase paddy and store rice. Prices increase fast

10 According to the Enabling the Business for Agriculture’s cross-country report (http://eba.worldbank.org/),
Lao PDR lags behind other EAP countries with its scores on the seed and agriculture machinery indicators.
Though Lao PDR performs better on seed registration, it faces obstacles in timely introduction and production
of high-quality seeds. Dealers importing tractors face delays and high-cost procedures, while the standards and
safety for operators of tractors are very low. On the fertilizer indicator, which measures laws and regulations
on the registration, import, and quality control of fertilizer products, Lao PDR performs better than a few other
EAP countries in regulating quality fertilizer but it preforms below average when compared to the broader
sample of 40 countries included in the cross-country assessment.

                                                                                                  19 | P a g e

       afterwards as the few larger millers can influence the price at which they sell. Very
       few mills work directly with farmers and farm groups through contract farming. For
       rubber, evidence suggests that only few companies are allowed to import into China
       keeping prices for farmers low, while in coffee, until recently one exporter accounted
       for a disproportionate size of the market; though, concentration may have fallen
       slightly in recent years as foreign investment entered the sector.

   •   Most agro-processors and rice mills have low efficiency. Few millers have modern
       equipment (though there has been some improvement recently through FDI) with
       typical paddy—rice efficiency levels of around 50 percent (head rice and broken).
       Apart from rice, post-harvest processing of coffee is poor and only few coffee
       exporters have equipment to accurately sort by size, density and color. Similar issues
       affect other fruits and vegetables, where in addition, packinghouses and processing
       plants remain too small to be able to directly participate in larger food chains. To
       circumvent this, Lao processors operate through Thai intermediaries which is also
       helping them meet increasingly more stringent quality and safety standards of
       foreign retailers.

41.     The 2015 policy for rice development in high-potential production areas of Lao
PDR does underscore the importance of a value chain approach. Cambodia and Vietnam
provide good examples on developing outgrower seed production, rice mills, contract
farming, food safety, marketing, and brand development which can be replicated. This will
also allow for the development of ‘agribusiness’ as more farm products can be (cold) stored,
transformed, packaged, transported, distributed, and served to make them available to, and
comply with, the preferences of consumers.

42.     Similar strategies can increase returns for other crops and sectors. Lao PDR has
a sizeable coffee-growing industry which has seen robust growth rates in recent years while
climate conditions are favorable for growing various fruit and vegetables. However, both
sectors are facing challenges in meeting scale and quality requirements and largely focus on
supplying raw produce to neighboring countries (Vietnam for coffee and maize and Thailand
for fruits and vegetables). Encouragingly, the newer business model on coffee aims to
improve quality but also develop a consistent and unique product that can fetch a premium
relative to international commodity price. While capture fisheries appears to be under
stress, aquaculture has grown fast and offers potential.

43.    Government support has been low and with limited effectiveness. Public funding
of agriculture has been low historically, which has made it difficult to achieve sustained
impacts (World Bank, IRRI, and FAO, 2012). Allocations have increased in recent years, but
the overall budget remains just around 1 percent of GDP, or around 3.3 percent of
government spending, compared to around 6.4 percent of GDP in Vietnam and 4.5 percent
of GDP in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, most programs focus on paddy production, with
limited support for other produce and market development. The quality of some programs
is low, though it is gradually improving. Training and agriculture extension services can
improve human capital of farmers enabling them to increase their productivity (Figure 26)
and integrate them better in commercial food value chains. Integrating climate sensitivity

into irrigation and other public programs would make farm systems more climate resilient.
Agricultural diversification and food safety programs would help reduce malnutrition.
Importantly, developing a brand recognition for its rice and other products can help Lao PDR
increase its export price and earn higher incomes for its farmers. The Cambodia experience
in recent years is a model that can be used.

Snapshot of the sector

44.     The structure of the private
sector in Lao PDR reflects the
                                              -1
characteristics of a small, low-value-
added         and       inward-oriented
economy. Around 98 percent of
registered firms are small, actually most
of them micro (less than 10 employees),

goods and services. According to the Note: Higher score is better.
2012 Enterprise Census, almost half of all employment is in firms with five workers or less
and 63 percent of all firms are in the retail sector. Only 12 percent of firms are in
manufacturing and with few exceptions, mostly involved in low-value-added activities (Box
4). While the contribution of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to employment
is large, their contribution to GDP is modest; it is estimated that MSMEs contribute around
16 percent of GDP, compared to 40 percent in Thailand, 32 percent in Malaysia, and 32
percent in the Philippines. This is also a reflection of the low productivity of MSMEs. The
export basket remains undiversified, unsophisticated, and dominated by low-value-added
products with few linkages to products with higher value addition. Until recently, the
country was not catching up with regional neighbors with regard to the sophistication of its
export basket (Record & Nghardsaysone, 2010). In terms of skill content, Lao PDR exports
have the lowest ratio of skilled workers relative to comparators in the region and at similar
income levels (The World Bank Group, 2016). At −1.5, Lao PDR’s index of economic
complexity is on par with that in Cambodia; however, significantly below regional and
structural peers. The private sector is poorly integrated in cross-country supply chains; 72
percent of companies source most of their inputs domestically and 94 percent serve only the
domestic market. A handful of companies, mostly located within SEZs, appear to be more
integrated in regional supply chains and account for a growing share of exports (albeit on a
very low basis).

45.    Squeezed by rising wages and non-improving labor productivity, the
profitability of the manufacturing sector suffered. Various measures of productivity

                                                                                 21 | P a g e

(output per worker, capital intensity, TFP) of Lao PDR manufacturing firms are low
compared to countries at similar level of development and have not improved significantly
between 2005 and 2012. Despite stagnant productivity, wages increased and have eaten into
the profit margins of firms (World Bank, 2014). On the other hand, profitability in services
increased reflecting a changing sectoral structure (financial intermediation,
telecommunications, and so on) in a less-competitive environment (entry is still restricted
in some sectors) allowing firms to more easily absorb higher labor costs. Continued
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate (up to 30 percent over the last five years) is
further undermining competitiveness; and adding to the weaknesses in product and factors
markets.

46.     There are too few firms and the
few which exist struggle to grow.                  Table 6: Lao PDR firms invest less

                             Box 4: Structure of the manufacturing sector
 Despite robust growth in the 1990s, the garment sector has stagnated over the last decade. The industry
 counts around 100 companies mostly around Vientiane and Savannakhet employing around 25,000 to
 30,000, largely female, employees, a number that has not changed significantly over the last decade. It was
 one of the first sectors to attract FDI due to low labor costs and favorable market access. It is export oriented
 (mostly to the European Union [EU]), importing most of the raw materials and providing little value added.
 The industry is small when compared internationally, with Lao PDR exports equal to around 7 percent of
 Cambodia’s garments exports. The sector appears stuck in a low-equilibrium trap with worker
 dissatisfaction driving high worker turnaround, low capacity utilization, and low investment in workforce
 skills (World Bank, 2012). An appreciating currency, difficult access to finance, higher transit times and
 costs, as well as still complex trade procedures put Lao PDR at a disadvantage compared to competitors.
 Food processing has expanded; however, the inability to meet standards, penetrate markets, and manage
 the supply chain to achieve economies of scale means that Lao PDR exports most of its food products
 unprocessed and without much value addition. Some timber-processing industry still remains but it has
 been struggling to grow.

 Emerging subsectors include assembly and equipment parts, albeit from a low base and largely confined to
 the SEZs. These are mostly foreign investments (around 70 companies so far) and parts of larger regional
 value chains. Most are companies that have decided to relocate part of their production, mostly from
 Thailand, to Lao PDR due to lower wage costs, government incentives, as well as the perceived political
 stability. However, they appear to be changing the structure of the Lao PDR manufacturing sector with
 exports reaching US$200 million in 2014.



47.    A large part of the Lao PDR commercial sector is informal. Informality is
estimated at slightly above 30 percent of GDP in Lao PDR (Schneider, Buehn, & Montenegro,
2010); however, this is likely an underestimate. Employment figures from the Enterprise
Census (at around 574,000) are significantly below survey-based estimates of non-farm
employment of around 1.2 million suggesting significant non-reported economic activity.
Also, 82 percent of businesses did not keep accounting records and 64 percent were covered
under the presumptive tax regime (also, partly to avoid complicated taxation procedures)
indicative of underreporting of economic activity. Firms interviewed during the 2015

Enterprise Survey reported that the practices of the informal sector are the biggest obstacle
to doing business.

48.     Lao PDR firms perform well on some gender dimensions. A bigger percentage of
firms have female ownership, more firms have female top managers and the proportion of
female workers is higher compared to global averages. Female management and
employment dominates in retail trade while it is lower in manufacturing. Between 2009 and
2012, female-owned firms became more concentrated in services and grew larger and more
profitable compared to male-owned firms. At the same time, firms headed by females also
have lower demand for financial services. A wage gap appears to exist but more likely related
to differences in asset endowments rather than discriminatory practices.

and limits firms’ ability to invest in human and physical capital to grow. Lao PDR was
ranked 139 on the 2017 Ease of Doing Business rankings, reflecting inadequate regulation
(though gradually improving), but also complicated and burdensome procedures. Among the
selected peers, only Bolivia has a bigger distance to the frontier (a measure of how far a
country is compared to the best performer) with Lao PDR underperforming against the low-
middle-income group, EAP and ASEAN averages. This generates uncertainty, high costs,
affects investment, and encourages informality which results in significant unexploited
opportunities for growth and job creation by the private sector. For example:

   •   Lao PDR has one of the most difficult procedures for starting a business globally,
       including a monopoly on centralized issuance of a company seal which alone takes up
       to a month. This is made more difficult by restrictions on market entry. Lao PDR has
       welcomed foreign investment in some sectors, but still has significant restrictions on
       foreign presence in few sectors. Also, investors are required to obtain numerous
       permits from various agencies which can pose a challenge, especially in areas outside
       the capital (U.S. Department of State, 2015).

   •   Other aspects of operating a business are also difficult. While tax rates are
       comparable to countries in the region, they have recently reemerged as a constraint
       to doing business with 22 percent of firms ranking it as the biggest business
       environment obstacle in 2015, up from 15 percent in 2012 and an EAP average of 11
       percent. Furthermore, paying taxes remains cumbersome and lengthy, taking on
       average 362 hours to complete. Operating licenses frequently need to be renewed
       each (second) year, generating operational costs and uncertainty. Improved customs
       processes resulted in remarkable reduction in the time it takes Customs to clear
       goods at the border from almost 11 days in 2009 to just 2 days in 2015. Still, complex
       licensing and documentary requirements for trade and other behind-the-border
       processes still inflate the overall time to import and exports. Lao PDR’s ranking for
       trading across borders remains poor at 120, particularly challenging for a small,
       landlocked, economy.

especially in rural areas. While the right of private ownership is recognized, business
contracts can be voided while the judiciary has limited experience in commercial law (U.S.
Department of State, 2015). Weak collateral and bankruptcy laws (Lao PDR is ranked joint
last 169 on Doing Business resolving an insolvency indicator) and a protracted enforcement
process (ranked 88 in the 2017 Doing Business report on enforcing contract) further weaken
property and creditor rights. One of the consequences is that banks are reluctant to use other

assets except land as collateral which prevents many small businesses and start-ups from
getting credit while the use of supplier’s credit is less frequent compared to the region.

51.     Consequently, markets remain characterized by an uneven playing field and
limited competition. First, a culture of affiliated business transactions has blurred the lines
between the state and the private sector. Similar to Vietnam and Cambodia, the reform years
in Lao PDR have seen a form of state advance as politicians, officials, and those with close
ties to them have seized on their ‘insider’ access to business opportunities. Conflicts of
interest are common, with officials (often acting through proxies) operating in sectors that
they are charged with regulating (Gainsborough, 2012). The existence of ties between
businesses and the state is undermining the competitive forces in the economy and resulting
in a gap between the ‘law in the books’ and the ‘law in practice’ and an increased use of
concession agreements (case-by-case negotiation of discretionary package of incentives) in
multiple sectors. Coupled with limited transparency and predictability of the enforcement of
regulations (Lao PDR is ranked 107, out of 144 counties, on transparency of government
policy making), this undermines business confidence and limits competition with knock-on
effects to other economic sectors. Next, while the number of state-owned entities (SOEs) is
not excessive (around 150), they still dominate the financial sector, air transport, utilities
(power, water supply, and so on) and have a significant share in telecommunications, fuel
distribution, and so on. Efforts to efficiently regulate the sectors are weakened by regulators
that are typically part or closely linked to the administration. For example, some state-owned
banks continue to operate despite failing to meet the capital requirements while the telecom
regulator maintains restrictions on market competition by mandating minimum prices.

52.    The associated costs are significant. Limited competition keeps prices high for
consumers and limits choices (for example in air transport, trade, and telecommunications)
but also limits competitiveness of domestic producers that rely on competitively priced
inputs. Crowding out a genuinely private commercial sector is another, and probably, bigger
cost. Beyond its direct economic costs, commercialization of state institutions weakens the
legitimacy of the state, benefits insiders, undermines government effectiveness, and lowers
the appetite for reform, keeping regulatory quality low. While large companies and actors
might be able to navigate such an environment (characterized by negotiation and
discretionary decisions), it particularly places burden on new and smaller, including women-
owned and innovative, companies, reducing the scope for inclusive growth.

Skills

53.    Employers point to skills as one of the most important constraints to firms’
growth. While it is not a new constraint, it appears to have gained in importance in recent
years. In the 2015 Enterprise Survey, 23 percent of employers identified skills as a major
constraint, compared to 16 percent in 2009. The percent of firms in the WEF Global
Competitiveness Reports (GCRs) that identified inadequately educated workforce as a
problem of doing business increased from 18.9 percent in 2013–2014 to 23.2 percent in
2015–2016. This compares to around 5 percent in Zambia and Nepal, around 9 percent in
Bolivia and Botswana, 11 percent in Vietnam, and 13.6 percent in Cambodia. While the
constraint affects all firms, it appears to be more acute for large firms and for exporters.

                                                                                   26 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                   Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


54.     Skills affect all job profiles. According to the 2012 Skills Toward Employment and
Productivity (STEP) Employer Survey, in almost 40 percent of attempts to hire workers,
applicants lacked the required skills. This holds across the board—that is, for manager
positions, specialists, as well as elementary positions. The same survey shows that nearly
half of the firms in Lao PDR had no or only few applicants to a low-skilled job, a much larger
proportion than in the Yunnan Province (China) and Vietnam.

55.     A mix of factors appears to be contributing to the skills problem. Standardized
tests do confirm that Lao students learn very little in the education system. Furthermore,
whatever they learn may not be very useful as development of the curricula and teaching
materials seems to be disconnected from the needs of the students and businesses. On the
demand side, companies may be finding it challenging to attract workers as the wages they
are willing to pay (determined by firms’ productivity) are only somewhat higher than
effective wages in the agricultural sector. Also, few firms are willing to invest in workforce
training. Only 6.5 percent of firms offered formal training, significantly below 22 percent of
firms in Vietnam and Cambodia and the regional and global average of around one-third of
firms.

Infrastructure and connectivity: transport, electricity, telecommunications, logistics

56.     Landlocked and small, Lao PDR’s domestic market is unlikely to be attractive to
most foreign investors, highlighting the importance of improved connectivity to
facilitate regional integration. Membership of ASEAN and WTO has lowered barriers and
increased the potential market; however, making the most of this opportunity requires the
ability to move goods and provide services across borders efficiently and at low costs.

57.    Substantial government outlays on improving connectivity have reduced the
deficit in hard infrastructure; but, not without challenges. Roads and bridges have been
constructed and upgraded and electricity supply and air connectivity have improved. Lao
PDR’s infrastructure stock is generally in line with what would be expected given the income
level and actually better compared to the selected peers (with the exception of quality of
roads in Botswana) (Annex 1: Understanding Lao PDR’s infrastructure deficit). Furthermore,
some of Lao PDR’s economic centers are located in vicinity to the Thai border and rely on
Thailand’s extensive network. However, more investment resulted in growing public debt,
including an unspecified (but significant) increase in arrears to contractors. In addition, a
focus on building new roads has meant that comparatively little has been allocated to
maintenance and operations. As a consequence, internal connectivity continues to suffer
with a significant part of the network impassable during the rainy season (particularly
secondary roads) while international links are deteriorating due to improper maintenance.
A huge backlog on maintenance means that the Road Maintenance Fund is estimated to be
able to cover only 30 percent of costs needed to gradually improve the quality of the road
network. Domestic transport costs appear to have declined but at around US$0.07 per ton
per km are comparable to Cambodia but above US$0.04 per ton per km in Thailand and
US$0.05 per ton per km in China. Businesses also report limited availability of transport
services (Srivastava & Kumar, 2012). Costs for international transport have also declined,
from US$0.13 per ton per km in 2013 to around US$0.11 per ton per km in 2016, still a

                                                                                    27 | P a g e

relatively high level and similar to Cambodia and landlocked countries in Africa. Around a
quarter of firms identified transport as a major constraint in 2015; however, 4 percent
consider it the biggest obstacle, lower than in EAP countries on average. Electricity has
reemerged as a constraint with 13 percent of companies identifying it as the biggest obstacle
in 2015; somewhat surprising given the increase in electrification and generation.

importance. As noted earlier, overall
border clearance times can remain long
due to poor coordination among                3

border agencies, lack of risk-based
approach and non-tariff measures. The         2
cost of clearing cargo in Lao PDR is
roughly double that in Vietnam driven
largely by informal fees (World Bank,         1
2014e). In addition, Lao PDR is ranked
152 in the Logistics Performance Index
(the lowest in ASEAN and among the            0
selected    peers),    and      performs
particularly poorly        in    logistics

perceptions of electricity as a constraint to doing business could reflect significant time and
procedures involved in submitting applications and getting approvals (Lao PDR requires 6
procedures that take 134 days to complete compared to an EAP average of 4.7 procedures
and 74 days).

59.      Availability and affordability of second-generation infrastructure hampers
firms’ growth. The price of ICT devices and internet service make these a luxury for most of
the population and businesses in Lao PDR, in part due to regulatory issues. As a result, the
economy is yet to benefit from new technologies and ICT applications that could help
overcome challenges from being landlocked. Only 13 percent of companies have their own
website, compared to 37 in EAP and 24 percent communicate with clients via e-mail
compared to 61 percent in EAP.12 Similarly, Lao PDR currently ranks 117 globally on
available airline seat kilometers and 94 on quality of air transport infrastructure keeping
costs of travel high (especially important for the tourism sector) and options limited, though
this is slowly changing with the gradual opening up of the sector as Lao PDR implements its
AEC commitments.

Access to finance

60.     Even though access to finance for firms has improved in recent years, many
MSMEs struggle to obtain the finance they need to grow. According to the 2015
Enterprise Survey, less firms in Lao PDR needed a loan compared to the EAP average, loan
rejection rates were lower, though collateral requirements are higher. Still, only 12 percent
of firms had a bank loan, compared to a regional average of 28 percent. Credit to the private
sector reached around 55 percent of GDP by end-2015, up from 23 percent in 2009, similar
to Cambodia and countries at lower-middle-income level, including some of the selected
peers (Bolivia 62 percent, Nepal 69 percent). Still, firms need credit at better terms to
increase investment and hence productivity and wages of workers. Also, the informal sector,
which is large in Lao PDR, typically has more difficult access to finance.

61.    Banks are reluctant to lend due to information asymmetries and difficulties in
executing collateral. A large number of firms are not registered and/or do not keep
accounting records and settle transactions in cash without invoices. Moreover, the reliability
of the accounting records for the firms that keep records may be deemed as unreliable by
banks. When MSMEs default on their loans the execution of collateral becomes a lengthy and
costly process for commercial banks. In Lao PDR, the judicial system is not prepared to
handle collateral execution in an expeditious manner; it takes up to five years for banks to
take possession of collateral through the judicial system.

62.     While credit to the private sector is growing, it occurs with limited products and
outreach. The assets of the banking sector reached almost 100 percent of the country’s GDP
by mid-2016, up from 24 percent in 2005. Over the same period, the number of banks
increased to around 40 compared to around a dozen in 2005. An additional 147 non-bank
financial institutions (microfinance institutions, savings houses, leasing companies, and so
on) were also operational in 2016. However, few commercial banks and non-bank financial
institutions operate outside urban areas. Limited access to formal financial services,
particularly in rural areas, remains a challenge; people lack the ability to expand their
businesses by taking out loans, or depositing money safely because there are no banks within
reach. The lack of access to finance in agriculture also hinders the introduction of more
sustainable farming practices and technological upgrading.

63.    Loans from commercial banks are generally available to cover short-term
working capital, and not to carry out long-term fixed investments. Around 16 percent
of firms use banks to finance investments, compared to 20 percent in EAP on average. This
may be partly explained by the slowly growing share of longer-term deposits. Around 40
percent of deposits have a maturity of one year and above, up from only 11 percent in 2005.
This limits banks’ ability to provide longer-term loans and until few year ago around 90
percent of total bank lending had a maturity of less than three years.

64.    The rest of the financial sector remains underdeveloped. The insurance market
represents a fairly small proportion of financial services, while the Lao Stock Exchange (LSX)
has only five listed companies. Alternative financing such as equity finance, supplier finance,
and other non-banking vehicles are not yet available in the market.

                                                                                   29 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


65.    Risks in the sector may undermine gains. Parts of the Lao PDR’s financial system
may be at risk of distress reflecting weaknesses in the management of some banks (including
a few larger state-owned banks) and lax enforcement of regulations (especially on domestic
banks). Non-performing loans (NPLs) were estimated at around 6 percent of total loans in
mid-2014 (and as high as 8 percent in state-owned banks) increasing to above 9 percent in
mid-2016 and a large foreign exchange exposure keeps credit risks high. Public sector
arrears have been a key factor behind the pickup in NPLs as contractors were unable to repay
loans taken to finance construction. Access to finance may reemerge as a major constraint if
these risks are not addressed.

Large variations continue to exist in living conditions between regions and
population subgroups

68.     Aggregate improvements in welfare mask large differences between regions
and socioeconomic groups. Poverty affected half of the population in Saravane and at least
two in five people in Bokeo and Sekong in 2012/13, in contrast to 6 percent in the capital
city. At 28.6 percent, the poverty rate in rural areas was higher than the 10 percent in urban
areas with the gap widening between 2007/08 and 2012/13. Rural areas accounted for 87
percent of the poor in 2012/13, compared to 80 percent five years earlier. Poverty is
concentrated in upland areas and among the less educated, and those who primarily depend
on family farming (Figure 21 and Figure 22).

69.    Poverty is particularly concentrated among minority (non-Lao Tai) ethnic
groups. About two-thirds of the poor in Lao PDR are ethnic minorities, even though they
constitute a third of the population in the country. Poverty rates are highest among the
MonKmer (42 percent) and Hmong (40 percent) and nearly three times the incidence of
poverty among the majority Lao Tai ethnic groups with a poverty rate of around 15 percent.
The ChineTibet is the only minority ethnic group with poverty rates close (16 percent) to the
Lao Tai.

70.     In general, ethnic minorities have characteristics associated with higher
poverty rates. The majority of working-age ethnic minorities (55 percent) have incomplete
primary or no formal education and 84 percent of them have at most completed primary
education compared to 56 percent for the Lao Tai. Ethnic minorities primarily depend on
subsistence agriculture, with 83 percent working on family farms and just 7 percent in paid
wage. On the whole, less than 20 percent of ethnic minority households have a non-farm
income, compared to 54 percent for Lao Tai households. Ethnic minorities are also more
likely to reside in remote rural areas with poor access to services.

71.    Progress in poverty reduction has been slower among minority ethnic groups,
besides the ChineTibet. Poverty reduction was particularly slower among the Hmong.
Starting with a poverty rate of 46 percent in 2002/03, their incidence of poverty declined by
6 percentage points in 10 years up to 2012/13, compared to a 10 percentage point reduction
in poverty among the Lao Tai from 25 percent in 2002/03. Compared to other ethnicities,
upward mobility was much lower and downward mobility much higher among both the
Mon-Khmer and Hmong-Lu-Mien (Figure 23 and Figure 24). For instance, half of the Hmong
who were poor in 2007/08 exited poverty in 2012/13 and 30 percent of those previously
non-poor had fallen back into poverty. Among the Lao Tai in contrast, three-quarters of the
poor in 2007/08 had moved out of poverty five years later and less than 10 percent of the
non-poor had fallen into poverty.

72.     Key gender gaps emerge on health, especially on maternal mortality and
teenage pregnancy, and are gradually narrowing on education. A high maternal
mortality rate places women at a higher risk while early marriages and pregnancy raises the
risks for health complications for young women (Asian Development Bank and The World

Bank, 2012). Women still have lower literacy rates, especially among the poor where the
literacy gap between males and females is 23 percentage points and girls constitute the
majority of those who have never been to school. Although gaps in enrollment have closed
and the net enrollment of girls equaled that of boys in both primary and secondary education
in 2012/13, the gap still persists in access to tertiary education. In general, the legal
framework provides equal rights to men and women; however, customs and traditions, may
limit implementation in some cases.

Drivers of poverty reduction

An increase in endowments and creation of off-farm opportunities drove poverty
reduction

73.   Household labor income growth was the major contributing factor to poverty
reduction. This was driven by increasing households’ endowments and economic
opportunities. More specifically:

                        •             Human capital improved - households’ human capital increased as the dependency
                                      ratio (number of dependents per working adult) declined from 2.7 in 2002/03 to 1.9
                                      in 2012/13 and educational attainment increased. The proportion of working-age
                                      adults with a secondary degree increased by 8.3 percentage points, from 26.7 percent
                                      to 35 percent over that period.

                        •             Access to land increased - access to agriculture land in rural areas increased by 26
                                      percent, mostly in the second half of the decade. By 2012/13, an average household

                                  •       Off-farm job opportunities expanded - the economy created about 400,000 jobs in the
                                          non-farm sector - enough to absorb two-thirds of the 610,000 new labor market
                                          entrants during this time, resulting in a decline in the share of agriculture in primary
                                          employment from 73 percent in 2002/03 to 64 percent in 2012/13.

74.     Higher education attainment facilitated the transition into off-farm
employment where earnings are higher, but also contributed to agriculture income
growth by raising agriculture productivity. The most educated fully transitioned out of
agriculture, mostly into the services sector. Those with incomplete secondary education
remained engaged in agriculture but diversified into mostly informal, low-productivity
household businesses which reduced underemployment. Households headed by someone
with at least complete primary education were more productive in agriculture. They
produced 30 percent more rice per person and 26 percent more rice per area planted while
selling a greater share of their produce in the market. Consequently, households with more
education were more likely to escape poverty whether in agriculture or non-agriculture
sectors (Figure 26).

The gap in the likelihood of exiting poverty between ethnic minorities and the Lao Tai
narrows when taking into account education attainment and livelihoods, although it is not
completely eliminated (Figure 25). About 90 percent of the difference in consumption per
capita between the Lao Tai and ethnic minorities is explained by differences in endowments
(few household members with post-primary education and a higher share of children in the
household among ethnic minorities) and poor connectivity (lack of access to electricity).

Taxonomy of the bottom 40 percent and constraints they face

76.   The bottom 40 percent in Lao PDR can be broadly grouped into four categories
with different needs or constraints and thus require different policy responses (Table
8).

   •   Unconnected, low capital: The largest group (42 percent) and the poorest, basically
       lacking in everything other than land. This group is predominantly ethnic minorities
       (71 percent) and located mainly in highland areas. Only 15 percent of people in this
       group have a non-farm income and the average share of working-age household
       members with at least secondary education is just 5 percent. This group is likely to be
       most vulnerable from uncontrolled exploitation of natural resources which affects
       their livelihoods and increases disaster risks. Non-farm opportunities are lacking in
       their remote locations, yet with low levels of education, people in this group are not
       only deprived of the prerequisite skills to transition out of agriculture, but they are
       also less productive within agriculture where they will remain in the foreseeable
       future. The lack of assets is thus a critical constraint to this group.

   •   Connected, rural, moderate capital: This group, constituting 26 percent of the
       bottom 40 percent, has higher asset ownership and connectivity, but has moderate to
       low levels of education, is largely rural, and predominantly agricultural with close to
       two-thirds of households being net sellers of rice. Like the case of Cambodia, this
       group can benefit significantly from policies that raise agriculture earnings, especially
       from rice production.

   •   Connected, urban, good capital: A third group (16 percent of the bottom 40
       percent), is predominantly urban, with above average human capital, high
       connectivity, access to services and asset ownership, has already entered the non-
       farm sector, and is predominantly Lao Tai. The challenge for this group is making
       their non-farm engagement more stable and productive, as the majority of this group
       still has to supplement their earnings with farming.

   •   Health burdened: The last group (16 percent) is set apart from the others by
       exposure to health shocks. While this group shares characteristics of other groups, it
       is singled out as it points to significant vulnerability. At least one household member
       in two-thirds of households in this group was hospitalized in the 12 months before
       the survey in 2012/13 and a third of the households have a chronically ill member.
       More than half are ethnic minorities.

Challenges for inclusive growth

Growth in Lao PDR was not broad based and not equitably shared

77.     Poverty has been less responsive to economic growth in Lao PDR compared to
other countries in the region, as growth did not only fail to translate into a
proportionate increase in household consumption on average, but was also more
favorable to the non-poor. Average consumption per capita grew by 2.2 percent per year—
about 3.5 percentage points lower than GDP per capita between 2002/03 and 2012/13. At
just 1.3 percent per year, consumption growth was even lower for the bottom 40 percent.
Inequality increased, with the Gini coefficient increasing from 32.5 in 2002/03 to 36.2 in
2012/13, thus higher than Cambodia (28 in 2011) but in the same range as Vietnam (35.6 in
2012) and Indonesia (37.2 in 2013) and lower compared to few of the selected peers
(Bolivia, Botswana, and Zambia). The low trickle down of growth and rising inequality
contributed to a low growth elasticity of poverty of around −0.42. Only the Philippines has a
lower growth elasticity of poverty in the Southeast Asia region. Cambodia for example had a
growth elasticity of poverty of −1.16 during 2004–2011; Vietnam and Indonesia also had
higher growth elasticity of poverty compared to Lao PDR, as well as most of the selected

peers (Bolivia, Botswana, and Nepal). The median elasticity for a sample of around 34
resource-dependent countries is around −1.4.

78.    Growth in the non-agriculture sector, largely driven by natural resources, did
not result in a commensurate increase in jobs; furthermore, a greater share of the
most rewarding jobs required higher levels of education, an asset many of the poor
lack, thus limiting their participation in the growth process. Value added from
hydropower generation and mining accounted for 10 out of the 14 percentage points
increase of the non-agriculture sectors’ share of economic output, but its direct13 share of
employment increased by less than half a percentage point (Figure 28) after creating less
than 20,000 of the 400,000 non-agriculture jobs created during that time. The rest were
created in services and manufacturing and were mainly captured by people with post-
secondary education (Figure 29), a greater share of them coming from non-poor families.

79.     A complex interaction of concentration of growth in the resource sector, of non-
farm wage jobs in urban areas, declining agriculture prices in rural areas and lower
education attainment at the bottom of the distribution drove inequality. This was
characterized by a widening rural-urban gap and rising inequality in urban areas within and
across provinces, reflecting differences in opportunities for different groups of people within
Vientiane capital and between the capital and the rest of the country. Unfavorable agriculture
prices in 2012 slowed income growth among rural households while boosting that of urban
households, who also had higher household endowments and access to more rewarding
economic opportunities. High returns to education explain the widening gap within urban

13The natural sectors also contributed indirectly to job creation through trickling down of rents as well as
through improved supply with electricity of households and businesses.

High vulnerability faced by households across the entire distribution is a drag to
poverty reduction and shared prosperity

80.     Upward economic mobility is high, but so is the risk of falling back. The high
churning is reflected by the large number of people who fell back into poverty even as many
others escaped, slowing the pace of poverty reduction. About 63 percent of people who were
poor in 2007/8 became non-poor in 2012/13 but more than half of them moved only up to
50 percent above the poverty line (Figure 30). At the same time, half the people who were
poor in 2012/13 were previously non-poor. The risk of falling into poverty is highest among
those closer to the poverty line (19 percent and 14 percent of those between 1 to 1.5 and 1.5
to 2 times the poverty line, respectively, fell back into poverty in 2012/13) but this reflects
high backward mobility in general. About half the people whose consumption was more than
double the poverty line in 2007/08 slid to a lower consumption group in 2012/13.
Vulnerability is a problem faced by households across the entire welfare distribution.

81.    Agricultural households were the most vulnerable to shocks emanating from
farm produce price fluctuations, loss of land, and adverse weather conditions. Initially,
higher agriculture prices between 2002/03 and 2007/08 contributed to poverty reduction
in rural areas, but declining prices in the central and south provinces in 2012 reversed some
of those gains. More than half of the bottom 40 percent in Lao PDR are net sellers of rice, thus
more of the poor and less well-off benefit from increases in rice prices and are hurt by lower

prices received by farmers as noted earlier. Climate change exacerbates weather risks and
affects the majority of farmers.

82.    In general, households are poorly equipped to deal with frequent shocks and
largely rely on informal social networks. In the absence of an adequate safety net, risk
management rests entirely on the household, often leading to behaviors that reinforce the
cycle of poverty or push families into poverty, including, reducing caloric intake, trading
valuable assets, borrowing money, and unsafe migration (World Bank, 2015b). With just 12
percent of the population covered by health insurance (mostly public and private sector
wage workers), health shocks and catastrophic out-of–pocket (OOP) expenditures are
another risk faced by households in the country. The proportion of households incurring
catastrophic health expenditures, which financially distressed households cover through
borrowing, rose to 5 percent in 2012/13. The likelihood of falling into poverty in 2012/13
was 14 percentage points higher for previously non-poor households (in 2007/08) who
borrowed to pay for hospitalization expenses when compared to other households with
similar characteristics. High out-of-pocket expenditures are also a huge barrier to access
health care (Powel-Jackson & Lindelow, 2010), further disadvantaging the poor, particularly
in rural areas. About 26 percent of respondents in a recent survey (Finmark Trust, 2015)
were going without medical care altogether due to unaffordability of care.

83.     Low financial inclusion further lowers ability to mitigate risks. Only 20 percent
of the population has borrowed, and only half of them from the formal financial sector. Less
than 3 percent of the adult population is covered by life and non-life insurance companies
and a pension system that is financially sustainable is not available. About 28 percent of the

adult population relies exclusively on informal mechanisms to manage risks, while an
additional 26 percent do not have any financial services (formal or informal) they could use
to mitigate risks (Finmark Trust, 2015). The latter experience the maximum welfare loss
from any shocks which easily pushes them into poverty.

Non-monetary dimensions of welfare which drive poverty reduction in the long term
are lagging

84.    Human development outcomes, in general, are still lagging with gaps emerging
in early life. Despite some progress against monetary poverty, gaps in other dimensions of
well-being remain large and require further investment in human assets to close them. The
proportion of stunted under-five-year-olds declined by only 4 percentage points over a
decade, from 48 percent in 2001 to 44 percent in 2012, yet poverty declined by more than 8
percentage points over that time. Similar trends appear to have persisted since.14
Consequently, Lao PDR did not meet the MDG on stunting even as it has already achieved the
goal of halving extreme poverty. Poverty declined fastest in Northern provinces—especially
among households living close to the China-Myanmar and Vietnamese borders. The North in
general still has very high prevalence of stunting and under-five mortality and has low rates
of net secondary school enrollment, just like the South, and a lower proportion of fully
immunized children.

85.     The prevailing high rate of stunting is an epitome of slower progress in human
development in Lao PDR, which puts many children at lifelong disadvantage. Child
stunting is a well-established risk marker and proxy population indicator for a host of
physical and environmental deprivations, namely chronic malnutrition, which impair child
development. Early-life stunting is associated with poor cognitive and educational outcomes
in childhood and adolescence, as well as lower wage earnings.

86.     Teenage pregnancies accentuate intergenerational transmission of
malnutrition. The process of brain development is most rapid during the first 1,000 days of
life from conception to the child’s birthday, when maternal, and later child, nutrition and
health have the greatest influence upon later life outcomes. Conversely, the culture of early
marriages and teenage pregnancies initiates the intergenerational transmission of
malnutrition as teenage mothers are more likely to deliver underweight babies and follow
traditional practices which may be counterproductive. In 2012, one in five females aged
between 15 and 19 either had a child or was pregnant while 35 percent of girls aged 18 were
married, compared to 9 percent in Vietnam and 18 percent in Cambodia. A profile of low
education, high poverty, non-Lao Tai ethnicity and rural residence emerges. About 72
percent of teenage pregnancies is among girls with primary education or less. Teenage
pregnancies are higher in rural areas (24 percent), especially remote ones. Young mothers


14 Two surveys which contained information on nutrition and stunting were undertaken in 2015. Both surveys

show a reduction in the stunting rate; and in the case of one of the surveys a more significant reduction (United
Nations Children’s Fund [UNICEF] survey on Child Anthropometric Assessment Report shows a stunting rate
of 25 percent). However, the surveys are not fully comparable to the Lao Social Indicator Survey (LSIS) which
is the primary source of data on malnutrition. The next round of the LSIS will be undertaken in 2017.

                                                                                                  41 | P a g e

are at greater risk of giving birth to a low birth weight baby, an indication of early growth
faltering.

87.     Practices around breastfeeding and feeding in early years are increasing the
risk of malnutrition. Early, exclusive, and continued breastfeeding is known to reduce child
risk of illness and death, as well as improve child cognition. However, in Lao PDR, only 40
percent of infants (0–5 months) are exclusively breastfed exposing them to food-borne and
environmental pathogens. Gender issues related to women’s education and decision making,
distribution of farm- and non-farm labor, and childcare practices are associated with
behaviors that impede achievement of optimal nutritional status for women, infants, and
young children.

88.     The origins of non-monetary poverty are traced to early life, with many Lao
children entering life and continuing to primary school without receiving services and
opportunities to allow them to maximize their potential. In 2011, 75 percent of women
from the bottom 20 percent of the wealth distribution did not receive any antenatal care,
compared to only 6.6 percent in the wealthiest. This points to considerable gaps in access to
health services amongst the most vulnerable groups, and also leads to low coverage of
essential nutrition interventions, such as iron supplementation during pregnancy, which can
improve maternal nutritional status, as well as child health outcomes and cognition in later
life. More than 75 percent of women in the poorest wealth quintile and 60 percent of women
in the second-lowest did not receive any iron pills during their previous pregnancy. Facility-
based delivery rates, though increasing, are low (38 percent) and differ between
socioeconomic groups.

89.    Access to and the quality of other services has improved, but gaps remain which
contribute to weakly improving human development indicators for the more
vulnerable. While poor diet and low diversity of complementary foods partly explain the lag
between consumption-based poverty and nutrition, lack of access to improved water and
sanitation along with low parental education are statistically significant determinants of
stunting in Lao PDR. About 70 percent of households had access to improved toilets in
2012/13, up from 59 percent five years before. However, half of the bottom 40 percent had
no toilet in 2012/13, compared to 26 percent without a toilet among the top 60 percent.
Around 73 percent of children from the richest households attend early childhood education
compared to only 5 percent of children in the poorest households. On the other hand, in
primary education, both access to schools and enrollment rates have been equalized. Gaps
open up again in secondary education. While secondary enrollment has increased overall, it
remains lower among poor households, who are also more likely to be located further from
secondary schools. The net secondary enrollment is almost 56 percent among the non-poor
but only 28 percent among the poor (Figure 32). Transport connectivity, proximity to
schools and health centers are also lower for the bottom 40 percent when compared to
others (Figure 31). This lack of access partly explains those in traditionally poor regions
lagging behind in human development outcomes even as they begin to make gains on
monetary poverty.

Education

90.    The 2014 Lao PDR Development Report found that many workers lack
foundational skills such as the ability to read, suggesting an agenda that goes beyond
the poor and affects the entire country. Without these foundational skills, people will
struggle even in the most basic jobs and teaching them more skills would be very hard.

91.    Lao PDR children spend fewer
years in schooling compared to peers.            Figure 33: Learning outcomes are poor
The country increased net enrollment in          (% of student in respective grade scoring zero)

secondary education is low (only 44.7

5.1 years with only 10 percent of the workforce completing upper-secondary, and 5 percent
having either vocational or tertiary degrees.

92.     Education outcomes are poor. While enrollment rates have improved, universal
primary school education is still far from being attained, if measured by whether all children
complete the level and end up functionally literate (United Nations Population Fund, 2015).
The early grade reading assessment found that almost one-third of students in grade 2
scored zero on fluency and 57 percent scored zero on comprehension. The lack of knowledge
of the Lao language among minorities is a major factor affecting their performance at school.
The low enrollment in early childhood education contributes to the education challenges in
Lao PDR as the best window for child brain development is missed. According to LSIS, only
23 percent of children aged 36–59 months attend organized early childhood education, with
strong geographic disparities: early childhood education participation is 55 percent among
urban children of the same age group, compared to 15 percent of rural children.

93.      The education sector has been underfunded until recently. Spending on
education as a percentage of GDP was only 2.9 percent in 2011/12, on par with some
countries in the region (Cambodia), but low compared to lower-middle-income countries as
well as most of the selected peers (Bolivia, Botswana, Nepal) and countries in the region
(Vietnam, Thailand). Spending appears to have increased since to around 3.7 percent of GDP;
still, most likely the increase has been taken up by higher spending on wages. Consequently,
schools have limited services and low-quality facilities (almost half of the schools in Lao PDR
have a roof that leaks; only slightly more than half of the schools have a water supply, only
20 percent have electricity and fewer than half of the schools have toilets). Access to more
modern appliances (phones, ICT) is even more restricted (World Bank, 2012a). Low non-
wage recurrent expenditures (school materials, equipment, teacher training, and so on) also
means households have to pay non-mandatory fees for schooling which may affect access to
education for children from poor families.

94.    Physical access to education is uneven. Overall and given changing population
dynamics; more schools are unlikely to be needed. Also, pupil-teacher ratios in primary and
secondary education, at 25.6 and 17.8, respectively, are not excessive (UN Women, 2015).
However, almost 57 percent of all primary schools and 70 percent of primary schools in
poorest districts do not offer all five grades of primary education. Providing education
services is difficult in remote areas which disproportionately affects children in the poorest
areas, particularly girls and non-Lao Tai ethnic groups.

Health

95.     Health indicators are improving, but the less well-off are benefiting less. Life
expectancy has been increasing and reached 68 years in 2014. Under-five mortality rates
have been reduced to below 70 per 1,000 live births and the maternal mortality ratio is
estimated to have fallen from 796 per 100,000 live births in 1995 to 220 in 2014. Household
air pollution, largely due to the use of solid fuels for cooking, is a declining, but still among
the largest contributors to premature death and disability, disproportionally affecting the
poor. According to (Finmark Trust, 2015), 79 percent of the population did not feel in good

                                                                                    44 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                     Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


health. The health network claims to cover 93 percent of the population at an average walk
of 90 minutes to a health facility. For slightly more than half of the population, the nearest
hospital was within 10 km while 85 percent of households had a health center within the
same distance. There are, however, major differences across geographical and social factors.
Inequities are greatest in rural areas, where households in the highest-income quintile have
an in-patient admission rate of 42.4 per 1,000 population, nearly three times the rate of 15.9
for households in the lowest-income quintile. Similarly, only one-quarter of the poor live in
villages with a medical practitioner compared to one-half of the non-poor.

96.     Insufficient public health sector inputs keeps private spending high and makes
health shocks a major determinant of poverty. With around 2.17 health workers per
1,000 population, Lao PDR’s health system is classified as facing a critical shortage of staff
(WHO and Ministry of Health, Lao PDR, 2012). Furthermore, with the government spending
less than 2 percent of GDP on health, the reliance on private spending and official
development assistance (ODA) is high. Government spending on health increased to around
US$30 per capita in recent years, above levels seen in Myanmar, but below the selected and
regional peers (Bolivia, Botswana, Nepal, Vietnam) as well as the average for lower-middle-
income countries of around US$90 per person in 2014. OOP payments account for around
40 percent of total health expenditure and, as noted earlier, prevent many households (26
percent) from seeking healthcare services and often lead to catastrophic health
expenditures. Critical preventive programs (immunization, family planning, maternal care,
HIV/AIDS) are largely reliant on assistance from development partners and may come at risk
as the country’s income level increases. Health financing programs such as Health Equity
Funds (HEFs) and the Free Maternal and Child Health program remain fragmented.
Institutional arrangements are weak, and reliance on external technical assistance remains
high, creating further challenges to the country’s readiness to witness an impending donor
transition.

97.    Quality of services is poor. Minimum requirement quality standards have been
prescribed; however, it is unclear if these adequately measure quality of services and are
enforced. The physical infrastructure is largely amortized and availability of modern
technology is limited; the only magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner in the country
opened in 2015 while smaller hospitals and health centers lack basic medical equipment for
simple diagnostics and treatment. Service quality is criticized, and there is dissatisfaction
with the attitudes and practices of public sector health-care providers, complex service
procedures and long waiting times (The Lao People's Democratic Republic health system
review, 2014). Corruption is allegedly widespread. Perceived poor responsiveness of
services results in low demand for services and utilization rates, and use of services across
the border.

Access to basic utilities (electrification, rural roads, water supply, and sanitation)

98.   Access to water supply and sanitation is improving; however, gaps remain and
disproportionally affect the poor. Economic losses due to poor sanitation were estimated
at US$193 million per year in 2006 (equivalent to 5.6 percent of GDP at the time), mostly
from the estimated 3 million diseases and 6,000 premature deaths annually and the

                                                                                         45 | P a g e

economic costs of water pollution (World Bank Water and Sanitation Program, 2009).
According to the World Health Organization (WHO)/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme,
71 percent of households had access to improved sanitation, above the MDG target of 65
percent. However, in rural areas, where the majority of the poor live, access remained at only
56 percent. While coverage with improved access was almost universal for the households
belonging to the highest quintile, the figure was only 13 percent for the poorest quintile
(World Bank, 2015). Without full access to improved sanitation, open defecation is
widespread and increases health risks, including for infectious diseases, one the major
causes of malnutrition. Access to improved water supply is higher (76 percent) with lower
inequities across urban and rural communities, though significant part is with questionable
sustainability and safety.

99.     The length of the road network has increased by around 50 percent over the
last decade; however, some areas, mostly rural, still remain disconnected, either
during the wet season or throughout the year. Two-thirds of villages were connected with
an all season road according to the 2011 Agriculture Census, leaving a quarter of villages
with road access only during the dry season road and 9 percent having no road access.
According to the 2015 Census, 7.9 percent of the population lived in villages without roads,
compared to 21 percent a decade earlier. Still, almost 50 percent of the rural roads were
classified as being in bad and failed condition. The poor state of roads is also a growing cause
of mortality and serious injury. Road traffic injuries are the ninth leading cause of death and
the second fastest growing, costing the country an estimated 2.7 percent of GDP in 2010
according to the WHO.

100. The electrification program in Lao PDR, which is one of most successful such
programs in the region, is entering the final stage, as the rate of electrification
approaches 90 percent of households. However, according to the 2015 Census, 15 percent
of the population lived in villages without electricity. Furthermore, only 58 percent of the
bottom 40 percent were connected to electricity in 2012/13, compared to 87 percent among
the top 60 percent.

101. If not managed, the ongoing urbanization can lead to grouping of people and
accumulation of assets in hazardous places and unsafe structures. While urban
population is still around one-third of the population, the urban population has been
growing fast and its contribution in consumption is already above 50 percent. However,
urbanization appears to be taking place in an unplanned and disorganized pattern due to
lack of resources, inadequate legal framework, and weak planning and implementation
capacity. With increases in population and the number of vehicles, the traffic conditions in
Vientiane are deteriorating. The city is starting to experience congestion and related
problems of accidents and deteriorating air quality. Missing links in the road network, poor
maintenance of water supply infrastructure, flooding and clogged drains, and disposal of
untreated waste constrain the productive capacity of urban areas, making them less
competitive and livable (Asian Development Bank, 2010). Cities are also unprepared to
manage disaster risks, lacking both engineered (such as dikes, canals, or ecosystem-based
systems) as well as non-engineered (such as early warning, drills, and emergency planning)
measures.

102. Progress continues to be made on dealing with UXOs; however, these still affect
a big part of the country. Since 1996, 55,000 ha have been cleared of UXOs, a fraction of the
8.7 million ha (36 percent of the total territory) estimated to have been contaminated, due
to capacity and funding constraints. Still, the number of casualties has been declining (from
3,000 in 2008 to 45 in 2014) as the authorities introduced a more result-based methodology
(The Lao People's Democratic Republic, 2015).

   4. Can the current model be sustained?
Despite strong headline GDP growth and some poverty reduction, a wide range of risks put into
question the robustness of Lao PDR’s development path. Growing public debt burden, systemic
risks in the financial sector as well as low buffers may test macroeconomic stability which can
ignite inflation, lower living standards, and hurt public services delivery. Continued
environmental degradation will hurt livelihoods and undermine growth prospects; and
together with climate change will increase the already high risks from natural disasters. If any
of these risks materialize, the poor are likely to be most affected as they have the least options
to mitigate risks.

Elevated macroeconomic risks

103. Lao PDR has been running a large investment–savings imbalance over the last
decade reflecting supply- and demand-side choices and policies. Growth prospects in
mining, hydropower, and more recently real estate development attracted strong
investment. Furthermore, public capital spending increased in an effort to address the
country’s infrastructure gap. At the same time, accommodative macroeconomic policies, a
possibly overvalued exchange rate, and financial sector deepening added to robust domestic
demand which in an environment of uncompetitive domestic production lowered domestic
savings. Strong FDI inflows financed a large part of the current account deficit and together
with robust growth resulted in total external debt declining from 122 percent of GDP in 2003
to 76 percent by 2011. However, a rapid debt-financed widening of the current account
deficit since 2011 increased total external debt to 98 percent of GDP by 2016, a level much

however, with limited success. The Economic Outlook database.
fiscal deficit averaged around 5 percent of GDP between 2013 and 2016 and could be as high
as 6.2 percent of GDP in 2016. This, together with significant amounts of debt-financed public
spending outside of the budget pushed public debt to an estimated 68 percent of GDP by end-
2016 (compared to 38 percent of GDP for emerging and developing Asia and 43 percent of
GDP for the sample of 49 resource-rich countries), elevating the risk of debt distress to high.
Going forward, financing needs will significantly grow and average around 21 percent of
total revenues during 2016–2020, up from 10 percent of revenues in recent years, as
increasing amounts of borrowing, including some on non-concessional terms, start to
mature. This will divert resources from other priority areas. Already in 2016, interest
expenditures are expected to be around 1.5 percent of GDP, exceeding the budgetary
allocation for the agriculture sector and slightly below the budgetary allocation to the health
sector. Furthermore, failure to adjust the fiscal balance going forward, cost overruns on large
infrastructure projects that are borne by Lao PDR, as well as larger exchange rate
disturbances would mean that debt servicing could easily become unsustainable.

105. Fiscal pressures stem from a narrow tax base and the inability to collect a fair
share of revenues from natural resource use. Lao PDR fiscal revenues reached around 23
percent of GDP in FY14/15, a strong improvement from around 15 percent of GDP in the
middle of the last decade. However, excluding revenues from natural resources and grants,
domestic collection effort is limited which became visible in this year as revenues slumped

                                                                                                           49 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                   Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


to 19 percent of GDP. This puts Lao PDR around the average for ASEAN countries and peers
such as Cambodia and Nepal, but below the average for lower-middle-income countries
(24.7 percent of GDP on average during 2013–2016) and resource-rich peers such as
Botswana and Bolivia (even after removing resource revenues). Weaknesses in tax policy
and administration result in the tax burden disproportionately affecting the relatively small
formal sector of the economy. Tax rates, in general, are not excessive compared
internationally, with most rates in ranges similar to countries in the region. The ‘total’ tax
rate is estimated at around 26.2 percent of profits, below 33.9 percent in EAP on average and
38.3 in lower-middle-income countries on average, similar to Botswana but higher
compared to Cambodia (21 percent) and Zambia (18.6 percent).15 However, the existence of
‘presumptive taxation’ (where a lump-sum payment based on turnover is made in lieu of all
tax obligation) for small companies together with a weak capacity to assess turnover results
in significant under-declaration of revenues and a leakage of government revenues and is an
incentive for firms to stay small and informal. In addition, tax exemptions are widely used to
attract investment, and are often poorly targeted, discretionary, and generous. In addition,
the contribution of the natural resources to fiscal revenues has been less than commensurate
(Box 5), reflecting significant unrecorded mining and logging activity but also low royalty
rates on some power projects. This may partly reflect the nature of the hydro sector
development in Lao PDR, mostly with private sector financing and at market terms; however,
even some projects in Lao PDR undertaken with private sector involvement (including more
recently negotiated agreements) do suggest that higher royalty rates are possible.
Importantly, strengthened macroeconomic management will lower country risk and the
financing costs of hydro projects in Lao PDR, allowing projects to remain viable even with
higher royalty rates.

106. Efforts to address the large infrastructure gap and inefficient spending are
adding to fiscal stress. Since the mid-2000s, government expenditures increased by above
10 percentage points of GDP to reach 29 percent of GDP in 2013, before falling to 27 percent
of GDP in 2015 and further to an estimated 25.2 percent of GDP in 2016. This puts Lao PDR’s
expenditures considerably above the ASEAN average as well as peers like Cambodia and
Nepal and slightly below the average for low-income countries. The increase reflects both
higher recurrent spending (wage increases as well as additional hiring) as well as a large
capital spending. With revenues falling below targets, arrears emerged forcing the
government to introduce a wage-freeze, lower recruitment, and restrict capital spending to
projects approved by the National Assembly. However, arrears continue to linger on, with
arrears at the Ministry of Public Works and Transport estimated at around US$1.4 billion, or
around 11 percent of GDP. This is affecting the liquidity and profitability of suppliers as well
as the health of the financial sector as contractors on public projects are unable to regularly
service their obligations to banks. In addition, the quality of public services could be affected
as unpaid civil servants reduce work efforts as they pursue other activities to compensate
for the reduced monetary inflows. Despite the difficult fiscal situation, the authorities have
proposed a number of big infrastructure projects, including the Lao PDR section of the

proposed Kunming-Singapore rail line16 which will keep the deficit and public debt levels
elevated and requiring careful management.

                             Box 5: Fiscal impact of natural resources use
 Despite increasing output, the contribution of resource revenues to the budget has been limited. Total
 natural resource rents between 2000 and 2011 were 9.6 percent of GDP, compared to 14 percent of GDP in
 Vietnam or 12.5 percent in Indonesia (World Bank, 2014g). Still, this places Lao PDR above the Kyrgyz
 Republic and Tajikistan (both landlocked with significant hydropower and mining potential) as well as
 Cambodia and Thailand. Revenue collection from hydropower and mining increased from about 2.7 percent
 of GDP in FY06/07 to about 4.3 percent in FY11/12 as commodity prices peaked during 2011–2012. Mining
 revenue is, in general, more volatile as it depends on the ore resource availability and commodity prices.
 Lower copper and gold prices as well as depletion at the main mines lowered fiscal revenues from mining
 to about 1.6 percent of GDP (US$195 million) in FY14/15. Also, most of the revenues come from the two
 large mines, which face a relatively high effective tax rates compared internationally. Hydropower revenue
 on the other hand, tends to be more stable due to predetermined prices and power output. Still, so far, the
 sector’s contribution to fiscal revenues has been relatively small (up to US$130 million, or 1.1 percent of
 GDP, in FY14/15) but is expected to gradually increase to around US$300 million by 2025 and faster
 afterwards once major power projects start operation, tax exemptions expire, and assets are transferred to
 Lao PDR ownership. Tax revenues from timber have considerably lagged behind the increase in timber
 exports. Internal World Bank estimates put the foregone fiscal revenues at around US$100–120 million, or
 1 percent of GDP, in 2014 given exports of US$1.6 billion; however, this may have declined more recently as
 royalty collection improved in 2015, while exports decreased.


107. Despite a surge in expenditures, some sectors remain underfunded and
delivery and quality of essential services suffers. Government spending reached US$3.4
billion in 2016, a 70 percent increase in five years. The increase in spending has been
directed towards transport and energy, as well as sectors such as education (2.9 percent of
GDP in FY11/12, though this was planned to increase to 3.7 percent of GDP in FY15/16),
health (0.7 percent of GDP in FY11/12, planned to increase to 1.9 percent of GDP in
FY15/16), agriculture, and so on. Despite envisaged increases in the budget allocations for
education and health, non-wage non-capital spending remains low (for example, around 11
percent of the total education budget). Lack of functional classification of budget
expenditures prevents a more detailed analysis of sectoral budget allocations. At the same
time, poor public investment management and weaknesses in public procurement put in
question the value for money of government spending. A 2011 IMF evaluation of public
investment management practices in 71 countries ranked Lao PDR 64 with especially weak
selection and evaluation processes (International Monetary Fund, 2011). Furthermore,
many projects were undertaken outside of the formal budget approval process. A review of
23 such ‘pre-financed’ projects in the road sector (projects financed by a private contractor
with an agreement for later repayment by the Government) found that the cost per kilometer

16 The project has been estimated at US$6.7 billion, out of which 40 percent will be provided by a joint venture

company formed between Lao PDR and China. Lao PDR will need to contribute with 30 percent in the capital
of this company (or around US$700 million). Around US$480 million will be borrowed from China in annual
installments over the medium term while the rest will be allocated from the budget. The joint venture company
will need to secure the remaining 60 percent of the project costs. Lao PDR Ministry of Finance (MOF) has noted
that no sovereign guarantee will be provided. According to the 2012 Feasibility, the internal rate of return (IRR)
is 4.56 percent and the repayment period of investment is 23 years.

resulted in over-capacity and that undertaken liabilities exceeded significantly the capital
budgets in the surveyed provinces.

108. Lao PDR’s monetary and exchange rate policies have had competing, and at
times conflicting objectives. In addition to price stability, monetary policy has focused on
increasing availability of credit as well as supporting budget execution. Monetary conditions
were loose for most of the last decade, including through negative real policy interest rate,
though falling inflation reversed this in recent years (the effectiveness of the interest rate
channel in Lao PDR is unclear). Also, direct lending by the Bank of Lao PDR (BOL) as well as
issuance of debt have added to domestic demand and complicated the goal of preserving the

million in September 2016, covered only around a quarter of foreign currency deposits in
the banking sector and around two months of imports. Backed by BOL interventions, the
official exchange rate of the kip against the U.S. dollar remained stable in recent years and
resulted in appreciation of the kip’s real effective exchange rate, with the appreciation over
the last five years reaching around 30 percent. The continued real appreciation of the
exchange rate signals a loss of competitiveness of Lao PDR’s exports; though wage and unit
labor costs indicators remain below what is expected at the country’s income level.
Furthermore, the credibility of the de facto pegged exchange rate in an environment of low
reserves has been tested in recent months as reported shortages of foreign exchange
resulted in a 5 percent gap opening up between the official and curb markets and added to
the difficulties of doing business.

109. The opening up of the banking sector resulted in significant deepening. By mid-
2016, Lao PDR had around 40 commercial banks compared to around a dozen in 2005 while
an additional 95 microfinance institutions were also licensed in 2016. As a result, the size of
the banking sector increased rapidly and credit to the private sector reached around 55
percent of GDP by 2015, up from the low base of 10 percent of GDP a decade earlier. This
was accompanied with strong deposit growth, keeping the loan-deposit ratio below one.
However, more recent credit growth appears to be also fueled by rapid growth in foreign
liabilities of the banking sector which reached around 20 percent of GDP by mid-2016 (up
from 9 percent of GDP at the end of 2012). In addition, almost half of the deposits are in
foreign currency, a high level given the limited foreign reserves cover.

110. With weak regulatory and supervisory capacity and only limited commercial
orientation of state-owned banks, the system is exposed to risks. While the
concentration has been decreasing, the four state-owned commercial banks still account for
46 percent of all assets (56 percent in 2012), 59 percent of all deposits (64 percent in 2012),
and 47 percent of all loans (65 percent in 2012). A number of private banks, mostly foreign
owned, have been expanding their market share in recent years. Officially, NPLs were
estimated at 3.2 percent; however, BOL regulations that put a cap on NPLs at 3 percent could
be creating incentives for commercial banks to understate NPLs. State-owned banks appear
to be particularly vulnerable with high NPLs (8.2 percent in mid-2014) and minimal capital
adequacy (2.9 percent in mid-2014). Parts of the banking sector (incorporated as branches)
are supervised by regulators with sound capacity (for example, from Malaysia or Thailand);
however, risks could be higher in domestic banks and some regional banks coming from
jurisdictions with weaker standards. Limited data availability prevents a more detailed
analysis, but lack of transparency is fueling concerns. Asked about the soundness of the
banks, executives in Lao PDR companies gave an average score of 4.5 (on a scale of 1–7) in
2015-2016, down from 4.8 two years before.17 If unresolved, these issues may threaten fiscal
solvency, financial sector stability, and macroeconomic stability and undermine trust in the
system. At the same time, healthy (mostly smaller) banks remain conservative.

Significant disaster risks and the impact of climate change, exacerbated by
rapid exploitation of natural resources is affecting the environment and
livelihoods

111. Disasters risks are significant, with a disproportionate impact over the poor.
Most frequent disasters are floods and storms and, to a lesser degree, droughts which keep
the large share of the population engaged in farming or fishing vulnerable. Environmental
degradation and unplanned urbanization are adding to disaster risks. The poor routinely
bear the brunt since their homes are fragile and often in low-lying environments and
disasters cause largest losses to their sources of livelihoods. While Lao PDR’s exposure risk
is lower compared to countries in the region, weak economic and social conditions, including
low capacity for disaster risk management (DRM), is keeping vulnerability high (United
Nations University - EHS, 2016). This reflects significant underfunding of DRM activities, lack
of a comprehensive investment strategy and nascent and evolving institutional structure.
Currently, the Government uses different reserve funds and contingent budget allocations,
which have proven to be insufficient to cover even recurrent disaster losses. As a result, the
Government, households, and businesses absorb most of the disaster risk for damage to their
assets. Disasters-related emergency costs account for around 30 percent of road budget
annually. Historical damage data indicate that annual expected losses range between 3.3
percent and 4.1 percent of GDP with the associated average annual fiscal cost equaling
approximately 2.3 percent of government expenditures. Among the ASEAN countries, Lao
PDR faces the highest 100-year probable maximum loss relative to GDP with estimated
losses as high as 13.9 percent of GDP. Also, around 188,000 rural households (46 percent of
rural population) are estimated to be at risk of food insecurity caused by drought.

112. Climate change is adding to the vulnerability by changing weather patterns and
resulting in more frequent and severe extreme events. Already, rainfall has become
more volatile and temperatures have been increasing by around 0.1°C per decade since the
second half of the last century.18 Projections include further increases in temperature and
increased intensity and frequency of extreme events, including higher rainfall and flooding
risks during wet season—which will affect agricultural lands along the Mekong River and
tributaries—and longer dry seasons accompanied by more severe water shortage. If
unprepared, these changes will put into question any gains in other areas. While the costliest
disaster still remains a 1993 storm, three of the five costliest events have taken place since
2009, including two floods in a single year 2013.19 The 2015–2016 El Niño has been one of
the strongest and has affected Lao PDR through lower yields, reduced hydropower
production, and damages from storms. Climate change will also affect the existing network
of dams and their power generation capacity, whose minimum annual value of hydroelectric
production at risk was estimated to be about US$283 million (USAID, 2014).

113. Lao PDR’s natural resources—minerals, forests, water resources,20 and
biodiversity21—have been intensively exploited, further increasing risks. At 12.2
percent of GNI in 2014, the rate of natural resource depletion in Lao PDR is significantly
above the rate in lower-middle-income countries and most regional and structural peers
(Vietnam, Cambodia, Nepal, Botswana). The cost of environment degradation was estimated
at above 7 percent of GDP in 2013 with forest depletion, pollution, and greenhouse gas
emissions contributing most. Lao PDR moved from being a sink of greenhouse gases in 1990
to a net (though small) emitter of greenhouse gases by 2000, due largely to land-use change
and depletion of forests. In mining, hydropower, and agriculture plantation projects,
concession agreements are frequently signed before the Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) is approved, jeopardizing the enforcement of the EIA conditions as part of the
concession implementation. Poor coordination among different government agencies leads
to the concession of the same area to more than one project. Deforestation rates, until
recently, were estimated to be above 1 percent per year. This is affecting forest-dependent
households, leading to soil erosion and accelerated sedimentation of hydropower reservoirs,
exacerbating weather-related risks, affecting wildlife populations and undermining the
future growth of sectors like tourism and clean agriculture.

114. The decline in the extent and quality of natural forest ecosystems also signals
threats to biodiversity. The deteriorating forest cover threatens biodiversity, but so do
subsistence hunting and passive government response to wildlife trafficking and protected
area degradation. Lao PDR is a wildlife trafficking hub with trade routes to Vietnam and

20 Construction of hydropower plants can lead to deforestation and ensuing soil erosion. By changing the water

regime in the river they are on, hydropower plants can also significantly impact fisheries, biodiversity, and
downstream agriculture.
21 Biodiversity: Up to 8 percent of the national protected area system is under hydropower or mining

concessions, and wildlife trafficking is an ongoing phenomenon. Capacity and political willingness to control
wildlife trafficking is severely limited.

                                                                                                55 | P a g e

China; though traders and consumers increasingly operate within Lao PDR. In response, the
authorities established the Lao Wildlife Enforcement Network and the Prime Minister issued
a notice to enforce the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES). Discussions have started on biodiversity offsets and reforming national protected
area management.

115. This is particularly important for Lao PDR where poverty and environment are
closely intertwined. A significant part of the population, especially the rural poor, depend
on natural resources for their livelihoods. Although data are inconsistent and incomplete it
is clear that forest resources provide an important range of products to consumers. For
forest-dependent households, forestry and agricultural activities are believed to contribute
between 30 to 70 percent to income. Inland fish and other aquatic animals provide nearly
half of all animal protein consumed by people, and 70 percent of rural households fish at
least part-time. In 2015, as many as 31 percent of rural households relied on unimproved
and open unprotected surface water.

   5. Toward ending extreme poverty and promoting shared
      prosperity
Pathways for strong, inclusive, and sustainable growth

116. Lao PDR has ambitious goals for the next decade. It aims to grow at 7.5 percent
per year, reduce poverty, and ensure the sustainable use of its natural resources. While the
goals are ambitious, Lao PDR’s assets and its location in the dynamic Southeast Asia region
make this development path possible.

117. With its abundance of natural resources and relatively low endowments of
other assets, Lao PDR’s growth prospects in the near future will be closely linked to
the resource sectors. It would be important to make growth more inclusive compared to
the recent history, and a recent World Bank report on development in resource-rich
countries provides important lessons on how countries like Lao PDR can ensure that natural
resources contribute to making progress toward the twin goals. It concludes that countries
should not aim to diversify their production structures. Australia, Canada, and Chile are
examples of high-income countries where natural resource and resource-intensive goods
still account for a high share of exports. Malaysia and Costa Rica are examples of countries
that are on the verge of becoming high-income countries. Instead, countries should aim to
diversify their assets, that is, achieve a better balance between natural resources, physical
and human capital, and institutions. The experience of these countries underscores the
importance of (a) advancing integration, including by using the natural resources; (b) getting
a fair share of resource rents; and (c) converting these into human and physical assets to
gradually open up opportunities outside of the resource sectors and ‘diversify naturally’.
While economic activity may, over the medium term, become more concentrated, good jobs
will still be created, including in services, a more productive agriculture and niche
manufacturing sectors. The framework also argues for strengthening key economic
institutions early in the development process (see Annex 2 for application to Malaysia).

                                                                                  57 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                    Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


118. Being a small, landlocked country, Lao PDR’s growth prospects depend on
closer integration. Prosperous economies succeeded by integrating and did that with the
assets they were abundant with. Lao PDR is not an exception. It has been increasingly
integrating, largely on the back of its natural resources, and there is still untapped potential.
A well-functioning regional power market will provide opportunities for Lao PDR to reap the
benefits from its power sector potential (Box 6). Also, being next door to China, the global
leader in outbound tourism, and a growing environmentally conscious middle class in the
region is improving the prospects of higher-value-added, nature-based, and labor-intensive
sectors, such as ecotourism and organic agriculture. Costa Rica provides a good example of
the opportunities available from nature-based tourism and the required policies (Annex 4).
A regional labor market can provide jobs for Lao workers but also meet the skills shortages
in the Lao economy. Over time, as human and physical capital levels improve, the areas in
which Lao PDR would be able to effectively participate in regional economic flows will grow.
The efforts under the AEC and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)
frameworks will provide opportunities for further integration as Lao PDR implements the
commitments it undertakes.

119. Building on this framework as well as the experience of Lao PDR and peer
countries, this Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) suggests that to ensure strong,
sustainable, and inclusive growth, Lao PDR will need to make progress on three
pathways and one cross-cutting theme. Pathway 1 focuses on sustainably and efficiently
managing the country’s natural resources. This is critical to deliver strong growth as well as
to secure resources needed to build Lao PDR endowments of human and physical assets.
Pathway 2 focuses on boosting agriculture and improving the environment for the private
sector to increase farmers’ incomes and create non-farm jobs. It draws on the experience of
Lao PDR and peer countries in reducing poverty and providing opportunities to people.
Finally, Pathway 3 emphasizes improvements in human capital required to increase the
ability of people to grab those opportunities as well as measures to address the high
vulnerability. Strengthening institutions and governance is a critical cross-cutting challenge
that affects progress in each of the three areas above. The proposed pathways can be easily
mapped to the three main outcomes of the 8th NSEDP.

120. Importantly, Lao PDR’s growth pattern needs to become greener and more
resilient. First, Lao PDR’s growth produced a large environmental footprint. With the cost
of environment degradation estimated at above 7 percent of GDP in 2013, the losses could
be irreversible and will stall the main engine of growth if not addressed. Second, Lao PDR is
currently rapidly accumulating physical capital (roads, bridges, dams, buildings) that should
serve the country over many years. If these investments fail to take into account the impact
of climate change or adequately deal with emerging challenges (including urbanization,
migration, pollution), the economy could be locked into options which may appear cost-
effective in the short term but have significant negative implications over the long term.
Admittedly, moving to a greener and more resilient growth model will have short-term costs,
but ones that are rapidly declining with the advance of technology and that will be dwarfed
by the long-term costs of inaction. Even if the cost is a slight reduction in the growth rate, the
remaining growth will be of higher quality and more inclusive and sustainable.

                                     Box 6: Regional power market
 Lao PDR’s installed capacity in the energy sector already exceeds domestic demand by four times and excess
 capacity will further increase by 2020. While there is no shortage of demand for electricity in the region,
 the national system needs to be strengthened and the physical and institutional infrastructure for regional
 power trade and system-to-system exchange is yet to be formed. Domestically, the completion of the 500
 KV transmission backbone scheduled for 2018–2019 should help in fully integrating the power system.
 Internationally, Lao PDR has developed strong bilateral power trade with Thailand and is exploring options
 for connections with Myanmar and Vietnam. Also, it is exploring electricity wheeling with Thailand and
 Malaysia for possible exports to Singapore.

 A stronger push for a regional power market in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) will open more
 opportunities, increase energy security, lower capital and system operating costs, and reduce emissions in
 the entire region. The Regional Power Trade Coordination Committee was established back in 2002 and a
 Master Plan was developed; however, implementation has been slow (for example, a Regional Power
 Coordination Center is yet to be formed). In addition, it will require (a) harmonization of national policies
 and regulatory frameworks and (b) improved system planning and real-time management capabilities to
 avoid cross-border blackouts. Importantly, transparent and stable governance and regulatory frameworks
 are essential to attract public and private investors needed to cover the large financing needs in the sector.


Cross-cutting theme: Strengthening institutions

121. Strengthened institutions will be critical for realizing opportunities through
each of the three pathways. This is especially so in resource-based economies where
natural resources create rents that make the institutions more vulnerable to capture as
windfall revenue from natural resources may help reinforce vested interests in inefficient
political institutions (World Bank, 2014g). The experience of developed, resource-rich
countries suggests that the institutions that matter most are those which (a) ensure stable
public finances and dampen volatility; (b) increase accountability of service providers; and
(c) ensure a level-playing field and promote competition. Importantly, most developed,
resource-rich countries were able to set up these institutions before significant resource
rents were created. Here, Lao PDR’s track record is mixed. Macroeconomic management has
been erratic; accountability arrangements are weak; and despite efforts for liberalization in

                                                                                                  59 | P a g e

goods markets, competitive pressures are weak while the regulatory framework is
discriminately enforced.

Pathway 1: Sustainable and efficient management of natural resources

122. Natural resources have delivered growth and the remaining potential is
significant. Sustainably managed, the country’s rich water, forest, and subsoil resources can
continue to support growth. Lack of an integrated approach in management of natural
resources has resulted in suboptimal and non-transparent allocation and use of the country’s
natural resources, in many cases favoring short-term gains while affecting livelihoods and
undermining future growth prospects. Weak regulations and poor enforcement at the sector
level further undermine the prospects for sustainable and shared growth.

123. Importantly, decisions on the use of natural resources should consider that
conservation of natural resources is sometimes a more efficient alternative to
extraction. For example, if institutions to manage natural resources, collect revenues, and
redistribute are weak, it is probably better to leave resources unexploited. Conservation
offers two important opportunities:

   •   It can reduce economic losses and present opportunities to nurture higher tiers of
       economic activities with reduced environmental impact. For example, reducing
       deforestation and forest degradation will increase the useful life of hydropower
       plants by reducing reservoir sedimentation. Nature-based tourism, with adequate
       measures to minimize pollution and negative impact on ecosystems, can generate
       diverse service sector jobs. Also, agricultural products that meet global food safety
       standards and are environmentally friendly, including but not limited to organic
       products, can fetch higher prices. While the expansion of these sectors will require
       reforms in other areas (connectivity, standards), the prospects critically depend on
       maintaining healthy ecosystems. This will be impossible under a scenario of
       uncontrolled expansion of mining, power plants, and logging. Conservation will also
       allow Lao PDR access to global climate finance.

   •   It will allow the authorities an opportunity to develop the institutions necessary to
       manage large resource rents. In this context, the relatively long period before Lao PDR
       starts to receive more significant benefits from its hydro potential may be positive, as
       the Government will have few options but to institute mechanisms for collecting
       taxes, to effectively regulate the business environment, and to improve governance.
       This appears to have been, at least partly, behind Lao PDR’s decision to introduce a
       moratorium on new mining and plantation concessions and ban timber exports;
       however, weak implementation limited its benefits.

Pathway 2: Unlocking the potential in non-resource sectors to create opportunities

124. Ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity will require an
accelerated structural transformation, including a more productive agriculture and a
vibrant private sector. The country has a young demographic profile and relatively low

                                                                                  60 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                      Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


wages and productivity, making the EAP experience in increasing productivity and incomes
in agriculture and developing a labor-intensive and outward-oriented manufacturing sector
relevant. Increasing productivity of agriculture will increase income of farmers, create jobs
in agribusiness and agro-processing, reduce stress on the environment, and enhance
nutritional outcomes. However, income-generating opportunities in agriculture remain
constrained by a still dominant focus on rice self-sufficiency, limited access to extension
services, difficulties in reaching markets and making connections with agribusinesses, as
well as market distortions.

125. As productivity growth reduces the labor requirement in agriculture, non-farm
rural jobs (such as tourism, handicrafts, décor, and artisanal goods) and
manufacturing and services can provide opportunities. The fast-growing region and
increasing wages in the region make Lao PDR an interesting candidate for firms to diversify
production structures. Affordable, and relatively soon abundant, electricity and easy access
to the Thai infrastructure are likely to be a comparative advantage, especially as growing
integration through the AEC and RCEP22 further opens up opportunities. Attracting FDI
would be an important element of a job-creating, private sector-led growth strategy as FDI
brings in know-how, capital, and access to markets. However, creating good jobs is
constrained by a difficult and selectively enforced regulatory framework, which breeds
informality and corruption, as well as inadequate labor skills. While the likelihood of a large-
scale, export-led industrialization seen in other EAP countries taking place in Lao PDR may
be more limited, even for standards of resource-rich countries, Lao PDR has room to increase
manufacturing (for example, in resource-rich Eurasia manufacturing accounts for 14 percent
of GDP, compared to 8 percent in Lao PDR). Also, significant opportunities in the services
sector remain unexploited. In general, a focus on niche segments (for example, nature-based
tourism, fair trade and organic agriculture, and so on) is likely to have the largest
development impact.

Pathway 3: Building the assets of people to be able to take on these opportunities
and to mitigate risks and protect gain

126. More human capital and assets open up opportunities for transition into better-
paid jobs—be it domestically or through migration—and also improve the prospects
for those that remain in agriculture. Human development outcomes remain poor despite
strong growth and the indicators are persistently worse for ethnic minorities who make up
a disproportionate share of the poor. The most vulnerable have very few assets, are
geographically isolated (mostly highlands), and face language and cultural barriers. The
critical constraints they face to build household assets, improve access to markets, and
create economic opportunities include the prevalence of malnutrition and teenage
pregnancies, poor education outcomes, and uneven access to basic infrastructure and
services. Social norms and traditions in parts of Lao PDR society also significantly affect
demand for critical interventions (maternal and child health [MCH] care, nutrition,

education). The constraints can be traced partly to insufficient funding of key sectors, but
also to weak management, especially in areas that require multisectoral collaboration.

127. High household vulnerability has been a drag to shared prosperity. This is due
to a growing exposure to shocks as well as limited opportunities to mitigate risks. The social
safety net is weak and fragmented, the DRM function is underfunded and poorly coordinated,
while the financial sector still excludes a big part of the population.

A prioritized agenda

128. Lao PDR is an LDC, and unsurprisingly, faces many constraints in the
achievement of the twin goals. However, not all constraints and challenges are equally
urgent and have the same impact on poverty reduction and promoting shared prosperity.
Also, unlocking the potential in a number of areas would depend on some other challenges
being addressed first or simultaneously.

129. The rest of the SCD prioritizes the proposed policy areas to help Lao PDR make
progress toward the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared
prosperity. The priorities are closely linked to the proposed pathways and reflect the
constraints identified earlier. The prioritization was largely guided by the expected impact
of the identified policies over the twin goals, defined to also include sustainability. In the Lao
PDR context, a focus on the impact over the twin goals meant prioritizing policy areas that
increase incomes in agriculture, create and facilitate transition to good non-farm
opportunities, and lower risks to sustainability of growth. These are the areas that
contributed mostly to poverty reduction in the past and in which there is still significant
potential. Greater weight was given to policy areas that address constraints for lagging
groups (such as ethnic groups) and address gender gaps. Furthermore, the SCD prioritizes
actions that require immediate attention, either because they address a pressing challenge
(malnutrition, teenage pregnancies, and rapid depletion of natural resources) or the long
period it takes to yield results calls for early intervention (skills and improved governance).
This prioritization was complemented by the outcomes of an extensive engagement process
with a broad range of stakeholders, including representatives of central and local
governments, the business sector, nonprofit organizations, and development partners (Box
7) where the need to improve the productivity of the agriculture sector, build skills, focus on
inclusion, and protect the environment came out strongly. Finally, specific policy actions are
proposed under each priority area that will facilitate the achievement of objectives.

                               Box 7: Lao PDR SCD public engagement
 The SCD benefitted from extensive nationwide public engagement that took place between February and
 March 2016. The objective was to solicit stakeholders’ views on the development priorities, challenges, and
 opportunities of Lao PDR. The engagement included eight face-to-face events in four locations (Vientiane,
 Luang Prabang, Oudomxay, and Pakse) and an online survey; 368 persons (290 men and 78 women)
 representing state and provincial governments, the National Assembly, mass organizations, private sector,
 development partners, nonprofit organizations, and think-thanks took part in the process.

 There was consensus that Lao PDR’s growth has been strong, but less inclusive and at a significant cost to
 the environment. Several themes and recommendations were proposed to share benefits more broadly and
 to strengthen sustainability, including the need to improve agriculture and rural development, strengthen
 education and skills, and put focus on inclusion. Similarly, there was agreement on the need to protect the
 environment and natural resources; streamline the business environment; and improve infrastructure
 availability. The public engagement clearly identified the weak performance of institutions and governance
 and difficulties with public finances and high public debt as critical constraints. At the same time, the
 country’s location, the energy sector, higher-value-added agriculture (organic production), and tourism
 were identified as growth drivers.

130. The prioritization takes into consideration the complementarities, synergies,
and trade-offs between the identified priorities. For example, improved productivity in
agriculture will help in reducing stress on natural resources by reducing the demand for
agriculture land as well as in reducing malnutrition. Improved nutrition outcomes provide
an illustrative example of the required synergies as addressing stunting will require
simultaneous progress on a few priority areas. Similarly, some reforms could be necessary
prerequisites to unlock potential in other areas (for example, the Lao PDR experience shows
that improved rural connectivity, without improving assets of households, is unlikely to
deliver more opportunities for households). Furthermore, the proposed actions will require
additional spending in a number of sectors, a clear trade-off with the objective of
consolidating the fiscal position. Similarly, natural resources are subject to competing
demands that need to be managed.

131. Policies and interventions to address the identified constraints should be
driven by the insight that, over the long term, migration will likely be a pathway to
economic integration for a big part of the population, especially in more remote areas.
Local economies are unlikely to be able to provide the scale of economic activity necessary
to sustain a larger improvement in living conditions for everyone while the cost of providing
services across the entire country would be prohibitively high. While respecting the right of
people to live where they want, measures to remove the impediments to integration and
transition, such as improving language skills, making registration easier, facilitating job
search, and improving access to services in new locations, can help.

Overarching priority: Enhancing institutional quality and creating a rules-based
environment

132. Stronger institutions can ensure faster progress toward the twin goals. While
the relationship between institutions and development appears to be weaker at lower levels
of development (Shikha & Zhuang, 2014), it increases as economies and societies become
more complex. This is even more important for resource-rich countries like Lao PDR with
ample evidence that concentration of economic activity in sectors such as natural resources
tends to strengthen the importance of improved governance. Also, some of the key
constraints to the growth of non-resource sectors as well as to sharing of the benefits from
growth are closely linked to the functioning of institutions. Strengthening prospects for
macroeconomic stability, effectively managing natural resources, improving stunting and
human development outcomes, delivering growth-enhancing infrastructure and regulatory
reforms, will all require an effective public sector that has the capabilities to mobilize
domestic resources, design sound policies, and ensure fair and transparent enforcement.
While priority-specific issues are addressed in the specific sections further, a few issues have
cross-cutting implications. Transforming state and market relations as well as strengthening
accountability will be critical to creating opportunities for the private sector, improving
public service delivery, and lowering economic risks. In addition to these fundamental
issues, improved procedures in the administration can help in strengthening government
effectiveness. Progress along these lines can ensure that Lao PDR is a rules-based economy
rather than one where a privileged few benefit and the majority is excluded.

133. Transforming the relationship between the state and the markets can help
boost private sector participation. Close links between government officials and business
entities as well as unclear separation between ownership and regulatory functions raise
questions about the functioning of markets and competitive pressures. Stronger
arrangements for avoiding conflicts of interest, clear delineation between sector regulators
and businesses, and more empowered and independent regulators (for example in the
banking sector, insurance, telecom, and so on) can help in reducing the commercialization of
the state.

134. Furthermore, assigning and protecting property and creditor rights can
support growth and inclusion. A comprehensive land administration system, including
effective implementation of regulations on expropriation and compensation, can help clearly
assign and protect property rights. This will stimulate investments, allow the private sector
to grow, and improve access to finance, and with land being one of the few assets that poor
people have, this is likely to have a significant impact for the bottom 40 percent. A stronger
judiciary will be needed to guarantee property and creditor rights.

135. Stronger institutions with oversight mandates can help increase accountability.
While some important steps have been taken, more can be done. The National Assembly is
increasingly playing a stronger oversight role; however, it is yet to turn down a government
proposal. The Supreme Audit Organization is quickly upgrading its capacities; still, resources
will be insufficient for a few more years. Providing an opportunity to appeal Government
decisions, strengthening the role of the judiciary, and improving its capacity can help.

                                                                                   65 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                  Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


136. Reforms in the central-local government relations can improve effectiveness.
Initially, existing arrangements should be clarified. At Lao PDR’s current stage of
development, there are benefits from having a strong central government, especially in
planning and financing public functions. This can ensure equity and economies of scale.
While delivery of some public services is more efficient at lower levels, decisions to delegate
tasks should be complemented with clear financing arrangements and stronger
accountability. Lao PDR, through the ‘Sam Sang’ initiative, has made a strategic commitment
for increased decentralization. It would be important that the process is gradually rolled out
and adjusted to reflect the results of the piloting exercises.

137. Similarly, stronger capacity at the highest level will facilitate consensus on
setting priorities, coordinating policies, and ensuring effective monitoring and
implementation. Government endorsement is required in Lao PDR to advance reforms;
however, a stronger central function can benefit from increased expertise at the Prime
Minister’s Office and stronger mechanisms for cooperation with line agencies on setting
sector priorities, policy impact assessment, and implementing agreed decisions.

138. A more merit-based civil service can make the best use of Lao PDR’s slowly
increasing pool of technically competent administrative personnel. It will be important
that these staff get adequate opportunities and over time take leadership of the reform
processes. In the interim, effective use of the available support from development partners
in designing policies that are tailored to Lao PDR circumstances can fill the vacuum.

139. Policies need to be increasingly informed by evidence. This will require stronger
systems to collect and analyze data and information. For example, improved registration and
certification of births, deaths, marriages, and divorces will allow to better match supply of
services to demand. Next, administrative and survey-based systems need to be strengthened
and increasingly used in the design of policies. This could include the use of information from
an improved Education Management Information System to approve new positions in the
education sector and use of data from the LECS to design a mechanism to identify and target
the vulnerable.

140. Partnership with stakeholders can improve the design of public services.
Examples include community-driven development approaches or increased consultations
with the private sector in drafting legislations. Lao PDR has some positive experiences in this
area, mostly at the local level (for example, the Poverty Reduction Fund), that could be scaled
up. Also, recently adopted regulations include commitments for greater openness and
consultations. Implementing the publication and consultation requirements of the Law on
Law Making (all draft laws should be posted for public consultations) should be a priority.
More broadly, a greater push toward more transparency will provide information to
measure the authorities' performance and to guard against possible misuse of powers.

141. More inclusive institutions will also strengthen social cohesion. Increasing
penetration of modern communications and gradually improving assets is exposing the Lao
PDR population, especially its younger and urban cohort, to more information and greater


                                                                                   66 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                   Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


awareness about opportunities in other countries. This will increase their demands from the
authorities, including on greater government responsiveness on policies that affect them.

142. Modern technologies provide an opportunity to deliver public services more
efficiently. Implementation of a comprehensive e-government strategy can bring
transparency to workflows and budgets and improve quality, timeliness, and reach of
administrative services. For example, innovative initiatives are being considered to improve
delivery of maternal health services. The current ad hoc approach to e-government is
resulting in missed opportunities and inefficient public investments in silo IT systems.

Promoting strategic use of natural resources and responsible management of the
environment

143. Natural resources can continue to drive growth, if properly managed. Even
under conservative assumptions, the hydropower potential is around three times above
current installed capacity levels while limited geological exploration and low exploitation
costs in existing project suggest that future growth in mining is possible. However, extracting
resources entails decisions on the possible alternative uses of the country’s resources. With
the Government’s efforts to green the economy as part of the 8th NSEDP, sectors like tourism
and organic agriculture could be providing alternative and financially attractive options. At
the same time, urgent attention is needed as forest and biodiversity degradation and
deforestation is rapid; mining is developing below potential and with often unmitigated
impact while power sector plans may not leave enough options for more efficient use of
water.

144. An emphasis on green growth in the 8th NSEDP confirms ownership of the
agenda. An immediate follow-up priority is to further the understanding of what
environmentally sustainable growth will look like in Lao PDR through the development of a
Strategy on Green and Resilient Growth. An important part of this agenda would be the
establishment of clear and transparent rules and enforcement mechanisms that will guide
decisions on the allocation and use of the country’s national resources. Lao PDR has already
piloted the use of Integrated Spatial Planning (ISP) (Box 8). Scaling it up and associating it to
a Strategic Environment Assessment process could help reconcile competing objectives. The
authorities’ target of restoration of forest cover to 70 percent and sector strategies (for
example, power and mining) that envisage expansion is one example of such competing
objectives. While establishing a functioning ISP may require a longer period of time, in the
near term land-use maps can be consolidated and used in procedures for land allocation.
Transparency in decision making and provincial and stakeholder buy-in will also be key to
planning across the landscape. Integration of EIA conditions in concession agreements and
their enhanced monitoring and enforcement during concession implementation can reduce
the negative environmental and social impacts of concessions. In addition, to minimize
impact over the environment, stricter standards and strengthened monitoring and
enforcement against air, soil, and water pollution from industrial sources, households, and
vehicles will be needed. A few sector-specific policy actions also require urgent attention, as
detailed below.


                                                                                    67 | P a g e

Water

145. An integrated approach to water management, taking into account the multiple
uses of water, will secure a sustainable hydropower sector and ensure attention to the
range of economic, social, and environmental demands on water. Coupled with
economic and population growth and the effects of climate change, the challenge of
managing for all water uses will require a more integrated and rigorous approach, engaging
multiple stakeholders and ministries. Strengthening these linkages is a key component of the
recently approved Policy on Sustainable Hydropower Development and the pending Water
Law. Also, the Mekong River basin, which provides most of the potential for Lao PDR, is
shared by five other countries—China, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam—and is
considered a transboundary resource. Effective regional water resource management
arrangements can facilitate equitable and sustainable development. These issues could be
addressed through the development of a transparent national hydropower plan that will
integrate river basin planning into cascade management and optimize multiple, including
regional, objectives. Such an approach will provide more careful project selection process
and identify operating rules that avoid conflict between facilities and across water users.
While it may moderate the pace of hydropower expansion, it will still allow for sizeable
expansion of the sector and better match the growth in installed capacity with improvements
in the backbone infrastructure, domestic demand, and expansion of export markets, with
more balanced management of water for industry, livelihoods, and the environment.

Forests, wildlife, and natural protected areas

146. Reversing the process of deforestation and forest degradation is a priority. A
rigorous rollout of ISP may help integrate forest planning with decisions in other sectors
(agriculture, mining, and power) as well as implications over watersheds (in terms of
erosion, sediment loads, and so on). Activities harming forests beyond agreements coming
from the ISP process should be stopped. This would include stronger oversight over salvage
logging (greater transparency of contracts, enforcement, and monitoring); implementing the
ban on illegal timber trade as envisaged in the Prime Minister Order No.15; establishing a
modern protected area management system; combating poaching and wildlife trafficking;
and preventing illegal mining and other activities. Rehabilitating degraded forests can
improve habitats for biodiversity while plantations can supply the timber industry and
timber trade.

                                  Box 8: Integrated Spatial Planning
 ISP is a blueprint for sustainable environmental, social, and economic development established by the
 Environment Management Law in 2012. At provincial or district level, ISP is based on a common
 overarching vision and development strategy for the province/district. The vision and development
 strategy is formed through a process of analyzing the potentials, needs, and problems in each area and for
 every sector and interest. It is a participatory process that unifies national and provincial priorities with
 potentials, needs, and problems on the ground at the provincial/district level. An ISP contains a
 Provincial/District Spatial Development Strategy with implementing measures, which can be in the form of
 regulations, zoning, incentives, constructions, and projects designed specifically to promote the desired
 development and/or to avoid and move away from undesired development.

 The central part of an ISP is a set of thematic planning maps on which the spatial development strategy and
 the implementing measures are visualized. The planning maps will show protected areas; sensitive and
 valuable natural and cultural assets; land-use zoning for industry, agriculture, residential, forestry, and
 infrastructure development projects; and any other development that is preferred/not preferred or
 allowed/not allowed. The result of the ISP is a report and maps that identify (a) the existing use of land
 areas, (b) possible use of land areas, and (c) existing or future land conflicts.

 The 2012 revision of the law also introduced the Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) as a process that
 is to be conducted when developing policies, strategic plans, and programs—for anticipating their impact
 on social and natural environment and for determining the means to avoid or mitigate those impacts. The
 SEA is an equivalent for policies and plans, to what the EIA and the Environmental Social Management and
 Monitoring Plan (ESMMP) are for investment projects.



147. In parallel, the capacity to manage state forests should be strengthened. The
current classification of state forests into production, conservation, and protection forests is
based on data from the early 2000s. Using recent data and local knowledge, the state forests
are being delineated to remove encroached village and degraded land. This should be
accompanied by strengthened institutional capacity, more human and financial resources,
and clearer division of responsibilities. Until recently, forest management was fragmented,
both horizontally (different ministries in charge of different type of forests) and vertically
(from central to province and district with unclear devolution or accountability). While
evidence points to the benefits from community participation in forest management, few
support decentralized administrative management. In fact, there is evidence in favor of
central-level management of conservation, such as the national park model.

148. Given the high value of Lao PDR’s timber products, securing the buy-in for
sustainable forest management will be a challenge. Some countries (Costa Rica, China)
have introduced payment for environmental services (PES) to incentivize villagers to
preserve assets. Alternative economic opportunities that have a lower impact over forests
and have higher returns, such as nature-based tourism and clean agriculture, could help. Still,
it is unlikely that these will be able to match the large amounts of funds involved in the
unofficial timber trade. Commitment at the top levels of government will be critical,
combined with a well-funded law enforcement function that can work without restraint.

149. Preserving forests and biodiversity would probably result in scaling back of the
timber industry, at least its reliance on natural forests in exchange for certified

                                                                                                 69 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                    Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


sustainable tree plantations. Going forward, the industry should operate under much
stronger standards on third-party-certified timber, such as the Forest Stewardship Council
(FSC) or the Programme for the Endorsement of Certification (PEFC). While this will require
resources, significant amounts of external support are available in case there is demand.

Extractives industries

150. Reforming the mining sector can contribute to its development in a socially
responsible and environmentally sustainable manner. First, the development of a
mining strategy, aligned with the national development plan and sectoral plans (agriculture,
forestry, power), should outline the vision for the sector, its regulation and management, as
well as other implications (growth, fiscal, affected communities, and so on). Such an
approach will probably highlight that some planned mining activities represent suboptimal
use of the country’s natural resources. For example, strip mining, which requires extensive
land use, is not likely to be an attractive investment if the areas are fertile and hold potential
for efficient farming or other income-generating activities. A few specific actions that need
to be part of such a vision include the following:

   •   An immediate priority would be to improve the management of the existing
       concessions. This would require resolving overlapping land allocations and more
       effectively enforcing existing regulations on environmental and social impact
       assessment. Failure to meet the license requirements should be dealt with through
       fast and effective license revocation.

   •   Next, putting in place a framework can help encourage entry of reputable and socially
       responsible investors. This will require an attractive environment which assures
       finder’s right, clear operational terms, and simplified and transparent licensing and
       approval. A standardized, progressive, and competitive fiscal regime will be a key part
       of this package. The effective use of ISP containing transparent geological data and
       mining cadastre may also make information more accessible to attract responsible
       investors. Absent such reforms, Lao PDR would probably be better off keeping its
       resources in the ground.

Increasing agricultural productivity to support incomes

151. Agriculture has a key role in ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity in
Lao PDR. Agriculture growth is pro-poor, with the sector accounting for 44 percent of the
poverty reduction between 2002/03 and 2012/13. Also, with productivity levels well below
regional peers and almost two-thirds of the population engaged in agriculture, the remaining
potential is large. There is ownership of the agenda with the government strategy
introducing a number of good practice elements. This makes the sector a very high priority
for poverty reduction, nutritional security, and shared prosperity.

152. Improved agriculture productivity has strong synergies with a number of
development outcomes. More productive agriculture will mean increased household
incomes and better access to diverse foods, a key requirement for better nutrition outcomes.

                                                                                     70 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                    Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


Similarly, it will generate surplus production that could provide competitively priced inputs
to a future export-oriented agri-business sector and create more jobs along the food value
chain. Also, more productive agriculture is in many ways climate-smart agriculture. For
example, competing demands for water are increasing the importance of water productivity,
which is much higher in irrigation schemes supporting mixed cropping or rotation crops
rather than rice mono-cropping. But agriculture also depends on progress in other areas;
especially in education and rural infrastructure, as well as improving the overall business
environment. There is a trade-off with consolidation of public finances; however, given the
expected benefits from the sector, these are interventions that merit additional resources.

153. A transition from a focus on rice self-sufficiency to competitiveness of rice-
based and other farming systems can unleash the productivity in the sector. Paddy
production will remain the core of farming systems, particularly in lowland areas and in the
monsoon season. But during the cool and dry seasons, the production of other crops, from
legumes to vegetables, could make farming systems more resilient and profitable. Improving
availability of quality seeds and fertilizers and strengthened research and extension services
(that is, promoting climate-smart agriculture), expanding multipurpose irrigation,
strengthening participatory water management, and promoting farmers’ organizations can
facilitate this shift. The supply chain can function more effectively if both agriculture-specific
as well as economy-wide constraints to doing business are addressed. Greater availability of
information (short message services [SMSs], radio), investments in public food safety
infrastructure and in assistance to private sector to be accredited in food safety standards,
as well as better rural roads can help farmer access markets. There is evidence that this has
helped Lao PDR coffee producers to obtain 70–80 percent of the world price for Robusta in
recent years, compared to less than 60 percent in the early 2000s. Promotion of contract
farming and access to affordable financing can also accelerate commercialization and
diversification and make value chains more inclusive.

154. Given the geographic and climate differences, the policy prescriptions are
likely to differ for different parts of the country. The livelihood strategies in the lowland
areas will need to center on more commercial rice production and strengthening of the rice-
based farming systems through commercialization and diversification. These are the areas
where the largest number of poor live. In the upland areas, where poverty density is low but
its depth is high, the livelihood strategies of most smallholders will continue to rely on
integrated management of crops and livestock, along with sustainable management of
natural resources such as forests and wildlife. The uplands can also offer a favorable
environment for profitable coffee and fruits and vegetable production.

155. While Lao PDR may still not be sufficiently competitive compared to agriculture
giants in the region (Vietnam and Thailand), the sector can still develop through
agriculture niches and growing acceptance of fair trade platforms and organic
agriculture. Focusing on quality, organic and geographic indication production offers higher
rates of return to Lao producers but also places difficult requirements and often higher costs.
Being competitive on quality requires a strategy and long-term public investments in
infrastructure, capacity building, Lao product brands, and value chain development, which
are needed immediately to bring the future benefits. Yet, competitiveness on quality is easier

                                                                                     71 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                  Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


to maintain when farmers manage to produce larger quantities and use markets in China,
Vietnam, and Thailand to absorb these commodities, while gradually working on quality
improvements.

Investing in improving nutrition to achieve children’s full potential

156. The 44 percent of under-five-year-olds who were stunted in 2012 makes
improving nutrition a top priority. Tackling malnutrition requires nutrition-specific
interventions as well as applying a nutrition lens to interventions in other sectors (nutrition
sensitive). Addressing stunting is about being healthy, consuming nutritious food, and
having access to essential health and nutrition services, access to clean water, appropriate
sanitation facilities, and education and better care for women and children. A recent report
on determinants of malnutrition in Lao PDR confirms that tackling each factor individually
will only have a small impact on nutrition outcomes, compared to when multiple factors are
addressed at once. This is recognized in the National Nutrition Strategy and Action Plan;
however, a recent mapping of activities showed that even though a large number of
stakeholders are supporting nutrition interventions, this does not often translate into high
coverage, neither geographically nor of target groups (see Annex 3 for more details).

157. Investments in early childhood care, stimulation, and learning are necessary to
ensure that from birth, every Lao citizen has the greatest possible opportunity to
reach his or her full potential. The foundation of skills development and employment
opportunity is set in motion by ensuring that children enter life healthy, receive adequate
nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life, and have access to nurturing and stimulating home
environments as well as early childhood education (World Bank, 2010d). This requires
increased availability of and access to quality services, including:

   •   Reproductive health services to ensure that women have the number of children they
       want when they want them

   •   MCH services (vaccines, preventive, promotive, and delivery care) to ensure maternal
       and child survival

   •   Nutrition-related services (supplementation, breastfeeding, and complementary
       feeding promotion, dietary diversity, deworming, fortification) to stimulate optimum
       physical and brain development in the first 1,000 days

   •   Parenting education and safe, nurturing, stimulating home environments to promote
       socio-emotional and psychological development

   •   Early learning/early childhood education opportunities to develop children’s
       language, cognitive, and social skills (see section on education below)

158. Without full access to improved sanitation and water supply, open defecation
is widespread and increases health risks and is one of the major causes of
malnutrition and stunting. A poor hygiene status also limits tourism opportunities. In

                                                                                   72 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                    Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


addition, the SDG agenda raises the bar by requiring a much higher level of services beyond
‘basic access’, namely safe, reliable, and accessible from home. Lao PDR should adopt a
national universal rural water and sanitation program, including a higher budget allocation.
This will also require a sound information system on service coverage and functionality,
which is currently lacking in Lao PDR. Support functions to communities managing water
systems can be put in place to help improve sustainability of services.

159. While aspiring for universal coverage, existing limitations on resources will
require prioritization to high-stunting, low-access areas. Interventions should be
targeted at the poor and ethnic minorities to have the greatest likelihood of reducing
disparities in health, education, and labor market outcomes. In many cases, this will require
social and behavior change to stimulate demand for and consumption of these services as a
large part of the unserved population are ethnic groups in remote areas. Media campaigns;
outreach activities; interpersonal contacts, especially at the village level; and social transfers
can help.

Improving the quality of education and keeping girls in school

160. Increasing the quantity and quality of education is a key priority for achieving
the twin goals. More and better education improves the productivity of farmers and better
prepares people to make the transition toward non-farm jobs, which have been key drivers
of poverty reduction in Lao PDR. Also, with over 30 percent of second graders unable to read
a single word and with inadequate labor skills topping the list of constraints to doing
business, improving education sector performance is urgent. The authorities have recently
increased the allocation to the sector, demonstrating their ownership of the agenda;
however, important decisions on prioritizing subsectors and specific interventions are yet
to be made.

161. Education has strong links to other priorities. It can support nutrition efforts
through improving nutrition of children in schools, but also through better educating girls
(also future mothers). Malnutrition and stunting are lower in children with more educated
mothers while keeping girls in school longer also reduces the likelihood of early marriages
and pregnancies. On the other hand, demand for education services will critically depend on
the job opportunities that will be available for graduates. There is a trade-off with
consolidation of public finances, though some savings can be generated in the system. For
example, revisions to the curricula and teaching norms can help optimize the staffing in the
sector. Also, improving the road network and demographic changes may allow for savings to
be achieved through consolidation of the network. However, given the importance of the
sector, allocating additional funds would represent a good investment of public resources.

162. Given the lack of basic foundational skills, priority should be given on early
childhood development and basic literacy. Early childhood education should be
expanded, including through cost-effective programs tailored to the needs of the target
group (multiage teaching in areas without enough children to sustain a full kindergarten or
non-formal models in remote areas). Addressing chronic malnutrition should be an integral
part of the early childhood development strategy. Training teachers, ensuring children stay

                                                                                     73 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                  Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


in schools, and providing access to teaching aides can increase literacy. Lao PDR has an
extensive school network; however, gaps in coverage still exist (around 13 percent of villages
did not have a primary school within a two-hour walk), while the quality of infrastructure is
poor.

163. Reaching vulnerable groups will require targeted interventions. While overall
education outcomes are inadequate, they are worse among the poor, girls (at higher levels
of education), and ethnic groups. A nationwide rollout of a feeding program can be helpful,
as well as implementing appropriate language policies and training teaching staff from non-
majority ethnic groups. Importantly, outreach activities and carefully designed social
transfers can help increase demand for education services.

164. Early marriage and teenage pregnancies are associated with no school
attendance, high dropouts, health complications, stunting, and poverty. Keeping girls
in school longer, improving access to birth control tools and reproductive health education,
and providing equal opportunities for women’s participation in the non-farm labor market
can help. A culture of acceptance of early marriages, especially among some ethnic groups,
further complicates the process and will require community-level change and outreach
activities. Social transfers conditioned on school attendance may help ‘nudge’ behavior.

165. Keeping students longer in school and ensuring they progress to higher levels
of education is important. As outcomes in primary education improve, better access to
secondary schooling will become more important. Transition to post-primary education is
currently very low, especially in rural areas, and is constrained also by poor access to
secondary schools. Better roads, organized student transport, and financial support (cash
transfer conditioned on attending secondary school) can help lower barriers to access.

166. While building basic skills will benefit the future labor force, interventions can
help address the significant skills issue today. Job-relevant vocational education,
delivered in close interactions with the private sector, and on-the-job training can help train
workers today. Putting in place an effective framework for standards, accreditation, and
quality assurance can promote entry of high-quality foreign education institutions.

Putting public debt on sustainable path and strengthening financial sector stability

167. Lowering risks in the fiscal and financial sectors is a high priority as these could
undermine growth and lead to instability that will affect delivery of public services
and the vulnerable the most. Growing public debt will at a minimum crowd out spending
to other priorities, but could also lead to public sector insolvency. Low reserves and a
potentially overvalued exchange rate, thin buffers, and weak governance in significant parts
of the banking sector can test macroeconomic stability in case of a larger terms of trade shock
or deterioration in the external environment. While debt levels are high and likely to increase
further over the medium term, the set of macroeconomic policies recently proposed by the
authorities, if implemented, should result in stabilizing debt levels and improved stability
prospects.


                                                                                   74 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                   Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


168. A stronger tax base can help increase government revenues. Lao PDR needs to
get its fair share of revenues from the use of natural resources. In hydro and mining, this will
require a fiscal regime that will be standardized, transparent, internationally competitive,
and effectively enforced. While exploitation of forests should be carefully considered, any
that actually takes place should be fully taxed. Next, tax regulations need to be reformed to
expand the tax base and remove exemptions to ensure growing non-resource revenues while
also removing incentives for informality. Reforming tax administration by simplifying
procedures (e-filing, simpler forms) and strengthening enforcement (updated tax payer
registries and regular audits) can support revenues with the added benefit of reducing the
bureaucratic requirements firms face. Recent government decisions appear to be going in
this direction, including by eliminating tax exemptions, increasing the excises rate, and
strengthening enforcement.

169. Containing spending will reduce fiscal stress while reallocating through
efficiency gains can make the budget more pro-poor. Currently, Lao PDR spends a lot (as
percent of GDP) on wages and capital expenditures and little on goods and services
necessary to deliver public services and maintain assets. Optimizing public sector
employment, a more efficient public procurement, as well as a careful review of capital
spending decisions can free up fiscal space and these measures are on the agenda of the
authorities. However, despite a difficult fiscal position, the appetite for large infrastructure
projects persists (Lao PDR section of Singapore-Kunming railway, road upgrades, and new
airports), which could easily absorb the fiscal space created and lead to further increases in
public debt.

170. Consolidating the fiscal position while improving spending outcomes will
require stronger institutions for public financial management (PFM). The deterioration
of the fiscal position and emergence of arrears in recent years underscores the limitations of
the PFM systems. Lao PDR needs a PFM system that will put in place a credible and realistic
fiscal envelope covering the entire public sector (current and capital spending as well as
development partners’ support) that will be executed in a predictable and efficient manner.
An immediate priority is to improve cash management and reporting arrangements.
Improving public debt management capacity (stronger institutional capacity, developing the
local capital market) can reduce risks with the recently amended Budget Law and the
upcoming Public Debt decree significantly increasing the reporting and analytical demands
from the authorities.

171.   Contingent liabilities need to be carefully managed. More specifically:

   •   Making an inventory of arrears and a plan for their clearance is a priority, as well as
       putting in place systems that will prevent arrears from emerging in the future
       (stopping off-budget spending, strict adherence to the Budget Law, and so on).

   •   Creditworthiness of EdL would be critical to the success of Lao PDR’s growth strategy.
       This will require strengthened corporate governance, reduction of losses, elimination
       of payment arrears, and introduction of cost-reflective tariff adjustments. Malaysia’s
       Petronas provides an example of an SOE that effectively created resource rents and

                                                                                   75 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                 Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


       collected and managed revenues to limit volatility, prevent exchange rate
       overvaluation, and channel investments into productive areas.

172. Public-private partnerships could help improve public services; however, the
regulating framework needs to be overhauled first. Under appropriate conditions, there
are opportunities to partner with the private sector in delivering high-quality services in a
cost-efficient manner. However, Lao PDR’s experience with private sector involvement,
mostly through so-called ‘IOUs’ (I Owe You), in many cases resulted in weak adherence to
rules, higher unit costs, and overdesign. Such schemes should be replaced with a public-
private partnership framework that will adequately address financial, technical, and
operational risks.

173. The financial sector is exposed to significant risks, which, if realized, will be
detrimental to growth prospects. A major disturbance in the sector will strip people of
their savings, have long-term consequence on trust in the financial sector, disrupt financial
flows, and create fiscal costs that the budget cannot absorb. Most urgently, the authorities
need to deal with banks that have low capital buffers and growing NPLs. In response, the
BOL has been working on restructuring plans for two state-owned banks and has requested
weaker private banks to produce and implement plans to increase capital levels to the legally
required levels. Further, a modern legal framework for bank regulation and supervision and
one that is properly implemented would be critical, and the BOL has announced plans to
amend the BOL Law by 2018 and the Commercial Banks Law by 2019. The non-bank
financial sector remains underdeveloped which keeps risks moderate for the time being;
however, going forward it will also require a similar reform agenda to ensure the economy
benefits from greater availability of financial sector products while minimizing risks. A more
flexible exchange rate arrangement, while helpful in lowering macroeconomic
vulnerabilities, could hurt the financial system given the large foreign exchange exposure of
banks and borrowers, underscoring the need for urgent attention to the challenges in the
banking sector.

174. Recent tension at the parallel foreign exchange market underscores the
importance of improved exchange rate management. Policy options that could be
considered include introducing more flexibility in the exchange rate (within the ± 5 percent
band allowed under the existing policy) as well as supportive monetary and fiscal policies to
manage Lao kip liquidity. This should allow the BOL to protect reserves and strengthen the
confidence in the domestic currency.

Making it easier to do business and create good jobs

175. A good job provides an exit out of poverty, but firms have created very few jobs.
A difficult business environment has constrained the growth of firms and their ability to
create jobs and increase wages, making this a high priority. While the reforms are important,
improving the business environment will only result in more jobs if the skills gap is
addressed and if the legislation is effectively implemented, a concept more closely related to
the overarching priority of an across-the-board upgrade of institutions.


                                                                                  76 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                 Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


176. The compliance and transaction requirements should be simpler and less
costly. Increasing the transparency and predictability of the regulatory environment (for
example, by publishing laws, regulations, procedures, forms, and fees in easily accessible
public domains) will be an important first step. This should be followed by a reduction in the
regulatory burden, including moving away from ex ante controls and screening toward
effective regulatory oversight. Priority should be given to simplifying business start-up and
introducing automatic issuance and renewal of licenses and permits (including for trade)
and where possible elimination or simplification. Given the untapped potential in services,
especially on the higher end, promoting entry through simpler and more transparent
regulations can have significant rewards, including in trade, ICT, air transport, medical and
other professional services, logistics, and so on. Lao PDR should aim to remove existing
restrictions to entry and reduce state involvement through reduced government presence in
economic activities, allowing greater foreign presence in commercial activities and stronger
separation between sector regulation and ownership.

177. With a large skills gap, firms should be encouraged to invest in education and
skills. Still, the significant skills gap will remain for the considerable future and the
authorities should put in place an environment in which this demand can be quickly and
efficiently met with imported skills. This can also allow for more rapid transfer of know-how.
Such an arrangement allowed Malaysia to meet labor and skills demand even in the early
stages of industrialization. At the same time, targeted support programs to build
entrepreneurial capacity of domestic managers can better position Lao MSMEs to benefit
from available opportunities.

178. Given identified market failures, carefully crafted and fiscally costed
government support can help attract investment and create jobs. In general, state
support programs provide an unfair advantage for companies and discourage incentives for
productivity improvement. Still, the small market size, difficult terrain, or low density keep
fixed costs high and may deter firms from investing. In such cases, carefully focused
interventions may be able to generate enough profits for investors (Gelb, Tata,
Ramachandran, & Rossignol, 2015). It is essential that such targeted interventions address
critical market imperfections directly, such as labor issues, business-to-business contacts,
standards, and investment climate reforms, rather than providing general and poorly
targeted incentives. For example, (Stirbat, Record, & Nghardsaysone, 2015) find that
interventions that focus on existing exporters to help diversify markets; promote knowledge
sharing with newcomers (through trade associations or peer groups); and target investment
promotion toward companies in Thailand or with presence there can increase the survival
rate of Lao exports. The authorities have focused their efforts on creation of SEZs, locally
addressing critical constraints to private sector development, and have recently had some
success in attracting FDI and increasing employment and exports. An important part of the
success of some of these zones appears to be the ability to provide a one-stop shop for most
government services and improving connectivity, thus reducing significantly costs and
bureaucratic requirements. To make the most of this, the authorities should analyze
potential mechanisms (such as matching grants, skill and job training) to encourage linkages
between firms located in SEZs and firms outside of the zones.


                                                                                  77 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                  Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


179. Some of the good jobs will come from out of Lao PDR, especially in Thailand
with its fast-aging labor force, and elsewhere in the region with the advent of the AEC.
The authorities have initiated some policies to assist migrants. Lao PDR and Thai
counterparts are working to facilitate the movement of migrants and their access to public
services. Still, a more general policy toward the diaspora is lacking. Such a policy could help
migrants get better jobs by developing their skills and preparing their departure. It should
also encourage the diaspora to remain engaged and potentially incentivize migrants to
return to Lao PDR in the future. A better investment climate should be in place to support
financial intermediation and private investment by migrants.

Investing in infrastructure for growth and inclusion

180. Improved connectivity lowers the costs of being landlocked in Lao PDR, helps
firms remain competitive and create jobs, and assists people in accessing markets and
services. Being a small and landlocked country, the performance of firms critically depends
on the ability to travel, transit, and trade across borders with ease and at low costs.
Continued integration with neighbors and the broader region will be important to allow
future investments to benefit from economies of scale, and this is particularly important for
the non-resource sector where investments into Lao PDR are likely to be efficiency seeking.
Also, an improved power system is important for the country to make the most of its rapidly
growing generation capacity. Rural roads are also vital for two-thirds of the population
residing in rural areas as they facilitate access to services and economic opportunities. Given
the unfinished agenda in this area, this is a high priority.

181. Lao PDR’s connectivity has improved considerably in recent years, especially
on hard infrastructure. Main road transport corridors have been upgraded in recent years
and the road network expanded by 50 percent between 2004 and 2014. In addition, a
considerable part of the population and economic activity is concentrated in areas bordering
Thailand and has relatively easy access to the Thai infrastructure. Still, the following would
need to be addressed:

   •   Upgrading the regional corridors to ASEAN standards (few sections in Lao PDR are
       still classified as Below Class III roads) and ensuring effective maintenance. This will
       require stricter controls on overloading as well as improved capacity to efficiently
       manage the road network, including planning, prioritization, and maintenance that
       will also consider disaster resilience. Rebalancing the road sector portfolio away from
       national roads to local roads can help increase access to universal year-round roads.
       Realistic traffic volumes should underpin decisions on interventions and upgrades.
       Introduction of non-discriminatory road charges could help lower the burden on the
       budget. Off-budget road construction should be stopped.

   •   Developing a railway network offers both opportunities and risks. Rail transport has
       significant environmental benefits and some of Lao PDR’s key exports could more
       efficiently be transported by rail. However, railway networks are expensive to
       construct and run. Embarking upon such massive projects should be done only after
       careful analysis of the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits.

                                                                                   78 | P a g e

   •   The remaining 15 percent of population without access to electricity are the most
       difficult to reach due to large distances from the grid, difficult terrain, and low
       population density. To meet this challenge, the strategy will have to work in parallel
       on (a) stretching the limits of grid extension by applying innovative and low-cost
       options and (b) accelerating and scaling up off-grid electrification program. Full
       electrification will also reduce household air pollution, a major cause of deaths and
       disabilities, especially among the poor. On both tracks, the poor and vulnerable
       population will require targeted subsidies to overcome relatively high connection
       cost.

   •   To optimize benefits in an environment of growing number of smaller- and medium-
       size hydropower plants and growing surplus electricity, Lao PDR needs a new
       strategy for system-to-system transactions and full integration of the domestic power
       grid. Ongoing investments should integrate the domestic system by 2019. The
       regional market provides exciting opportunities, especially in trade with Thailand
       and Vietnam (and Myanmar and Cambodia at a later stage), but this will require a
       stronger regional transmission infrastructure and eventually a functioning regional
       power market.

182. As physical infrastructure constraints are gradually addressed, soft constraints
are gaining in importance and need to be addressed. More specifically:

   •   Continuing reforms outlined in the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, such as
       improving procedures, border management, and coordination among all border
       agencies, would be important to reducing the costs of being landlocked.

   •   In ICT, establishment of a more effective telecommunications regulatory authority
       could promote competition among operators based on affordability and quality of
       telecommunications services, including high-speed or mobile broadband Internet
       services. Online provision of public services can create content which is currently
       lacking due to low uptake of ICT by government agencies, while ICT education
       programs can increase literacy.

   •   On air connectivity, full implementation of the ASEAN Open Skies Agreement will
       provide important growth opportunities, especially in tourism.

Improving access to and quality of health services for more productive people

183. Health indicators are slowly improving, but the vulnerable are benefiting less.
A healthy labor force is critical to economic growth and inclusion and Lao PDR has been
making progress with life expectancy increasing and mother and under-five mortality falling.
However, health outcomes remain considerably poorer than other countries at the same
level of income. According to (Finmark Trust, 2015), 79 percent of the population did not
feel in good health. Also, the persistence of malnutrition can be closely linked to weaknesses
in the functioning of the health sector. Given the population’s health profile, emphasis should


                                                                                   79 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                   Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


be given to the preventive and primary care services that also cater to emerging and
noncommunicable diseases.

184. In parallel, further upgrades to the physical infrastructure in the sector as well
as development of human capital are needed. Improving health worker capacity, skills,
and clinical competencies across all levels of care, combined with appropriate performance
management measures, is required to address issues around quality of care. However, given
the significant amounts of resources needed and the long periods needed for these actions
to provide results, putting in place an effective regulatory framework (standards,
accreditation, and quality assurance) can promote entry of reputable FDI in the sector and
improve quality of services.

185. Actions should focus on closing barriers to access, especially among ethnic
groups. Differences across geographical and social factors need to be addressed. Better rural
roads can help improve access as almost 38 percent of villages did not have a dispensary
within a two-hour walk. Beyond the physical access, social and financial barriers need to be
tackled. Increasing the number of health staff from ethnic minorities could help, as well as
integrated outreach activities and demand-side measures to remove barriers to access,
increase demand for services, and raise awareness for risks (for example, from teenage
pregnancies), especially among ethnic minorities and vulnerable social groups. A well-
functioning social protection system can reduce financial barriers through transfers
conditioned on increasing demand for services, consolidation of the numerous health
financing programs, and greater insurance coverage.

186. Improving health outcomes will require additional resources. Improving
priority setting and allocating resources on the basis of sound methodology can help
generate some savings. In addition, improved procurement processes can reduce costs while
more efficient social insurance can help pool risks and share costs. Still, given the relatively
low budgetary allocations at the moment, an increased budget for delivery of health services
would represent a good investment. Also, with GDP growth, some development partners
may discontinue funding for some interventions. Critical preventive programs
(immunization, family planning, maternal care, HIV/AIDS) rely on assistance from
development partners and may come at risk as the country’s income level increases. Careful
planning in advance can help avoid disruptions in provision of services.

Putting in place strengthened disaster risk management

187. More frequent and intense shocks are affecting livelihoods through lower
yields, higher costs, and loss of infrastructure. Around a quarter of the population was
affected by disasters over the last decade, with significant damages to livelihood and
infrastructure. The frequency and severity of disasters appears to have increased and most
models predict further intensification, underscoring the need to improve DRM.

188. Being better prepared for disasters can significantly reduce costs. With floods
being the most frequently occurring natural disasters, a clear priority is to improve the
availability and reliability of weather information, through investment in

                                                                                   80 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                   Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


hydrometeorological services and early warning systems. In general, decision makers in Lao
PDR lack necessary information to evaluate disaster risks and filling these data and
information gaps is a priority. Importantly, infrastructure should increasingly become more
resilient to disasters, including through climate-proof building and construction codes.
Disaster-resilient infrastructure in urban centers (water control structures, urban drainage,
and solid waste management) and in rural areas (river embankments, retention basins, flood
gates, and irrigation and drainage systems) can reduce losses from disasters. This will also
better prepare Lao PDR’s urban areas to deal with the ongoing urbanization. While pressures
appear to be manageable at the moment, investing early on makes sense as urbanization
usually precedes development with most of the geographical transformation taking place by
the time countries reach a per capita income of US$3,500 (The World Bank, 2009).

189. Successful recovery requires the Government to rapidly mobilize finances after
a disaster and have an effective system and operating procedures in place for their
efficient and timely use. Important elements of such a strategy would include (a)
consolidation of the various government funds; (b) using standard operating procedures for
emergency response; and (c) considering pooling of risks through a mutual insurance fund
with other countries in the region (Cambodia and Myanmar). Next, as agriculture is one of
the sectors most affected by disasters, introducing drought-resistant seeds for farmers and
emergency rice seeds and paddy reserves for the population affected by disasters can also
help.

190. Progress on dealing with UXOs needs to accelerate. Since 1996, 55,000 ha have
been cleared of UXOs, a fraction of the 8.7 million ha estimated to have been contaminated,
due to capacity and funding constraints. The number of casualties has been declining (from
3,000 in 2008 to 45 in 2014) as the authorities introduced a more results-based
methodology (The Lao People's Democratic Republic, 2015); however, the large number of
UXOs limits access to a significant part of the land and is a potential danger for a big part of
the population.

Introducing a basic social protection system to lower vulnerability

191. A fiscally affordable and well-functioning social protection system reduces the
risk of poverty and can help promote behavior change. The absence of a social protection
system is pushing a lot of people into poverty and increasing vulnerability. While
vulnerability is probably best addressed by increasing assets and providing income-
generating opportunities, a social protection system can help deal with shocks. Also,
international experience suggests that social transfers can be a useful vehicle in ‘nudging’
behavior which will be critical to making progress on reducing dropouts in education,
improving nutrition practices, dealing with teenage pregnancies and utilization of health
services (for example, MCH care), or building job-related skills for critical groups (literacy
for adults, technical skills for farmers, and so on). The awareness about the need for
channeling resources to the poor is gradually developing in Lao PDR and stronger capacity
to identify the vulnerable will be needed before a more comprehensive system is rolled out,
making this a medium priority.


                                                                                   81 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                   Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


192. Lao PDR needs to develop a national social protection strategy to outline the
type of interventions and instruments that would be applicable to Lao PDR’s context
and challenges. In the meantime, the share of the populations with financial protection
against potentially impoverishing health expenditure needs to increase through greater
allocation of resources for HEFs, consolidation of programs, and also more effective
enforcement of social insurance requirements in the private sector. This is also the objective
of the Government’s Universal Health Coverage (UHC) plans. Before new social programs are
designed and scaled up, Lao PDR will need to develop a robust mechanism for identifying the
poor and to improve delivery mechanisms for targeted, pro-poor interventions. Some early
steps have been undertaken recently, with the National Committee on Poverty Eradication
and Rural Development and the State Statistics Committee working toward generating
poverty scorecards and poverty maps. A stronger safety should also cover the relatively large
group of people living with disabilities in Lao PDR. The incidence of disability is assumed to
be highly attributable to low standards of health care, widespread poverty, and the high
incidence of UXOs. As a start, accessibility of public institutions needs to improve for this
group.

Improving inclusiveness of the financial sector to improve access to credit and lower
risks

193. A deeper financial sector would help expand MSMEs growth, help households
better manage risks, and facilitate investment. Limited access to finance constraints the
ability of households, especially the vulnerable, to invest in their assets while lack of
insurance prevents them from mitigating risks from economic shocks and natural disasters.
In addition to the limited options to those that are interested, low financial literacy and
awareness add a significant barrier to financial inclusion. On the side of the corporate sector,
access to finance appears to have receded as a concern; however, access is still challenging
for a significant part of businesses, especially smaller ones, while recent gains may be
undermined in case authorities fail to address risks in the financial sector. While reforms can
support financial inclusion, the efforts will only have a more meaningful result in case
weaknesses in the general business environment (enforcing contracts, improving financial
reporting) and financial sector stability (NPLs, capital adequacy) are addressed before
making this a medium priority. There is also strong complementarity with better functioning
of land markets. The poor have very few assets that could be used as collateral, and currently
in most cases this is land which banks are reluctant to take due to insecurity of tenure. The
authorities have pointed to the need to improve access to finance, though their efforts appear
to be mostly focused toward directed landing rather than improving the enabling
environment for banks to increase financial intermediation.

194. Some specific interventions need to be undertaken early on. In the banking
sector, the agenda is overlapping to a significant degree with the actions to lower financial
sector risks and macroeconomic stability. More stable banks will improve access to finance,
but they will need better credit information infrastructure. Furthermore, a better-capitalized
and functional deposit protection fund can help increase confidence in the banking system,
while putting in place nationwide, real-time payment systems can increase availability of and


                                                                                   82 | P a g e
 The World Bank Group                                          Lao PDR: Systematic Country Diagnostic


access to financial instruments (credit and debit cards, mobile banking, e-banking, and so
on). However, there is a broader agenda covering non-bank financial institutions, such as
microfinance institutions (village funds) and insurance and leasing companies, which if
properly regulated and supervised can increase availability of financing and instruments in
the economy.

Identified data and knowledge gap

195. Knowledge and data gaps have imposed limitations on some of the analyses in
the SCD. Additional insights were gained in a few areas during the SCD preparation,
especially on long-term growth prospects, the outlook for power generation, the linkages
between various causes of malnutrition, and the issues affecting businesses. However, a
significant gap remains. In many cases, important information is not available or not publicly
shared, preventing effective design of policies and monitoring and evaluation.
Administrative data systems suffer from weak reporting arrangements, while frequency and
coverage of surveys should increase. Furthermore, even when produced, data are either not
made publicly available or not disseminated effectively. The rest of this section presents the
identified gaps. This list is not exhaustive but provides pointers to critical areas where future
data efforts and analytical work may need to focus.

                                    Table 13: Identified data gaps
  Broad area                 Assessment of data availability and quality
  Macroeconomic              Weak and with delay. Important gaps exist, including on expenditure-side
                             GDP. Trade and balance of payments data are very weak. Monetary and
                             financial sector data are also delayed and unclear if they meet international
                             standards.
  Fiscal and debt            Weak and with delay. Elements of the economic classification of fiscal
                             accounts are available but are not fully compliant with Government Finance
                             Statistics (GFS) manuals. Functional analysis of the budget is not available.
                             Debt reporting has improved. Recent revisions should ensure compliance
                             with GFS.
  Employment                 Weak. A labor module is included in the LECS which is done every five years.
                             A labor force survey was done in 2010. Development partners undertake
                             surveys on ad hoc basis (that is, STEP survey in 2012).
  Poverty and social         Basic. Poverty data are derived from the LECS, the household expenditure
                             and consumption survey. In general, the LECS provides sufficient
                             information for identifying the poor and vulnerable. However, frequency
                             needs to increase and a light annual survey is being considered.
  Industry, private sector   Weak. Enterprises census is undertaken every five years but has limited
                             information and doesn’t cover the informal sector. Firm-level data are only
                             available from surveys undertaken mostly by development partners (World
                             Bank’s Investment Climate Assessment [ICA], GiZ, and so on).
  Health                     Weak, but slowly improving with the rollout of the health district
                             information system. Information on immunization, nutrition, and maternal
                             health is particularly weak. The authorities are currently undertaking an
                             update of the Health National Accounts.
  Natural resources/         Weak. Natural resources data from national sources are limited and
  environmental              somewhat unreliable, including due to inefficient collection as well as often



                                                                                               83 | P a g e

                        vague classification systems. Environmental quality is not systematically
                        monitored.
 Energy                 Weak. The hydropower sector lacks a central database. Energy supply and
                        demand data from different agencies are inconsistent and not always
                        updated or validated. Collection, recording, analysis, and presentation of data
                        from instruments regarding dam safety are not centrally processed, plotted,
                        evaluated, and interpreted for possible consequences.

196. The knowledge gap in a few areas requires immediate attention. More
specifically:

  •   The available information on fiscal accounts provides for only a basic understanding
      of trends and sustainability concerns. Furthermore, lack of data and information has
      limited the ability to more closely link service delivery to availability of resources.

  •   Similarly, better understanding the risks to the stability of the financial sector will
      require more information than currently available. Lao PDR remains one of the few
      countries that have not undertaken a Financial Sector Assessment Program.

  •   The information on labor market developments and earnings is very limited,
      preventing a deeper analysis of labor market dynamics. A Labor Force Survey will be
      undertaken later in 2016, but more frequent information, especially on trends in
      wages and sector employment will be useful.

  •   In agriculture, the knowledge on the functioning of the supply chain needs to be
      updated.

  •   A significant knowledge agenda remains in the natural resource sectors. One
      particular area is the value of natural products and biodiversity. Another is on the
      need for integrated water management, including the impact it will have over the
      hydropower strategy. Better understanding of the increase in generation capacity
      and demand for electricity and implications over public finances is also needed. Dam
      safety data collection, evaluation, and interpretation merits improvement.

  •   The understanding of green and resilient growth is still evolving in Lao PDR. Further
      analysis is needed to tailor this concept to the needs of Lao PDR. This work can also
      shed more light on how Lao PDR can promote environmentally friendly sectors, such
      as nature-based tourism.

  •   ICT sector assessment would look at affordability and access as well as how to use
      ICT for jobs and public service delivery.

Lao PDR’s infrastructure stock has been rapidly growing, and in general, is in line or in some
cases exceeds what would be expected from its income levels. Still, gaps in coverage exists
while the quality of infrastructure needs to improve.

The air transport infrastructure has expanded, with new airports added and others
upgraded. The number of airports may be excessive for current traffic volumes; though,
airports with higher passenger frequency may need upgrades. The quality of infrastructure
is in line with regional income peers, but the number of passenger arrivals is low, also due
to a delayed process of opening up.

Other infrastructure is less developed. Lao PDR has only few kilometers of rail and no
pipelines. Also, river transport is very limited as only a small percentage of rivers are sailable.
Second-generation infrastructure is growing, but lags countries in the region. Internet
penetration and mobile subscriptions are low even by lower-middle-income country
standards.

Access to improved sanitation facilities is above levels observed in Cambodia and in lower-
middle-income countries; however, lags other countries in the region. Access to improved
water source is higher; however, the comparisons to other countries are even worse with
coverage levels on par with Cambodia and below all regional and income peers.

     Annex 2: Development by harnessing natural resources—an
                            example
Once dependent on primary products, Malaysia today is an upper-middle-income economy
and one of the largest exporters of integrated circuits, electronics, and solar panels. While at
times adopting unorthodox policies (that is, large government presence, industrial policies,
entry restrictions), its success is due to policies that facilitated efficient use of natural
resources, collection of resource rents, and investment into human and physical capital,
supported by accountable institutions that prioritized stability and competitiveness.

Efficient use of resources. Natural capital accounted for 20 percent of national wealth in
2005, most of it in oil and gas, but also forests, agriculture land and other subsoil assets. In
oil and gas, the state-owned Petronas, in partnership with foreign parties, expanded
production, diversified into downstream activities (refining, processing, retail) and
converted the resource rents into government revenues. In agriculture, Federal Land
Development Authority (FELDA) policies, such as land allocation through settlements and
accompanying extension and marketing services, helped diversify the sector.

Investing in human and physical capital. Malaysia invested more than the resource rents
it received building a large capital stock (ranked 24 on the infrastructure pillar of the WEF
GCR). At the same time, the share of workers with secondary education or higher increased
from 43 percent of the labor force in 1982 to 81 percent in 2014. Education became more
accessible to low-income households, including through the FELDA settlement programs
which allowed for more efficient provision of services and infrastructure. Meanwhile, it put
in place a robust regulatory framework for higher education (standards, accreditation, and
quality control) that turned Malaysia into an international center for tertiary education.
Affirmative-action policies complemented increased supply and helped integrate the more
vulnerable groups. To respond to immediate concerns about lack of skills and workers, it
opened up the market to foreign labor since the beginning of its industrialization process.

Institutions. Economic management was generally prudent with low and stable inflation,
moderate debt levels, manageable external balances, and a competitive exchange rate. The
fiscal deficit between 1990 and 2015 was on average 2.2 percent of GDP with some
countercyclical fiscal behavior following shocks. Monetary and financial sector policies
reacted to signs of risks, though this still did not prevent episodes of crisis. Petronas played
a key role by limiting volatility, preventing exchange rate overvaluation, and investing into
productive areas. While its governance arrangements are not necessarily ‘good international
practices’ it still achieved world-class efficiency. Also, despite, at times significant
restrictions to market entry and distortions, a focus on attracting FDI and an export
orientation ensured strong competitive pressures and accountable service providers.
Malaysia has traditionally been a place with sound regulatory quality and a place where it is
easy to do business (ranked 18 on Doing Business).

Importantly, not everything worked. Rice subsidies failed to make the sector competitive
and ended up being a burden on the budget. Industrial policies to develop sectors without

strong comparative advantage (for example, heavy industry and automotive) also did not
produce the desired results. Importantly, the expansion in plantation agriculture and logging
also contributed to some environment degradation.

                 Annex 3: The agenda to tackle malnutrition
The Government is making some progress in institutionalizing and implementing
multisectoral and multi-stakeholder interventions that enhance food security and nutrition.
Initial progress has been made on strengthening local governance mechanisms and
enhancing the capacity for planning, delivery and monitoring.

In 2015, a multi-stakeholder process for the development of a National Nutrition Strategy
and Action Plan was facilitated by the Secretariat of the National Nutrition Committee, with
the support of the UN team and the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Civil Society Organization
(CSO) network. The Strategy and Action Plan were presented at the first National Nutrition
Forum (chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister) on November 20, 2015, and have been
published and distributed in Lao and in English languages.

The development of a Strategic Action Plan for Social and Behavioral Change Communication
for Improved Health and Nutrition has also been initiated by the National Nutrition
Committee’s secretariat and the Ministry of Health, with financial and technical support from
the World Bank, UNICEF, EU, and other development partners. Consensus was reached on
the multisectoral scope of the strategy, which includes key behavioral clusters around
maternal care and nutrition, infant and young child feeding, water and sanitation, and
agriculture and food security related practices. In the interim, a media campaign—via
national and local TV and radio stations—using existing video and audio resources has been
implemented and a community-based integrated nutrition package is being supported in
selected districts with the highest rates of undernutrition, food insecurity, and poverty.

Mapping of existing programs was conducted by the office of the secretariat to the National
Nutrition Committee with support from the UNICEF, EU, SUN network and other
development partners. The mapping has generated information on nutrition coverage,
budget, and activities according to priority interventions. In summary, the findings showed
that a large number of stakeholders are supporting nutrition interventions, but at present
this does not often translate into high coverage, neither geographically nor of target groups.
For example, of 13 evidence-based, high-impact direct nutrition interventions only some
micronutrient and deworming interventions are at scale. Almost US$42 million is reported
as spent in 2015—half of what is required per year for the next five years and reaching a
limited number of beneficiaries. Similarly, just over half of the funding required for the
period 2016–2020 is either allocated or expected from stakeholders.

                         Annex 4: Nature-based tourism
According to the 2014 Lao Tourism Statistics Report, the number of visitors to Laos grew by
19 percent per year in the last 10 years reaching 4.1 million tourists in 2014 and generating
US$641 million foreign exchange revenues. Of those visitors 3.7 million are on holiday
(260,000 on business) of which a small but increasing fraction are adventure and nature-
based tourists. Yet the growth potential might lie with this segment of the tourism market.
The development of environment-friendly nature-based tourism in Lao PDR provides an
exciting opportunity to create jobs and fiscal revenues while preserving natural resources
especially in rural areas, where options are limited. Lao PDR’s geographic location in South
East Asia, diverse culture and traditions, combined with spectacular landscape, cave
waterfalls, and a large number of natural and cultural sites provide a solid foundation for
further expansion of the sector. Growth of leisure travelers and environmentally conscious
consumers in the region is also creating the demand for the industry. Lao PDR’s efforts to
expand its tourism sector is also boosted by the concerted efforts of Cambodia-Lao PDR-
Myanmar-Vietnam (CLMV) for increasing the value proposition of the subregion, such as
through improved physical connectivity. A common point of attraction across CLMV
countries is nature, which the Governments have recognized and are supporting through
initiatives such as the ASEAN Declaration on Heritage Parks to increase sustainable tourism
activity in natural protected areas under the Declaration.

Costa Rica may provide a useful model for Lao PDR. Around 50 years ago, its forests faced a
reality similar to Lao PDR today. Forest cover had declined to 26 percent of the territory due
to growing pressures from agriculture, mining, and logging. However, the situation was
dramatically reversed for the better. The policies focused on removing barriers for
investment in nature-based tourism accompanied with policy reversal in biodiversity and
forest conservation, establishing of new protected areas, and providing incentives (payment
for environment services) to preserve the environment. As a result, forest cover was
restored to around 50 percent of the territory. But, this had costs as people were relocated,
the timber industry was downscaled and the incentives became a significant cost for the
budget. These were offset by growth in tourism, targeting the high-end of the market.
Tourism arrivals grew by 14 percent per year on average to reach 2.8 million tourists in
2014.

For Lao PDR to follow this example it would need to reverse the trend of forest cover decline
and protect natural resources. But, the agenda is broader. Tourism is a sector with strong
linkages and requires efficient connectivity (airlines, roads) and hospitality (restaurant,
hotels). Reforms to improve connectivity and human capital would be critical. An
appreciating exchange rate could also be hurting the prospects of the sector. Also, while
people want a way to experience nature, they prefer to avoid being exposed to the realities
of poverty and require easy access to high-quality services (for example, facilities with good
health and hygiene standards). Still, some sector-specific interventions can help.
Importantly, the awareness of Lao PDR as a tourist destination is low and will require a
better-organized sector and promotion. Also, standards on the use of protected areas for
tourism purposes should be developed and efficiently enforced.
