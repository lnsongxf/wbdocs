     from the premise that structural change from agriculture to secondary
     and tertiary sector activities is running out of steam in Turkey, and growth
     will have to come from within-sector productivity improvements. This
     involves the application of new technology, better management, and a
     more efficient allocation of resources, which are best accomplished in

          The 2000s was an impressive period for poverty reduction and
          increasing prosperity. A major economic transformation resulted in an
          increase of GDP per capita (purchasing power parity [PPP] adjusted) of more
          than 150 percent during the period 2000–2015. While this sustained growth
          was initially fueled by favorable global conditions, it slowed down during the
          global crisis in 2009, but has since recovered to rates higher than the OECD
          average. The positive economic dynamics were reflected in overall reductions in
          poverty and improvements in shared prosperity.

          This chapter presents a detailed account of progress and challenges
          concerning poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Turkey. The
          chapter documents levels and trends of poverty and shared prosperity in the past
          decade and exposes the drivers behind those trends. It also presents a baseline
          scenario of progress toward the twin goals using a micro-simulation model and
          population and economic growth assumptions. Finally, it discusses bottlenecks to
          take into account going forward.


          A. Progress in Reducing Poverty
          3. Turkey made significant progress in poverty reduction in the
          2000s. Poverty was more than halved during this period. The poverty
          headcount ratio declined by 25.4 percentage points during 2002–2014, falling
          from nearly 44 percent to 18 percent (Figure 1.1). Extreme poverty also

Changes in demographics (share of adults per household) and non-                                levels and other characteristics have been an important contributor to attaining
labor income (remittances, agricultural and other income) seem to                               higher incomes. Holding constant these characteristics, increases in returns
have played a marginal role in poverty reduction. Even though social                            have played an even more important role during the period of analysis. Going

incomes of the poor significantly. There may be scope for further increasing the                paragraphs. For some groups or regions the bottlenecks take the form of lack
effectiveness of social assistance to mitigate risks of vulnerability in the face of            of endowments (characteristics), while for some others the challenge hinges on
macroeconomic shocks.                                                                           the returns from the labor market (Figure 1.14).

Challenges Across Regions

Higher labor incomes and poverty reduction have been driven                                     	
by increasing returns to (human capital) assets and, to a lesser                                Although some subnational territories with high poverty incidence

23 - The microsimulation is based on the Global Income Distribution Dynamics (GIDD) framework. It
is a top-down macro-micro simulation framework that distributes macroeconomic shocks exploiting the
observed heterogeneity available in household surveys. The GIDD was developed by the World Bank and
was inspired by previous efforts involving simulation exercises (Bourguignon, Bussolo, and Da Silva 2008;
Bourguignon, Ferreira, and Leite 2008; Davies 2009; earlier versions of the GIDD model can be found in
Bourguignon and Bussolo 2013 and Bussolo, De Hoyos, and Medvedev 2010).

         What will be the engine of growth?



     Over the past two decades, the shift of employment out of
     agriculture into industry and services constituted the main engine
     of growth. The structural change driven by international and domestic
     market integration has brought increases in productivity and rising incomes.
     Trade liberalization in the 1980s and the Customs Union (CU) agreement
     with the EU in 1995 provided the price signals and competitive incentives for
     the modernization of Turkey’s industry. Structural reforms after the financial
     crisis in 2001 provided much needed stability and financing to the corporate
     sector, and together with more business-friendly regulations, facilitated the
     creation of jobs in manufacturing and services. Public and private investments
     in infrastructure, in particular transport, logistics, and energy, ensured that the
     benefits of international integration were spread inland (World Bank 2014a).

     New sources of productivity growth will have to come from
     technology absorption, innovation, and ‘moving up the value
     chain’. The agriculture sector still employs one-fifth of the labor force, and
     rural areas face much greater challenges in poverty reduction than urban areas.
     High-income countries typically have percentages of agricultural employment in
     the single digits, and between-sector structural change still has some way to go.
     Agricultural development therefore continues to be important for Turkey’s future.
     However, as between-sector structural change inevitably slows, productivity
     improvements within manufacturing and service sectors have to become the
     drivers of growth (Acemoglu, Aghion, and Zilibotti 2006; Benhabib, Perla, and
     Tonetti 2013). With rising wages, low-value-added manufacturing is losing
     competitiveness, leaving only technology upgrading and innovation as avenues

2.7). Mudabi (2008) describes a U-shaped curve of value creation in value
chains, with higher-value activities in pre-production or in post-production,
while at the center of the value chain—where manufacturing and standardized
services take place—there is less value added. More value added therefore lies
with the intangible activities or services than with manufacturing.

over incoming cases) has seen some positive developments, as highlighted by the
European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ), which considered
clearance rates and disposition times for main non-criminal case categories
(civil and commercial) as satisfactory based on 2012 data (CEPEJ 2014, 200).
According to the 2013 Activity Report of the High Council of Judges and
Prosecutors, the clearance rates are above 95 percent in general and in some
courts reach over 110 percent.36 The clearance rate in insolvency cases in first
instance courts in Turkey is notably high, reaching 127 percent in 2012.37 It is
considerably lower in consumer protection and labor courts. However, the level
of backlog remains high and delays remain challenging (European Commission
2015, 16). Average length of proceedings in enforcement and bankruptcy
offices was 787 days in 2014 and 732 days in 2015.38 People have to wait for
more than two years for the enforcement of decisions.

The quality of services delivered by courts needs improvement. The
efficiency of the legal framework in settling disputes and challenging regulations
as assessed by the Global Competitiveness Report 2015–2016 is declining.
While overall “the quality of judicial decisions has improved in recent years,”
weak reasoning at times limited to repeating the legal terms or the relevant
articles of the laws remains a challenge (European Commission 2014, 46;
European Commission 2015, 15). Consistency of adjudication remains weak
and undermines legal certainty. Also, the courts reportedly fail to comply with
procedural rules and stick to previous practices despite changes in legislation.
The appeal process does not address these challenges effectively as it is affected

             How can growth be sustainable?



      Irrespective of the difficulties to describe an amorphous mass of
      cities, utilities, infrastructure, land, and natural riches, these assets
      are as important as labor and capital in the production process
      and in determining well-being. This chapter discusses the availability of
      and constraints imposed by resources and public assets. We start with a look at
      Turkey’s urbanization experience and discuss infrastructure and connectivity
      issues. We then present opportunities for greening Turkey’s growth, challenges
      in the sustainability of water use, and issues in energy supply.


      A. Increasing Urbanization
      Fast urbanization has led to an impressive rise in Turkey’s city
      population, without some of the pains observed in other countries.
      Informality in housing is well below what would be expected for a country
      that went through such a rapid urbanization and population growth. Today,
      new firms are increasingly moving toward dynamic secondary cities, capturing
      economic spillovers from Turkey’s large primary cities, while taking advantage
      of lower land and labor costs. Turkey’s leading cities, meanwhile, are
      diversifying and innovating to remain competitive.

      Urbanization and economic growth should move in tandem, and
      Turkey is a good example. Urbanization and per capita incomes progressed
      above average (the HH quadrant in Figure 3.1). In contrast, some countries have

increasing, environmental footprint. Turkey’s rapid economic growth has
not come at the expense of a rapid depletion of its natural capital stock. While
sector-specific challenges deserve to be highlighted, on the whole Turkey compares
favorably with other industrialized and emerging market economies. At the same
time, emissions increased much faster than in other OECD countries in recent
decades. The challenge is to reduce the link between economic growth and
impacts on the environment, including from pollution, CO2 emissions, water
use, wastewater disposal, or degradation of fertile land. This section highlights the
challenges.

                               Prioritization


      The previous chapters explained how progress toward the
      twin goals in Turkey over the next 10 years will depend first and
      foremost on creating good jobs. They developed projections for labor
      force growth, and human and physical capital accumulation, as well as outlining
      the requirements for TFP growth, and, finally, sustainability. A short summary
      follows here.

         • Chapter 1 presented evidence of the importance of job creation and rising
         wages in Turkey’s success in poverty reduction and shared prosperity over
         the 2000s. Population projections show that Turkey is still benefiting from
         a falling dependency ratio (non-working-age to working-age population)
         until about 2025, when rising old-age dependency will outweigh falling
         dependency of minors. The ‘demographic window’ is the time during which
         Turkey could become rich before getting old, but only if people of working
         age were economically active, and the economy created jobs for the new
         entrants into the labor force. Progress toward the twin goals will rest in a
         major way on creating good jobs in the next 10 years. On the labor market’s
         supply side, human capital accumulation enhances productivity. The chapter
         provides a cautious, middle-of-the-road projection for GDP growth, wages,
         inflation, and so on based on assumptions of population and human capital
         growth, and extrapolation of recent trends on capital accumulation and
         TFP. This baseline shows a decline in poverty to 13 percent and 2 percent
         in 2025, from 21 percent and 4.5 percent in 2012, at US$5 and US$2.50
         poverty lines, respectively. Removing the constraints identified in this SCD
         could speed up growth and progress to the twin goals significantly.

Programs can be grouped together under the pillars of the NDP, although some are

published its reform plan for 2016 after the election in November 2015, which lays
out specific measures and a timetable for implementation. We highlight a few key
measures that correspond to some of the priorities identified in this SCD as follows.

      • The first pillar ‘Qualified Individuals, Strong Society’ identifies the need to
      boost LFP and human capital, and make growth more inclusive, including
      regarding regional differences. The reform agenda under this pillar covers
      skill development and labor market reforms.

         •Under this pillar, improvements in education follow the 2012 reforms
         that made 12 years of schooling mandatory. The Government now
         targets enhancing quality of education, the relevance of the curriculum
         to the demands of the labor market, and enhanced vocational training.
