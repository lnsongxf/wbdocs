Executive Summary

1.	 Not all court cases are the same, nor should they be treated the same. This principle
is known as differentiated case management, and it is increasingly adopted by courts to resolve
minor cases more efficiently and more effectively. According to Doing Business data, 138 economies
worldwide have either a small claims court or a simplified procedure of some kind for small claims.
In the European Union (EU), all but five jurisdictions have some form of fast-tracking procedure for
small claims. This report provides a comparative analysis of small claims procedures in the 28 EU
Member States to inform countries looking to introduce or reform such a procedure.

2. Though there is no fixed template, some common and salient features can be found
among the fast-track procedures in EU member states, particularly with regard to court fees,
types of disputes, thresholds, institutional set-up, procedure, possibility of self-representation, rules
for lawyers and their fees, avenues of appeal, and use of information and communication technology
(ICT). Most countries do not have dedicated small claims courts. Rather, small claims disputes
fall under the jurisdiction of district courts or other courts of first instance, depending on the type
of dispute. Small claims procedure may be optional and available at courts and parties’ discretion.
Nonetheless, small claims procedures can be tailored to each country’s unique context to enhance
access to justice and judicial efficiency.

3. Low court fees are important for facilitating access to justice through a small claims
procedure by making the procedure affordable for all. Examples range from countries that
charge no fees for the procedure to countries with sliding scales or fees pegged to the cost of living.
The average court fee in the EU28 for a claim of less than 2,000 EUR is 94 EUR, or 5 percent of
the claim.

4.    The types of disputes covered by small claims procedures vary, though civil and
commercial monetary disputes are the most common. Germany covers the broadest range
of disputes because the law references only the value of the claim and not the type of dispute. A
higher threshold for small claims procedure allows more citizens and business to use it, increasing
accessibility of the service. In the EU, the highest thresholds can be found in the Netherlands (25,000
EUR) and Austria (15,000 EUR).

5. Most countries adopt a combination of procedural tools to speed up and simplify the
process. For example, hearings may be conducted in writing; ordinary evidentiary rules, legal
representation, and ordinary rules for judgments may be waived; judges may take a more interactive
and assertive role with parties; and the process may be sped up with mandatory shorter deadlines.
Due to their simplified nature, there is usually no need for lawyers to represent the parties in small
claims procedure. As such, in most countries legal aid and recovery of costs from the losing party
are not available in small claims procedure. Appeals from small claims judgments can also be
limited. In some countries it is only possible to appeal on points of law (i.e., if serious procedural
mistakes have been made).

6. Electronic services facilitate the speed of procedure and reduce costs. More countries are
introducing e-services such as electronic submission of forms and online payment. Some countries
are also going further and conducting the procedure entirely online.

7. Raising awareness among citizens and businesses about the possibility of fast-tracking
their case can increase access to justice. According to survey data, 75 percent of EU citizens
are not aware that a small claims procedure exists, and many are deterred from pursuing valid
claims for fear of cumbersome procedures and long delays.1 Awareness-raising should focus on
poorer segments of the community and micro and small businesses. For these groups, their most
likely interactions with the court system is via a small claim, yet they are often deterred from seeking
justice due to high costs, complex procedures and lengthy wait times. A well-designed fast-track
procedure can ease these concerns and offer a service that meets their needs.

1. Introduction

8.	 The costs and long duration of court proceedings can be discouraging, and for the
poor and micro and small enterprises (MSMEs) it can preclude access to justice entirely.
According to the latest CEPEJ data, in 2014 disposition time of first instance civil and commercial
litigious cases ranged from 97 days in Lithuania to 532 in Italy, with an overall EU average of 250
days.2 Costs (comprising both lawyer and court fees) can sometimes be greater than the value of
the claim.3

9.	 Legislators around the world have long recognized that disputes concerning smaller
claims may not require the same complex procedures and rules; instead, they can be
resolved in a cheaper and more efficient manner. Although small claims procedure is not a new
phenomenon and has existed for decades, it has only recently gained traction. Factors such as
popular demand spur more and more countries into looking for new and faster ways to deal with
smaller claims, as citizens are looking for simpler, ICT-enabled ways to resolve smaller disputes.

10.	 The courts have also become more sensitive to citizens’ needs and are looking for more
service oriented and citizen responsive approaches. Another important factor is cost. Small
claims cases take up courts’ resources and effort at a time when resources need to be applied
judiciously. Small claims procedure frees up courts’ resources and reduces backlogs, enabling the
courts to focus on more complex cases.

11.	An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering introducing small claims
procedure or reforming their existing procedure to make it more cost effective and efficient.
An analysis of how the procedure works in other countries provides a useful input to the policy
making process in these countries.

12.	This report provides a comparative analysis of small claims procedure in the 28 EU
Member States — including lessons learned and good practices — to inform EU members
and candidate countries looking to introduce or reform their small claims procedure. It
considers a number of dimensions, namely: court fees, thresholds, institutional set-up, use of
technology, the role of lawyers, lawyer fees, and avenues of appeal.


2. Why do Small Claims Matter?

13.	 To simplify, speed up, and reduce costs of litigation, countries have introduced fast-
track procedures for smaller claims – a so called ‘small claims procedure’. Not only does a
small claims procedure help to free up courts’ resources and reduce backlogs (making it easier for
courts to focus on more complex cases), they also ensure access to justice for ordinary citizens.
Indeed, the 2013 Eurobarometer survey4 found that the ability to carry out proceedings in writing
and without a lawyer were the most common factors encouraging respondents to go to court
against a business.5 Unfortunately, as Figure 1 shows, the survey also found that 75 percent of
respondents6 were unaware of the existence of a small claims procedure in their country.

14. The benefits of small claims procedure for contract enforcement, in particular, have
been recognized by countries, corporations, and international organizations. The World
Bank, for example, recently incorporated small claims courts and fast-track procedure as a good
practice in its methodology for contract enforcement in its Doing Business report. According to
Doing Business data, 138 economies worldwide have either a small claims court or a simplified
procedure.7 Several global corporations have introduced their own small claim resolution systems.
Interestingly, eBay’s innovative approach to online dispute resolution inspired the online small
claims court currently being considered in the UK.8


15. The Special Eurobarometer 395, which surveyed EU citizens regarding disputes with
a retailer, provider or business transaction partner, can shed some light on citizens’ views
about small claims and their willingness to go to court over disputes under 2,000 EUR.9
As can be seen in Figure 2, 54 percent of the respondents would be willing to go to court with a
business located in their country over a dispute of 2,000 EUR or less. Willingness was the highest
in Germany (68 percent), Sweden (64 percent), and Austria (62 percent), while the consumers
least willing to take a business to court were in Bulgaria (31 percent), Cyprus (35 percent), and
Greece (36 percent)10. The report did not reveal why people in some countries were less willing
to go to court, however, it is noteworthy that neither Bulgaria nor Cyprus have a small claims or
simplified procedure. While Greece does have a dedicated small claims court, 92 percent of the
Greek respondents had not heard of it.

   A
    country receives a score of 1 if it has a small claims procedure which is applicable to all civil cases and the law sets a cap on
   the value of cases that can be handled through this court or procedure. If small claims are handled by a stand-alone court, the
   point is assigned only if this court applies a simplified procedure. An additional score of 0.5 is assigned if parties can represent
   themselves before this court or during this procedure. If no small claims court or simplified procedure is in place, a score of 0 is
   assigned. For more information, see: http://www.doingbusiness.org/methodology/enforcing-contracts

16. According to the Eurobarometer 395 survey, EU citizens are willing to go to court over
minor amounts. With regard to the financial threshold for involving the court, Figure 3 shows
that more than one in five EU citizens (21 percent) would be willing to go to court if the amount
of the dispute was up to 399 EUR and another 21 percent for an amount between 400 and 799
EUR. Seventeen percent would be willing to go to court if the amount of the dispute was 800 to
1,199 EUR. Only 5 percent of respondents would require a minimum amount between 1,200 to
1,599 EUR to go to court, while 6 percent would not go to court for less than 1,600 EUR. This
shows that the amounts that EU citizens are willing to go to court over can be very low. Intro-
ducing a small claims procedure would capture such claims, thus enabling citizens to have their
disputes resolved cheaply and efficiently.

3. What is Small Claims Procedure?
17. There is no universally agreed definition of small claims procedure. Doing Business
identifies it as a “mechanism for quick and inexpensive resolution of legal disputes involving
small sums of money”11 and lists such features as informal hearings, simplified rules of evi-
dence and more streamlined rules of civil procedure, and the possibility of self-representation.
Doing Business assigns a score to countries which have a small claims court or a fast-track
procedure for small claims in place which is applicable to all civil cases and where the law sets
a cap on the value of the disputes that can be handled through this court or procedure. For
countries where small claims are handled by a stand-alone court, the court needs to apply a
simplified procedure. It also assigns an additional score if parties can represent themselves
before the court or during the procedure.12 The European e-Justice Portal, which refers to
small claims procedure as its own category and contains information on the procedure in EU
Member States, does not provide a definition of what such procedure entails. The CEPEJ
report on the efficiency and quality of justice13, which makes reference to small claims proce-
dure, only notes that the definition of what constitutes a small claim differs across jurisdictions
and seems to only refer to the monetary value of what constitutes a small claim and not to the
procedure itself.

18. For the purpose of this report, ‘small claims procedure’ means any simplified or fast-
track procedure for claims up to a certain fixed monetary threshold, as specified under
the law.14



4. Small Claims Procedure in the EU
19. There is no template for how small claims procedures are set up in different jurisdic-
tions, but they do share some common features. Generally, the procedure has limited juris-
diction and is only available for certain types of disputes, usually simple civil/commercial claims
involving private persons, tenants/landlords, consumers, or businesses. The costs are usually
lower, both with regard to court fees and costs for lawyers, as the idea behind small claims
procedure is to keep the costs down, and in fact there is usually no need or even allowance for
lawyers. As a result, in some jurisdictions legal aid is not available.

20. Many jurisdictions offer detailed information about the procedure online, as well as
electronic services. To simplify and accelerate the process, many jurisdictions offer download-
able application forms and check-lists, as well as e-filing or e-payment.

21. In most jurisdictions, small claims follow a simplified procedure15 with deviations
from rules of ordinary procedure both for the parties and the court, making it easier for

     
     Order for payment procedure is also a form of simplified procedure which is available in most EU member states. However, the
     procedure falls under its own category, relating to uncontested monetary claims, often with its own procedural track, and is thus
     not part of this analysis. The order for payment procedure will be the focus of a forthcoming World Bank analysis. The report
     does not cover simplified procedure in criminal cases.
15
     There is no agreed definition of the term ‘simplified procedure’, which is sometimes used with reference to small claims. For
     
     example, the CEPEJ report on the efficiency and quality of justice uses it as a catch-all term for any kind of simplified procedure,
     including small claims and payment orders, as well as simplified procedures in criminal law and administrative law cases. The
     e-Justice Portal, on the other hand, refers to simplified procedure as an alternative to small claims procedure. For example,
     it states that Germany does not have any small claims procedure but does allow for a simplified procedure for any claims up
     to 600 EUR. Similarly, for Austria, it stipulates that no small claims procedure exists under Austrian law, but that a simplified
     procedure can be used for purely financial disputes of 25,000 EUR or less. No further explanation is provided regarding the
     definition or the difference with small claims procedure. In this report, ‘simplified procedure’ means a procedure which does not
     need to follow all the steps and requirements of ordinary procedure.


                                                                    11

ordinary citizens with no legal education to understand the process. This does not mean,
however, that due process is not ensured. The procedure is also more informal, as the proce-
dure normally does not foresee the need for lawyers, with the judge often being required to step
in to inform the parties about their rights and obligations.

22. Time limits for small claims procedure are usually shorter and the right to appeal is
limited. By setting stricter time limits, small claims procedure provides quicker resolution and
reduces costs. Further, once the small claims track is chosen it is normally not possible to trans-
fer the claim to ordinary procedure, and the right to appeal is generally limited except on points
of law.

     The available information on small claims procedure in different EU member states is somewhat inconsistent. For exam-

     ple, while the European e-Justice Portal states that there is no small claims procedure in Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech
     Republic and Finland, the Doing Business report only lists Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Finland as countries without a small
     claims procedure. The CEPEJ report on the efficiency and quality of justice, on the other hand, lists Belgium, Cyprus and
     Czech Republic among those countries which have small claims procedure, but not Bulgaria and Finland. For the sake of
     consistency, only those countries which fall within this report’s definition of small claims procedure are included in the analy-
     sis.

     Although Finland allows for a simplified procedure, it does not set any thresholds for the value of the claim, therefore it falls

5. Court Fees
25. Fees charged by courts to the parties for addressing claims are calculated in differ-
ent ways across EU Member States.21 These fall into three main categories: fixed court fees,
fees based a fixed percentage of the claim, and fees that vary according to claim value.22 Some
countries, such as the UK, allow for lower fees if the claim is made online. The average court fee
in the EU28 for a claim of less than 2,000 EUR is 94 EUR.23

26. In most EU jurisdictions, the absolute value of court fees for small claims procedure
increases with the value of the claim, but there is some variation among Member States.
Spain, for example, has no court fees at all. France, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Malta, Por-
tugal, and Sweden, have fixed court fees, regardless of claim value. The Czech Republic and
Croatia have a combination of a fixed fee and a fee based on a fixed percentage of the claim. In
several countries, such as the Czech Republic, Greece, Latvia, and Hungary, natural persons
with low incomes can request an exemption or deferral of fees, thus increasing access to justice
for the poor.

27. Figure 4 depicts court fees as a percentage of the value of the claim for three sample
values.24 In countries with a small claims threshold below 1000 or 2000 EUR, disputes above
these amounts are settled in ordinary procedure. In these countries ordinary court fees kick in in
relatively small cases and the procedure may become more expensive.

28. Court fees that are relatively high may have a detrimental effect on the use of small
claims procedure. Court fees which are higher than 10 percent of the claim value are consid-
ered disproportionate and may deter citizens from pursuing legal action.25 As seen in Figure 4,
in most countries the relative costs of going to court are highest for the lower threshold of 500

EUR and then drop as the value of the claim rises. The figure also shows that it is still relatively
expensive to go to court for disputes with a relatively small value. In 10 EU jurisdictions, the court
fees are more than 10 percent of the claim for disputes up to 500 EUR. Estonia has the highest
costs, where the court fee for a claim of 500 EUR is 25 percent of the value of the claim.


6. Types of Disputes

29. In most EU jurisdictions, only simple civil law cases can be resolved under the small
claims track, as seen in Table 2. These include commercial and consumer disputes, movable
property disputes, rent, damages, and contractual claims. Disputes involving cases such as
divorce, custody, or bankruptcy are generally exempted.

30. Only in Germany are there no limitations to court jurisdiction based on case type, as the law
only refers to the monetary value of the claim and not subject matter. Lithuania, Luxembourg,
Malta, and Romania only allow for monetary claims, while Austria allows for monetary claims
and social security and labor law disputes. The Netherlands allows for monetary and labor law
disputes as well as cases involving the lease of residential and commercial property.

31. Denmark, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, and Sweden provide exceptions in the law for the
types of disputes that are exempted from small claims procedure. For example, in Slovenia
disputes concerning immovable property, copyright, intellectual property, competition, and dis-
turbance of possession are not covered. Sweden expressly exempts family law matters.


                                                                 14

7. Thresholds

32. Small claims procedure is generally intended to only apply to uncomplicated cases
where the amount in dispute is low. In the EU, this amount varies as each country deter-
mines its own thresholds. Some countries have also set different thresholds for different types
of disputes, as is the case in Croatia, Spain, and Slovenia, where the threshold for commercial
disputes is higher than for private disputes.

33. There is no clear pattern for thresholds among EU jurisdictions. Rather, clusters of
thresholds can be discerned, which are presented in Table 3. The lowest threshold can be found
in Germany and Croatia (in the latter only for private claims), where the upper limit is 600 EUR.
On the lower range are also Lithuania and Slovakia, where the threshold ranges between
1,000 and 1,500 EUR. In the UK, there is no upper limit for cases that a judge deems to be sim-
ple26 and in Austria there is no limit for labor and social security law disputes, while there is a
threshold of 15,000 EUR for pecuniary disputes.

34. In Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovenia (for private disputes), and Swe-
den, the threshold ranges between 2,000 and 2,400 EUR. In France, Hungary, Malta, and
Slovenia (for commercial disputes only), the threshold is between 3,500 and 4,000 EUR.27 The
highest ranges, between 10,000 and 25,000 EUR, can be found in Austria, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain (for administrative disputes), and the UK. By comparison, the
European Small Claims procedure for cross-border cases has a threshold of 2,000 EUR.

35. Sweden adjusts the threshold value to take into account changes in the Consumer
Price Index (CPI). The small claims threshold is set to 50 percent of the price base amount,28
which is adjusted every year by the government based on the CPI. The price base amount for
2016 was set at 44,300 SEK (4,826 EUR), so for 2016 the small claims threshold is 2,413 EUR.
By comparison, in 2015 the threshold was 12 EUR higher at 2,425 EUR.


26
      he decision is made based on factors such as the amount in dispute, which should normally be under 10,000 pounds, and the
     T
     type of claim, normally consumer claims, accident claims, disputes between tenants and landlords, etc.
27
     
     The limit for small claims in Malta will be increased to 5,000 EUR. Times of Malta, Limit for cases filed at Small Claims Tribu-
     nal to rise to €5,000, October 22, 2015, available at: http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20151022/local/limit-for-cases-
     filed-at-small-claims-tribunal-to-rise-to-5000.589221.
28
     The price base amount is set by the government and is adjusted annually based on the price trends in Sweden. It is used for
     
     calculating different kinds of benefits and, as in this case, the threshold for the small claims procedure. Whenever the price base
     amount changes, the sums change automatically.


                                                                   15

36. The value of the threshold relative to income provides a better measure of accessibility
than the absolute value – the higher the threshold the more accessible the procedure. While
the threshold is the same in Austria and Portugal in absolute terms, it is significantly higher in
Portugal when compared to income as a percentage of GDP per capita.

37. Figure 5 shows the absolute value of thresholds for small claims procedure29
 across EU Member States and those thresholds relative to GDP per capita. Portugal has
a relatively high threshold, while Luxembourg has a relatively low one.

38. There is no clear pattern to the level of the threshold compared to a country’s GDP per
capita, nor does the ratio depend on geographical location. As a percentage of GDP per capita,30
the countries with the highest thresholds are Portugal and the Netherlands (88 percent and 63
percent, respectively). They are also significantly higher than the rest of the EU Member States.
Germany has the lowest threshold, at 2 percent. The remaining EU jurisdictions are evenly
spread ranging between 3 and 39 percent.

39. The thresholds in most of the countries are well above the average minimum range
of amounts that EU citizens are willing to go to court over. Only Croatian and German
citizens would be unwilling to go to court for amounts within the threshold in their countries. The
threshold for what constitutes a small claim in Croatia and Germany is 600 EUR. However, re-
spondents said they would only go to court if the amount of the dispute was 627 EUR in Croatia
and 657 EUR in Germany, which, as can be seen in Figure 6, constitutes 105 and 110 percent,
respectively, of the small claims threshold. Lithuanian and Latvian citizens would go to court
over the smallest amounts (i.e., 458 EUR and 474 EUR, respectively), while citizens of Spain
and Luxembourg would only go to court if the dispute amount was at least 880 EUR and 933
EUR, respectively.

8. Institutional Arrangements

40. Most EU Member States keep small claims procedure in regular courts, usually in dis-
trict courts or relevant courts of first instance, depending on the type of case (see Figure
7). Although a dedicated small claims court can save judicial resources over time, establishing
such courts may require upfront investment of both financial and human resources.

41. Very few countries have dedicated small claims courts. Greece has small claims mag-
istrates, while Malta31 has a small claims tribunal. In Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Latvia, Po-
land32, and Sweden, the small claims procedure falls under the jurisdiction of district courts. In
Croatia, France, Ireland, Lithuania, and Slovenia many disputes fall under district courts, but
they can also fall under other courts depending on the type of claim. For example, in Croatia
commercial claims fall under commercial courts, while in Ireland the Private Residential Tenan-
cies Board handles personal injuries, debts, and problems with lease agreements. In Estonia,
Germany, Portugal, Romania, and Slovakia, relevant courts of first instance have jurisdiction
depending on the type of claim. In Italy and Luxembourg, small claims procedure is handled by
the justice of the peace.




31
     I
     n Malta, the arbiters in the Small Claims Tribunal are appointed from amongst lawyers - who have been practicing law for at
     least seven years - for a term of five years. The adjudicators are not eligible for re-election.
32
     In Poland, small claims fall under common courts which are divided into divisions. If the claim is of a civil character, it is dealt
     
     with within the civil division of a district court. If it is a commercial claim, it is dealt with in the commercial division of the district
     court. The former is mandatory to be in place in every court. The latter can be allocated to the most efficient location where
     the court has jurisdiction over the case.

9. Procedure

42. As the objective of small claims procedure is to resolve disputes in a simpler, quick-
er, and cheaper manner than ordinary procedure, most jurisdictions allow for rules of
standard procedure to be set aside without compromising due process. This can involve
simpler rules for presenting evidence, hearing witnesses, or presenting a judgment. In some
countries the entire procedure can be held in writing and the parties do not need to attend court.

43. There is no “one size fits all” template for small claims procedure and most countries
have a tailor-made approach that fits their individual needs. Some countries may choose
to set aside ordinary rules for evidence, while others may not. In some jurisdictions small claims
procedure may be optional, while in others it is mandatory. Oral hearings may be required or
claims may be conducted entirely in writing.

44. Understanding the varied forms of small claims procedure may help countries choose
those procedures that best suit their needs and available resources. Table 4 and the sec-
tion below show some of the main features of small claims procedure in the EU. These include
whether the procedure is mandatory or optional, whether hearings are held orally or in writing,
the rules for taking evidence and judgments, the role of the judge, and what time limits, if any,
are in place to ensure a speedy process.

45. Mandatory/Optional: In the majority of EU countries small claims procedure is optional,
but once initiated cannot be transferred to ordinary procedure.33 Denmark has a flexible system
where parties can select either small claims procedure or ordinary procedure—regardless of
the threshold—unless the dispute is between a consumer and a business, in which case it must
be processed under the small claims procedure. In Estonia and Germany, a simplified proce-
dure is an option and is used at the court’s discretion, regardless of the parties’ preferences.
Only in Greece and Lithuania is small claims procedure mandatory, both for the parties and
the court.

46. Hearings: In 12 EU countries, court hearings are not mandatory and the court may decide to
resolve the dispute through written procedure (Estonia, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania,
Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, and the UK). However, parties
can request an oral procedure or the court can deem it necessary, for example, if the case is
complex. In Croatia, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, and
Spain, on the other hand, the small claims procedure is oral and parties or their representatives
are required to attend the hearing. In France, Ireland, and Italy the Judge, the Registrar, or the
Justice of Peace, respectively, first attempt to reconcile the parties and only when reconciliation
is unsuccessful is the matter transferred to small claims procedure.

47. Taking Evidence: Several countries have introduced more flexible and relaxed rules on
taking evidence compared to ordinary procedure. In Estonia, Germany, Greece, Malta, Po-
land, Romania, Slovenia, and the UK, the formal requirements for taking evidence can be set
aside. For example, the court can hear a witness or expert by phone or in writing or recognize
other means of proof as evidence (e.g. statements not given under oath). In Austria, for claims
below 1,000 EUR the ordinary rules of evidence can also be set aside and the judge can decide
to disregard evidence in certain cases. For the sake of speedy resolution, some countries have
restrictions on expert witnesses. In Poland, it is not possible to hear expert witnesses, while in
Portugal it is only possible to hear one expert witness. In the UK, the judge decides on a case-
by-case basis whether expert witnesses will be heard or not. In Malta, the Small Claims Tribunal
Act specifically states that proceedings will not be deemed invalid even if formalities are not


33
     n Denmark, Poland, Romania and the UK, however, the court can decide to transfer a claim to ordinary procedure if the
     I
     case is too complex.


                                                               19

observed as long as there has been substantial compliance with the Act.34 In France, Hungary,
Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, and Sweden, how-
ever, the rules for taking evidence are the same as for ordinary procedure.

48 Judgments: In Austria, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia,
and the UK the formal requirements for the judgment itself are more flexible and simplified and
the judge can, for example, omit the description of the facts in his or her judgment. In Greece,
Ireland, Slovenia, and Spain the court delivers its judgment immediately after the oral hearing.
In France, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, and
Sweden the contents of the judgment must be the same as under ordinary procedure.

49. Role of the Judge: In several countries judges have a more interactive role with the parties
to a small claims procedure than under ordinary procedure. For example, in Austria, judges are
required to give parties appropriate guidance on filling out forms and their procedural rights and
obligations, as well as any legal consequences of their acts and omissions. In Germany, the
court has a duty to explain the proceedings and clarify the issues. Judges in Denmark play an
active role, attending to the preparation of the case and assisting and guiding the parties, while,
on the other hand, in Luxembourg the courts and bailiffs have no obligation to assist the parties.
In Croatia, small claims disputes can be assigned to court advisors who are public servants,
while in Malta, the Small Claims Tribunal is presided over by a lawyer.

50. Speed: Several countries have tighter deadlines for small claims procedure than for ordi-
nary procedure. In Hungary, for example, the court has to review the small claims form within
eight days and schedule a first hearing within 60 days of receiving the form. In Italy, the time
between serving the summons and appearance in court is half that of ordinary procedure and
judgment should be rendered 15 days after the final hearing. In Lithuania, the average duration
of small claims proceedings is intended to be one to three months, while in Portugal the hearing
is held within 30 days of the application. Latvia’s Civil Procedure Law, however, does not pro-
vide for any time limits for the conduct and resolution of small claims cases.

51. Length of Proceedings: A speedy procedure is one of the cornerstones of the small claims
track. While there are no statistics for the EU28 Member States on the average length of pro-
ceedings, most countries have time limits for different steps of the procedure, for example: for
setting a hearing once a small claim has been received; for when the applicant and defendant
need to respond; for when the judgement must be rendered; and for when the appeal must be
lodged. In Ireland, if the parties fail to come to an agreement through the Registrar they are
called to a court hearing and the law prescribes the court hearing be set at least 14 days after
the court receives the small claim, although in practice the parties are usually given one month’s
notice to appear in court. In Hungary, the court has to set a hearing within 60 days after receiv-
ing a small claim, while in Portugal the hearing needs to take place within 30 days.

52. Enforcement of Decisions: Enforcement arrangements impact the efficiency of small
claims procedure. Notably, several countries do have specific procedures to facilitate enforce-
ment of small claims. In the UK, if the debtor does not pay after receiving the court order, the
claimant can ask the court to collect the payment or to send bailiffs to collect it. The claimant
needs to pay another court fee (in addition to the fee that was paid for the small claims proce-
dure) in order for the court to process this request. In Ireland, if the respondent has not paid
within 28 calendar days, the claimant can turn to the Sheriff for enforcement of the decision.



10. Rules for Lawyers and Fees

53. An important feature of the small claims procedure is that it often eliminates the
need for parties to be represented by a lawyer. In most jurisdictions, parties are free to have
a lawyer if they wish, but are often not entitled to legal aid. Some countries allow parties to be
represented by non-lawyers (Malta, Latvia, and the UK), while in others (France and Greece),
the law lists those who can represent parties, including a spouse, registered partner, or parents.
In Austria, Denmark, and Germany, it is the judge who advises and guides the parties through
the procedure, but lawyers may be present and may even be mandatory in some instances (see
section 55 below).35 According to Doing Business, of all EU jurisdictions, only Lithuania does
not allow self-representation in small claims procedure. In Latvia, the use of a lawyer is optional.
No statistics could be identified on whether the use of a lawyer contributes to faster small claim
proceedings.

54. As with the different options for the procedure for the small claims track, the rules for
lawyers and fees vary across the different Member States. Countries may want to look at the
available options and choose the solutions that best fit their needs and resources.

55. Mandatory Legal Representation: Some jurisdictions require legal representation for
claims exceeding a certain amount. For example, in Austria parties are required to have legal
representation if the claim exceeds 5,000 EUR, in Italy parties must have legal representation
if the claim is more than 1,100 EUR, and in Spain legal representation is mandatory for claims
above 2,000 EUR.

     
     Information in English on rules for lawyers and fees is sparse, thus this should be kept in mind when considering the assess-
     ments in this section.


                                                                 21
                       Fast-Tracking the Resolution of Minor Disputes: Experience from EU Member States




56. Optional Legal Representation: In Croatia, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland36, Lat-
via, Lithuania, and The Netherlands, legal representation is optional. Thus, in most of these
countries it is not possible for the parties to apply for legal aid. Furthermore, in those countries
where legal representation is not deemed necessary, all parties bear their own costs and are not
entitled to recover the costs of a lawyer from the losing party. There are some exceptions to this
rule: in The Netherlands and Latvia the judge can decide that the losing party shall also pay the
legal assistance costs of the opposing party.

57. Ordinary Rules for Lawyers’ Fees: In Austria, Germany, Italy, and Latvia the rules for
ordinary procedure apply with regard to use of lawyers and their fees.

58. Fixed Costs: Fixing the lawyers’ fees in disputes involving small claims is a good way to
prevent soaring costs for the parties. Denmark has opted to establish fixed costs for those who
wish to be represented by a lawyer in a small claims procedure. The costs are 2,700 DKK (360
EUR) for cases that take up to one hour in court, 4,000 DKK (540 EUR) for cases up to two
hours, and 6,000 DKK (805 EUR) for cases up to three hours. The rates are lower for relatively
low amounts: 1,500 DKK (200 EUR) for claims less than 5,000 DKK (670 EUR), and 2,500 DKK
(335 EUR) for claims between 5,000 and 10,000 DKK (670 - 1,340 EUR).

59. Legal Aid: In most EU jurisdictions, parties to small claims procedure are not entitled to
legal aid. There are some exceptions: in Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, The Netherlands, and
Slovenia parties to a small claims procedure can be granted legal aid if they are deemed in
need. Legal aid may be provided only partially free of cost and the applicant may be required to
contribute to the costs in accordance with his or her financial situation.

60. Losing Party Pays Principle: In Estonia, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Portu-
gal, Romania, and Slovenia the losing party pays all the costs, including the costs for legal fees
of the opposing party. Luxembourg has opted for a slightly different solution: although the losing
party normally pays the costs of the other party, lawyers’ costs are not normally reimbursed, but
the judge may award the successful party a lump sum that can include lawyers’ costs. In Swe-
den, the winning party may only be reimbursed for one hour of a lawyer’s advice (apart from
fees and costs of travel and translation). In the UK, the winning party may claim any court fees,
but the costs of legal advice (up to 260 GBP) may only be claimed in certain types of cases. In
contrast, in Ireland, each party pays their own fees and lawyers’ costs are not reimbursed by
the losing party.



11. Avenues of Appeal

61. To prevent strain on judicial resources, many countries limit avenues of appeal for
smaller claims. Providing citizens and businesses the opportunity to resolve small claims dis-
putes in court can facilitate access to justice, but allowing disputes to continue over several in-
stances could prove costly for the courts. Table 5 shows the avenues of appeal for small claims
in EU member states and whether it is possible to appeal at all.

62. In France, Greece, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia there is no right of appeal, but
some make exceptions on points of law (e.g., if there has been a serious breach of proce-
dural law). Sweden requires the permission of the court of appeal which can only grant leave
if the examination of the case would have an impact on case law or if the lower court’s decision
is expected to be overturned.37


36
     In Ireland businesses are required to have legal representation in small claims procedure though consumers are not.
37
      he same rule applies to appeals in ordinary procedure in Sweden.

                    Fast-Tracking the Resolution of Minor Disputes: Experience from EU Member States




63. In other countries, the right to appeal varies depending on the value of the claim. In
Denmark, appeals are only possible for claims above 10,000 DKK (1,330 EUR), while in Germa-
ny appeals from claims under 600 EUR are only possible if the court of first instance grants explicit
leave for appeal. In Austria, the right of appeal is limited: for claims not exceeding 2,700 EUR,
appeals are only allowed on points of law or if the court made a serious procedural error rendering
the procedure invalid, but for claims above 2,700 EUR normal rules of appeal apply. In Italy no
appeals are possible for claims under 1,100 EUR, in the Netherlands appeals are possible for
claims exceeding 1,750 EUR, and in Spain appeals are only possible for claims above 3,000 EUR.

64. Estonia, Ireland, Lithuania, Malta, Portugal, Romania, and Slovakia, allow for appeals
of small claim disputes in all instances. In Latvia, appeal is possible only to the court of
second instance, but not to the third instance. In some countries, like Ireland, the small claims
procedure no longer applies when an appeal is made. This means that the fees are higher, legal
representation is mandatory, and the judge might award costs against the claimant.

TABLE 5 Avenues of Appeal for Small Claims Procedure in EU Member States

Country         Avenues of Appeal
Austria         Right of appeal for small claims is limited under Austrian law. For claims under 2700 EUR, appeals are only
                allowed on points of law or on grounds of invalidity, i.e. in the case of extremely serious procedural errors.
                For claims above 2700 EUR, normal appeal procedure applies.
 Croatia        -
 Denmark        No possibility of appeal for claims under 10,000 DKK (1,330 EUR)
 Estonia        Appeals of simplified proceedings follow the ordinary procedure. Appeals are made to circuit or district courts
 France         No possibility of appeal
 Germany        Where the claim does not exceed 600 EUR, appeals are not allowed unless the first instance court grants
                explicit leave for appeal.
 Greece         No possibility of appeal
 Hungary        Appeals can only be made on the grounds of a serious breach of procedural rules or the incorrect application
                of the legislation.
 Ireland        Appeal is possible before the Circuit Court
 Italy          If the disputed value does not exceed 1,100 EUR no appeal is possible. Appeal is only possible if there has
                been a breach of procedural rules, constitutional law or Community law, or of the principles governing the
                subject‑matter
 Latvia         Only one appeal is allowed. No cassation to the 3rd instance is allowed.
 Lithuania      Appeals may be filed within 30 days from the passing of the judgment
 Luxembourg     Ordinary rules for appeal apply for order for payment cases, while summons cases before a justice of the
                peace can only be appealed if the value of the claim exceeds 1,250 EUR.
 Malta          Appeals are made to the Court of Appeal by filing a claim in the Court’s Registry.
 Netherlands    Appeals are possible for claims exceeding 1,750 EUR. Civil cases are brought to the four competent courts
                of appeal and administrative cases to the two competent courts of appeal (one for planning matters and one
                for civil servants).
 Poland         Appeal is allowed only on a point of law and is decided upon by a single judge (instead of 3) in written
                procedure.
 Portugal       Appeals are not subject to specific rules and are thus allowed in the way of ordinary procedure.
 Romania        Appeal is possible.
 Slovakia       The possibility to appeal is the same as for ordinary procedure. Appeals shall be filed within 15 days of the
                ruling
 Slovenia       Appeals are only possible on the point of law.
 Spain          Appeal is only possible for claims above 3,000 EUR. The appeal is submitted to the same court in writing
                within 20 days of the passing of the judgment.
 Sweden         Appeal is allowed but requires permission from the court of appeal. Leave to appeal may only be granted if
                the examination of the case would have a wider impact on the application of the law or if the court’s decision
                is expected to be overturned on appeal. Appeals are made to the competent Court of Appeal (Hovrätt)
 UK             The possibility of launching an appeal is not available as a matter of right. The party must ask the trial judge for
                permission and give persuasive reasons. Court claims for money can be appealed within 21 days of the ruling.

12. Use of Technology

65. The use of technology in small claims procedure has several benefits: it facilitates
access to information and access to justice, reduces the administrative burden for all
actors, and speeds up proceedings. While some progress has been made, several countries
fail to offer any electronic services at all while others only offer downloadable forms and online
information. In a number of countries, filing a complaint still requires the traditional procedure of
filling out a paper form and posting it by mail or bringing it to the relevant court.

66. The latest EU Justice Scoreboard shows that there are significant differences be-
tween EU jurisdictions in allowing litigants to pursue a small claim online, as illustrated
by Figure 8. No regional patterns can be discerned. Estonia, Lithuania, Malta, and Portugal
offer the most comprehensive packages of information and services online, including how to:
start a small claims procedure, obtain information on related legislation and rights, share ev-
idence and supporting documents, retrieve a judgment, and appeal against a court decision.
It is encouraging that compared to the previous year, there has been improvement in all cat-
egories.38

67. In the majority of jurisdictions, there is a gap between providing information
about small claims procedure and actually offering online services.39 Only Esto-
nia, Lithuania, Malta, and Portugal score 100 percent for online availability. According
to the European Commission’s Background Report Delivering the European Advantage,40

appeal of small claim procedures is the service and information offered online in fewest instanc-
es, in those countries where appeals are possible.

68. Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Slove-
nia, Sweden, and the UK offer some form of electronic services, for example electronic submis-
sion of claims (Denmark, Ireland, Slovenia, and Sweden). In Poland, it is possible in some
courts for the parties to log in and check the status of their case, but the case is not processed
electronically. Ireland and the UK (claims under GBP 100) offer “regular” e-services and also al-
low for an alternative “small claims online” procedure41 conducted entirely online by district court
offices and available to both consumers and businesses.

13. Awareness of Small Claims Procedure
71. A large obstacle to using small claims procedure is the lack of awareness about its
existence among the general population.45 As Figure 9 shows, awareness of small claims
procedure ranges between 4 and 42 percent across EU jurisdictions. According to the Special
Eurobarometer 395, 75 percent of EU citizens were not aware of and had not heard of small
claims procedure. Awareness raising campaigns aimed at the general population and targeted
court users may be worth exploring to boost the use of the procedure.

72. In addition to raising awareness, a number of other features could be emphasized to
encourage citizens to pursue a small claim. According to the Eurobarometer survey46 these
include being able to carry out the proceedings remotely, in writing, online, and without the ne-
cessity of a lawyer. Furthermore, two thirds of the respondents said they would be more likely to
go to court over a dispute under 2,000 EUR if they received free legal assistance. This indicates
the population is not aware of how the procedure works and that it can, and should, be conduct-
ed without the help of a lawyer. Here, consumer organizations and easily accessible information
about the procedure could contribute to its wider use.

14. Conclusion and Recommendations
73. Judiciaries across the world are looking for innovative ways to simplify and speed
up resolution of small disputes. This report provides some comparative evidence of how judi-
ciaries in the EU have achieved this through small claims procedures. Countries differ but there
are salient common features, including: lower court fees, types of eligible cases, thresholds for
what constitutes a small claim, institutional set-up, simplified procedural track, the possibility of
self-representation, restricted avenues of appeal, and the use of technology.

74. Some core recommendations may be drawn from the analysis:
   i.	 Court fees should be less than 10 percent of the value of a small claim, and pref-
       erably less than 5 percent. Research shows that court fees which are higher than 10
       percent of claim value are considered disproportionate and likely deter citizens from pur-
       suing their legal rights. Therefore, low or no court fees are recommended in small claims
       procedure.

    ii.	 Thresholds should reflect local context but should be low enough to provide ac-
         cessibility to large groups of potential court users. With widely varying thresholds for
         small claims procedure across the EU (from 600 EUR in Germany to 25,000 EUR in The
         Netherlands) it is difficult to assess the optimal threshold. However, the threshold of 2,000
         EUR introduced by the EU for European small claims procedure for cross-border disputes
         can serve as a barometer of a reasonable threshold. In setting thresholds, policymakers
         should consider incomes per capita and local cost of living.
   iii.	 The types of disputes covered should at least include civil and commercial cases.
         While several countries also allow for other types of disputes, civil and commercial dis-
         putes are subject to small claims procedure in all of the countries covered by this study.
         Though there is no concrete data on this, many small claims disputes would appear to be
         between consumers and sellers and between small businesses. Family law disputes are
         often (but not always) explicitly excluded from small claims procedure.
   iv.	 The procedure should value flexibility and responsiveness to citizens and busi-
         nesses. One of the defining features of small claims procedure is its flexibility, which
         allows for speedier resolution. One particularly good practice is found in Malta where the
         Small Claims Tribunal Act states that proceedings will not be deemed invalid even if for-
         malities are not observed, as long as there has been substantial compliance with the act.
    v.	 Judges should take an active role in proceedings. A defining feature of the procedure
         is that self-representation is allowed. So, in order to ensure due process and that parties
         without legal representation are not at a disadvantage, the judge in small claim cases
         should take a more active role and guide the parties through the process. This is likely to
         require the careful selection of judges adept at this approach, and training will likely be
         required to instill a proactive culture among small claims judges.
   vi.	 E-services should be offered wherever possible, with analogue back-ups. As the
         report shows, in many cases small claims procedure can be conducted entirely in writing
         and court hearings may not be necessary. Conducting the entire procedure online should
         therefore be an option for the courts. Courts should at the very least offer parties the op-
         tion to pay court fees online and to submit applications online. In-person options should
         always be available for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with limited in-
         ternet access, with an expectation that demand for in-person services will reduce in the
         medium term.
  vii.	 Policymakers should consider how best to ensure effective enforcement of small
         claim judgment. From the perspective of the user, the enforcement procedure is a key
         step in their path to justice, even if the court sees it as a separate procedure. For example,
         if the fast-track procedure delivers a judgment quickly, but the enforcement of decisions is
         lengthy or requires additional costs, as is the case in the UK, citizens and small business-
         es may continue to be deterred from bringing valid claims. In that case, improvements to
         the enforcement procedure should be factored into the reforms.
 viii.	 Raise awareness about the possibility of fast-tracking. Surveys show that 75 per-
         cent of EU citizens are not aware of the existence of a small claims procedure, so many
         citizens and businesses labor under the erroneous assumption that the process will be
         lengthy and costs will be high. Countries that already have a small claims procedure
         should consider launching awareness raising campaigns to encourage citizens and busi-
         nesses to use this friendly service as part of broader government responsiveness initia-
         tives. Countries looking to introduce such a procedure should consider dissemination as
         a key part of the reform rollout.
75. Resolving small claims via a fast track has many benefits: it frees up court time and
court resources, it reduces backlogs, and it improves access to justice for ordinary cit-
izens and micro and small enterprises. Jurisdictions that lack a small claims procedure, or
wish to improve the effectiveness of their existing procedure, would do well to consider how best
to incorporate these good practices into their context.
