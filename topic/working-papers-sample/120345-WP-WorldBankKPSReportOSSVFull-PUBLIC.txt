               Executive Summary
               This report summarizes the discussions, deliberations, and conclusions of a three-day
               international workshop focused on service delivery through one-stop shops (OSS). The
               participants of the workshop were public officials and development professionals from 29
               countries, hence the proceedings represent the practitioners’ view rather than an academic
               approach. The sessions during the workshop were interactive and took various forms:
               presentations, panel discussions, pecha-kucha style rapid talks, peer exchanges during a
               “gallery walk” session, and learning visits to OSS in Singapore and Malaysia.

               The workshop was co-organized by the UNDP, World Bank and Regional Hub of Civil
               Service in Astana, reflecting a growing global interest in OSS. The term OSS is used to
               denote service centers for citizens and firms that offer consolidated access to multiple public
               and/or private sector services at a single location through one or more service delivery channels.
               A recent World Bank study identified 82 countries that offer OSS for government-to-citizen
               (G2C) services. Development partners, such as UNDP, World Bank, and bilateral donors have
               been supporting governments in establishing and operating OSS. The most successful OSS
               initiatives have had measurable impact on the quality of service delivery. This includes such
               measures as citizens’ satisfaction, lower corruption, and greater efficiency of service delivery.



               The key highlights from the deliberations included the following:

               i.	 Although there are many different models of OSS adopted worldwide, global trends in
                   OSS include four common features: access, personalization, speed, and interaction.
                   Increasing access means supplementing brick-and-mortar centers with electronic and
                   mobile services. Personalization refers to providing targeted information based on citizen’s
                   interests and needs. Speed concerns reducing transaction times and involves re-engineering
                   and simplifying processes and procedures. Finally, interaction refers to engaging citizens,
                   from receiving feedback from citizens to engaging them as co-creators of OSS.

               ii.	 Innovation is often used synonymously with OSS: not only because of the link between
                    OSS and e-government, but also due to new approaches such as design thinking. The
                    most significant developments in the design and functioning of OSS are linked to
                    technological advances. The most state-of-the-art OSS utilize back-end integration. This
                    requires interconnected and interoperable public registries and databases, exchanged
                    across agencies through data exchange. In addition, countries are using technology for
                    citizen engagement and outreach. For example, the OSS in Azerbaijan employs a proactive
                    social media strategy. Various feedback mechanisms include video-chat, exit surveys, and
                    complaint books and hotlines. In Singapore, the rapid pace of technological advancement
                    enabled new thinking. The Singaporean public service is exploring ways to strengthen data
                    analytics, introducing virtual reality, and new means of communication, such as intelligent
                    chatbots for gathering feedback. Singapore’s Innovation Lab for the OSS brings together
                    various disciplines – data analytics, design thinking, behavioral insights, organization
                    development – in order to re-design public service and transform user experience.

Executive Summary




iii.	 High-level leadership, strategy, and institutional reform are the key preconditions for a successful
      introduction of OSS. There was a unanimous consensus that high-level political commitment is
      crucial for success of OSS, as well as that an OSS reform cannot succeed in isolation. Rather, it must be
      accompanied by legal and institutional reforms that support citizen-centric service delivery. In some
      countries, such as Kazakhstan, there is a medium-term strategy for the reform, endorsed by the country’s
      top political leadership, providing the authorizing environment for the necessary regulatory changes.
      A long-term vision also leads to many supporting reforms in public administration, introducing ICT
      technologies, improving service culture, citizen feedback, as well as engaging youth.

iv.	 Countries around the world have adopted different models of OSS that allow for learning from
     these differences. In Eurasia, governments opted for fundamental administrative reform and back-end
     integration, offering services through operators. In contrast, countries in the South and East Asia tend
     to prefer OSS that co-locate service providers under one roof without back-office integration. One of
     the sessions in the workshop juxtaposed five different models with a wide range of OSS scope, level of
     services, and success. Both citizen OSS (Vietnam, Myanmar and Moldova) and business OSS (Canada
     and Malawi) were included. Despite the different models, there were several common threads across
     the presentations. The key themes included the lessons of ambition versus realism, the importance
     of sequencing and incentives, and the need to capitalize on a political window of opportunity. Each
     reflected the importance of context in the design and operation of the OSS.

v.	 Front-office functions in OSS, such as physical spaces, customer service, and citizen feedback,
    are as important as the decision whether to integrate the back-end functions. Some countries (e.g.
    Georgia, Azerbaijan) opted for a new flagship building constructed specifically as an OSS that symbolizes
    transformation and a new approach to public services. Others (e.g., Malaysia, Albania) are re-using and
    repurposing existing space to save time and money. Nature and level of citizen feedback also differs,
    from a national portal in Bangladesh to citizen-feedback via SMS in Albania. There are also different
    human resource management (HRM) aspects: in Kazakhstan and Georgia, front-office operators provide
    all services, while in Malaysia, Azerbaijan, and Singapore, front-officers are the seconded representatives
    of a specific agency and offer only of the services provided by that agency. Countries choose their own
    approaches based on many factors, such as the country context and available financing – but most
    importantly, according to the goals of establishing the OSS.



The emerging conclusions from the workshop concerned the OSS success factors, design
considerations, as well as the future trends in OSS:

i.	 What factors contributed to the successful rollout and positive impact of OSS around the world?
    Workshop discussions distilled the following success factors:
       üü clearly defining the underlying policy problem that OSS are expected to solve;
       üü visionary top leadership;
       üü link to an underlying public administration reform program or strategy;
       üü thought-out reform sequencing;
       üü high-level coordination across governments agencies;
       üü accessibility; and
       üü OSS branding.

                                                                                              Executive Summary




ii.	 What can be learned about the OSS design from successful OSS experiences? The deliberations
     of the workshop produced a checklist for policy makers who embark on designing reforms of service
     provision through OSS:
        üü Develop a strategy to ensure a whole-of-government approach
        üü Assess the need for the institutional and administrative reform
        üü Define the required changes in the legislative and regulatory framework
        üü Determine the modality of service provision: will the OSS simply collocate the service providers or
           fully integrate service provision in a single window?
        üü Choose a financing model: free access, subsidized services, or cost recovery
        üü Determine the extent of the back-end integration and required data exchange
        üü Decide on the citizen interface features: new building versus using existing space, integration with
           community and lifestyle, training of front office staff, customer service standards
        üü Define the monitoring and evaluation framework, including KPIs: what does success mean? How
           will the user feedback be collected?

iii.	 What are the new trends in the evolution of OSS? Strategic shifts in public service delivery that are
      already underway in the most innovative OSS include: automating routine transactions; predicting service
      needs; focusing more on the citizen as a person; and providing personal relationship management for
      more complex services. Some of the new trends in the evolving OSS include:
        üü seamless customer-centric services, or breaking down intra-agency silos and instead acting as one;
        üü co-design and co-delivery of public services, or getting key stakeholders (e.g. customers, partners)
           to actively participate in development and design of public services;
        üü personalized services for complex issues; and
        üü predictive and anticipatory services, so that services are delivered to customers at the point of
           need and using the right mix of delivery channels.

CHAPTER 1


Introduction


On 3-5 May 2017, an international workshop
Re-inventing Public Service Delivery took
place in Singapore and Johor Bahru, Malaysia
focusing on delivering services through OSS.

Attendees from 29 countries and three continents shared a wide range of
perspectives, both conceptual and technical. The workshop focused on citizen-
centric OSS, presenting examples from a wide range of contexts, including Albania,
Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Moldova, and Vietnam, to illustrate
the diverse experiences and models. The UNDP Global Centre for Public Service
Excellence in Singapore, World Bank Group Global Knowledge and Research Hub in
Malaysia, and the Regional Hub of Civil Service in Astana, Kazakhstan co-organized
the workshop.

Why is There a
Global Interest in
One-Stop Shops?
The public sector in any country fulfils multiple
roles. It acts as a ‘policy maker’, ‘regulator,’ and
‘provider’ of public services.
Greater citizen expectations regarding service provision and tightening fiscal
space are prompting the public sector to explore new sustainable models for service
delivery. An OSS can significantly improve the customer experience through enhanced
service levels at the same or reduced cost to government. In its latest report dedicated
to this topic,2 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) defines key elements in the design and
delivery of a customer-centric model, including speed, engagement, responsiveness,
value, and integration. In the literature, the term “One Stop Shop” is used broadly
to denote many types of OSS, including: one-door or single-window services,
community service centers, citizen service centers, information centers, service kiosks,
e-government web-portals, and others.

OSS are a global phenomenon. A global scoping study undertaken by the World Bank supported by
the Nordic Trust Fund identified 82 countries that offer OSS for government-to-citizen (G2C) services (see
Figure 2).4 International organizations, networks, bilateral and multilateral donors, including the World Bank,
UNDP, and USAID, have been supporting governments around the world through development financing
and technical assistance to establish OSS as part of a broader public sector modernization agenda. This has
included support for the elaboration of national strategies, back-end change management, IT investments,
and construction works.

Countries introduce OSS for a variety of reasons. Citizens have higher expectations of service levels
and service experience, as they increasingly demand the same levels of service delivery as experienced
in the private sector. Furthermore, OSS can be beneficial especially to groups of citizens who reside in
remote places, who are disabled or otherwise vulnerable. Finally, OSS can represent a visible commitment
of government to improve service delivery, increase accountability, and reduce petty corruption.

Countries around the world have adopted different models of OSS. In Eurasia, governments opted for
fundamental administrative reform and back-end integration. This involved digitizing registries, introducing
mandatory interoperability requirements to enable data exchange across agencies, and offering services
through third party operators. In contrast, countries in the South and East Asia tend to prefer OSS that co-
locate service providers under one roof without back-office integration. This model of OSS is often built as
part of popular attractions, such as shopping malls or community hubs.

Although the empirical evidence on the impact of OSS is limited, the most successful OSS initiatives
begin to show measurable effects on the quality of service delivery. This includes such measures
as citizens’ satisfaction, lower corruption, and greater efficiency of service delivery. For example, after
introducing Albania’s OSS named ADISA, citizen satisfaction with government services improved from 25
percent to 87 percent in the first 6 months of operation. There are important caveats: these are still early
days of implementation and the figures come from ADISA, i.e. not an independent source. However, the
government is systematically collecting citizen feedback, which will eventually provide an unbiased measure
of impact. OSS can also reduce petty corruption. In the Indian state of Karnataka, citizens report 50 percent
less chance of being asked for a bribe in OSS than other government offices; other states report more
modest results.5 On balance, governments often see OSS as a quick win and a politically important reform.
Figure 3 lists some of the examples of such initiatives around the globe.

Harnessing innovation for better service delivery
The most significant developments in the design and functioning of OSS are linked to technological
advances. The availability and spread of new technologies are opening new channels for governments
to provide information and services to their citizens, expanding the possibilities for service access and
interactions. These include online solutions and digital platforms, facilitating data exchange between
government entities and citizens, and creation of national ID systems as unique identifiers that can be used
to catalog services, documents, and target citizens for specific services.

Azerbaijan is using technology for citizen engagement and outreach. ASAN Service employs a proactive
social media strategy. Various feedback mechanisms include video-chat, exit surveys, and complaint books
and hotlines. Staff meet every Monday to review complaints and understand why they happened, with an
easy escalation to higher management levels. They found there was not enough information among the
public on the services that do exist; consequently, the ASAN Radio was created, blending information about
services and reforms along with live chats and entertainment.

In Singapore, the rapid pace of technological advancement enabled new thinking. The Singaporean
public service is exploring ways to strengthen data analytics, introducing virtual reality, and new means of
communication, such as intelligent chatbots for gathering feedback. New opportunities for public sector
also include crowdsourcing of solutions (e.g. for the design of new bus routes), immediate feedback on
social media, and developing predictive algorithms that can enable contact with citizens before they need a
service, such as reminders that their passports are set to expire.

In Moldova, the efforts have focused on digital delivery. Investing in enabling technology such as MPass,
MPay, MCloud, or MConnect provides IT backbone of e-service delivery.

    the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.” The method focuses on three main elements of a product or solution:
    people, technology, and business. All of these aspects evolve around the customer. (https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2015/05/10/what-is-design-

Panel discussion: Leadership, strategy,
and institutional reform

Senior officials from Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan and Moldova
shared their views on the role of political leadership, long-term strategy
for improving service delivery, and the concurrent institutional reform. This
session revealed a unanimous consensus that high-level political commitment is
key for success of OSS, as well as that OSS cannot succeed in isolation. Rather,
they must be accompanied by legal and institutional reforms that support citizen-
centric service delivery. Given that the panel included leaders of the OSS reforms
in their countries, the discussion was wide-ranging and touched upon a number of
strategic issues.

For example, Kazakhstan’s experience exemplifies how high-level leadership
and institutional reform led to the evolution from a single-sector OSS to a
full-scale multi-sector operation with national coverage. The OSS in Kazakhstan
started in 2007 at the Ministry of Justice and then progressed to the establishment
of a State Corporation “Government for Citizens” that oversees Public Service
Centers (PSCs). Today, Kazakhstan has 349 PSCs and 70 mobile teams, as well as
2,183 post offices offering 548 services (75 percent of all services), with 22,000
employees (see Box 6 for further details). The development strategy of the state
corporation “Government for Citizens” until 2020 was endorsed by the President.
The legal framework to enable operationalization of OSS includes series of primary
and secondary legislation, including the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On
Public Services”; standards of public service provision through OSS; rules for
integration of the back office and front office, including organization of the PSC;
list of state services provided in OSS; procedure for application to OSS; delivery of
documents; procedure for issuing documents in PSCs; data exchange between the
PSCs and authorized bodies.

Azerbaijan’s ASAN Service has a long-term strategy to take the OSS
experience further. ASAN is working on creating several “applications”, including
the ASAN School (to train volunteers and deliver certificates) and ASAN Pay
(digital payment mechanism for services). Aside from the physical ASAN center,
a mobile ASAN – a specialized bus – offers targeted, cost efficient way to service
provision, covering over 1 million people so far. ASAN stresses the importance of
the transparency of the process of service provision as well as the transparency
of fees to be paid. Further, it uses feedback from citizens and staff to improve its
services and design of new centers.

                               DISCUSSION POINTS

                               What are the basic requirements before creating OSS? All panelists concurred
                               that a solid legal and regulatory framework is required to clarify timeframes and to
                               result in reducing petty corruption. Establishing public registries and databases is
                               an important prerequisite for creating integrated OSS.

                               How to attract service providers from the private sector? The panelists noted
                               that location of the OSS is usually in a popular and highly frequented location,
                               such as near shopping, transportation, and other municipal buildings. The high
                               footprint of citizens thanks to co-location makes it attractive to private sector
                               representatives. Another factor is the importance of having a recognized brand
                               name and image, and being “the place where people want to be.” This includes
                               attracting both citizens and high-talent employees. It also helps attract service
                               providers from the private sector.

                               How do you cover the last mile? It is difficult and costly to build ASAN centers
                               around the country, so Azerbaijan relies on mobile units to target both inclusion
                               and remote areas – offering door to door service for disabled, and mobile units for
                               remote areas. Bangladesh has set up the National Portal system a system where
                               there is one digital center within 2 km of most citizens.

                               How do you ensure the citizens’ voice is heard? In Bangladesh, a call center
                               service based on the information and services available in the national portal has
                               been introduced. Citizens can report, comment or complain to the call center on
                               any service or issue, which the call center forwards onto concerned office and the
                               concerned office registers its progress about the action taken. The electronic file
                               management system known as ‘Nothi’ allows officials at different tiers to monitor
                               the progress of service delivery including grievances. The service seekers also get
                               information through SMS and follow the progress of their submission through a
                               tracking number.

                               How do you set prices for services without discriminating against the poor
                               and vulnerable? This is an important challenge for all countries with OSS: ensuring
                               access to services while also considering financial sustainability. Each country
                               needs to decide on a model: subsidized services, partial cost recovery, or full cost
                               recovery, depending on the service and population segment.

                               How do you engage youth? Azerbaijan has taken a proactive approach to engaging
                               youth as part of the ASAN reform. They have developed the ASAN Academy where
                               students can participate in a two to four-month internship program working as an
                               ASAN Volunteer. Those completing the program are awarded a work certificate.
                               This leads to increased activity at the ASAN Service centers and growing support
                               for ASAN. It also provides an opportunity for volunteers to develop skills and be
                               introduced to public service. Further, the list of successful volunteers (currently
                               over 10,000) are now being requested by private companies interested in hiring
                               graduates.

Pecha-kucha presentations:9 Many faces of OSS
To learn from different models of citizen-centric OSS, the pecha-kucha session brought
together five presenters with stories of five countries across four regions. The examples
of these countries reflected a wide range of OSS scope, level of services, and success. Both
citizen OSS (Vietnam, Myanmar and Moldova) and business OSS (Canada and Malawi) were
included. With under seven minutes allocated for each story, the presentations were focused
and fostered much discussion and cross-pollination.

Despite the different models, there were several common threads across the presentations.
The key themes included the lessons of ambition versus realism, the importance of sequencing
and incentives, and the need to capitalize on a political window of opportunity. Each reflected
the importance of context in the design and operation of the OSS.

Key enablers across the examples were the importance of establishing the legal status
of the OSS and devolution of authority. These were present in Malawi and Moldova: without
administrative reform and legal status, the OSS could not provide end-to-end service, but only
information. Another was the visionary leaders who made it work, using their power to convene
the actors and stakeholders. One suggestion was to find high-level backing for the reform, such
as from the Office of the Prime Ministers.

Regarding the experiences of the OSS for businesses, a key lesson was the role of
competitive federalism: sub-national governments like to compete and outperform each
other. In Canada, the online OSS called BizPal spurred such competition at the province level.
Nationally, Canada was ranked 2nd on the Doing Business Index, and this provided incentives
and inspiration for other countries to adopt similar approaches. Similar competitive spirits are
seen in citizen OSS and e-service indices.

DISCUSSION POINTS

How much does it cost to be successful? The answer to this question hinges on the type of
OSS and the level of digitization and IT infrastructure. For example, the Canadian Bizpal did
not require hard infrastructure investments; as an online platform in a country with developed
IT infrastructure, it was able to succeed on the budget of USD 600,000 a year. The examples
presented showed that a frugal effort can still have positive impact. For example, Moldova’s
cost to establish each Joint Information Service Bureau (JISB) was very small, about USD
2,500, but did not have computers or special buildings. The JISBs were housed in the existing
buildings of District Councils. These buildings are the “go to” points for citizens, making them
most accessible for beneficiaries. Further, the operation of the JISBs are primarily funded by
the district, which promotes financial sustainability. Establishing Vietnam’s OSS required USD
50,000 per district, although cost recovery and financial sustainability is an issue. Myanmar,
Malawi and Moldova show that initial pilot OSS can be frugal and low-technology efforts, but
can provide significant value to beneficiaries seeking services and information.

     seconds each. This ensures that each story is told in under 7 minutes and creates room for interaction and discussion. For more on pecha-kucha style

                How to boost home-grown initiatives? Due to the proliferation of OSS around the globe,
                there are many examples to learn from. In many cases, countries mimic each other instead of
                developing their own model. Adopting such “best practice” rather than a “best fit” approach is
                risky, as sometimes a model that was successful in one country cannot be replicated in another
                context due to political, economic, technical or cultural factors. Developing their own model
                or using an adaptive approach to modifying an existing one allows governments to reflect the
                country context, use existing systems, and foster innovative solutions. Table 1 below provides a
                summary list of what to do and what to avoid for the countries developing their own OSS model.

                What are the risks of OSS? Table 1 points to what should be avoided, but does not dwell on
                the risks of the OSS reform. What can go wrong? First, the rigidity of civil service rules may not
                allow outsourcing the front office service outside civil service (e.g., Minas Gerais, Brazil), which
                may create problems with working extended hours, or offer limited incentives for being open
                to new organizational cultures. In Minas Gerais, only the second generation of OSS found a
                way to rely on private contractors to bypass the rigidity of the civil service rules.10 Second, the
                diagnosis of the problem must drive the type of the OSS model. If the bulk of the processing
                delays is in the inefficient back-end processes, then the OSS model that foregoes the back-
                office integration will only deliver limited results. Finally the resistance from vested interests
                should not be under-estimated. This is especially the case when the OSS are introduced to fight
                petty corruption and disturb a steady stream of rents for service providers. Finding a way to
                neutralize those vested interests and similar political economy considerations are often the key
                to success of OSS initiatives.

        Malaysia has launched their Urban Transformation Centres (UTCs) throughout the
        country with the support of the Prime Minister. At present, 18 physical centers are operating,
        of which ten UTCs are at state level and eight at town level. UTCs house up to 50 different
        agencies. To broaden access, working hours are from 8.30am to 10pm every day, including
        weekends. This is possible thanks to two to three shifts for employees.

        The UTCs utilize existing buildings that have been empty or underutilized; they are all
        refurbished. These include former bus terminals, shopping malls, and business arcades. In
        Malaysia, federal and state governments collaborate in establishing UTCs, while the services in
        UTCs are provided by both federal and state governments.

        Citizens engagement is used to identify appropriate locations as well as what services
        are to be offered at a particular UTC.

        In addition, Mobile Community Transformation Centres (Mobile CTCs) provide key
        services from various government agencies at different times and locations through
        the deployment of buses and other mobile assets in rural or remote areas nationwide.
        Additional components under the Mobile CTC program include opportunities for local
        businesses to promote their products, community activities within the vicinity of a Mobile
        CTC, awareness campaigns of government policies and programs, and as a government aid

                         Rising to the Challenge:
                       Developing a Service Culture
       Empirical evidence shows several key challenges that OSS in different countries confront,
       including understaffing, lack of mentoring, coaching, or low IT awareness. Below are some
       measures that emerged during the peer-to-peer exchanges during the workshop and may
       inform future policy making when rolling out an OSS.

            •	 Shortage of staff can be supplemented by the deployment of staff to sub-national levels,
               rotation of staff, using a multiple shift system (Malaysia) and volunteers (Azerbaijan).

            •	 Service culture: instill in OSS staff that their role is to serve the citizens who claim their
               entitlements.

            •	 Retention of capacity within OSS is crucial so that people’s mindsets are changed; hence
               it is important to institute an incentive scheme to work and remain at OSS.

            •	 Incentives to work in the OSS: to be supported by bonuses, prestige, attractive buildings,
               cost sharing arrangements, whereby part of the service fee is awarded to employees
               based on performance.

            •	 Behavioral aspects can be addressed through training. In Azerbaijan, staff development
               includes soft skills trainings for all ASAN employees: stress management, time
               management, psychology, understanding the customer.

            •	 Communication outreach: explaining how government will empathize with citizens’
               needs; “government cares” is part of a larger political agenda.

            •	 Awareness-raising through mass media, social media, NGOs can help change citizens’
               perception of the state and service provision, but needs to be tied to the concrete
               successes of OSS.

         Kazakhstan’s experience with OSS
        Kazakhstan offers more than 700 services online, 548 services through OSS under the
        state corporation “Government to Citizens,” and more than 80 services through mobile
        government applications. “Government for Citizens” was set up to become the sole agency
        to administer all public services under one roof, or Public Service Centers (PSCs), based on the
        models of the Canada Service and Australia’s Centrelink.

        Today, Kazakhstan has 349 PSCs and 70 mobile teams, as well as 2,183 post offices
        offering 548 services (75 percent of all services), with 22,000 employees. To date, they
        have completed 37 million services. Kazakhstan has specialized PSCs for driving and vehicle
        registration. In addition to PCSs, there are additional access channels, including call centers
        and an e-government online portal. Citizen feedback is collected through electronic monitors
        and SMS-based feedback mechanisms. Surveillance cameras are also utilized for monitoring at
        PSCs. This allows the government to monitor who are the visitors, their ID numbers, see type of
        government services they utilize, and how many services one employee rendered

        The development strategy of “Government for Citizens” was endorsed by the President
        until 2020. The next stage is to launch a single application policy, which allows citizens to
        file one application for services that cover a number of agencies. Once this is in place, the
        State Corporation aims to adopt an anticipatory approach by introducing a “life-cycle”, so that
        people will receive public services according to their social and personal needs. Citizen needs
        will be determined by analyzing a number of factors, including their age, occupation, and social
        demographic.

        Importantly, Kazakhstan has an integrated back-office for service provision, with 47
        interoperable information systems and registries “talking to each other” and exchanging
        data. IT integration strengthens horizontal and vertical co-ordination and enables streamlining
        of service provision, cutting red tape and continuous automation of the business processes.

                       OSS success factors
                       Workshop discussions distilled the following factors that contributed to the
                       successful rollout and positive outcomes of OSS around the world:

                       üü Defining the underlying policy problem that OSS are expected to solve. Does the
                            underlying problem require making service provision more effective and efficient, or
                            is it more about bringing government services closer to remote areas? In Georgia,
                            Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, OSS focused on efficiency in service provision, which
                            defined a particular type of OSS and sequence of reforms. On the other hand, in
                            Bangladesh, getting information about services out to the rural areas was the main
                            driver for the OSS. The government used participatory action research to understand
                            what citizens needed. This also led to a particular model of OSS that differed radically
                            from the Eurasian models.

                       üü Visionary leadership. Introducing institutions that underpin effective governance
                            often puts politicians at odds with stakeholders that benefit from the status quo.
                            As a reformer, it is the leader’s responsibility to take unpopular decisions, bridge
                            the gap between players, engaging stakeholders in the process of the reform. In
                            Cambodia, leadership was key as the Minister of Interior guided the development of
                            OSS operations. In Algeria, leadership was needed for coordination, data integration,
                            and harmonization of information. In Myanmar, the establishment of OSS was an
                            important political objective, but establishing shared incentives and shared vision at
                            all levels proved challenging. It is also important to overcome resistance to reform at
                            various levels and get incentives right.

                       üü Link to an underlying public administration reform program or strategy.
                            An overarching strategy should guide larger objectives, such as better business
                            environment or greater government effectiveness that OSS will contribute to. Moldova
                            launched a cross-cutting PAR strategy in 2016, which underpins a number of reforms,
                            including OSS. Common reform goals include: reduced time and administrative
                            burden for citizens and businesses; improved service access and delivery quality;
                            increased number of satisfied citizens from government services; and reduced
                            corruption, increased efficiency, transparency and accountability in service delivery.
                            Performance management reforms can also utilize the data from OSS to improve the
                            accountability of service providers. For example, OSS KPIs can be used to determine
                            staff bonuses (e.g., ASAN Service, Azerbaijan).

                       üü High-level coordination at the center of government was critical in Azerbaijan,
                            Algeria, and Cape Verde. In Azerbaijan, ASAN Service used a centralized approach
                            where a presidential decree was an enabler. ASAN reports to the presidential
                            administration, which facilitates coordination with MDAs. In Cape Verde, the Prime
                            Minister coordinated the OSS reform, while regulations and administrative rules
                            supported ongoing coordination at the technical levels.

Chapter 4: Key Conclusions




üü Reform sequencing. Administrative reforms that support streamlining service
     delivery should precede introducing OSS. This includes establishing the legislative
     framework, defining discretionary authority in offering public service, levels of
     decision making, BPR, and HR reforms enabling incentives. On the IT side, inter-
     operability of databases is one of the key pre-conditions. Political will to share data
     by ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) is as important as the cost.

üü Accessibility. OSS must be located at convenient places to ensure high footprint. A
     good example is the model adopted in Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Singapore) where
     OSS are part of shopping malls, community centers or hubs, or are deliberately
     located in central areas (e.g., former Pudu bus terminal in Kuala Lumpur).

üü Branding can be a critical success factor for OSS. In Azerbaijan, ASAN Service is a
     brand name with a social trust. ASAN’s brand is key for retention of staff and private
     sector participation: people want to be a part of it. This is similar for the Albanian
     ADISA brand. Strategic communication of the reform is part and parcel of branding.




OSS design considerations
What can be learned about OSS design from successful OSS experiences? Workshop
discussions revealed that successful OSS models usually involved commissioning a full-
scale feasibility study, resulting in a detailed roadmap and a phased approach. The OSS
feasibility study helped define objectives, demand, budgeting, financing model, and a
prioritized list of services to be included in the OSS. Feasibility study usually entailed the
terms of reference for BPR, as well as a realistic assessment of the need for policy and
legal framework re-adjustment and administrative simplification.

The rollout of OSS was successful when the implementation details were well-
thought out at the outset. This includes clarity on the available IT systems integration,
among various levels of government as well as horizontally across agencies. Key
considerations include: the presence of broadband connectivity to enable data exchange
across agencies; interoperability (i.e., ability to use the databases across different MDA
services); adaptive technical design; and ability to work in both offline and online modes.

Crucially, figuring out the financial sustainability of the OSS model is critical
before embarking on the reform. There are various operating models to choose from:
free access to services; subsidized services; or service fees for partial or full cost recovery.
Here, the upfront costs of the physical infrastructure (computer, buildings), software, and
institutional features should be considered.

                       The deliberations of the workshop produced a checklist for policy makers designing
                       reforms of service provision through OSS. The following steps are vital for the success
                       of OSS:

                           üü Develop a strategy to ensure a whole-of-government approach
                           üü Assess the need for the institutional and administrative reform
                           üü Define the required changes in the legislative and regulatory framework
                           üü Determine the modality of service provision: will the OSS simply collocate the
                              service providers or fully integrate service provision in a single window?
                           üü Choose a financing model: free access, subsidized services, or cost recovery
                           üü Determine the extent of the back-end integration and required data exchange
                           üü Decide on the citizen interface features: new building versus using existing space,
                              integration with community and lifestyle, training of front office staff, customer
                              service standards
                           üü Define the monitoring and evaluation framework, including KPIs: what does success
                              mean? How will user feedback be collected?




                       Looking to the future: New trends in OSS
                       The examples shared by Malaysia and Singapore showed the evolution of OSS as
                       community centers or hubs. This involves integrating the public sector into the lives of
                       citizens in new ways in partnership with NGOs and the private sector. (See Box 3 and 4 on
                       the Tampines Hub in Singapore and UTCs in Malaysia, respectively).

                       The future will bring opportunities for strategic shifts in public service delivery.
                       This includes automating routine transactions, predicting service needs, and focusing
                       more on the citizen as a person: providing personal relationship management for more
                       complex services.

Re-inventing Service Delivery Through One-Stop Shops                                                                 33
Chapter 4: Key Conclusions




Some of the new trends in the evolving OSS include:

üü Seamless customer-centric services: breaking down intra-agency silos and instead-
     acting as one. In Singapore, the “No Wrong Door” policy and First Responder
     Protocol was introduced to deal with misdirected feedback or cross-agency issues
     from the public effectively. Life cycle in service provision takes it to a new level,
     introducing understanding of the key needs of citizens at different stages of their
     lives, and applying a customer-centric point of view to guide the design of services.

üü Co-design and co-delivery of public services: getting key stakeholders (e.g.
     customers, partners) to actively participate in development and design of public
     services. Collected evidence shows use of co-design and co-delivery to create a
     health system driven by the people within it, e.g. care planning, pathway planning
     and wellbeing planning enable patients to identify their own goals and aspirations,
     and to navigate the services that will help to achieve them.11

üü Personalized services for complex issues: building flexibility into processes so that
     differing customer circumstances and needs can be catered to, rather than adopting
     an inflexible rules-based approach.

üü Predictive and anticipatory services: delivering services to customers at the
     point of need and using the right mix of delivery channels. This includes considering
     small changes to evoke change in citizen behavior.12 In Singapore, the government
     changed the formulation of the letters addressed to soon-to-be retirees about
     their appointments. The letters now include more personalized information and the
     wording was changed from “Please contact us” to “Please confirm your meeting.” As
     a result, the citizens’ attendance of these appointments increased from 15 percent
     to 31 percent.
