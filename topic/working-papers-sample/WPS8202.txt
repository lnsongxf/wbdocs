Unequal Laws and the Disempowerment of Women in the Labor
Market: Evidence from Firm-Level Data



1. Introduction

Institutions are defined as the set of rules that govern interactions in society (North, 1990).

However, these rules can be discriminatory against certain segments of the population, such as

women. When gender discrimination is embodied into the legal system, it can play a substantial

role in the exclusion of women from the labor market. A system of laws that discriminate against

women has the capacity to affect their lives in a multitude of dimensions. Allocation of time is

distorted towards certain tasks as opposed to others. This reverberates all through education

decisions, fertility choices and career options. The awareness of a system that distorts labor market

outcomes can also discourage women from engaging in economic activity, leading to a waste of

talent in the economy. Furthermore, as these laws persists, the effects can echo through

generations.



The effects of legal gender discrimination can be detrimental not only for women but for society

as a whole. There is much consensus in economics on the costs of gender inequality to society.

The exclusion of women from economic activity and the resulting gender gaps in labor force

participation, education and entrepreneurship lead to low human capital, low productivity, and low

economic growth (Abu-Ghaida and Klasen, 2004; Bandara, 2015; Baliamoune-Lutz and

McGillivray, 2015; Dollar and Gatti, 1999; Gaddis and Klasen, 2014; Goldin, 1995; Klasen, 2002;

Klasen and Lammana, 2009; Knowles et al., 2002; Lagerlof, 2003; World Bank, 2011). Through

simulations it has been shown that many countries can gain at least a 15% increase in GDP if

gender gaps were removed (Cuberes and Teignier, 2014).

                                                 2
The goal of this study is to establish the link between laws that discriminate against women and

women’s participation in the formal labor market, as well as their ability to achieve top managerial

positions and become owners of firms. This study adopts a holistic approach. Our concern is not

one or two laws, but a system of laws that entangle different aspects of the lives of women. We

also do not want to restrict the analysis to simple labor market engagement, but expand it to include

empowering outcomes such as top managerial positions. For this study, we use two prominent

World Bank data sets, the Women, Business and the Law database and the Enterprise Surveys.

The Women, Business and the Law database explores the laws that serve as impediments for

women in the economic sphere. The overall number of discriminatory laws by gender has been

quantified as a measure of legal gender disparities (Iqbal et al., 2016). We use this indicator and

combine it with rich firm level data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys spanning over 60,000

firms across 104 economies. Information regarding employment, ownership, and managerial

positions by gender are available by firm.



We find that legal gender disparities do hinder women’s engagement in the economic sector, both

as workers and as top managers or business owners. We also attempt to uncover pathways that

explain the relationship between legal gender disparities and the likelihood of women to be

business owners and managers, and some suggestive evidence points to discrimination in access

to finance and corruption. Women managers and business owners are less engaged with the

financial sector - more dependent on internal funds and less likely to have an overdraft facility - in

economies that have a higher number of legal gender disparities. Women business owners and

managers are also more likely to face bribe requests when obtaining an operating license in

economies where a greater number of laws discriminate against women. One possibility is that if

the legal system does not provide recourse for women, other actors may take advantage of it and
                                                  3
extract more rents from them especially when they apply for operating licenses. This is consistent

with findings in the literature that women entrepreneurs are susceptible to harsher business

environment in terms of access to finance and even interference and harassment by government

officials (Ellis et al., 2006; Muravyev et al., 2009).



This is not the first study to explore the relationship between legal gender discrimination and

gender outcomes. However, most of the existing studies focus on a particular country or a few

countries and on specific laws. For example, studies look at the impact on gender outcomes of the

Equal Employment Opportunities Act (Eberts and Stone 1985) and the Equal Pay Act in the United

States (Neumark and Stock 2001), childcare services in Canada (Powell 1988) and in 20 OECD

countries (Bassanini and Duval, 2006), as well as the impact of parental leave laws (Ruhm 1998;

Baum, 2003; Berger and Waldfogel, 2004). Also see Leonard (1985) and Weichselbaumer and

Winter-Ebmer (2007) and Morrison et al. (2007). Few studies have taken a global approach. A

majority of the global studies utilize country-level analysis, focus on specific laws, or explore

outcomes other than the labor market. Austen and Mavisakalyn (2016) find that constitutional

protections increase the proportion of women in parliament – a measure of women’s empowerment

– in more than 106 economies. Similarly, Gonzales et al (2015) utilize country-level analysis to

show the effect of various laws on female labor force participation. Branisa et al., (2013) use

country-level data to explore the effects of social institutional gender inequality on education, child

mortality, fertility, and governance using the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI), an

aggregate measure that does not capture laws alone, but mixes in several variables that reflect

income and social institutions.



Fewer studies are global in nature and utilize micro-level data. Sekkat et al (2015) use firm-level

data to show that the presence of women in the ownership in the firm increases the likelihood of
                                                   4
the top manager to be a woman as well. More closely related to this study, Amin et al. (2015) use

firm-level data across 58 economies and find that the presence of non-discrimination clauses in

hiring increases women’s employment. Amin et al. (2016b) also uses firm-level data to uncover

the effects of mandated paternity leave on women’s employment. This study builds on this strand

of research by combining micro firm-level data across countries to explore the link between overall

gender discrimination in laws and goes beyond women’s employment by exploring indicators of

women’s empowerment - women’s presence in top managerial positions and ownership of firms.

The use of micro firm-level data allows the analysis to account for firm-level heterogeneities given

that several firm-level characteristics such as sector, size, access to finance and so forth can

influence the nature of employment, firm ownership, and firm management. Furthermore, the use

of firm-level data alleviates simultaneity bias as it is unlikely that an individual firm can affect

overall country-level institutions (Paunov, 2016).



In summary, this study makes the following contributions to the literature. First it utilizes an

aggregate measure of legal gender discrimination and links it with a set of labor market outcomes

for women, including employment, managerial positions, and firm ownership. Second, the study

conducts a global analysis of 104 economies using rich micro-level firm data that follow the same

methodology and use the same survey instrument across all countries to allow for comparisons

across economies. Firm-level data allow the analysis to account for several firm-level

heterogeneities, including firm sector and size. Finally, the study also attempts to uncover the

pathways by which systematic legal gender discrimination that permeates through several laws

can disempower women in the labor market.



The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the conceptual underpinnings of the analysis,

section 3 provides the data and empirical strategy, section 4 presents the results. Robustness checks
                                                 5
are presented in section 5, while section 6 explores the pathways or mechanisms. Section 7

concludes.




2. Conceptual Framework

The theoretical basis of the relationship between discriminatory legal institutions and gender

outcomes has to do with the allocation of time. Choices of time allocation are rooted in models of

intra-household decision making processes (Sen 1990, McElroy 1990). Initially much of the

literature assumed that households were unitary, that is they maximized a joint utility function,

obviating any conflict between members of the household (Becker 1981). The argument for these

models was that the bargaining occurred during the mate selection phase, and thus once a

household was formed, members had similar preferences. However, several models departed from

this assumption and allowed for differences in preferences over resource allocation among

household members. These models were classified as bargaining models and their allowance for

conflicts within the household gained empirical support as little evidence was found for unitary

household models (see for example, Thomas, 1997).



Under bargaining models, husband and wife have different utility functions that depend on the

consumption of private goods. Both husband and wife bargain over resource allocation to

maximize their respective utility functions. The bargaining outcome depends on the husband’s and

wife’s individual threat points. The threat point is the utility obtained if bargaining breaks down

permanently. The higher is the utility of a member of the household if bargaining breaks down,

the greater is the influence of the member on the bargaining outcome. Threat points are influenced

by a number of factors called “extra household environmental parameters” (McElroy, 1990).

Discriminatory laws affect such parameters thereby altering the bargaining outcomes in the

                                                6
household (Branisa et al., 2013). Thus, the higher the number of legal gender disparities in an

economy, the lower the threat point of women, and thus the lower the bargaining outcomes, which

may include a reallocation of time away from labor market activities. Thus, the engagement of

women in the labor market would be limited.



With regards to women attaining top managerial positions, a number of factors come into play as

elucidated by the career management literature. As one enters into a career, several decisions have

to be made along the way. These series of decisions are typically based on a comparison of costs

and benefits each step of the way (Keane and Wolpin 1997). Such calculations may be gender-

specific, thereby distorting incentives between men and women. Most research on the determinants

of women managers are based on such a comparison of costs and benefits as the career progresses

(Mincer, 1962; Becker, 1965; Jaumotte, 2003; Morrison, et al., 2007). The existence of gender-

specific discriminatory laws can alter this calculation substantially. Laws that discourage or

hamper the ability of women to work would increase the opportunity costs for women, potentially

discouraging them from attempts to attain managerial or ownership positions in a firm.



Apart from legal gender disparities, there are several other factors that have been identified to be

related to women’s labor force participation. Global integration, proxied by exports and foreign

ownership of firms, and aggregate demand (proxied by GDP per capital growth) have been found

to affect female employment (Elson, 1996; Seguino, 2000). Better educated women have been

found to increase the likelihood of female top managers (Amin and Islam, 2016). Some business

sectors are friendlier towards women while others are less so (Islam and Amin 2014; Juhn et al.,

2014). Infrastructure improvements have also been found to be positively correlated with women’s

participation in the labor market given it reallocates their time away from household activities to

the labor market (Wamboye and Seguino, 2015). Finally, culture has been found to be correlated
                                                 7
with women’s participation in the labor market (Fernandez et al. 2004; Fernandez, 2007; Farre’

and Vella, 2013; Fernandez and Fogli, 2009).



Regarding firm specific characteristics, age of the firm and access to finance may matter. Older

firms may be resistant to change and thus reluctant to hire women workers or top women managers

(Blum et al., 1994). In some firms, informal networks tend to be dominated by males, and thus the

presence of formal training may be crucial for women to move up the career ladder (Rowley 2013).

Crime has also been found to be correlated with women’s employment in management positions

(Islam, 2013). In our empirical estimations, we try our best to account for all of these factors given

the constraints of data limitations.



3. Data and Empirical Strategy

Our main data sources are the World Bank Group’s Enterprise Surveys (ES) and the World Bank

Group’s Women, Business and Law (WBL) databases. The ES offer an expansive array of cross-

country comparable firm-level data on firm’s experience of the business environment and on firm’s

performance and characteristics, including gender composition of the workforce, gender

composition of the ownership, and gender of the top manager. The sample of ES firms used in the

paper consists over 60,000 firms across 104 mostly developing countries. ES were conducted in

various countries between 2006 and 2016 using a common questionnaire and sampling

methodology (stratified random sample), and are representative of the non-agricultural and non-

mining formal (registered) private sector of the economies1. The WBL database measures legal

institutions that discriminate on the basis of gender across the world. WBL data are collected

through several rounds of interactions with practitioners with expertise in the different areas

 More information about the ES methodology and country coverage is available on the Enterprise Surveys website
http://www.enterprisesurveys.org. Note that each firm has only one observation in the sample.
                                                      8
covered by the database. Inputs collected from practitioners are verified against codified sources

of national law and, then, coded by the WBL team.




Exploiting firm-level heterogeneity in female employment data and country-level law data, we

estimate the following equation for firm i in country j and sector r:



               =	               +             +           +          +             +
               +	                   +                +               +                 +	
               +                     +                   ++           +	           +
               +            +        		(1)


We use five measures for women’s participation in the labor market (                   ) obtained from

the Enterprise Surveys. These include: whether the firm has a female top manager, whether the

firm has a female owner, whether the majority of the firm’s owners are female, percentage of

female employees over total employees, and the log of the absolute total number of female

employees. The employee measures capture general female participation while the female

management and ownership variables capture empowerment. The measure of whether or not there

is at least one woman present in the ownership structure of the firm may seem redundant given

that we have a measure of whether the majority of the owners are female, however the latter was

recently included in the Enterprise Surveys and thus the former has a larger number of observations

(almost 20,000 more firms). Summary statistics are presented in table 1 while variable descriptions

can be found in table A1.




Our main explanatory variable (              ) is the Legal Gender Disparities measure based on the WBL

database and constructed by Iqbal et al., (2016). The Legal Gender Disparities is constructed as

follows. Fifty-one gender disparities in laws are considered. If a law treats men and women
                                                      9
differently (a legal gender disparity) then a score is assigned. If the disparity applies to only

married women, a score of 1 is assigned. If it applies to both married and unmarried women, a

score of 2 is assigned. If the law treats both men and women the same, then a score of 0 is assigned.

The summation over all the scores provides the Legal Gender Disparities score. Table A2 provides

a listing of the legal gender disparities and the corresponding score assignment.2 There is

substantial variation of the Legal Gender Disparities measure in our sample. The mean value is 18,

with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 41. The Republic of Yemen has the highest number of

legal gender disparities and the Slovak Republic has the lowest in our sample.




Since the dependent variables vary at the firm level and the Legal Gender Disparity measure varies

at the country level, a reverse causality problem is unlikely, although it cannot be ruled out

completely (Paunov, 2016). Our main concern remains to be one of omitted variable bias. To

account for omitted variable bias problem, we employ a large number of control variables as shown

in equation (1). A formal definition of the control variables used along with the data source is

provided in Table A1. Education (                 ) is measured at the country-level and is the female-to-male

ratio of the mean number of years of education. Several firm-level characteristics are accounted

for including firm size (             ), firm age (         ), whether the firm is part of a larger firm (      ),

whether the firm offers formal training (                   ), experience of the top manager (         ), exporter

status (             ), foreign ownership (                 ), access to finance (         ), and crime (       ).

Two variables are used to capture access to finance – whether the firm has a checking or savings

account and whether the firm has a line of credit or loan. Demographic effects that may influence

the supply of women’s labor are captured by the percentage of women in total adult population

(             ). Following Wamboye and Seguino (2015), we control for the current state of labor

    Further details can be found in Iqbal et al., (2016).
                                                             10
markets by capturing aggregate demand through the growth rate of GDP per capita (                      ).

Finally, we also account for the level of development (              ). We also worry about industry-

specific factors, global economic shocks, and region (continent) specific factors. We account for

these using sector fixed effects at the 2-digit ISIC level, year fixed effects, and region fixed effects.

Summary statistics can be found in table 1, with data descriptions and sources provided in table

A1.




4. Base Regression Results

Table 2 presents the main results. The estimated coefficient value of the legal gender disparity

score is negative and statistically significant at the 1 percent level across all 5 labor market outcome

measures for women. A unit increase in the legal gender disparity score is associated with a 0.3

percent decrease in the likelihood of a female top manager, 0.5 percent decrease in the likelihood

of the presence of a female owner, and a 0.4 percent decrease in the likelihood that the majority of

the owners for the firm are women. Alternatively, if a country such as the Republic of Yemen,

which performs the poorest on legal gender disparities (has most disparities), were to emulate the

Slovak Republic, which is the best performer, the associated increase in the likelihood of a firm

having a female top manager would be 13.12 percentage points, the increase in the likelihood of a

firm having a female owner would be 18.8 percentage points, and the increase in the likelihood of

a firm having women majority owners would be 15.7 percentage points. These are considerable

results given that only 17.3% of the firms in the sample have a female top manager, 34% of the

firms have at least one female owner, and only 12% of the firms are majority female-owned.

Similarly, a unit increase in the legal gender disparities score is associated with lower levels of

female employment, relative to total employment and in absolute terms. The former is lower by



                                                   11
0.4 percentage point or about 1.2 percent of its mean value while the latter is lower by 1.6 percent

of its mean value.



Several of the covariates have coefficients with the expected signs and significance. Female-to-

male education has a positive effect on the labor market outcomes for women across all five

measures, statistically significant at the 1% level and at the 5% level in one case. This is consistent

with findings in the literature (Amin and Islam, 2016). Similarly, the proportion of women in total

population has a positive and statistically significant effect at the 1% level for all five measures of

labor market outcomes for women. By and large formal training has a positive effect on women’s

labor market outcomes. In a majority of specifications in table 2, age of the firm is positively

correlated with the presence of female managers and owners. Size of the firm is negatively

correlated with all five labor market outcomes for women. Exporter status is positively correlated

and the coefficient is statistically significant only for female ownership. The link between female

ownership and the access to finance variables is positive with the coefficients statistically

significant at least at the 5% level.



These initial findings indicate that laws that discriminate against women not only negatively affect

women’s employment, they also reduce the presence of women in empowering positions –

management and ownership of firms. The consistency of the effects across a wide spectrum of

labor market outcomes for women indicates these are powerful results, and legal gender disparities

have a multifaceted effect on women’s lives. In the next section, we check the robustness of our

findings to a number changes in the specifications and sample alterations.




5. Robustness

                                                  12
We test if our findings are robust to the inclusion of additional variables. A large number of

covariates can create a number of problems, including multicollinearity and reduce sample size

due to missing data. Thus, as a robustness check we consider adding sets of variables that have

been highlighted in the literature as important correlates of labor market outcomes.



In table 3, we include four variables in the specification - agriculture value added (% of GDP),

manufacturing value added (% of GDP), improved sanitation facilities (% of population with

access), and total fertility rate (births per woman). The burden of care provision on women can

influence their labor supply and we account for this using the proportion of population that has

access to sanitation. Structural factors affecting job availability for women vs. men are proxied

by the share of agriculture and manufacturing in total value added. Furthermore, fertility rates

could alter the time allocation of women away from formal labor markets. As indicated in table 3,

the sign and significance of the coefficient of the legal gender disparities score are largely retained

as in the base specifications in table 2 after inclusion of these additional variables. The only

difference is that the coefficient for legal gender disparities is statistically significant at the 5%

level instead of the 1% level. In table 4, we conduct a similar exercise by including variables that

capture the percentage of adherents to various religions as a way to account for culture. The sign

and significance of the coefficient for legal gender disparities is largely similar to the base

specification in table 2 across all women labor market outcome variables, with the one small

difference being a drop in the statistical significance of the coefficient for legal gender disparities

form the 1% level to the 5% level for female ownership.



One issue with our results is that we may not be capturing the degree of control women exert on a

firm. For instance, the gender of the top manager may not adequately reflect the gender

composition of the whole management team (top manager plus lower level managers). Similarly,
                                                  13
data for the percentage of female ownership in firms are only available for a subset of the sample.

Thus, for many firms we are unable to make statements on the extent of women’s ownership of a

firm (percentage of firm owned by women) that is affected by unequal laws. We partially address

these issues by limiting our sample to sole proprietorship firms. Typically, these firms are small

and run a by single (top) manager with no or a limited number of lower level managers. Ownership

structure is clear and simple with either a woman or a man owning 100% of the firm. Thus, we

can expect that sole proprietorships with women owners or managers are more likely to face the

burden of gender-related unequal laws. On the other hand, due to their small size, sole

proprietorship firms may be able to slip under the radar and avoid being subjected to gender-related

laws.



In table 5, we present the findings when we restrict the sample to sole proprietorships alone. We

find that just as in base estimations in table 2, the sign and significance of the coefficient for the

legal gender disparities score are retained, with a slight increase in magnitudes of the coefficient

of legal gender disparities for some of the outcome variables when compared to the base

specification.3



Finally, following Sekkat et al. (2015), we investigate if we can uncover a significant relationship

between female owners and managers, and if this relationship has any effect on the coefficient of

the legal gender disparities score. Therefore, in table 6, we consider the specification in table 2 for

female managers as the dependent variable but also controlling for the presence of a female owner

(column 1, table 6) and whether or not the majority of the firm is female-owned (column 2, table




3
 We repeated the same exercise for the sample of firms with legal status other than sole proprietorship. The
negative and statistically significant coefficient for the legal gender disparities score is retained. These results are
available from the authors upon request.
                                                          14
6).   We do find a positive and highly statistically significant relationship between female

ownership and management, confirming the findings of Sekkat et al. (2015). Regardless, the

coefficients for the legal gender disparities score are unaffected – a negative coefficient is retained

with a statistical significance of 5 percent or higher.




6. Pathways

Thus far the study has uncovered a robust relationship between legal gender disparities and a wide

range of labor market outcomes for women. This leads to the question of what channels might

convey these effects. While we cannot account for all possible pathways given data limitations,

we at least find suggestive evidence of two potential pathways between female management and

ownership and legal gender disparities. To uncover the pathways, we limit our sample to only

firms that are both owned and managed by women. We then include an array of indicators as the

dependent variable and check whether they are correlated with the legal gender disparity score.



Table 7 contains the findings. It shows that a higher legal gender disparities score is associated

with poorer access to finance, and higher corruption faced by women-owned and managed

businesses. More specifically, the greater the legal gender disparity score, the greater the likelihood

that women-owned and managed firms resort to internal sources of funding than external sources

of funding; the lower the likelihood of the firms having an overdraft facility. Furthermore, the

chances of women-owned and managed firms expected to give gifts or make informal payments

to obtain an operating license are much higher in economies with higher legal gender disparities.



Thus, women-owned and managed firms face greater difficulty in obtaining finance and face

higher corruption with increases in legal gender disparities. The finding is consistent with other

                                                  15
studies in the related literature, which that find that women entrepreneurs experience harsher

business environment in terms of access to finance and interference and harassment by government

officials (Ellis, et al., 2006; Muravyev et al., 2009).



    7. Conclusion

By exploiting two unique data sets, this study has uncovered a consistent and systematic negative

relationship between gender-specific discriminatory laws, termed as legal gender disparities, and

a wide range of labor market outcomes for women. More importantly, some of these outcomes,

such as top managerial positions and firm ownership, are good proxies for women’s empowerment.

The findings are robust to a number of specifications and sample alterations. The study also

identified two potential pathways by which legal gender disparities discourage the participation of

women in economic spheres. Legal gender disparities end up restricting the access to finance and

increase bribery requests faced by women-owned and managed firms. A number of policy

implications can be garnered from these findings, with some caution required as further

investigation may be merited. First and foremost, policy makers can abolish discriminatory laws

to reduce the economic losses created by restrictions placed on women. Second, the policy makers

can address the pathways by which discriminatory laws affect women. Increasing financial

inclusion, and encouraging good governance are two important policy recommendations.



While this study adopted a holistic approach to capture the relationship between discriminatory

laws and labor market outcomes for women, a huge research agenda is needed to uncover the

effects of specific laws and the pathways by which they encumber women. The literature has

overwhelmingly explored certain laws while ignoring others. We hope this study will ignite further

research in the more overlooked laws.
