A.	 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

    Growth remained strong at 6.9 percent in 2016, after 7.0 percent in 2015. Cambodia’s
    economic activity continues to expand at a robust pace. Construction remained one
    of the main drivers of growth. Garment exports eased slightly as the country’s external
    competitiveness was eroded by US dollar appreciation, rising labor costs and increasing
    competition from other regional low-wage countries. Better weather conditions last
    year resulted in increased agricultural production, although agricultural commodity
    prices remain depressed. Real growth is projected to remain strong, expanding at 6.9
    percent in 2017 and 2018, partly underpinned by government spending. Downside risks
    to this outlook include the fallout from further rises in US interest rates, a slower-than-
    expected economic recovery in Europe, and uncertainties over global trade. Poverty
    reduction is expected to continue over the next few years, driven mainly by the
    garment, construction and services sectors, together with increases in remittances.

        depository institution overnight, using open market operations (decided by FOMC)—for the purchase and sale of US treasury securities (bills, notes, and bonds).
        Since 2006, there have been three increases in the interest rate: the first rate increase from 0.25 to 0.5 percent per year (December 20, 2015), the second to 0.75
         percent (December 18, 2016) and the third increase to 1.0 percent (March 15, 2017). As of March 16, 2017, the effective Fed fund rate is now 0.91 percent and the
        bank prime loan rate is 4 percent.

26 	 Following IMF Staff report on “Making Public Investment more Efficient”, this section presents some proxies for inputs (level of spending) and outputs/outcomes
     (roads, maternal mortality), in an effort of assessing efficiency. It is worth noting important data limitations in the selection of indicators. Another caveat is that
     the proxies are not completely or uniquely attributable to spending levels.
