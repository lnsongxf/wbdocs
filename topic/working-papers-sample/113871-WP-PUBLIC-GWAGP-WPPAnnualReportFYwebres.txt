FOREWORD

Through its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
the world has made a pledge to reduce poverty and inequality by 2030.
The SDGs present a roadmap for investing in 17 critical areas, including
water, health, education, food security, infrastructure, and sustainable
cities and communities. As ambitious as they are, these goals are what’s
needed to shift the development agenda from reactive to proactive,
from fragmented to comprehensive.


In water, achieving the SDGs implies successfully evolving from a “needs-
based” approach to a preemptive effort to bolster communities’ resilience,
while targeting the poorest and the most vulnerable. The costs—jumping
from billions to trillions—may seem high, but the long-term benefits are no
doubt exponentially higher, provided the resources are invested effectively
and efficiently today. These long-term benefits range from healthier
children and thriving ecosystems to economies safeguarded from drought
and cities fortified against rising waters.


The pathway to success is becoming clearer by the day. Our sector is
especially grateful to be guided by the High Level Panel on Water, jointly
convened by the United Nations and the World Bank Group. The Panel
includes the heads of state and government of 11 countries facing or having
faced acute water challenges and who are spearheading SDG 6: Ensuring
availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.


While leadership is crucial, the most challenging work will have to be done
at the local level—in conflict-affected towns, on rural farms, and on the
outskirts of growing megacities. Whereas some countries will spearhead
innovative solutions, others will look to their peers for tried and tested
approaches. The World Bank’s Water Global Practice is eager to help fill
the existing knowledge gap. Through the Panel, we will share our global
knowledge, which is rooted in our operational work and based on more
than 70 years of experience in designing, contextualizing, testing, and
refining our tools and methods.
Most importantly, we know that achieving the SDGs requires much more
than technical knowledge and financing; we must bring sustainability to
the forefront of the poverty challenge. The Water Partnership Program
(WPP) is a platform where collaboration among academia, donors,
global experts, the private sector, and civil society organizations brings a
sustainability lens to the World Bank’s work. It adds significant value by
fostering cross-Practice collaboration and enabling teams to incorporate
the key factors of sustainability—inclusion, resilience, institutions, and
finance—into any project or program.  


I am pleased to introduce this Annual Report on “Global Solutions, Local
Success,” which highlights the WPP’s progress and results achieved
in fiscal year 2016. As we launch the new Global Water Security and
Sanitation Partnership1 we would like to thank our WPP partners—the
governments of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Austria,
and Switzerland—for pioneering a successful program that we can now
scale up in order to achieve SDG 6 toward a water-secure world for all.




Sincerely,




Guangzhe Chen
Senior Director
Water Global Practice




1. The new Global Water Security and Sanitation Partnership is the World Bank’s multidonor trust fund that merges the WPP and the
longstanding Water Sanitation Program to ensure water security and sanitation for all.
                                      CHAPTER 1:


       Growing our
       Partnership




6   Global Solutions, Local Success
The extraordinary global development challenges emerging today
require leaving behind the status quo and taking up a different
approach that can quicken the pace of change and bring results
to scale. The World Bank is using its Water Global Practice (GP)
as a platform to bring global solutions for local success. As water
security becomes more critical to global growth, the Water GP is
reengaging its partners and donors to shift sector thinking and
systematically invest in the factors that will bring sustainability to
the fore—inclusion, resilience, institutions, and finance.


The Water GP, with critical support from the Water Partnership Program
(WPP), is already consolidating the Bank’s decades of experience to bring
tried and tested, proven and packaged approaches to new locales. The
GP is also working with urban, climate, environment, energy, agriculture,
and other GPs to develop new, integrated approaches and tools that
can address the interrelated challenges emerging every day across the
globe. To foment this more focused and agile business structure, the GP
is launching the new Global Water Security and Sanitation Partnership
(GWSP), which will expand on the WPP’s successful platforms.



1.1 THE SDGS: FROM BILLIONS TO
TRILLIONS

It has been one year since the adoption of the 17 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) and the race to 2030 has clearly begun. Putting on paper
this “universal call to action” made the scale of the challenge, especially
as it relates to water, all the more tangible. Beyond providing water and
sanitation to all in an inclusive manner, the SDGs call for sustainable
services underpinned by adequate water resources and resilience
against climate-related water hazards. This is no small feat, requiring
both a scale-up of sector finance from billions to trillions, and, beyond
investments, ensuring that institutions have the capacity to manage
their resources and deliver services under uncertainty.


1.1.1 A High-Level Panel Leads the Way

Global leaders have responded with urgency and in equal measure. A High-
Level Panel on Water (HLPW) is being convened jointly by the United
Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, and the President of the World
Bank Group, Dr. Jim Kim, to engender a commitment to achieve all the
water-related SDGs. The Panel consists of 11 Heads of State and Government



                                                                              Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Report   7
                                                and a Special Adviser and will be active for two years. The Panel has already
                                                published an action plan for getting to 2030, and the World Bank’s Global
                                                Water Practice, with support from the WPP, is playing a lead role in the
                                                plan’s implementation.


                                                1.1.2 A More Focused, More Agile Water GP

                                                The Water GP is making five major changes that will enable its clients
                                                to deliver results on the road to 2030. First, it is applying new global
                                                knowledge in practice and crafting the future knowledge agenda, via its
                                                five Global Solutions Groups (GSGs). Together, the GSGs will produce
                                                27 global knowledge pieces on key topics by 2017. In 2016, the WPP was
                                                pivotal to their progress:


                                                •	 Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS): The GSG published a background
                                                   paper for the HLPW entitled Financing Options for the 2030 Agenda,
                                                   which sets a financing path for reaching the SDGs, with a strong focus
                                                   on access to domestic finance for developing countries. This report
                                                   was launched in November, 2016, at the Budapest Water Summit,
                                                   by Guangzhe Chen, Senior Director of the Water GP. Other major
                                                   outputs for 2017 include a national sector turnaround framework,
                                                   piloted in Peru; a global study on climate-resilient utilities; a utility
                                                   turnaround framework; and standard bid documents for design-
                                                   build-operate projects.


                                                •	 Water Resources Management (WRM): The WRM GSG is helping
                                                   guide the Bank in how to work toward improving the lives of the most
                                                   vulnerable—from those in fragile countries, to those facing water
                                                   stress or insecurity.  First, the GSG is advancing a flagship report to
                                                   bolster water engagements in countries prone to fragility, conflict,
                                                   and violence, which will provide recommendations for teams working

8   Global Solutions, Local Success
•	 Water, Poverty, and Economy: The GSG has a mandate to establish
   the analytical foundation for the linking of the Water Practice with the
   World Bank’s twin goals (eliminate extreme poverty and boost shared
   prosperity by 2030) and the SDGs. This year, the GSG published a
   new flagship report—High and Dry: Climate Change, Water and the
   Economy—supported by the WPP. It provides a quantifiable account
   of the effects of climate change on actual and future risks related to
   water (box 1).


•	 Hydropower and Dams: In FY16, the Energy and Extractives Global
   Practice published an update of its Supporting Hydropower Review,
   part of the Practice’s knowledge series, to help clients “do projects
   right” by distilling lessons from past and current Bank operations and
   connecting teams to a body of practical knowledge. The GSG has
   built a useful evidence base to respond to generalized assumptions
   made in the sector and to collect project-specific data on dams for
   cross-regional learning and experience sharing.


Second, the Water GP has implemented a range of knowledge tools and
services that facilitate the flow of knowledge from national, regional,
and global projects back into new operations. Recognizing the benefits
of these new systems to ensure appropriate use of (partly WPP-funded)
knowledge, the WPP has supported the GP’s knowledge management
(KM) and GSG teams in the development of these tools.

                                       The GSGs have provided quality oversight to 46 project teams to
                                       improve the consistency and performance of Bank operations and
                                       analytical work. This support includes quality enhancement review of
                                       analytical work and project appraisal documents, safe space discussions
                                       to improve the quality of project designs and loan negotiations, mission
                                       support for client dialogue, technical discussions, and advice on team
                                       composition, among others.


                                       The most popular tool, the AskWater helpdesk, has received more than
                                       250 questions from 143 staff, with the Africa region asking the largest
                                       number of questions. More than 30 staff have been assigned to respond to
                                       the questions, thereby improving their sector expertise at the same time.
                                       Responses are documented and made available on the Bank’s intranet.


                                       In FY16 the GSGs launched new, Just-in-Time facilities that complement
                                       the role of the Water Expert Team (WET) by providing rapid responses
                                       to requests for technical expertise, for cases where additional quality
                                       oversight is not required. These facilities are still in a pilot phase, as the
                                       GP tests the most cost-effective way to provide services to task teams
                                       that require different types and levels of support, depending on the
                                       complexity of the technical challenge.


                                       These new tools, now available to teams via WPP and WSP funding,
                                       are changing the way Bank staff communicate on technical challenges,
                                       and providing incentives for honest and transparent discussions that can
                                       have a meaningful impact on project performance. Moreover, through
                                       these tools, the activities of the GSGs are standardized and documented,
                                       helping identify skills and expertise of Bank staff previously unknown or
                                       untapped, which can now be used to improve quality on certain topics.
                                       Overall, the GSGs are changing the behavior of managers and staff in a
                                       way that increases the productivity and agility of Bank teams.


                                       Third, the Practice is building on the nearly 50 years of combined
                                       success of the Water Partnership Program (WPP) and the Water and
                                       Sanitation Program (WSP) to launch a new, multidonor trust fund, the
                                       Global Water Security and Sanitation Partnership (GWSP). The GWSP
                                       pivots the focus of the GP away from regions and subsectors, toward
                                       a “water writ large” approach to development that coordinates with
                                       other sectors, works at the right scale (basin, city, country), and dares to
                                       innovate. The GWSP will maintain the five modalities of support (global




10   Global Solutions, Local Success
knowledge; long-term and just-in-time technical assistance; partnership-
funded water staff; and project preparation services) that are critical
factors for the WSP and WPP to achieve their unique objectives. This
new approach will enable a much more comprehensive and flexible
response to clients, who more than ever are seeking not only to bring
the most relevant global best practices to their local context, but also
to address water resources and services challenges comprehensively—
through integrated solutions.


The GWSP will build the core contributions of the WPP outward and
upward, bringing together dozens of the sector’s most committed
development partners, donor governments, academia, and civil society
organizations to increase aid effectiveness; leverage global expertise and
experience; and target funds where they will have the highest impact on
the SDGs. A new type of partnership will leverage the investments and
knowledge of the GP and achieve far more than could be achieved with
World Bank resources alone.


Finally, the Practice is aligning its work program around five priority
themes critical for scaling up toward the SDGs: sustainability, inclusion,
finance, institutions, and resilience. A new results framework for the
GWSP, which will measure progress of Bank programs toward these five
themes, will guide funds to the most cost-effective ways to yield the
highest value investments. In essence, what the Bank has learned over
the last 50 years will be consolidated, refined, and refocused to help
clients based on our comparative advantage. Chapter 2 of this report
demonstrates how the WPP is already making headway on four of these
five themes—proof positive that the program targets the most critical
success factors, to be continued under the new GWSP.

            Box 1. High and Dry: Paving a Path
            for a More Water Secure and
            Climate-Resilient World
            The impacts of climate change will be primarily felt in the water cycle. It is projected that
            rainfall will be more variable and less predictable, and that warmer seas will generate more
            intense floods and storms. Climate change is a global issue, but its volatility and intensity
            will affect regions, countries, and cities differently. If policies continue “business as usual,”
            climate change will affect the world’s most water-stressed and poorest the most.


            The World Bank’s Water, Poverty, and Economy Global
            Solutions Group’s new flagship report High and Dry: Climate
            Change, Water and the Economy, supported by the WPP,
            provides a quantifiable account of the effects of climate
            change on actual and future risks related to water. The
            report (downloaded more than 9,000 times and picked up
            by 146 news outlets) suggests that bad water management
            policies can aggravate the adverse growth impacts of
            climate change, while good policies can steadily neutralize
            them. In fact, water scarcity under a changing climate could
            cost some regions up to six percent of their gross domestic
            product (GDP) and, in some places, lead to an increase in
            migration and conflict if no action is taken. For instance,
            water scarcity effects in water-abundant regions (such as Central Africa and East Asia)
            as well as in currently water-stressed regions (such as the Middle East and the Sahel in
            Africa) could see growth rates decline by as much as 6 percent of GDP by 2050 because
            of water-related impacts on agriculture, health, and incomes (see map 1).


            Water stewardship and adequate policies and investments can lead to more water secure
            and climate-resilient economies. The report highlights overarching policy priorities that
            encourage the development of smart water policies:


            •	 Optimize the use of water through better planning and incentives. Building climate-
               resilient economies that can develop and grow in a warming world by allocating scarce
               water resources to higher-value uses through planning and regulation, and by ensuring
               access to water for poor households and farmers as well as the environment.
            •	 Increase water efficiency within sectors. Creating and adopting water-saving
               technologies, incentives, and awareness while enabling sharper incentives for
               technology uptake.




12   Global Solutions, Local Success
•	 Expand water supply and availability where appropriate. Investing in storage infrastructure that makes
   water available when it is needed; water recycling and reuse; and, where viable, alternative water
   development (e.g., desalination).
•	 Reduce the impact of extremes, variability, and uncertainty. “Water proofing” economies to limit the
   impact of extreme weather events and rainfall variability while carefully choosing siting and design.

The WPP, starting the last of its eight years of implementation, remains
a key contributor to the new direction of the GP and the early success of
the GSGs. It is evident that the resources provided to the Water GP have
strengthened the GSG model much more than in other practices, and water
is now leading the way on the “knowledge in implementation” agenda.


WPP’s regional work programs are also showing great results. Dozens
of activities have closed this year, as the program nears the end of its
second phase. Many of these activities are highlighted in chapter 2, where
they are organized around four of the GP’s five topics—sustainability,
inclusion, institutions, and resilience, and chapter 3—where they are
organized by WPP result area.


In FY16 the WPP responded to client demand in key areas like climate and
flood risk, and groundwater management by working at the country level
to improve project designs. In parallel, it advanced global and regional
initiatives that build on local experience and bring best practices from one
country to another. For example, Vietnam and the Philippines are taking
on flood risk management, and the Bank’s experience is being used to
expand its Global Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM) Initiative
to include flood risk, starting with a regional program in Latin America.
Similarly, the use of remote sensing (RS) to improve groundwater
management in India has added to the Bank’s cadre of pioneers under
its Global Remote Sensing Initiative. Finally, the WPP’s Decision Tree
Framework is being mainstreamed for WRM projects across the GP, with
piloting in the Solomon Islands, and other climate assessment tools being
applied to new challenges in Kenya and West Africa.


Other key trends emerging from strong client demand in FY16 include
irrigation, and water and poverty. The WPP supported innovative
economic analyses of institutions and inclusion in Kenya and India, which
is helping the Bank, through water programs, deliver on its twin goals
of poverty reduction and shared prosperity. In irrigation, the WPP has
expanded its support to clients through national and local institutional
capacity building, legal reform, and modeling the trade-offs between
irrigation and other water uses. WPP’s irrigation work can be seen in
countries as diverse as Uzbekistan, Niger, Tanzania, Myanmar, Nigeria,
Kenya, Turkey, and India.


The WPP is positioned for a comprehensive evaluation and closure,
whereby the program’s knowledge, tools, and best practices—in
both trust fund technical management and administration—will be
transitioned to the new GWSP. In FY17 an independent review of the
WPP will be published with lessons learned, the preliminary findings of
which are already being used to inform the design of the GWSP and its
results framework.

The Water GP’s five themes help task teams focus on the elements
of their projects that will help clients achieve sustainable success.
This year, the WPP’s activities show clear support for four of these
themes—inclusion, resilience, sustainability, and institutions—with
the fifth—finance—under way as the GP consolidates its thinking
on the topic on behalf of the High-Level Panel on Water.



2.1 INCLUSION
The Water GP is at the forefront of making poverty reduction and
shared prosperity a tangible objective of Bank projects. This focus on
inclusion—especially of the most vulnerable populations within a project
area—receives support from the WPP to ensure long-run sustainability.
In Kenya and India, WPP funding has enabled teams to undertake more
project-specific analyses of potential impacts on the poor through some
cutting-edge approaches to economy-poverty analysis and behavior
change programs. In Niger and Kenya, the WPP promotes projects
that provide clear, pro-poor strategies in service delivery policies and
models for both water supply and irrigation. By prioritizing a few key
investments in inclusion, the WPP is bringing the evidence and extra
support needed to ensure that clients have the capacity and know-how        Woman drinking water.
                                                                            Photo: Curt Carnemark/World Bank
to focus on bringing benefits to the poor.  


2.1.1 Source to Tap: Water for the Poor

The Mombasa Water & Sanitation Company (MOWASCO) provides
water and sewerage services to Kenya’s second largest urban center,
Mombasa, with a population of about 1.2 million. All of Mombasa is now
under water rationing and many of the city’s low-income areas, which
comprise 30 percent of the population, lack access to service. Most of
this population buys water from private kiosks and the water is often of
poor and inconsistent quality.


MOWASCO is considered non-performing and the level of water service
is far below that expected for such an important economic center.
The WPP supported the Mombasa County government in improving
the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of MOWASCO in
advance of new water supply being made available to the city through
the 186,000 m3 per day multipurpose Mwache dam, being prepared
under an International Development Association (IDA) loan. MOWASCO
being an uptaker of the bulk water supply from the dam, the success of
the project leans on the utility’s ability to translate that new resource
into sustainable services.



                                                                               Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Report   17
                                       MOWASCO began making institutional improvements in 2013 through
                                       a 4-year Water Operator Partnership (WOP) with Dutch utility Vitens-
                                       Evides International. The WPP complemented and built on the WOP to
                                       finance the following:


                                       •	 A performance management contract with Mombasa County to
                                          include indicators on coverage, access, and water quality;


                                       •	 A customer service strategic plan to include modern metering and
                                          the development of a social connection policy, with support for pro-
                                          poor connections from the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid
                                          (GPOBA);


                                       •	 An Institutional Framework Strategic Outcome to include provision for

                                       2.1.2 Niger’s Irrigation Law Helps Smallholders

                                       In Niger, the WET is building on its previous efforts—in support of the
                                       2014 approval of a new ordinance to improve irrigation management—
                                       to operationalize the ordinance through a new decree. Through
                                       multiple stakeholder workshops, the WET consultant helped guide the
                                       development of the new decree to specify the functions, missions, and
                                       relations to other stakeholders of the National Irrigation Agency. One
                                       of the aims of this work is to enhance mutual accountability between
                                       the agency and farmers as a means to improve irrigated agricultural
                                       productivity, increase household income, and enhance equity through
                                       efficient allocation of irrigation water within the existing schemes and
                                       further expansion of irrigated agriculture.


                                       The WET outputs also lay an approach to developing a comprehensive
                                       law on irrigated agriculture, expected to be adopted by the National
                                       Assembly in 2018 to replace a 1960 law whereby the government controls
                                       all irrigation systems, which are restricted to large-scale collective rice
                                       schemes. The new law opens up public-private partnership (PPP) options
                                       for small-scale farming in alignment with the Sahel Irrigation Initiative, of
                                       which the Bank is a major partner along with six countries in the region,
                                       including Niger. Focusing on inclusion gives more people economic
                                       opportunities and boosts overall productivity and economic growth.

           BOX 3. Climate Change in Island States
           In the Solomon Islands, the WET was asked to assess climate-related uncertainties and
           suggest ways to incorporate climate variability into the proposed design of the 15 MW Tina
           River Hydropower Development Project. Considering the option of developing this as a
           public-private partnership, it was essential for the Bank and the borrower to understand the
           risks associated with climatic variability and change.


           The WET consultant used limited runoff and rainfall data, together with information gained
           through previous studies, to assess the uncertainties in total and firm power production, and
           applied The Decision Tree Framework, up to step 2 (chapter 3). The consultant also used
           projected climate scenarios to assess the sensitivity of power production to hydrological
           data, and thus also the project’s vulnerability to climate change. In the process, the consultant
           identified potential problem areas of the design from an uncertainty standpoint, and
           recommended possible measures to make the project more climate-resilient.

                                          Recurrent flooding in the Greater Metro Manila Area is managed by
                                          operating 57 pumping stations during flood events. Many pumps are over
                                          30 years old and no longer operating at full capacity. The Philippines looked
                                          to the World Bank to provide global best practices on flood resilience. The
                                          Bank responded by leveraging a WPP-funded study tour to the Netherlands,
                                          where officials from the Philippines, Bangladesh, China, and Vietnam
                                          learned how the Dutch manage water resources and how they protect
                                          their population and cities from the devastating effects of flooding. As a
                                          result, the Philippines delegation expressed interest in using hydrodynamic
                                          simulation software that visualizes the impact of flooding, known as 3Di.

The WPP subsequently supported the 3Di visualization of various flood

for innovative pumping station modernization designs based on good
international practices. Both activities influenced the $300 million
pipeline Metro Manila Flood Management Project.


2.2.2 Complex Water Systems: Breaking Silos

Resilience requires decisions on when and where to use water most
efficiently. A country must have accurate data on the potential trade-
offs it faces between allocating water to one user versus another, and
between the present and the future.


The World Bank is facing increasing demands to provide support in
“water resource hotspots” around the world in river basins where
water challenges are constraining growth and traditional solutions
are failing because of increasing complexity. Such water systems are
characterized by (i) trade-offs and synergies between multiple sectors;
and (ii) trade-offs and synergies in the spatial dimension (stakeholders in
geographically distinct areas, such as riparian countries in a basin setting)
and between timescales (such as between current and future uses, and
varying timescales of impact and regeneration of water resources).


This complexity requires a systems analysis approach, which allows a
simultaneous representation of multiple sectors and scales, rather than
the more traditional project-by-project approach. The WPP-funded
Complex Water Systems (COWS) Initiative is aimed at meeting a strong
and largely unmet demand for such high-quality technical analysis of
complex water systems. Currently, Bank staff with skills in complex
systems analysis are scattered across Global Practices. COWS enables
the Bank to deploy its top experts on high-priority complex systems
engagements and to use innovative analytical tools, including Geographic
Information Systems (GISs), remote sensing, simulation, optimization
and multicriteria models, and interactive visualizations.


Engagements are selected through a Bank-wide call for proposals. Early
results of the COWS Initiative include two examples—one in Tanzania,
one in Myanmar.


Tanzania’s Trade-Offs: Environment, Crops, and Power
The Great Ruaha River, flowing through the Ruaha National Park in
southern Tanzania, has seen decreasing water flows during the last
decades and a growing number of days during the dry season with
zero flows. COWS conducted a systems analysis of the river, using
newly available remotely sensed data to understand the complexity and
assess the efficiency of different solutions. The system model describes
the various hydrological systems in the river basin as well as the man-

                                                   produces more distributed results than previously possible. The model
                                                   confirms low water use efficiency in irrigation in the Usangu Plains (20–25
                                                   percent) and increases in rice irrigation over the last decades, diminishing

for two basins covering more than 700 km2, and water balance analysis
in the catchments for flooding and dry seasons. The activity used
systems analysis and modeling tools to give Vietnam recommendations
for managing river basins, duly taking into account flood control,
environmental and social sustainability, and water quality issues.
This activity helped client agencies understand how to optimize the
alternatives for basin management, providing workshops on the
application of tools used in the analysis. The work leverages other donor-
funded programs in the city, including those of the Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).


At the other end of the climate spectrum, the WET is working with three
southern provinces suffering their worst drought in 40 years. Reservoirs
have almost completely dried up—with water below 10 percent of
their design capacity—and have adverse impacts on livestock, crop
yields, and household water availability. A quick assessment of water
availability by the WET consultant and the final report Drought Risk
Management – A Preliminary Water Resources Assessment inform the
implementation of four ongoing and future Bank loans in the country,
ensuring that project designs incorporate the most recent data for
more sustainable outcomes.




2.3 SUSTAINABILITY
The WPP supports the Water GP in facilitating sustainability at the
source. For coastal economies, that means protecting the natural land
and water environment so it can benefit future generations as well. For
inland populations, including farmers, it means protecting groundwater
resources and ensuring their proper management so that from year to
year and season to season the right quality and quantity are available for
productive use. The WPP is promoting the uptake of innovative tools like
remote sensing (RS) and integrated modeling frameworks to creatively
address sustainability challenges.


2.3.1 Our Tiny Blue Planet

Earth observation, or Remote Sensing (RS), is a relatively new and
growing field. It has the potential to help clients improve their monitoring
and predictive capabilities and improve the outcomes of Bank operations
and analytical work. RS tools and products are useful across several
water-related fields, including flood and drought risk management,
evapotranspiration mapping, irrigation and rain-fed system management,

     in World Bank Water-
     Related Projects
     In World Bank projects, the following sectors and
     themes* have been the key users of remote sensing:


     •	 Flood protection and general water, sanitation and
        flood protection (more than 50% of projects using RS)
     •	 Irrigation and draining (25%)
     •	 Natural disaster management (17%)
     •	 Climate change related (12%)


     In projects with a large WRM component (55%),
     remote sensing has been used primarily in lending
     operations (66%) and less frequently in advisory and
     analytical support (9%).
     *Note: sectors and themes are not mutually exclusive

                                                    and transboundary river basin planning and management, water quality
                                                    management, and delta and coastal area management. Remotely sensed
                                                    data can help verify ground data and even provide information in areas
                                                    that lack monitoring infrastructure. As such, earth observation can be

                                                    countries with insufficient monitoring systems.


                                                    In 2016, the WPP-funded Remote Sensing Initiative published a guidance

                                                    used most (50 percent of projects in flood protection use them) and
                                                    builds on a Bank portfolio review to direct task teams on when and
                                                    where RS tools can be beneficial.


                                                    Under Phase II, the team has started reaching out to task teams to
                                                    provide expert support on several projects. The objective of this initiative
                                                    is to mainstream beneficial RS use and applications in operational Bank
                                                    projects, as well as to increase the use of RS applications in client countries.


                                                    Phase II attempts to bridge the gap between the supply of RS tools and
                                                    the demand from Bank projects, and to support continued collaboration
                                                    with external partners like the National Aeronautics and Space

                                                                                 Abed Khalil, Task Team Leader
on, for example, real-time water demand for agriculture and thereby
improve water use efficiency. Unfortunately, few people have the
necessary skills to use satellite-driven data to aid groundwater planning.


To fill the capacity gap, the WET provided three key consultancies. First,
a WET consultant recommended a tenfold increase in the frequency
of groundwater monitoring using RS technology. The advice included
design of a real-time data monitoring system for aquifer management
plans, considering different geographic and time scales at which data
can be provided, as well as the limitations presented by monsoon and
cloud cover. This yielded protocols for data assimilation to produce
a biannual groundwater monitoring report at the block level for the
selected areas, which could be scaled up to all states.


Second, a WET expert identified pollution sources and trends in five states,
and provided ideas for program design related to chain improvement for
sampling and analysis of groundwater quality. Through the expert, the
client is learning about other countries using satellite information for real-
time water use measurement and verification. Finally, in these same states,
a WET consultant helped revise the proposed draft of the Groundwater
Development, Management and Protection Bill, noting the need for more
integrated approaches and mechanisms to ensure enforcement of its
provisions for a resource under the protection of the states.

          Demand Management
          Volumetric operations and maintenance fees are globally recognized as an effective incentive
          for improving irrigation efficiency, especially if implemented at low transaction costs. With 30
          percent of the Valley’s irrigated area dependent on pumps to convey water, such inefficiencies
          present high and unnecessary costs for many WUAs. The WPP supported a team to develop
          such an approach in a number of interested WUAs, building on lessons learned from approaches
          across the globe. The new pricing scheme has been discussed with the Ministry of Water
          Resources, which is interested in piloting the approach under the Ferghana Valley Water
          Resources Management Phase II Project. The WPP support could influence $200 million across
          two project components.

                                                    during the summer months due to high water use in agriculture (which
                                                    account for 90 percent of all abstractions). At the same time, there is
                                                    excess winter runoff, in particular from upstream Kyrgyzstan, which
                                                    stems from energy generation for winter heating.

2.3.3 Protecting Africa’s “Sand River”

The coasts of Ghana, Togo, Benin, and the Ivory Coast are home to 31
percent of West Africa’s population and host an abundance of natural
resources, which provide vital ecosystem services and help buffer
against severe weather and natural events.


The West African coast consists of a narrow low-lying strip, maintained
by sediments from rivers and transported along the coast by waves
and currents, comparable to a “sand river.” The sandy coastal barrier is
eroding at several locations; the highest rates of retreat (10 meters or
more per year) occur in the most urbanized areas. Sea level rise may
further advance coastal retreat, disrupting the barrier.


The World Bank–financed West Africa Coastal Areas Management
Program seeks to protect those living in the coastal zone through
erosion and flood control investments. The WPP, with cofinancing from
the Deltares “Understanding System Dynamics” research program,
supported the development of a large-scale sediment budget that can
serve as a first step toward an integrated and climate-resilient coastal
zone management plan. The quantification of the sediment transport
rates along the four countries’ shores was based on numerical modeling.
It provided the first estimate of the possible consequences of major
human interventions along the coast and possible transboundary
implications. The effects of climate change on the large-scale sediment
transport capacity were also analyzed. Creating awarenes involved
communication and exchange of information and results with local
organizations and relevant stakeholders.


The model is used to investigate the effects of the major interventions
in place along the coastal system, and to determine the methods for
avoiding sediment blockage (e.g., sediment by-pass systems around
the ports). Moreover, by simulating the effects of climate change (i.e.,
changes in sea level rise, wave height, wave direction, and precipitation),
the modeling framework provides a first-order estimate of expected
changes to the sediment budget and coastline position. Finally, this
framework could provide the boundary conditions for creation of more
detailed models at specific hotspot locations where adaptation and
solutions will be planned.

                                         to end users, employees of water institutions have incentive structures
                                         that determine their priorities and behavior. The WPP supports projects

                                         effective at a medium scale (~500 people, ~100 project villages). The
                                         United Nations International Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is replicating this
                                         approach across South Asia.


                                         Now that the results of the approach have been validated, the Bank
                                         has launched a $2 million global technical assistance effort called the

2.4.2 Devolving Water Management to Nigeria’s
Farmers

Institutions can remain stagnant and ineffective if new knowledge and
ideas are not made available to decision makers. The nearly $500 million
Transforming Irrigation Management in Nigeria (TRIMING) Project was
approved in 2014 to establish a system of coresponsibility between the
federal government of Nigeria and WUAs, where five selected public
irrigation systems would become financially self-sufficient. Phase I of
the program gradually shifted government-managed irrigation projects          Visiting TRIMING project site with

2.4.3 IUWM: Shared Challenges Define a Regional
Platform

Today’s water challenges require institutions—whether local or national;
water, environment, or agriculture—to collaborate effectively. With an 80
percent urbanization rate, many cities in Latin America are confronting
water scarcity, water pollution, and ecosystem degradation. The impact
of thirsty and polluting cities extends far beyond the urban perimeters
as cities compete with agricultural and other water users, including
the environment, to satisfy their water demands—often reaching into
neighboring basins and importing large amounts of water.

                                       Water’s secondary impacts: Pollution and floods
                                       The WPP continues to address these issues by building upon and
                                       extending the activities undertaken during Phase 1 of the Latin
                                       America Region’s Blue Water Green Cities Initiative (2010–12). Phase I
                                       of the initiative has had a profound influence on World Bank–financed
                                       operations and clients by helping develop Integrated Urban Water
                                       Management (IUWM) tools and promote their application in operations.
                                       Two emerging regional priorities are environmental water quality
                                       management and urban flood management. Good IUWM practice calls
                                       for coupling urban water pollution control activities with basin-wide WRM
                                       that incorporates both water quality and water quantity dimensions. Latin
                                       American countries and cities are embarking on massive investments
                                       in wastewater collection and disposal infrastructure to improve and
                                       protect the environmental quality of their water resources. A key
                                       development challenge in this context is to ensure that policy, planning,
                                       and regulatory decisions are well formulated and implemented within an
                                       IUWM framework.


                                       This year’s work included the publication of an integrated urban flood
                                       risk management guidance note that was built around the needs
                                       identified in an international workshop showcasing the experiences
                                       and challenges of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The workshop leveraged
                                       $100,000 in funding from the WSP and was cosponsored by the United

                                       IUWM on a small scale
                                       While water and sanitation coverage is relatively high in Uruguay,
                                       sewerage coverage and treatment outside the capital, Montevideo, are
                                       low, infrastructure is aging, and floods occur frequently. These are the
                                       challenges that many low- and middle-income countries will be facing in
                                       the near future. Uruguay can play a pioneering role in testing new IUWM
                                       solutions. The country has the political will and institutions to support
                                       innovation, which is why the WPP has looked to Uruguay to pilot the
                                       tools developed under its Blue Water Green Cities Initiative. Uruguay is
                                       also strategically placed to leverage the MercoSur platform for south-
                                       south knowledge exchange on IUWM.

This WPP activity first applied the methodology for IUWM diagnostics
in the cities of Salto (90,000 residents) and Young (17,000 residents),
then developed a roadmap for a national IUWM for sustainable urban
development (including tools to identify and prioritize the most
vulnerable populations), and strengthened local capacities on IUWM.
The selection of a small and a medium-sized city in Uruguay will diversify
the knowledge base of IUWM case studies, which have otherwise been
conducted in mega and large cities, by exposing unique challenges and
opportunities that do not exist at other scales.

project for improved water WSS as well as future investments to improve
environmental quality and wastewater management, and reduce flood
risks within the IUWM context, with benefits that will disproportionally
accrue to low-income households.


The activity benefited from groundwork laid by previous World Bank,  
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) , and European Union (EU)
support for urban water management, and is expected to crowd in
additional funds from national and local agencies to implement the
IUWM action plans. Local institutions will provide up to $150,000 in in-
kind support for implementation.

The Water Partnership Program (WPP) Phase II results framework
translates the WPP’s objectives into two principal impacts: (i)
vulnerable populations have been provided with an enhanced
quality of life; and (ii) climate-resilient green growth has been
made possible through water-smart development. The first impact
represents the program’s progress toward social and human
development goals, while the second represents the program’s goal
toward economic growth coupled with sustainable development.

The results framework is presented in annex 2. It deconstructs these                                        Objective

to the three “to-be-determined” at the end of the Program.


A few indicators are, for various reasons, unlikely to be met by the end of
the program. Some of these were stretch targets, given the short timeline
and demand-driven nature of the program, and others have proven
difficult to monitor, given the variety of indicators used in Bank projects.
Sub-indicators that are unlikely to be met are found under indicator G

the sector. The Bank identified Mexico as having comparable institutional
experiences and, with a similar climate, being successful in mainstreaming
climate change in the national water policy agenda.


In May of 2016, the WPP supported a study tour of more than 20
delegates from Kenya to visit Mexico’s institutions. The delegates from
Kenya included representatives from the Ministry of Water and Irrigation,
the National Treasury, the Coastal Water Services Board (WRMA),
Members of Parliament, officials of Kwale and Mombasa Counties, and
the Mombasa Water Services Company.


The exchange was an important milestone in the partnership between
the two countries, which was started at a high-level event in Mombasa
in February 2014. The learning experience included presentations at
several federal institutions in Mexico City—including the House of
Representatives—and field trips to various water service providers and
irrigation districts in three states. The delegation also visited the National
Water Commission (CONAGUA), the Association of Mexican Water
Utilities (ANEAS), basin organizations, and municipal water utilities to
help participants reflect on what transforming a country’s water sector
can look like.

                                          participants from water, forestry, desertification, and agriculture learned
                                          new ways to improve institutional coordination for shared planning and
                                          implementation. They also saw the benefits of technical innovation (such

                                          client has also requested the World Bank to support the preparation of
                                          an Irrigation Modernization Project whereby IWRM principles would be
                                          piloted in the context of irrigation investments. The project will include
                                          a component on strengthening the water management capacity at the
                                          basin level, through the establishment of Basin Water Data Centers
                                          in selected basins, and support for the recently constituted Basin
                                          Commissions. The concept of a new irrigation project reflects the IWRM
                                          concepts learned throughout the study tour.

learned from donors, partners, service providers, and global experts. A
total of 79 technical sessions and 25 courses were offered on topics
ranging from dam safety to gender inclusion and from climate change to
rural sanitation. Participants assigned both the quality and the relevance
of the learning activities a score of 4.5 out of 5. By sharing solutions to
common challenges the World Bank aims to improve the quality of its

                                                    (LCBC) adopted the Water Charter as a binding framework for

focus on the need to improve monitoring of rainfall information, which
can have large livelihood impacts for rainfed agriculture and livestock
producers; monitor groundwater and water quality for oil spills; and
estimate evapotranspiration levels in the basin (via real-time hydrological
monitoring). The data and systems gap analysis is informing the way
forward for operationalizing the charter, and will inform a series of future
loans in the riparian countries: Cameroon, the Central African Republic,
Chad, Niger, and Nigeria.


Armenia: Financial review leads to second-stage reforms
In Armenia, agriculture is the main livelihood of rural communities and
highly dependent on irrigation. WUAs were first established in 2002;
there are currently 42 WUAs responsible for 195,000 hectares, which
comprises most of the country’s irrigable land.


The WPP funded a strategic plan to enhance the effectiveness of
WUAs in Armenia as a guidance tool for the implementation of the $30
million World Bank–financed Irrigation Systems Enhancement Project.
While substantial progress has been made in upgrading the irrigation
infrastructure and building the institutional capacity to manage it, much
work remains to be done to lower the overall operations and maintenance
(O&M) cost per cubic meter of agricultural water and to ensure WUAs
have the data and capacity to make the best financial and economic
decisions. Thus, the activity included a review of 10 years of experience
in WUA management, including changes in cropping, energy and water
use, and financial sustainability. The team also reviewed capacity across
WUAs in terms of planning, conflict management, GIS, and accounting
and financial management, including calculating O&M requirements.


The review, along with a WUA financial strategy, was used to draft a
government decree for improving the financial sustainability of the
national irrigation sector, which is awaiting approval. The work has also
garnered the interest of the government of Armenia for a Development
Policy Operation with a component on irrigation, under which second-
stage reforms are envisioned to improve sector performance.

Automating water rights boosts productivity
The National Water Resources Board (NWRM) regulates water
resources in the Philippines. Nearly half of all permits in the country
are for groundwater extraction, and better tracking and monitoring
is needed to enforce permitting. The WET is supporting a new
water allocation permit management system. Unlike past attempts
of information systems, NWRB wanted a system where information
drives the value for different stakeholders who provide and use data
rather than a “nodal agency” model. The NWRB Permit Management
System proof of concept was developed as an integrated permitting
framework that automates and links administrative processes (using a
cloud-based permit management system) with an aquifer model that
is able to update the effects on the aquifer of potential additional wells
using data from existing permittees and sensors.


The algorithm has been tested successfully in one pilot area. The study
found that nearly 50 percent of roughly 40 audited accounts show
consumption above allocations. Those using more water than they
were allocated were industrial users who voluntarily report their use
on a timely basis. Such users are probably not aware of their excess
or consider that the negative consequences of such behavior are low
compared to the benefit and, therefore, can pay the penalties if charged.
The purpose of the system is to improve the quality of the information
and interpretations available to decision makers and permitting staff,
ultimately enhancing the capacity for stewardship of water resources in
the Philippines. The new, context-aware system, a so-called “connected
water management system,” signals a first step toward changing the
status quo. Automating the different stages of evaluation and hosting it
in the cloud allows regulatory staff to engage in the process in a more
efficient and streamlined way and makes the system portable.

Urban Water Supply and Wastewater Project is one effort to address
this growing challenge, and includes seven wastewater subprojects in
medium cities, each with a population of 100,000–200,000.


The WPP supported the seven cities benefiting from the project by
providing knowledge dissemination and technical assistance, which
contributed to the introduction of global best practices tailored to
the cities’ local conditions; an assessment of alternatives for collection
and sustainable treatment of wastewater; and selection of the most
appropriate design option. The designs focus on using energy-efficient
and environmentally friendly treatment processes to the extent possible,
and attempting to adopt energy-generating processes.


The low-cost and sustainable wastewater treatment technology options
demonstrated in the seven project cities were disseminated nationally
and are expected to have policy-level impacts on national sector
development over the next decades. Through the $123 million influenced
project, the activity supports more than 800,000 people, including the
urban poor, by giving them access to better sanitation and wastewater

As of 2016, 178 practitioners—including representatives from 11
government agencies—received introductory training on the Decision
Tree Framework. This year the Water GP also started an in-depth learning
series for task teams to apply the Decision Tree Framework to Bank
projects. During the course, task teams learn to assess the vulnerability
of water resource systems to changes in the initial conditions on which
proposed designs are based; and to develop adaptation strategies
through iterative climate risk assessment and management. Thirteen
participants completed the course so far and more are expected to
benefit in the years ahead.

ANNEX 1 - FINANCIAL SUMMARY
WPP PHASE II
(July 2012 – June 2016)


This annex provides financial information concerning the second phase
of the WPP on donor contributions, approvals, disbursements and
commitments of activities, and program management and administration
costs. This financial report covers a 48-month period, from July 2012
to June 20162. From Phase II inception until June 2016, a total of 233
activities (including 103 for WET) were approved for a total amount of
$39.2 million. From July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016 (the Bank’s Fiscal Year
2016, FY16), 70 new activities were approved, amounting to $15 million.


The program’s overall approvals represent 73 percent of the total
allocation approved under the different windows. When proposed
activities and program management are included, the total amount
increases to $51.7 million, representing 89 percent of the total available
contribution to the Program. Most approved activities are currently
under implementation—44 WPP and 68 WET activities had been closed
by the end of June 2016.


Donor Contributions to the WPP

Total donor contributions to the second phase of the WPP amount to
$54.5 million. In October 2015, the WPP welcomed the Government of
Switzerland’s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) as its fifth
donor, joining its four existing donors: the Netherlands’ Directorate-
General for International Cooperation (DGIS), the United Kingdom’s
Department        for    International      Development         (DFID),     the    Danish
International Development Agency (DANIDA), and the Federal Ministry
of Finance of the government of Austria. In June 2015, the Bank and DGIS
reached agreement on an additional contribution of $6.3 million. Likewise,
in August 2015, DFID made an additional contribution of $3.7 million.


As detailed in table A1, the WPP Phase II contributions equal $59.1
million when including the $4.6 million remaining balance from WPP
Phase I, all of which had been received as of June 2016. After deducting
the 2 percent administration fee and adding the earned investment
income, this leaves a total program budget of $58.4 million.




2. To provide clear and accurate data, all WPP Phase II financials are included in this
report. The second phase of the program officially started in July 2012, so this financial
report includes figures as of that date. However, since donor funds were received in the
beginning of 2013, most activities only started after the first quarter of 2013—only the WET
services were continued from July 2012 due to the specific nature and high demand from
the Regions, using remaining WPP Phase I funds.

                                         Since the inception of its second phase, the program has disbursed
                                         $21.6 million through 233 activities. During FY16 alone, $9.8 million was
                                         expended. Including commitments, the program has used $27.4 million
                                         (of which $11.6 million or 42 percent in FY16 alone), which increases
                                         to $30.1 million when program management and administration
                                         expenditures are taken into account. Table A2 and figure A show the

                                              As can be seen in these figures, on average 67 percent of regional
                                              allocations has been approved for activities plus an additional 29.4
                                              percent in draft proposals, while the regional implementation rate is
                                              significantly higher (54 to 84 percent, average 74 percent) compared to
                                              FY15 (average 52 percent). The global windows show an approval rate
                                              of 77 percent, but a lower implementation rate of 68 percent because
                                              these activities are activated more recent.


                                              The average activity size is about $152,000 for the regional windows,
                                              and $430,000 for the global windows (excluding the WET window, for
                                              which the average activity budget is about $33,0003). Compared to
                                              WPP Phase I, which saw an average activity size of less than $140,0004,
                                              the Phase II activities—especially the global activities that often span
                                              several years—are significantly larger.




                                              3. This figure does not include WET management and administration costs.
                                              4. This figure does not include activities under the Expert Support Teams window.

Program Management and Administration Costs

Program Management and Administration (PMA) costs are costs
incurred by the WPP Team and the Bank’s technical experts who
provide strategic advice and support. These include expenditures on
general program management, monitoring and evaluation, and donor
coordination, among others. Total PMA disbursements and commitments
under Phase II from inception to June 30, 2016 amount to 9.1 percent
of total disbursements and commitments—down from 12 percent as of
June 2015. The decrease of PMA percentage has brought these costs
only slightly above the WPP cap on PMA costs (9 percent according
to the Administrative Agreement).5 Despite the relatively low activity
disbursements in the first year of the program,6 the WPP has proactively
set up the program structure and procedures in order to match the
PMA costs and increase disbursement rates by FY16. This is illustrated
in figure B, which shows relatively low activity disbursements in the first
year of the program, but exponential growth of this figure since July
2013. As expected, PMA costs will decrease further relative to activity
costs toward the closure of the program.

                                 * For all sub-indicators: some of these are new WB core-indicators (easy to track in the future), but not all. For some indicators, it is quite likely that only a couple of Bank projects will be tracking them, and the WPP cannot
                                 guarantee that it will be requested to support these projects.
                                 Due to these uncertainties, the WPP proposes to evaluate these indicators & targets after 2 years.
                                 The following assumptions were made to determine the targets of the sub-indicators:
                                 1) est. 4 Bank projects protecting 300km each
                                 2.1) WPP Phase I: 1 project, 0.5 million ha; estimate for WPP Phase II: 2 projects

                                 4) WPP Phase I: 1 project, 10 MCM; estimate for Phase II: 2 projects
                                 5) WPP Phase I: 2 projects, 0.43 million ha; estimate for Phase II: 8 projects.
                                 6) 2002-2012: 800 MW/yr in WB projects, FY11-12 1,600 MW/yr. FY13-16 estimate: 1,500 MW/yr, of which 50% supported by WPP.
                                   (*) % female of direct beneficiaries is core sector indicator for WB projects, which allows for detailed specification.
