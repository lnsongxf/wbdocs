The Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Economic Update (http://www
.worldbank.org/eca/update) is a joint product of ECA’s Office of the Chief
Economist, the Macro and Fiscal Management Global Practice, and the Poverty
Global Practice, with inputs from the Developments Prospects Group.
   Part I was prepared by a team in the Chief Economist Office, led by Hans
Timmer, and including Maurizio Bussolo, David Michael Gould, Mathilde Sylvie
Maria Lebrand, Georgi Panterov, Nathaniel Wesley Russel, William Shaw,
Ekaterina Ushakova, and Hernan Jorge Winkler. Chapter 1 benefitted from
forecasts prepared by economists in the Macro and Fiscal Management Global
Practice, which are presented in Part II. Earlier work on perceptions, middle class

Executive Summary

These are tough times for Europe and Central Asia (ECA). The Brexit vote and
the refugee crisis are testing the European Union’s internal cohesion. Continued
vulnerabilities in European banking sectors are curbing the economic recovery.
The Russian Federation, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and South Caucuses are
still grappling with the consequences of low oil prices, increasingly compounded
by low prices of other commodities. The fall in commodity prices has forced
major adjustments in fiscal and monetary policies, made banking sector reforms
vital and urgent, and required a shift of economic activity toward exportable
products. In Turkey social and political tensions have increased in the aftermath
of the coup attempt. Geopolitical frictions in the region are increasing.
    These challenges weigh on the economic outlook, causing forecasted GDP
growth to be lower than it would have been in a less gloomy environment. Not
all of the headwinds translate into a GDP downturn, however. In fact, GDP
growth for the region as a whole is expected to modestly accelerate this year, to
1.6 percent, up from 1.4 percent in 2015, thanks partly to ongoing recovery in the
European Union and a small rebound from the 2015 contraction in the eastern
part of the region.
    The absence of a slowdown in GDP growth does not contradict the statement
that these are tough times for the region. The region faces difficult structural chal-
lenges that, absent strong policy responses, could impair growth and poverty
reduction over the long term.
    First, lower oil and minerals prices may be here to stay. Oil-exporting coun-
tries have suffered large terms-of-trade losses that reduced national income far
more than it reduced GDP; in Azerbaijan, for example, national income declined
by roughly 25 percent over the last two years. In the absence of a recovery in
prices, commodity exporters will have to take steps to ensure that the recent ex-
change rate depreciations result in shifts in production to manufactures. Space
has to be created for new entrepreneurs in export sectors. Large companies that
depended on oil revenues and construction orders, and that benefited from lend-
ing by related financial institutions, are unlikely to become internationally com-
petitive in new sectors and under new circumstances.
    Second, the decline in investment rates in the European Union may well be
part of a new normal, reflecting reduced resources as trade deficits shrank after
the financial crisis. Lower investment over the long term will mean slower
growth, unless policies are adopted to improve productivity. Schooling systems,
labor market regulations, and financial intermediaries have to adjust to rapidly
changing industrial organization, to take advantage of the emergence of the shar-
ing economy and more atomized production methods.
    Third, divergence within the European Union—as a result of diminishing in-
ternational competitiveness of countries in Southern Europe—could well pres-
age mounting tensions within the currency union.                                         xiii

                In this environment, cyclical macroeconomic policy can be only a small part of
            the solution. In the western part of the region, there is some room for fiscal stimu-
            lus after austerity in previous years, while monetary stimulus is reaching its lim-
            its. In the eastern part of the region, the opposite is true. Looser monetary policy
            is a real option, while fiscal policies have to adjust further to lower oil revenues
            and reduced remittances. However, these cyclical policies will do little to address
            the pervasive structural challenges. In fact, pure cyclical stimulus can frustrate
            the necessary adjustments to cope with these structural challenges.
                Perhaps the most complicated structural challenge is the growing social and
            political tension in many countries. Throughout the region there is a tendency
            toward populism. Voters’ preferences are polarizing, as support for the middle of
            the political spectrum is dwindling. Mistrust in existing institutions and general
            anxiety are increasing. Surveys show especially concerns about the lack of job
            security.
                The political polarization likely has many causes, and economic challenges or
            rising distributional tensions may well have played a role. However, this report
            shows that there is no clear link between the observed anxiety and a simple mea-
            sure of income inequality. Inequality, measured by the standard Gini coefficient,
            has actually fallen over the past 10–15 years in some countries in the region.
            There are, however, indications that the anxiety is correlated with other measures
            of distributional tensions.
                Since 2010 individuals have become more pessimistic about their position in
            the income distribution, opportunities for upward economic mobility have dete-
            riorated, and incomes have become less secure over time. The latter is caused by
            rapid increase in temporary and part-time work, and shifts in the demand for
            skills, driven by new digital technologies, which affect more severely people em-
            ployed in occupations of the middle the distribution. In addition, there is some
            evidence that inequality of opportunity, i.e. inequality due to circumstances be-
            yond the control of the individual, has been structurally increasing. If efforts
            matter less for achieving secure jobs and growing incomes, than people will get
            discouraged, underinvest in their education or give up their search for employ-
            ment. Slow overall growth has also likely reduced support for traditional parties.
            Econometric evidence suggests that political populism in ECA is related to the
            extended period of slow growth since the financial crisis. The biggest challenge
            for societies and governments is to provide new perspectives in a new economic
            era without falling back on fixes that worked in the past under very different
            circumstances. Coping with the structural challenges and limiting the rise in po-
            litical polarization will require policies that support adjustment to these new eco-
            nomic realities while limiting the pain that such adjustments can cause. Given
            the uncertainty surrounding many of these issues, research is essential to guide
            policy choices.
                This report consists of two chapters. Chapter 1 summarizes the short-term
            outlook before briefly outline the main structural challenges to growth and pros-
            perity facing the region over the longer run. Chapter 2 examines some of the
            changes that may have increased social and political anxiety.

Tough Times for
Europe and Central Asia


Europe and Central Asia (ECA) is confronting difficult social and economic chal-
lenges that threaten to overturn established political relationships and could
have dire implications for long-term growth. Britain’s vote in favor of leaving the
European Union, geopolitical tensions, the specter of terrorist attacks, the at-
tempted coup in Turkey, the continuing refugee crisis, and the likely long-term
shift to lower prices of many countries’ commodity exports have greatly in-
creased anxiety over economic prospects. Disappointing global growth has aug-
mented the difficulties for the region.
    In the near term, ECA is facing continued slow growth. GDP growth is ex-
pected to rise modestly, from a meager 1.4 percent in 2015 to 1.6 percent in 2016,
as Russia and neighboring countries start to recover from deep recessions. How-
ever, terms-of-trade losses and dwindling remittances have reduced incomes and
consumption by much more than GDP in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Even
with a recovery in GDP, 2016 consumption is expected to remain more than 4.5
percent below its 2014 level in the eastern part of ECA. Throughout the region,
exchange rate depreciations have contributed to modest acceleration of exports
and GDP.
    Several structural challenges have become more urgent than the cyclical ones.
First, the prospect of an extended period of low commodity export revenues un-
derlines the importance of facilitating shifts in production to tradables. Second,
countries that experienced investment booms, accompanied by rising trade defi-
cits, before the financial crisis have to find a new growth model, as the availabil-
ity of external resources has declined. Third, diverging competitiveness within
Europe is creating strains within the European Union.

                                  The Short-Term Outlook

                                  Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, and other shocks that have in-
                                  creased uncertainty, triggered a downward revision from the forecast published
                                  in the April Economic Update (table 1.1). For the European Union, 2016 GDP
                                  growth has been downgraded by 0.2 percentage points, and growth in 2017 is
                                  now expected to be 0.5 percentage points lower than forecast half a year ago.
                                  Growth in Turkey and the South Caucasus has also been revised downward.
                                     Despite these downward revisions, modest acceleration in GDP is expected in
                                  2016 across the region. A rebound from past downturns is supporting growth
                                  despite the new challenges, and currency depreciation is helping the region out-
                                  perform tepid global trade growth. GDP growth in the European Union and
                                  Western Balkans in 2016 is expected to decline only slightly from the previous
                                  year, continuing the trend recovery from the financial crisis. GDP growth is ex-
                                  pected to rise modestly in France, Germany, and Italy; growth in the United King-
                                  dom is expected to fall by about half a percentage point. The more rapidly grow-
                                  ing Central European countries are expected to experience the largest declines in
                                  growth (0.4 percentage points) among subregions, with the sharpest fall in the
                                  Czech Republic. Unlike the other subregions in the western part of the region, the
                                  Western Balkans is forecast to grow, driven by a sharp upswing in Serbia.
                                     Prospects appear less sanguine in the eastern part of the region, although oil-
                                  exporting countries should experience a modest rebound from the difficult expe-
                                  rience of 2015. Growth in Central Asia is expected to decline to 2 percent in 2016,

Chapter 1: Tough Times for Europe and Central Asia	                                                                  ●  5



almost 1 percentage point below the rate in the previous year and well below the
5.1 percent growth recorded in 2014. The South Caucuses are expected to dip into
recession in 2016. GDP in the Russian Federation is forecast to fall only slightly,
following the 3.6 percent plunge the previous year. Growth in Turkey is expected
to fall to 3.1 percent, not 4 percent as forecast in 2015.
    The fall in commodity prices is driving significant shifts in consumption,
which shows a very different pattern from GDP (table 1.2). In the European
Union, consumers are benefiting from lower oil prices. Consumption growth is
therefore expected to exceed GDP growth in many countries. Between 2015 and
2018, consumption in the European Union and Western Balkans is expected to
grow 0.9 percentage points faster than GDP.
    By contrast, in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, consumption declined by 4.8
percent in 2015, compared with a 1.2 percent contraction of GDP. Russia experi-
enced an almost 10 percentage-point fall in consumption and a 3.7 percent-point
contraction in GDP. This large decline in consumption reflected a terms-of-trade loss
of more than 6 percent of GDP, making the total income loss in Russia 10 percent.
    Consumption is expected to decline at a more modest rate in 2016, but the
reduction in consumption will be sharper than the GDP contraction. Although
data are not yet available, it is likely that the sharp reduction in consumption has
reversed the decline in poverty in Russia. Income and consumption are falling be-
hind GDP in many of its neighbors as well, because of the decline in the purchasing
power of remittances. Russia is a major source of remittances for many of these
countries; the decline in GDP there, coupled with the depreciation of the ruble, has
greatly reduced the value of remittance receipts in dollars and in local currencies.

                                     Europe’s export performance is strongly linked to the weakening of the euro
                                 in the wake of quantitative easing by the European Central Bank. In 2015 the
                                 volume of German exports to the United States grew 8.8 times faster than overall
                                 imports into the United States. The same year Germany’s export prices declined
                                 6.4 percent relative to U.S. overall import prices. Over a longer historical period,
                                 the ratio of changes in Germany’s export prices to overall U.S. import prices is
                                 highly correlated with changes in Germany’s market share in the United States
                                 (figure 1.4).
                                     The European Union benefited from two major relative price shifts over the
                                 past year: Lower commodity prices increased the purchasing power of the com-
                                 modity importers, and the weakening of the euro made European producers
                                 more competitive vis-à-vis other manufacturing exporters. These shifts helped
                                 support growth in GDP and consumption, which nevertheless remained slow by
                                 historical standards.
                                     Financial sector indicators imply continuing concern over developments in
                                 Southern Europe, but markets do not appear to anticipate a major shock. Their
                                 stance is roughly consistent with the World Bank’s forecast that growth will re-
                                 main slow in 2016 and slow further in 2017 (table 1.1) but that a major downturn
                                 will be avoided.
                                     Secondary market yields on the bonds of weaker EU countries remain signifi-
                                 cantly higher than yields on German bonds, and the yields on some recently in-
                                 creased (figure 1.5). For example, the secondary market spread on Portuguese
                                 bonds over German bunds increased by roughly 1.5 percentage points between
                                 January and September 2016, to about 3.5 percentage points, reflecting the weak
                                 position of Portugal’s banking system. Greek spreads fell a bit over the past year
                                 but remain at more than 8 percentage points. Bond spreads remain well below
                                 the levels reached earlier in this decade as the euro crisis intensified. Neverthe-
                                 less, spread levels are more differentiated than before the crisis, indicating con-
                                 tinued anxiety over economic developments.

Long-Term Challenges

The forecast of rising growth by 2018 in both the eastern and western parts of the
region masks the very difficult long-term challenges facing ECA and the social
and political tensions these challenges may generate. This section outlines some
structural changes facing ECA, including the necessary adjustment to low com-
modity prices and lower investment rates. It also highlights economic tensions
within the European Union caused by the diverging export performance of sub-
regions. These challenges affect countries within the region differently; the appro-
priate policy responses therefore differ. However, a common thread is that adjust-
ment will require abandoning approaches to economic growth that served a useful
purpose in the old economic environment but are now counterproductive.
   The recent decline in commodity prices is unlikely to be reversed soon. Since 2013
the prices of minerals and nonprecious metals have fallen sharply relative to the
price of manufactures, while the price of crude oil collapsed in the middle of 2014.
   Although the prospects for commodity prices are notoriously uncertain, it is
unlikely that prices will move back to levels seen in 2004–14, when exceptionally
high prices reflected the long-term commodity price cycle. Low prices for oil,
metals, and minerals during the 1990s discouraged investment in exploration
and production as well as in substitutes. Limited investment eventually con-
strained supply, which began to drive sharp increases in prices from around the
turn of the century.

                                   The opposite is now happening, as investments undertaken over the past de-
                                cade are boosting supply and driving down prices. In addition, despite recent
                                declines, commodity prices remain somewhat above the average for 1986–2005
                                (Figure 1.6). With continuing technological innovations in extraction, the substi-

                                Lower Oil and Minerals Prices May Be Here to Stay
                                A long-term shift to lower commodity prices will present a considerable chal-
                                lenge to commodity exporters in the eastern part of the region (World Bank 2015).
                                Sustaining growth in the face of massive terms-of-trade losses will require funda-
                                mental reforms on a range of fronts.
                                   First, commodity exporters are experiencing a real depreciation of the ex-
                                change rate, reversing the appreciation that had been fed by rising export reve-
                                nues and capital inflows. It is imperative that monetary policy accommodate this
                                change through nominal exchange rate devaluation; if it does not, the necessary
                                real devaluation will have to occur through a decline in the price level, a much
                                more painful and protracted affair. This process has begun, but adjustment has
                                been limited in some countries, particularly countries that relied on a nominal
                                exchange rate anchor. Policy makers may have to adopt a different mindset to
                                permit an adequate devaluation.
                                   Second, the precipitous fall in commodity prices threatens to cause a banking
                                crisis in several countries, especially those with delayed policy responses. Banks
                                have experienced sharp declines in the value of their assets. Low commodity

prices have reduced the value of loans to the oil and minerals sectors, while slow
demand growth is impairing the value of loans to the construction sector (essen-
tially a reversal of the Dutch disease that had increased demand for nontradables,
such as housing). In addition, many banks were involved in “connected lending”
that was not profitable. Such lending could be supported when money was freely
available; in the current, more constrained, environment, the low return on these
loans threatens banks’ finances. Several banking systems have seen a sharp rise
in dollar-denominated liabilities, so that the unavoidable exchange rate deprecia-
tion will further impair the solvency of banks and their clients. These issues un-
derline the importance of both urgent steps to prevent a disorderly collapse of
banking systems and reforms to improve bank profitability and redirect lending
to new sectors that are benefiting from devaluation.
    Third, the fall in commodity export receipts has reduced fiscal revenues. Ex-
change rate depreciation should mitigate this decline, as the local currency value
of commodity revenues rises. However, the likely allocation of considerable re-
sources to rescue and restructure insolvent banks will be a further drain on rev-
enues. On balance, a sustainable medium-term fiscal policy in an era of low com-
modity prices will require both a lower level of expenditures and a reallocation
of expenditures to support new economic activities in manufacturing that have
been made more profitable as a result of the devaluation.
    Fourth, it is essential to protect the most vulnerable members of society from
the double-digit declines in household incomes caused by the changes in the
terms of trade or lower remittances. Poor households are much less able than other
households to sustain sudden, large cuts in their incomes. Efficient social protec-
tion is needed to prevent human suffering and the erosion of social cohesion.
    Fifth, and most important, it is essential to support firms in exploiting the new
export opportunities offered by a more competitive environment for manufactures.
Doing so may challenge powerful interests in both government and the private
sector that are used to profiting from the easy availability of funds from commod-
ity exports. The reforms required are far-reaching. They include cutting the cost
and time involved in establishing new firms and entering new markets, reducing
limits on the movement of labor to new activities while maintaining essential
labor protections, and allowing insolvent but well-connected firms to fail.


The Decline in Investment Rates in the European Union
May Be the New Normal
In the years before the financial crisis, booming investment in the EU accession
countries contributed to rapid growth, which was financed by massive capital
inflows and transfers, resulting in large trade deficits. These inflows reflected
expectation of improvements in technological progress and in the rule of law, as
the accession countries adopted EU rules and standards.
   The financial environment is now much more constrained, capital inflows and
transfers to the accession countries have fallen sharply, and these countries’ trade
deficits have largely disappeared. In most countries, since the third quarter of
2015 the trade deficit as a percentage of GDP has been significantly lower (or the
surplus higher) than in the period just before the financial crisis (figure 1.7).

                                The fall in external resources has likely ushered in a long period of low invest-
                            ment rates. Declines in the trade deficit between the year before the financial
                            crisis and the most recent year are highly correlated with reductions in the ratio
                            of investment to GDP (figure 1.8), indicating that an external resource constraint
                            is driving lower investment. It is unlikely that these countries will be able to re-

turn to large borrowing in the near term—and it would probably be unwise for
them to do so. Many countries in the region will need to adjust to a period of
lower investment and slower growth.
    The experience of the accession countries is similar to, albeit less dramatic
than, that of Malaysia after the East Asian financial crisis, when the ratio of in-
vestment to GDP fell from 43 percent in 1997 to 27 percent in 1998 and remained
at or below that level for the next six years. (Figure 1.9 compares Malaysia’s de-
cline in the investment rate following the East Asian crisis with Bulgaria’s follow-
ing the global financial crisis.1) The decline in external resources will require
greater efforts to mobilize domestic savings, a sharper focus on innovation to
improve efficiency, and increased integration with the international economy
(which may require increased capital outflows) to profit from access to foreign
technology and trade ties.


Lack of Convergence May Threaten European Cohesion
Diverging economic performance within the European Union is challenging poli-
cies that were based on a steady increase in convergence. Major progress in
achieving a more unified European economy was made over the past few de-
cades, as the accession countries adopted EU rules, the older European economies
experienced continued price convergence, and local banks became pan-European
banks. These developments involved a continuous, steady increase in integration,
with economic institutions evolving to support a more united Europe.
   At the same time, competitiveness trends within the European Union, as il-
lustrated by export performance, have been diverging sharply. Since 2000 Ger-
man exports roughly followed the same trend as global exports, even during the
global financial crisis (figure 1.10). By contrast, exports from Southern Europe
were well below the global average; at the beginning of 2016, the ratio of Italian
exports to global exports was almost half what it was in 2000.2 Export growth in

reducing interest rates are likely to be ineffective (if potential investors are credit
constrained) or lead to unsustainable borrowing (if credit is freely available). Ex-
pansionary policies to compensate for jobs lost as a result of lower export reve-
nues could limit the exchange rate adjustment required to encourage shifts in
investment and workers to import-competing or noncommodity exporting
sectors.


Job Security Is Falling
Increasing uncertainty over job security is becoming a major challenge across the
region. Although employment in the European Union is now higher than before
the 2008 crisis—largely as a result of a higher female employment rate (World
Bank 2016a)—all of the additional employment has been in the form of tempo-
rary and part-time jobs. Chapter 2 examines this issue, along with other factors
that may be contributing to the rise in political extremism in many countries.

Polarization and Populism



Introduction and Main Messages

Many countries in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) are witnessing significant po-
litical polarization. Increasing numbers of voters appear to be moving away from
centrist positions, abandoning long-held political commitments, and losing faith
in established parties (and to some extent institutions). Examples include the
vote to end Britain’s membership in the European Union; the victory of the Free-
dom Party of Austria (FPÖ) in the first round of the April 2016 presidential elec-
tions, leading to the resignation of the Austrian chancellor; the absence of a
proper government in Spain for almost 250 days; the success of the Swedish
Democrats, who now lead the government in opinion polls; the victory of the
Five Star Movement, which advocates holding a referendum on Italy’s commit-
ment to the euro, in mayoral races in Rome and Turin; and the rising popularity
of Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front in France.
    Political conflict is perhaps more intense in the eastern part of the region,
manifested in violent efforts to change political systems or boundaries. Examples
include the smoldering conflict in Armenia and Azerbaijan, the attempted coup
in Turkey, the conflict in Ukraine, and uneasiness in Central Asian countries,
where political leaders express concerns over the possibility of a local Arab
Spring and social unrest.
    Many issues—including economic difficulties, ethnic rivalries, the refugee cri-
sis, and geopolitical tensions—may be driving political polarization in ECA. The
importance of each varies by country. This chapter focuses on economic prob-
lems, where World Bank research can make the most useful contribution.

                                                                                17

               It first explores whether the anecdotal evidence of increasing political polar-
           ization is supported by hard data. There does appear to have been some shift
           across ECA away from traditional, more centrist political parties, as well as to-
           ward more populist political opinions, since the beginning of this century. How-
           ever, the bulk of votes are still cast for traditional parties, and the trend toward politi-
           cal polarization may have been partially reversed in the most recent years. At the
           same time, survey evidence indicates that the shares of the populations of Eastern,
           Southern, and Central Europe that are strongly dissatisfied with their lives are large
           and rising and a significant share of ECA’s population distrusts major institutions.
               The chapter then considers three potential economic issues that may be associ-
           ated with polarization and declining life satisfaction: rising inequality, slow
           growth since the financial crisis, and structural changes in the labor market.
           Overall trends in inequality do not appear to be the main driver of political po-
           larization and declining life satisfaction in ECA. Current inequality levels are
           higher than they used to be at the fall of the Berlin Wall but, at least for the more
           recent decade, they have not changed much. In fact many countries in the eastern
           part of the region, with the exception of Russia, have experienced reductions of
           inequality. This does not mean that distributional tensions are not a factor behind
           the reduction of subjective wellbeing but simply that changes in an aggregate
           inequality index do not capture a fully accurate and complete picture of the un-
           derlying distributional change.
               Several reasons could explain this. First, surveys often fail to measure capital
           income or to include the richest households, which may understate the level of
           inequality and distort the trend. Second, the summary indicators of inequality
           used in empirical work, notably the Gini coefficient, may not capture complex
           changes in the distribution of income such as, for example, a hollowing of the
           middle class. Third, people often have different attitudes toward inequality stem-
           ming from differences in effort versus unequal opportunities; data on overall
           inequality may not capture the issues people view as critical. Fourth, reactions to
           inequality are based on the perceived level of inequality, which may differ signifi-
           cantly from the level registered in surveys and used in analyses.
               Dissatisfaction with the extended period of slow growth in ECA has likely
           contributed to political polarization. Econometric analysis finds that a decrease
           of 1 percentage point in average GDP growth over the previous four years is as-
           sociated with an increase of 3.1 percentage points in the share of voters for parties
           with a more populist stance. Declining life satisfaction, and perhaps political po-
           larization, may also be related to a decline in economic mobility (or perceptions
           and expectations of mobility).
               Europe is undergoing rapid shifts in the labor market, including the rise in
           temporary and part-time employment, along with a sharp drop in the number of
           jobs involving middle-skilled, routine tasks in favor of low-skilled and high-
           skilled, non-routine tasks. These changes, in part driven by technological prog-
           ress, may have increased uncertainty about job stability and the prospects for
           achieving a middle-class lifestyle, reducing well-being and undermining support
           for the parties in power.

    Further research is critical to understanding the link between these three eco-
nomic issues and the growing dissatisfaction with lives, centrist political parties,
and institutions in ECA. The problems are complex, the data to address some of
these relationships are not available, and the important economic drivers of dis-
satisfaction likely differ by country, as well as by economic and social class within
countries. The purpose of this chapter is to survey some of the research on these
issues, present stylized facts, and highlight potential policy implications.
    Understanding the economic drivers of the rise in populism can make an im-
portant contribution to policy. The literature shows that political polarization has
short- and long-term effects on economic performance. For example, political
polarization tends to increase in the aftermath of financial crises; it may actually
slow the process of recovery, by reducing the chances of adopting economic re-
forms (Funke, Schularick, and Trebesch 2016). Political polarization also matters
in the long run, because it may impair efficiency, make business cycles more pro-
nounced and frequent, and contribute to economic stagnation (Azzimonti 2011;
Azzimonti and Talbert 2014; Binswanger and Oechslin 2015).
    Both theoretical and empirical research are at an early stage. But some tenta-
tive observations for policy can be made based on this preliminary work. In-
equality, at least in the most recent decade, does not seem to have changed much,
however persistently low growth rates have generated less chances of upward
mobility and more insecurity. People perceive this growth process as less inclu-
sive. Thus, transfers designed simply to improve income distribution may there-
fore not address these concerns. Rather, structural policies that increase access to
education, health services, and good jobs—that is, policies that improve the dis-
tribution of opportunities—may be more successful than transfers in improving
both efficiency and equity. Policies should aim to reduce workers’ lack of security
in a rapidly changing job market—by providing retraining and adequate unem-
ployment insurance and ensuring that working part-time or in a temporary job
or becoming unemployed does not mean losing one’s benefits, for example.
    The structure of this chapter is as follows. The next section summarizes evi-
dence of political polarization and the deterioration of perceived well-being in
ECA. The following section considers the impact of changes in inequality, slow
growth, and structural changes in the labor market on these phenomena. The last
section draws some tentative conclusion and suggests lines for future research.



Voting Polarization and Decreasing Subjective Wellbeing:
Two Symptoms of Europe and Central Asia’s Malaise

Self-reported voting patterns reveal an increase in political polarization in Eu-
rope: the share of people who voted for parties at the extremes of the ideological
spectrum increased by more than 20 percentage points between 2002 and 2010
(figure 2.1, panel a). An aggregation of these data using an index of political po-
larization also shows an increase over this period (figure 2.1, panel b), although
all these measures point to a slight decline in polarization between 2012 and 2014.

Source: Own estimates based on the European Social Survey (2002-2014) and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (circa 2002- circa 2014). The polarization
index in panel b is based on Duclos, Esteban, and Ray 2004.
Note: Panel a is based on the European Social Survey, which asks people which party they voted for during the last elections. When this information
was missing, responses to the question “Which political party do you feel closest to?” were used. Data from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES)
were used to assign each party a score from 1 (extreme left) to 10 (extreme right), based on rankings by experts of each party’s overall ideological
stance and its stance on economic issues. The survey reports the average score assigned by experts, which can take any value between 1 and 10.
Panel a shows the percent of voters who voted for parties with ranks of less than 4 or more than 6. The polarization index shown in panel b captures
the existence of a few groups of important size whose members share an attribute and feel some degree of identification with members of their own
group and some degree of hostility toward other groups. It avoids clustering people around discrete ideological ranking intervals. The index ranges
from 0 (no polarization) to 1 (full polarization). The sample of countries includes Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Spain,
Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.




                                           Even if most voters continue to support traditional parties, growing support for
                                           extremist parties is a worrisome trend.
                                              The increase in polarization varied across the region. The share of people who
                                           voted for parties at the extremes of the ideological spectrum rose sharply in
                                           Southern and Central Europe; the increase was smaller in Western Europe; and
                                           the share declined in Northern Europe (figure 2.2).
                                              Along with, and perhaps related to, the rise in political polarization is some
                                           evidence of stagnating well-being and a growing dissatisfaction with institu-
                                           tions. The World Values Survey and the Life in Transition Survey measure these
                                           changes (box 2.1).

        BOX 2.1         Surveys of well-being and dissatisfaction with institutions

        The World Values Survey is a global survey cover-                                          The Life in Transition Survey (LiTS) covers about

        Note:
        a. Its website (www.worldvaluessurvey.org) notes that “the World Values Survey “has over the years demonstrated that people’s
        beliefs play a key role in economic development, the emergence and flourishing of democratic institutions, the rise of gender
        equality, and the extent to which societies have effective government.”

“being overall satisfied” doubled, from about 5 percent to 10 percent.
    A strong indication of the degree of dissatisfaction in the region is the signifi-
cant increase in the share of people expressing strong dissatisfaction with their
job in most ECA subregions between 2005 and 2010 (figure 2.5) Like the changes
in overall life satisfaction, these changes were small in Central Asia, Northern
Europe, Germany, and Central Europe (dissatisfaction actually declined in Cen-
tral Asia and Northern Europe) and much larger in Eastern Europe, Russia, and
the South Caucasus.
    Opinions about policies to improve income distribution also showed polariza-
tion. The LiTS survey asks people to indicate, on a scale from 1 to 10, whether
they believe that incomes should be made more equal (1) or reflect effort more
closely (10). The share of the population with more extreme positions increased
between 2010 and 2015, indicating growing dissatisfaction with the status quo
(figure 2.6).
    The share of the population expressing complete distrust in institutions—
except the armed forces and the police (the most trusted institutions) and govern-
ment—rose between 2010 and 2015 (figure 2.7). Distrust is highest for political
parties, which experienced the largest increase in distrust over the period.



Why Are People in the Region Becoming More
Polarized and Less Satisfied?

Rising inequality, slow growth, and structural changes in the labor market are
three economic issues that may be associated with polarization and declining life
satisfaction. This section discusses some of the literature that considers this associa-
tion, and presents some empirical evidence on it for Europe and Central Asia.

complete distrust, (answer=2) some distrust, (answer=3) neither trust nor distrust, (answer=4) some trust, and (answer=5) complete trust. The left-
hand side panel shows the share of respondents (as a simple average across all countries in LiTS surveys) that choose complete distrust to this
question in 2015 (LiTS III). The right-hand panel shows the changes in the share of respondents that indicated complete distrust for each institution
between 2010 and 2015.

Inequality Is Rising
One hypothesis is that rising income inequality is driving political polarization
and declines or stagnation in satisfaction with life. Higher inequality may in-
crease demand for redistribution (and higher tax rates) because a larger share of
the population feels left behind.2
    In perhaps the best-known contribution to the theory of voting choice and
inequality, Metzler and Richard (1981) argue that the median voter in a country
in which income distribution is unequal—or has become less equal—would have
an income below the mean. Therefore, he or she would have an incentive to vote
in favor of increasing taxation to finance redistribution.
    This model is insightful, but other factors affect attitudes toward income dis-
tribution. For example, people at the lower end of the income distribution may
have expectations of upward mobility that make them prefer less redistribution
(Piketty 1995; Benabou and Ok 2001). Societies in which individual effort is be-
lieved to be the main source of income formation prefer lower taxes and less redis-
tribution (Alesina and Angeletos 2005). Similarly, more complex mechanisms link
inequality and subjective well-being. For example, a specific individual’s life satis-
faction may be more influenced by how incomes of his or her reference group
(friends, peers, neighbors, his or her own income of the past) evolve than by
changes in overall inequality (Clark and D’Ambrosio 2015).
    ECA experienced significant changes in income distribution over the past de-
cade or so. Most of its countries experienced a reduction in the level of income
inequality, with the Gini coefficient declining (figure 2.8). This equalizing trend
was much more pronounced in the eastern part of the region (except Russia).

                                              Inequality fell sharply in some countries in ECA. The Gini coefficient fell
                                           about 10 points in Kazakhstan and Moldova and about 5 points in Ukraine, the
                                           Kyrgyz Republic, Belarus, and Armenia. A 10-point decline in the Gini coefficient
                                           in such a short period of time is equivalent to transforming an income distribu-
                                           tion similar to that of Spain (with a Gini of about 0.36) into a distribution similar
                                           to that of Finland (with a Gini of about 0.26). These large changes may not be
                                           confirmed by a more detailed analysis, as data on income distribution in some of
                                           these countries may not be very reliable, especially for the earlier time periods.
                                              Note also that these trends of stable or decreasing inequality are quite recent
                                           and, when a longer time period is considered, current inequality levels are, for
                                           most countries, quite higher than they used to be at the fall of the Berlin Wall. This
                                           combined with lower mobility, actual or perceived, may actually have led to
                                           lower life satisfaction (more on this below).
                                              The relationship between inequality and well-being during the 2000-2014 pe-
                                           riod was weak. A simple regression of life satisfaction on inequality shows that
                                           the Gini coefficient explains just 5 percent of the cross-country variance of life
                                           satisfaction. Furthermore, the correlation between changes in inequality and
                                           changes in well-being is low (figure 2.9).
                                              The weak link between inequality and well-being is not surprising. In their
                                           reviews of the empirical evidence, Clark, D’Ambrosio (2015) and Ferrer-i-Car-
                                           bonell and Ramos (2014) report that the relationship has been found to be both
                                           positive and negative. This does not mean that distributional change does not
                                           matter for people’s well-being. Rather, the Gini coefficient may not accurately
                                           measure important changes in inequality, or the relationship may be more depen-
                                           dent on perceptions and attitudes than the level of inequality shown by the data.

    Two major measurement problems could affect the relationship between the
Gini and well-being. First, the distribution of income could become more polar-
ized while the Gini coefficient remains constant or even decreases (for a discus-
sion of polarization versus changes in inequality see, for example, Zhang and
Kanbur 2001).
    Second, surveys may not accurately measure inequality, because they include
labor-related income and transfers but do not accurately measure capital income
and normally do not adequately reflect households with very high incomes. As a
result, surveys tend to underestimate inequality and possibly distort trends. For
example, surveys do not show the huge increase in the number of billionaires,
which rose globally from 204 in 1998 to 1,793 in 2015 (statistics obtained from the
Forbes list of billionaires3). The increase in ECA has been one of the highest in the
world, expanding by a factor of more than nine. In some countries, such as Rus-
sia, the number rose by a factor of 88.
    Life satisfaction may also depend more on perceived inequality than actual
inequality, and the two may differ significantly. Perceptions are particularly im-
portant in ECA.4 Sanfey and Teksoz (2007) find that people in transition econo-
mies—where inequality was very low before transition but rose markedly during
and after transition—tend to overestimate the level of income inequality. Even
small increases are noticed and can elicit negative reactions.
    Inequality stemming from differences in effort tends to be viewed as more
acceptable than inequality of opportunity (that is, inequality related to circum-
stances beyond an individual’s control, such as place of birth, parents’ education,
or race). Arampatzi et al (2015) and Hassine, N. (2011) argue that an important
factor which may explain the Arab Spring was the high level of inequality of op-
portunity in countries where (standard) inequality was not very high. (Inequality
had actually fallen before the revolt in Tunisia, where the Arab Spring began.)
    Only a few estimates of inequality of opportunity are available for ECA and
only over short intervals of time (Checchi and others 2015). In Norway from 1985
to 2005 (Almås and others 2010), “unfair” inequality rose while inequality as
measured by the standard Gini fell. If the two types of inequality move in op-
posite directions, or are perceived to do so, then the relationship between in-
equality and well-being could be difficult to detect.
    Poland is an example of how attitudes toward changes in income distribution
were an important determinant of life satisfaction. Grosfeld and Senik (2010)
show that the correlation between life satisfaction and inequality was positive
(and significant) during the transition but negative (and still significant) after
about 1996. They argue that Poles viewed increasing inequality during the transi-
tion period as a positive signal of their potential future higher incomes. Later on,
as opportunities were materializing for only a few people, they viewed inequal-
ity in a more negative light.
    Other attitudes toward inequality affect its relationship with life satisfaction.
For the ECA countries in the 2005 LiTS survey, Cojocaru (2014) finds that “disad-
vantageous inequality” (‘the distance between one’s own income and that of
richer people) is associated with lower life satisfaction. However, “‘advanta-
geous inequality” (the distance between one’s income and the incomes of poorer
people) has no clear relationship with life satisfaction.

                                               One way to measure aggregate perceptions of inequality is to survey views of
                                           the differences between a ’person’s income and the incomes of others. Indeed, if
                                           people were able to accurately assess all the gaps between their income and the
                                           incomes of all others, their subjective perception of aggregate inequality and its
                                           measurement using the actual data would coincide.
                                               LiTS I, II and III ask the following question: “Please imagine a 10-step ladder
                                           where on the bottom, the first step, stand the poorest 10 percent of people in our
                                           country, and on the highest step, the 10th, stand the richest 10 percent. On which
                                           step of the 10 is your household today?” Across ECA countries, the average share
                                           of the population viewing themselves in the fourth to eighth percentile of the
                                           income distribution rose between 2005 and 2010, while the share of people view-
                                           ing themselves in the bottom three percentiles fell (figure 2.10). If every individ-
                                           ual were able to correctly assess his or her position in the distribution, then all ten
                                           steps of the income ladder would have the same share of people, i.e. ten percent
                                           (in figure 2.10 this would correspond to the uniform distribution indicated by the
                                           red line). The results however show that in general there is a bias towards the
                                           middle of the ladder indicating that more people perceive belonging to the mid-
                                           dle deciles than to their real position. This bias towards the middle fluctuates
                                           over time. People in the region became more optimistic during the 2005 to 2010
                                           period, but less optimistic, during the period 2010 to 2015 (figure 2.11).
                                               The experience differs considerably across countries (see the annex). Some
                                           countries (such as Romania) show little difference between the distribution of
                                           ’people’s perceived income relative to others between 2005 and 2015. In others
                                           (such as Slovenia), the share of people perceiving their income to be in the bottom
                                           half increased. Yet other countries (such as Albania) show marked differences

over the period in both high- and low-income categories. Perceived inequality
could thus well have played a role in changes in well-being in some countries.
    It is also likely that people form expectations of how their incomes will evolve
in relation to aggregate change in income and its distribution. Thus, expectations
of growth likely affect the extent of individual satisfaction and commitment to,
as well as trust in, existing institutions and political parties. The next section
discusses the extent to which slow growth since the financial crisis may have af-
fected political polarization and life satisfaction.


Incomes are Stagnant
Poor economic performance—as indicated by high unemployment, declines in
production, financial instability, or high inflation—may undermine confidence in
the ability of mainstream parties to manage the economy and thus increase sup-
port for extremist parties. de Bromhead, A., Eichengreen, B., & O’Rourke, K. H.
(2013) examine how the decline in output during the Great Depression led to the
rise of right-wing political extremism in the 1920s and 1930s. They show that
changes in GDP over a prolonged period rather than the previous year drove the
rise in extremism. The intuition is that societies can withstand one-time shocks
but that continuing bad economic news reinforces negative expectations and
generates a lack of confidence in mainstream parties.
    A similar analysis for today’s European countries finds that the 2009 crisis led
to increased support for populist parties (see Part II).5 A 1 percentage-point de-
crease in average GDP growth over the previous four years is associated with a
3.1 percentage-point increase in the share of votes for populist parties (table 2.1).6

                                          A 1 percentage-point decrease in GDP growth the previous year is linked to a 1.1
                                          percentage-point increase in the share of votes for populist parties. However,
                                          when a dummy variable is included for the period after 2009 to account for
                                          changes in extreme voting caused by other aspects of the deteriorating political
                                          climate of the postcrisis period, the impact of growth over the past year is no
                                          longer significant. In short, it was the long-term deterioration in economic condi-
                                          tions following the crisis that drove the rise in political extremism, not just a one-
                                          year fall in output.
                                             Life satisfaction, and perhaps political polarization, may be more related to
                                          economic mobility, or perceptions of economic mobility, than to GDP growth.
                                          The prospects of becoming richer than average may explain why societies with
                                          high (or increasing) inequality do not necessarily experience a rise in political
                                          polarization or a decline in life satisfaction.7 Cojocaru (2014a) tests the prospects
                                          of upward mobility (PUOM) hypothesis in ECA using the LiTS II survey. He
                                          finds that it is confirmed for EU countries but not for non-EU countries. Lokshin
                                          and Ravallion (2000) find support for it for Russia.
                                             Economic mobility deteriorated following the financial crisis. Many house-
                                          holds in ECA saw their incomes rise above the $10 a day threshold—a threshold
                                          that represents the lower bound of middle-class income (Ferreira et al. 2013)—
                                          during the period of rapid growth (2000–08) (figure 2.12). The number of house-
                                          holds crossing this threshold declined significantly following the 2008/09 finan-
                                          cial crisis, and in some countries poverty rose. In many countries in the eastern
                                          part of the region, upward mobility was strong before the 2008 crisis and dropped
                                          dramatically after 2008.8 In fact, in the more recent period, many people in these
                                          countries experienced downward mobility.
                                             Moreover, perceptions of economic mobility have deteriorated in some ECA
                                          countries since 2010. In some subregions, the share of the population that felt that
                                          their economic circumstances had improved (compared with their parents’ gen-
                                          eration) declined between 2010 and 2015 (figure 2.13, panel a), and the share of
                                          the population that expected their children’s economic circumstances to improve
                                          (compared with their own) fell (panel b). Views of past and future mobility dif-

                                           sus over this period.
                                               Perceptions of lower economic mobility may be associated with lower life
                                           satisfaction. The perception that one’s economic circumstances have deterio-
                                           rated, or that one’s children’s economic circumstances will decline, may be as-
                                           sociated with lower life satisfaction and greater willingness to support radical
                                           changes in policies or political leadership. Rothwell (2016) shows that expecta-
                                           tions of very low (or no) upward mobility are a common characteristic among
                                           supporters of Donald Trump in the United States. In ECA the country averages
                                           for the level of life satisfaction are positively associated with ’people’s expecta-
                                           tions that their children’s incomes will exceed their own. The correlation for 2015
                                           is positive but slightly smaller than for 2010 (figure 2.14). Declines in perceptions
                                           and expectations of economic mobility may be thus contributing to a deteriora-
                                           tion in life satisfaction—and perhaps to support for populism.


                                           The Structure of the Labor Market Is Changing
                                           Poor labor market outcomes could be fueling the increasing dissatisfaction and
                                           polarization of voters across Europe. In the United States, local labor markets that
                                           were more exposed to trade with China experienced both larger declines in man-

low-wage countries substantially increased the share of votes moving to the far
right across French communities and that these effects grew over time. Halla
Wagner, and Zweimüller (2012) find that the inflow of immigrants into a com-
munity increased support for far-right parties in Austria. In Germany, increasing
trade with China and Eastern Europe increased the share of votes for the extreme
right, an effect driven mainly by changes in manufacturing employment (Dippel,
Gold, and Heblich 2015).
   Most European labor markets, however, appear to have fully recovered from
the financial crisis, a fact does not appear consistent with the hypothesis that poor
labor market performance has driven rising political extremism. The share of
working-age people with a job has returned to precrisis levels in Western, North-
ern, and Central Europe (figure 2.15). In Central Europe, employment rates in
2015 exceeded levels before the crisis hit the region. In Turkey and the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, employment rates have risen continuously
since 2009. The only exception to this pattern is Southern Europe, where labor
market recovery began only in 2014; employment rates there remained below
precrisis levels in 2015.
   These aggregate patterns mask important underlying changes in the structure
of ECA’s labor markets. Over the past 10–15 years, many workers shifted from
permanent, full-time jobs to temporary or part-time employment, and technol-
ogy drove massive changes in the share of employees in low-, middle-, and high-
skilled occupations. Such dramatic changes in work arrangements have no doubt
also been accompanied by considerable labor market churning and rising uncer-
tainty over job stability. It is possible that the uncertainty associated with these

                                        changes, rather than poor labor market conditions in the aggregate, are driving
                                        the rise in political extremism and declining life satisfaction.
                                           Except in Northern Europe, an increasing share of employees hold temporary
                                        contracts rather than contracts of unlimited duration. These changes have most
                                        pronounced in Western Europe, Southern Europe, and particularly Central Eu-
                                        rope (figure 2.17). The share of temporary employees in Poland, for example,
                                        increased from 6 percent to 18 percent between 2000 and 2015.
                                            An increasing share of workers hold part-time jobs, especially in Western and
                                        Southern Europe. In some Western European countries, including the Nether-
                                        lands and Switzerland, at least one out of every three workers has a part-time job.
                                        Although part-time work is more prevalent among women, both men and
                                        women have experienced a substantial rise in part-time work since the early

2000s in most subregions. The rise in part-time work is thus not driven by changes
in the gender composition of the labor force or by increasingly flexible work ar-
rangements among women.
    As a result of these changes, the share of workers in traditional employment
relationships (defined as salaried workers with a single full-time, permanent job)
fell in most countries. The decline was steepest in Western Europe (figure 2.18).
The size of the decline in traditional employment was similar for men and women
and among workers of different ages (figure 2.19).

                                                             decrease in demand for workers performing routine tasks.9 ECA experienced a
                                                             larger decline in routine employment than other parts of the world.
                                                                 Some anecdotal evidence suggests that the decline in traditional employment
                                                             has contributed to increasing political polarization. For example, the rise in part-
                                                             time and temporary work was greater in Poland than in many other countries,
                                                             and the most recent elections resulted in the rise of a populist government. These

                                                             sharply in many ECA countries, as shown in figure 2.5.

                                                             work is related to polarization toward the right. Negri (2015) shows that people
                                                             in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries
                                                             holding temporary contracts are more likely than the average person to vote for
                                                             left parties. They are also more likely to be involved in the political process than
                                                             unemployed people. Their support for the left is tied to those parties’ support for
                                                             expansion of the welfare state, not for noncorporatist (that is, more extremist)

pectations of future income, is associated with the unemployment rate and job
quality. The decline in traditional employment reduces expectations for income
and the ability to enter the middle class.
    A large share of the population in ECA views stable and well-paying jobs as
out of reach. Dávalos and others (2016) also find that except in Turkey and more
traditional communities in FYR Macedonia and Central Asia, most families feel
they need at least two full-time employed earners to accumulate enough income
to belong to the middle class. Both the number and the quality of jobs matter. The
lack of good jobs is driving this discontent and the feeling of being “left behind,”
particularly among women and youth, causing discontent to rise in some coun-
tries despite solid rates of economic growth. There is also the perception that
political and social connections are increasingly critical for accessing jobs and
improving ’well-being. Inequality of opportunity is perceived to be increasing,
exacerbating frustration over the decline in traditional employment and middle-
skill occupations.
    There is, then, some evidence linking structural change in the labor market
with political polarization or declines in well-being. Further research is required
to address this issue.



Conclusion

This chapter has framed the analysis of the links between political polarization,
growing mistrust in existing institutions, and rising economic challenges across
ECA. Simple measures summarizing income distribution do not show rising in-
equality. However, life satisfaction, perceived inequality, inequality of opportu-
nity, job security, and economic mobility have deteriorated. At the same time,
long-term economic growth has fallen to historically low levels, and the composi-
tion of demand for skills is changing. Although more detailed analysis at the
country level is required on all of these trends to establish firm causality, the evi-
dence presented suggests that economic anxiety may well be part of the driver of
political anxiety.
    Even the preliminary evidence can provide some broad guidance for policy. If
actual income inequality—in particular inequality stemming for differences in
effort—is not a driver of declining life satisfaction in many countries, then further
redistribution through taxes and transfers is unlikely to greatly improve satisfac-
tion. Rather, measures to ensure equality of opportunity, while boosting overall
growth, could break the current vicious circle of economic and political anxiety.
This points in the direction of more investments in education, health services,
and infrastructure that serve a wide range of people.
    Efforts to retrain workers who lose their jobs, as the international division of
labor changes and new technologies are introduced, and to create new jobs will
reduce the anxiety people experience as job security declines. Rethinking the ar-
chitecture of social protection might be required to adjust to new economic reali-
ties. This could include an enhanced role of the government in life-long learning;
separating eligibility for benefits (including pensions and health insurance) from

           employment; and providing services such as child and elder care, which facilitate
           more flexible employment choices.
               To study further the relation between changes in inequality and political po-
           larization or populism, improved data on inequality is needed, including indica-
           tors of people’s perception of changes in inequality, and measures that differenti-
           ate between inequality of opportunity and inequality as the result of differences
           in efforts. More research is also needed to analyze the links between demand for
           skills and changes in life satisfaction. This research is urgent because policy
           changes are imperative to adjust to important economic changes and to reduce
           social and political anxiety.

           1.	 The unremarkable improvement of 1.2 percent for Latin America and the Caribbean
               should be put in context, as this region’s average level (7.7) is very high.
           2.	 These are not necessarily the policy programs of the populist parties that gain ground
               when there is political polarization.

      zation and Populism

These are tough times for Europe and Central Asia. The Brexit vote and the refugee
crisis are testing the European Union’s internal cohesion. Continued vulnerabilities
in European banking sectors are curbing the economic recovery. Russia, Eastern
Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucuses are still grappling with the consequences of
low oil prices, increasingly compounded by low prices of other commodities. In
Turkey, social and political tensions have increased in the aftermath of the coup
attempt. Moreover, geopolitical frictions in the region further complicate the
challenges.

These turbulent economic times coincide with political polarization and rising
populism. This likely reflects anxiety about unequal opportunities and decreasing
job security, while low secular growth causes more pessimism about prospects.
Coping with the structural challenges outlined above and limiting the rise in
populism will require policies that support adjustment to these new economic
realities while minimizing the pain that such adjustments can cause.
