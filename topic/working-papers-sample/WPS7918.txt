1. The context: Foreign direct investment in Turkey
Under the auspices of international financial institutions, Turkey initiated in the 1980s a successful
case of economic liberalization through export oriented policies (see Botarav and Yeldan, 2001).
Turkey opened its capital account to international flows in 1989 following a slowdown in economic
activity in the late 1980s. Contrary to expectations, foreign direct investment (FDI) remained subdued,
averaging just about 0.4 percent of GDP during the 1990s. On the other hand, portfolio inflows
increased significantly, and their volatility contributed to heightened macroeconomic volatility and to
the crises of 1994 and, especially, 1998-99 and 2001, when the country suffered net portfolio capital
outflows above 2 percent of GDP (Ertuğrul and Selçuk, 2001). This is also a typical outcome for
emerging markets with fixed exchange rates, high inflation and unrestricted capital inflows.

       In the 1990s and early 2000s, and except for India, Turkey lagged significantly behind the rest
of the now called BRICs (large emerging economies) in terms of foreign direct investment attraction,
as shown in Table 1. According to some scholars, domestic inefficiencies, persisting controls, and red-
tape were the reasons behind the struggle to attract foreign direct investment (Celasun et al., 1999),
whereas others blame deficiencies in the design and timing of the economic liberalization approach
(Önis, 1998; Demir, 2004). In addition, macroeconomic instability and inflation have been often
highlighted as significant deterrents of FDI (Erdilek, 2003). Furthermore, the decade of the 1990s was
one of frequently changing political coalitions, which might have also hindered capital flows.

          Net foreign direct investment inflows to Turkey increased to 3 percent of GDP, on average,
in 2005-2008. As envisaged by some authors (Basar and Tosunoglu, 2006), the signaling caused by the
official start of European Union (EU) accession negotiations in 2005 seems to have significantly
helped increase FDI inflows. This is line with other emerging markets, as in Alfaro, Kalemli-Ozcan,
and Volosivych (2008), who show that the most important determinant of FDI is a country’s
institutional quality. It is also worth mentioning the modifications in the legal framework for foreign
direct investment introduced in 2003, as well as increased macroeconomic and political stability as
other contributing factors.

          In the aftermath of the global crisis, FDI inflows to Turkey have dwindled, declining from 2.1
percent of GDP in 2010 to 1.6 percent in 2014, and in spite of the fact that the economy rebounded
quickly from the slowdown in growth experienced in 2009. It is worth noting that this is partly due to
the lower inflows to the financial sector, while FDI into utilities and manufacturing increased
significantly (Table 2). It has been also argued that lower FDI inflows may be affected by slower than
expected progress in the adoption by Turkey of the acquis communautaire, allegedly seen as a proxy of
institutional development, coupled with diminishing prospects of EU membership (Sánchez-Martín,
Escribano, and de Arce, 2015). Concretely, the European Commission (2015), when relating the status
of the Turkey’s membership process, explicitly mentions a deterioration of rule of law, accentuated in
2014, as one of the main challenges going forward. This could potentially hamper FDI inflows in the
future.

          Why is foreign direct investment attraction so vital for developing economies? Contrary to
other capital flows of short term nature, foreign direct investment is believed to be a stable source of


                                                          3
development financing (Wolf, 2005). The composition of capital flows matters (Tong and Wei, 2011),
and for a large open economy such as the Turkish, which presented an average current account deficit
of 7.5 percent of GDP in 2010-2013, counting with long-term foreign investment matters. In addition,
beyond the macroeconomic implications, firm-level evidence for some developing economies points
to the existence of positive productivity spillovers over local suppliers (Javorcik, 2004; Kugler, 2006),
as well as other positive pecuniary and knowledge-related externalities.

        The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, assessing whether foreign direct investment in
Turkey has contributed to growth by generating the micro-level externalities; second, if that is the
case, empirically identifying significant driving factors for foreign direct investment, in order to help
understand the reasons for Turkey´s limited success in attracting inflows, and propose ways to increase
the appeal to foreign investors.

        The rest of the paper is structured as follows: section two presents firm-level evidence of the
impact of FDI on productivity in Turkey; section three presents a cross country approach to the
determinants of FDI attraction in Eastern Europe and Turkey; section four draws policy implications
for Turkish policy makers; and section five concludes.



2. FDI and Growth in Turkey: Evidence from Firm Level Data
        In order to respond to the question on the impact of foreign direct investment on growth, we
examine whether multinational firms increased the productivity of Turkish firms who received FDI
between 2005 and 2012. We also analyze how this affects the productivity of domestic firms operating
in the same or different sectors than the foreign affiliates of the multinationals.

    2.1. Data and empirical approach
        Our data come from the ORBIS database (also known as AMADEUS for European countries)
which is compiled by Bureau van Dijk Electronic Publishing (BvD). It covers 60 countries worldwide,
including both developed and emerging countries. ORBIS has financial accounting information from
detailed harmonized balance sheets and profit and loss accounts of all companies. In terms of
coverage, the database is crucially different from the other data sets that are commonly used in the
literature, such as Compustat (for the United States), Compustat Global, and Worldscope databases,
in that 99 percent of the companies in ORBIS are private, whereas the data sets mentioned contain
information mainly on large listed companies. A fundamental advantage of our data is the detailed

                                                    4
ownership information, encompassing over 30 million “links” between companies and their
shareholders. For each target/affiliate/subsidiary company we know the amount of foreign
investment in company stock, together with the country of origin of the investor.

           We have 7,000+ unique firms over the period 2005 to 2012, amounting to 35,000+
observations. FDI represents 3 to 4 percent of these firms receiving foreign investment, which is a
typical average number in Europe (much higher in Latin American countries). The econometric
analysis is based on the work by Fons-Rosen, Kalemli-Ozcan, Sorensen, Volosovych, and Villegas-
Sanchez (2014).

           Two well-known findings in the literature are that multinational subsidiaries generally
outperform domestic firms and the most prevalent form of multinational entry is through acquisition,
rather than greenfield investment. These facts suggest that the superior performance of companies
receiving FDI could be due to multinationals selecting domestic firms which a priori were better
performing. It is not straightforward then to gauge how much of the correlation between ownership
and productivity is due to selection and how much due to active improvements caused by, say,
transfers of superior technologies and organizational practices to foreign subsidiaries. We try to
address both sides of this issue. The focus on the manufacturing sector allows us to compare results
with those in the existing literature.

           Both labor productivity and total factor productivity are computed. Labor productivity is
defined as value added to labor ratio, log (VA/L , ). We construct TFP as the residual from a Cobb-
Douglas production function with capital and labor: log (TFP , ) = log (Y , − M , ) − α log (L , ) −
α log (K , ), where the coefficients are estimated by the method of Woolridge (2009) that improved
upon Olley and Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and Petrin (2003), as explained in detail in Fons-Rosen
et al. (2014). Y is output (operating revenue or sales), M is materials, K is capital (fixed tangible assets)
and L is labor.

      2.2. Which firms are foreign-owned in Turkey?
           In this analysis, we apply the standard OECD definition of FDI: “a direct investment
enterprise is an incorporated or unincorporated enterprise in which a single foreign investor either
owns 10 per cent or more of the ordinary shares or voting power of an enterprise […]”.5 Prior to

assessing what is the effect of foreign investment on firm level productivity, a probit regression is run
to understand which domestic firms receive foreign investment in the first place, i.e., firm-level
determinants of foreign investment. This is presented in the following equation,



                    FO ,   =       FO ,       +        log       /       ,         +   log     /   ,     +   log            ,

        + 	                    ,          +   AGE , +        	           ,   +∅ +      ,           (1)



where i represents each firm, and t the time. To measure firm productivity, we use log (VA/L                            ,       ,
and log (TFP    ,      . We find that the only significant predictor of foreign investment is firm and sector
productivity—when we replace sector-year fixed effects, ∅                                  with sector level productivity—in
addition to lagged foreign investment signaling a reputation effect or long term investment effect. All
other determinants are insignificant, meaning size or age or capital intensity or being in a certain sector
does not influence the investment decision. The key determinant of foreign investment is whether the
sector that the firm is operating in is growing (in terms of output), and whether the firm identified by
the foreign investor is productive and growing.

          It is important to take into account this selection result (which is a typical finding in the
literature for other emerging markets) in the analysis presented below, on the impact of FDI on
productivity. Otherwise, we would not be able to tell whether a positive correlation between FDI and
productivity is due to the fact that foreign firms pick productive firms, or because the arrival of foreign
capital increases the productivity of the subsidiary once it receives the investment. Hence, we opt for
dynamic lagged difference regressions to leave aside this cherry picking effect.

    2.3. Do Foreign-Owned Firms Become More Productive After Receiving FDI?
          We ask whether foreign-owned firms become more productive with increased foreign
ownership; that is, we estimate dynamic relations with foreign ownership growth and productivity
growth.

          We estimate the growth in TFP on the change in FO, experimenting with the length of the
growth interval. We estimate the following equation:



                    ∆ log	 TFP ,   ,          ∆ FO ,   ,     δ   ,   +       , ,                       (2)

                                                                     6
where TFP ,   ,   refers to total factor productivity of firm i, in sector s, at time t, and FO ,   ,   is the
percentage of firm i’s capital owned by foreign investors at time t. δ   ,   represents sector-year dummies.
The lag-length k takes values between one and four; i.e., ∆       is     -     .

         The parameter of interest is the “within” coefficient, : a positive         implies that changes in
foreign ownership are associated with increasing productivity relative to firms that stay domestically
owned.

         Table 3 examines the relationship between growth in foreign ownership and growth in firm
total factor productivity in the manufacturing sector. As we have been emphasizing, accounting for
firm selection is crucial and after differencing, all specifications in Table 3 are free of firm-specific
time invariant effects.

         Columns (1) to (4) of Table 3 show the results for different time horizons. An increase in
foreign ownership does not have an immediate impact on productivity— only after four years is there
a positive and statistically significant relationship between foreign ownership and firm productivity.
The point estimate for the four year differencing is significant at the 1 percent level and implies that a
100 percent increase in foreign ownership is associated with a 1.1 percent increase in firm productivity,
so a small effect.

opposed to the foreign ownership of more than 10% threshold we used in the previous table. As can
be seen, results are very similar, though the economic impact is a little bigger.6 The positive
productivity effects are still realized after four years. This effect is a typical finding in the literature of
effects of FDI on firm productivity. As has been found for Latvia, Lithuania, and Spain by others, and
also for other Eastern European countries by Fons-Rosen et al. (2014), in general it takes 3-5 years to
realize potential benefits of FDI. This is as expected if FDI is bringing technology and knowhow.
Hence, Turkey is not different from other emerging markets in this regard. The reason why the

         All these regressions are estimated by feasible Generalized Least Squares (GLS). There is a
large difference in the variance of the error terms across firms, so GLS is more efficient. We do this
in two steps: first OLS estimation, and then we use residuals from the OLS estimation to calculate
firm-specific standard errors which we then use to weight observations in the second step.

         In spite of the firm level heterogeneity, sectors are not that different in terms of delivering this
result. All our regressions in Table 1 and Table 3 have sector fixed effects and the last columns have
sector-year fixed effects (both at 2 and 4 digit sectors). It is clear that the results of last two columns
in both tables are very similar. To test the sectoral heterogeneity hypothesis further, we interact FDI

with sector dummies. This exercise yields an insignificant result and hence we are not reporting it.
This means that the effect is similar across sectors. Recall that we are working with four-digit sectors
within manufacturing so this result is expected. If we worked with sectors like construction, services
or agriculture, then the results might differ. Even when the bulk of foreign investment in Turkey is in
services, we focus exclusively on the manufacturing sector, where the calculation of firm level
productivity is more accurate, as it benefits from correct measurement of capital and materials, and
the results are comparable across countries.

        Table 5 runs similar regressions as above but this time using log employment as the dependent
variable. As we can see, there is an initial increase in employment but after four years this effect turns
negative. This may mean that domestic content requirements imposed on multinationals upon arrival,
in terms of hiring local workers, would vanish after the fourth year. This is not surprising since the
four-year mark is also when productivity starts improving. Clearly, efficient use of labor explains part

results.

    2.4. Spillover Effects to Domestic Firms
           Studies on FDI spillovers in emerging markets (horizontal and vertical) typically rely on a two-
digit industry classification (see, for instance, Javorcik, 2004). Following Fons-Rosen et al. (2014), we
define horizontal “competition spillovers” at the four-digit classification for each country:
                                                     ∑∈               ,   	
                                     	          ,     ∑∈
                                                                               ,                     (3)
                                                                  	

where s4 refers to an index for each specific sector, at the four-digit sector classification. We construct
the variable for “knowledge spillovers:”
                                               ∑∈         ,   	               ∑∈        ,   	
                                 	        ,     ∑∈                             ∑∈
                                                                                                ,   (4)
                                                      	                             	

           The knowledge spillover variable captures foreign presence in the same two-digit sector,
excluding output produced by foreign-owned companies in its own four-digit sector. For example, if
a foreign-owned company is a car manufacturer (four-digit sector classification), other car
manufactures could be negatively affected by competition spillovers. On the other hand, it is possible
that manufactures of electrical and electronic equipment for motor vehicles (classification would
establish a business relationship with the company leading to knowledge transfers but not competition.
In the literature for vertical linkages and spillovers, the relevant linkage is based on input-output tables
at two digits.

           Traditionally, the empirical literature has found positive horizontal productivity spillovers in
developed countries and negative productivity spillovers in developing countries. Fons-Rosen et al.
(2014) show that negative productivity spillovers in developing countries are driven by competition
effects in broadly defined sectors and there can still be knowledge spillovers in narrowly defined
sectors where firms are not in direct competition.

           Columns (1) and (2) in Table 6 reveal a negative and significant effect of foreign owned
companies in terms of competition spillovers, meaning in the same four-digit sector, where the latter
column uses two digit sector-year effects to control for the fact that FDI will be attracted to high
productivity sectors. The negative effect is expected from a direct competition explanation, as local
companies would be expected to suffer from the entry in the market of a foreign direct competitor;


                                                     11
nonetheless, the empirical evidence on the existence of this effect is mixed (Javorcik and Spatareanu,
2005). We expect competition effects to be dominant within the same four-digit sector classification,
while potential technology and knowledge transfers might come from foreign presence in the same
two-digit sector.

    Notes: Estimation performed by Generalized Least Squares (GLS) where weights are the square root of the firm mean
    squared predicted residuals. Standard errors clustered at the corresponding level specified in the table are reported in
    parentheses. Results are obtained based on the sample of firms with no foreign ownership (i.e., firms that were never
    acquired (in any percentage) by a foreign-owned investor over the period of analysis). The dependent variable is the log
    of total factor productivity which is computed following Wooldridge-Levinsohn-Petrin methodology (WLP). See the
    text for the information on the construction of spillover variables.


            Once we focus on effects within the thinner four-digit sector classification, where
multinationals operate in the same two-digit but different four-digit sectors, we find negative
competition effects and positive and significant knowledge spillovers. The point estimates suggest
that, if the foreign presence in your same four digit sector doubles, you, as a domestic firm, have 1.5
percent lower productivity due to competition and business stealing effects. But if you are a domestic
firm in the same two-digit sector but different four-digit sector than the foreigners, your productivity
would be boosted by up to 20 percent.7 Columns (3) and (4) show similar results when we use a sample
of continuing firms and do not allow for entry and exit.



7
  It is worth noting that the spillover variables are average foreign ownership shares, i.e., they are between 0 and 1.
Thus, productivity would be boosted by 20 percent only when average FO rises from 0 to 100%--not when it doubles
from, say, 5% to 10%. In that case, productivity gains could be smaller.

                                                              12
        As shown by Fons-Rosen et al. (2014), the competition spillover is negative both for
developed countries in Europe and transition economies of Eastern Europe. The coefficient estimate
is -0.03 for developed countries and -0.08 for emerging Europe. The coefficient for Turkey is -0.015,
which is a much less negative. For the knowledge spillover the coefficient for developed Europe is
0.020 (a much smaller positive than Turkey) and the coefficient for emerging Europe is negative at -
0.078. Hence Turkey is unique among its neighboring countries in terms of getting full knowledge
spillovers from FDI for domestic firms that are not in direct competition with the multinationals. The
reason for this, we suspect, is that Turkey is farther behind in terms of technological frontier and best
business practices and the domestic firms truly benefit from the close business relationships with
multinationals.

        Summarizing, we show that FDI has positive productivity effects on firms that receive the
investment only after 4 years. This is a result typically found for other emerging market countries like
Turkey in the literature since it takes time for such countries to transfer the technology and knowhow.
Moreover, we find that knowledge spillovers are positive and big in Turkey in spite of the negative
competition spillovers. The latter effect is a typical result for emerging markets but the former is not.
In general spillovers are positive only if they are vertical in emerging markets, meaning in downstream
and upstream industries. Here even within the same industry if you are not a direct competitor with
the multinationals you, as a domestic firm, benefit from multinational existence in your broad sector.
This may have to do with the fact that Turkey still is behind in terms of management practices and
technology and knowhow and can benefit a lot from FDI when domestic firms are not competing
with foreign owned firms directly in the production of the final good.

        Finally, it is worth mentioning that we have a full set of time dummies in our regressions and
the coefficients on time dummies (although not reported) are also important, since they become
negative after 2009, pointing to the fact that there were some FDI liquidation outflows in Turkey. In
the next section, we explore the determinants for foreign direct investment attraction, to try to
understand which factors may have influenced the slowdown in FDI attraction in Turkey, and how
the situation could be corrected. Given the potential for large knowledge spillovers evidenced by firm
level data analysis, there are reasons to encourage foreign direct investment attraction in Turkey.

3. How to attract more foreign investment? A cross country
   approach to the determinants of FDI


    3.1. An eclectic empirical approach to the determinants of FDI
This section revisits the determinants of foreign direct investment in Eastern Europe and Turkey by
adopting the cross country analytical framework proposed by Sánchez-Martín et al. (2014). This
empirical approach combines different theories concerning foreign direct investment to identify
relevant variables to be included in panel data regressions.
        According to Dunning (1998), developer of the so-called eclectic Ownership-Location-
Internalization (OLI) paradigm, beyond firm-specific determinants, labor endowments and location-
bound factors play an important role in multinational decisions to invest. Thus, the empirical model
incorporates enrollment in tertiary education and telephone and mobile phone lines per capita available from the
World Development Indicator database of the World Bank (2015), as proxies for human capital and
telecommunications infrastructure, respectively. The first is expected to influence foreign direct
investment attraction, especially for companies requiring a skilled labor force, whereas the penetration
of telecommunications would benefit all multinationals by lowering costs and improving business
competitiveness.
        Drawing from the OLI paradigm, the Knowledge-Capital Model (Markusen and Maskus,
1999) allows for multiple production facilities, separating cross-support centralized services and
disperse production in some multinationals. This approach distinguishes three types of FDI depending
on the motivation: export-oriented (vertical), market seeking (horizontal), and resource seeking. The
empirical framework presented in this paper incorporates GDP per capita growth as proxy for market
expansion. It has been found to be one the most robust determinants of horizontal FDI inflow
attraction in econometric studies (Artige and Nicolini, 2005). It also includes the level of trade openness,
defined as the sum of exports and imports as a percentage of GDP, as this would signal economies
that are “international trade friendly”, which would positively contribute to vertical FDI attraction.
Nonetheless, it is worth noticing that this macro-level cross country analysis does not explicitly
distinguish between horizontal and vertical FDI inflows.
        In addition, other macroeconomic and country risk variables, such as inflation, a typical proxy
for macroeconomic stability (Buch and Lipponer,2004), an exchange rate stability index, an economic risk
rating and a financial risk rating are also included as potential determinants of foreign direct investment,

                                                      14
following the empirical literature (e.g. Asiedu, 2002). Note that for the three latter variables, a higher
value corresponds to a lower risk. High levels of inflation, exchange rate instability generating currency
mismatches, and macroeconomic and financial uncertainty indicating the likelihood of eventual crises
are all expected to have negative effects on foreign direct investment attraction.
        Aside from endowments, location-bound, and macroeconomic variables, institutions are
widely considered to matter for foreign direct investment attraction. For example, as argued by Rodrik,
Subramanian, and Trebbi (2004:21), the presence of clear property rights for investors is a key, if not
the key, element in the institutional environment that shapes economic performance. A country in
which investors believe their property rights are safe would thus be more likely to attract FDI as shown
for the first time by Alfaro, Kalemli-Ozcan and Volosovych (2008) and then by others.
        Therefore, as discussed in more detail in Sánchez-Martín et al. (2014), the proposed empirical
approach pays special attention to institutional variables and introduces a series of institutional indexes
elaborated by the PRS Risk Group (International Country Risk Guide), such as control of corruption, rule
of law, government stability, bureaucracy quality, and investment profile (see table with definitions in the Annex).
In principle, it would be expected that the higher a country rates in these institutional dimensions, the
larger FDI inflows that country would be receiving. Higher control of corruption (less likelihood of
patronage, nepotism…) is expected to result in larger FDI inflows, according to the so called
“grabbing hand” hypothesis by Egger and Winner, 2006. A law and order index, composed of an
assessment of the strength and impartiality of the legal system and an assessment of the popular
observance of law, is also included in the analysis, and expected to be a key factor for FDI attraction.
The government stability variable, a valuation of the government’s ability to carry out its electoral program
and its ability to stay in office, could be expected to positively contribute to foreign direct investment
attraction, although empirical evidence is mixed (Asiedu, 2002). The quality of bureaucracy is believed to
foster foreign direct investment attraction in the sense that it entails lower administrative hurdles and
enhanced policy implementation. Finally, investment profile, measuring the likelihood of expropriation,
obstacles to profit repatriation, payment delays and risks posed to contract viability is also expected
to present a positive sign, given that the higher the rating the lesser the direct obstacles to investment
are.
        Given the nature of our sample – mostly composed of Eastern European countries during the
post-communist era- it is important to add control variables for the important economic
transformation these economies have been through. Thus, in order to take into account the recent
conversion of Eastern European economies to the capitalist economic system, the cross country

analysis presented in this paper introduces a series of transition indexes elaborated by the European
Reconstruction and Development Bank. First, price liberalization allows multinationals to have control
of price-setting decisions by subsidiaries, thus allowing them to fully reap profits that would not be
possible in a centralized economy. Second, a competition policy variable is included, although the expected
effect on FDI is ambiguous: lower competition in the host economy may mean larger potential gains
for a foreign subsidiary that is established; at the same time, a less developed competition policy may
imply that the subsidiary faces an established oligopoly that constrains its ability to operate. Third,
privatization processes associated with economic transition are an opportunity for foreign investors,
and positively influence FDI (Mukherjee and Suetrong, 2009).
        Regional integration processes are alleged to have a positive impact on foreign direct
investment attraction (Kokko and Gustavsson, 2004), although testing this hypothesis runs against
numerous empirical challenges. Drawing from previous analytical studies trying to measure the impact
of regional integration on FDI, and in spite of the limitations of this approach, we introduce two
dummy variables: one capturing accession negotiations with the EU and the second one capturing EU
membership (Cartensen, 2004; Gungor and Binatli, 2010; Esiyok, 2011).


        Finally, as discussed in Sánchez-Martín et al. (2014), investment decisions in a certain moment
may be related to the signaling role provided by the existing level of foreign investment in a country,
given that risk-averse investors may be more prone to invest in economies with a greater foreign
presence. Nevertheless, given that this study focuses on the institutional and policy related
determinants of FDI, we decide to not include this variable in the reported regressions, as the FDI
stock is also determined by similar factors to FDI inflows. Results with the stock of FDI considered
as an independent variable are nonetheless included in the Annex.
         

    3.2. Cross-country regression results on the determinants of FDI


        The empirical analysis in this study is based on a sample made up of 16 countries, essentially
from Eastern and Central Europe8 and Turkey, over the 1999-2013 period. The relationship between
FDI inflows and its determinants is estimated by regressing the following equation,

 Countries included are Albania, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,
Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Turkey, and Ukraine.

where the dependent variable, yearly FDI inflows as a percentage of GDP (                       ),9 is modeled as a
function of a series of location-related, macroeconomic, institutional, and transition-related
determinants (       , as discussed before. We include country fixed effects ( ,) in all the specifications
in order to control for unobserved country specificities. The error term is represented by                   .
        In addition, the equation laid out above was estimated using an alternative method of random
effects. Although the results are remarkably similar across both specification, the Hausman test
confirms in most cases that estimation under fixed effects is preferred to random effects (as the latter
estimator turns out to be inconsistent).

  FDI inflows (% GDP) come from the UNCTAD database, and are defined as follows: “For associates and
subsidiaries, FDI flows consist of the net sales of shares and loans (including non-cash acquisitions made against
equipment, manufacturing rights, etc.) to the parent company plus the parent firm´s share of the affiliate´s reinvested
earnings plus total net intra-company loans (short- and long-term) provided by the parent company. For branches, FDI
flows consist of the increase in reinvested earnings plus the net increase in funds received from the foreign direct
investor”.


                                                          17
        We also conduct a series of co-integration tests prior to performing cross country regressions,
in order to avoid potential distortions caused by the inclusion of non-stationary variables. The panel
data co-integration test developed by Levin, Lin and Chu (2002) and Im-Pesaran-Shin (2003) applied
in this paper subtracts cross-sectional means within the panel, in order to mitigate propensity towards
rejection of the null caused by the existence of cross-section dependencies (Gengenbach, Palm, and
Urbain, 2010.) The results of the test revealed that all the variables are stationary except trade
openness, and the proxies for infrastructure and human capital (Table 7). Therefore, in order to
prevent potential issues, these variables are included in the regression in first difference, which after
transformation does not present a unit root.
        Regression results are displayed in Table 8. Overall, the panel is fairly balanced, despite the
lack of data for the EBRD transition index for the Czech Republic, and the unavailability of data for
the same index in 2013 resulting in the loss of about 30 observations. Regressions (1) to (4) consider
the effects of macroeconomic variables (1), to which country risk variables and education and
infrastructure are incorporated (2 and 3), together with variables accounting for the economic
transition process (4). Specifications (5) to (8) follow the same pattern, but with institutional variables
instead of macroeconomic indicators. A caveat to acknowledge is that the fact that a series of
significant determinants of foreign direct investment have been identified in cross-country regressions
does not imply the causality of the results presented in this section.
        On the macroeconomic side, the results suggest that GDP growth, a proxy for market growth
rate, is the only variable that seems to be significantly and positively affecting FDI inflows.
Nonetheless, the effect seems to vanish as more variables are included, most likely because they are
also associated with higher GDP growth. Other macroeconomic variables such as trade openness and
inflation do not seem to have played a significant role on foreign investors’ decisions over 1999-2013,
although the coefficient of exchange rate stability becomes significant once we incorporate
institutional variables. The relatively small role apparently played by macroeconomic fundamentals
goes against our expectation, but may be explained by the fact that FDI decisions consider a large
range of factors simultaneously. Furthermore, investment decisions under high macroeconomic
uncertainty contexts, such as those occurring during a period of economic transition, may require
more time to consider the environment as stable and hence be pushed back to later – which makes it
difficult to capture their effects under this setting (Trevino et al., 2002). Similarly, the estimation results
show that human capital, proxied by enrollment in tertiary education does not appear to influence
FDI inflows. This suggests that most foreign investors in Eastern Europe were not seeking a highly

It could be argued that there could be “endogeneity” associated to this variable, especially considering
that Turkey has experienced large FDI inflows into this sector since 2005. However, this proxy
variable is not directly associated to the amount of FDI in communications (coming to Turkey to buy
the physical and intangible assets). Second, mobile and fixed phone subscriptions in Turkey have
grown steadily from 1999 through 2008; thus, the process had already began before the 2005-2008
FDI inflow boom. Third, it is worth considering that Turkey is only one of the 16 countries of which
the sample is made.
        Furthermore, in order to ensure that the results are robust to alternative specification, and do
not suffer from major simultaneity problems, we have performed alternative Generalized Method of
Moments estimation following Arellano and Bond (1991), which produces very similar results to those
presented in our original econometric specification. Lastly, dropping the infrastructure proxy does not
qualitatively affects the results either.
        Moving to the institutional variables, the results point to a large positive and significant
relationship between FDI inflows and ‘law and order’. This is in line with our expectations that the
enforcement of the law is a key determinant of foreign investors’ decisions. Government stability and
its capacity to implement programs and reforms also appear to have positive and significant impact
on the attraction of FDI. Other institutional and political variables such as corruption control,
bureaucracy quality and investment profile do not seem to attract more FDI as they improve over
time. This may be because they are intimately related with the improvement of other institutional
factors and relate closely to the general level of development of an economy.
        Transition variables are essential control variables in this group of countries, but they seem to
have played a mixed role in fostering FDI. Indeed, on the one hand, the quality of competition policy
and the progress in price liberalization have not contributed to attract FDI and, to the contrary
regression (8) suggests that better competition rules and price liberalization could have deterred FDI
inflows when macroeconomic fundamentals are not controlled for, although the results are barely
significant. On the other hand, large scale privatization is positively and significantly associated with
larger FDI inflows, confirming that a higher degree of privatization provides investment opportunities
that are related to competition effects or first-mover advantage seekers (Bellak and Leibrecht, 2011).
        The regression results displayed in Table 9 offer a comparison of three specifications
summarizing the previous results, using respectively country fixed effects, country fixed effects and




                                                   20
control for EU accession/negotiations, and country and time fixed effects as robustness checks.10
Overall, these results, based on a more selective set of variables, reinforce the conclusion from
equations (1) to (8): law and order and phone lines are strongly significant across all specifications.
        Equations (12) to (14) provide interesting insights about the role of EU accession prospects
in attracting FDI. Indeed, the EU negotiation dummy has a positive and significant coefficient in most
of the regression results, backing up the argument that accession talks tend to matter more than formal
accession in driving investor appetite for investment in one country.
        Furthermore, exchange rate risk becomes a significant factor of FDI inflows when one does
not control for EU candidacy or time fixed effects, suggesting that the prospect for EU accession may
have played a role in anchoring exchange rate stability expectations. This result is in line with Bevan
and Estrin (2004) who argue that foreign investors viewed the prospects for EU memberships in
Eastern Europe as a positive signal regarding the quality of macroeconomic management, political
stability and institution quality because EU accession implies the compliance with strong requirements.
Similarly, large scale privatization appears to be strongly significant when EU accession dummies are
not included.




10 Other robustness checks have been carried out. Overall, after smoothing the series with 3 years moving
average and logarithm transformations respectively, the results remain vastly unchanged. A crisis dummy was
also included, and did not suggest that a break in the series occurred after the crisis erupted.

4. Policy implications for Turkey
As discussed in section 2, Turkey traditionally struggled to attract foreign direct investment, until the
country saw a change in fortune in 2005. As discussed in more detail in Sánchez-Martín et al. (2014),
the jump in FDI inflows observed in 2005-08 is likely to have to do with the signaling caused by the
official launch of EU accession negotiations, among other factors. This seems to be corroborated by
the significant coefficient of the EU membership dummy variable present in the cross-country
empirical analysis conducted for this paper.
       However, in the context of the international economic crisis and the crunch in Southern EU
members, starting in 2009, foreign direct investment slowed down. Net FDI inflows to Turkey halved
to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2009-2013, from 3 percent of GDP in 2005-2008. This compares to a
regional median for countries in Eastern Europe of 3 and 6.2 percent of GDP, respectively, over the
same periods. Interestingly, other developing countries (e.g. large Latin American economies) have
not experienced a significant decline in FDI inflows over the past five years, which seems to suggest
that new EU member countries and other economies with strong ties with the European Union may
be suffering from the convulsed economic and political situation traditional investor or partner
countries are going through.
       In the case of Turkey, EU27 originated FDI inflows decreased from a value of close to US$14
billion in 2006-08 to roughly US$5.5 billion in 2009-10. Foreign direct investment inflows after the
2009 crisis have been mainly sustained thanks to capital accruing to the energy and utilities sector in a
context of liberalization. The empirical analysis has shown that in fact privatization seems to have
played a significant role in FDI attraction in Eastern European countries. However, as privatization and
liberalization processes in Turkey are completed in most sectors, this will no longer be a driving force
for FDI inflows.
       Drawing from the cross-country empirical results presented in the previous section, we try to
understand which other factors, apart from the EU crisis and low-spirited prospects for EU accession,
may have contributed to the slowdown in FDI inflows to Turkey. We also discuss which policies could
be designed to try to correct this trend. This is especially important for the economic development of
Turkey, as we have found empirical firm-level evidence pointing to a large and positive contribution
of FDI to the productivity of local companies through knowledge spillovers.
       Firstly, cross-country regressions identify the existing stock of FDI in a given country as a
significant determinant of FDI inflows, since there seem to be some sort of agglomeration and/or


                                                   23
 


signaling effects. Turkey’s level of net stock of FDI (20 percent of GDP) is significantly lower than
the average level of stock in other Eastern European countries (50 percent of GDP). This may help
partly explain significantly smaller FDI inflows to Turkey, a country that may not be perceived as a
cradle for long term investment.
        Second, foreign direct investment attraction is found to be negatively affected by exchange
rate risk. It may be argued that, by introducing macro-prudential measures to mitigate exchange rate
variability caused by volatile capital flows, Turkey would gain attractiveness for long term foreign direct
investment attraction. Some macro-prudential measures are already under implementation (see
Fendoglu, Kilinc, and Yörükoglu, 2014).

        Another significant determinant of foreign direct investment is the proxy for telecommunications
infrastructure. Data from the World Development Indicators suggests that the penetration of mobile
and fixed lines in Turkey, very fast until 2008, has stagnated, as shown in Figure 2. This implies an
expansion in the phone line subscriptions gap with respect to new EU members, which could also
suggest slower technology adoption. Public policies aimed at fostering the penetration of
telecommunications at competitive rates could be helpful in terms of foreign direct investment
attraction. Public investment in other types of infrastructure (e.g. roads, ports) not included in our
econometric analysis, may also contribute to the arrival of foreign multinationals.

       A third opportunity for Turkey to increase its appeal to foreign investors would imply
strengthening institutions. The cross-country econometric analysis presented in the previous section
suggests that, over the past two decades, government stability and law and order have been key
determinants of foreign direct investment in Eastern European countries. The International Country
Risk Guide government stability index, composed of measures of government unity, legislative strength
and popular support, has been in Turkey higher than the regional average. This reflects the political
stability the country has enjoyed under the Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi era, inaugurated in 2001, which
may have arguably helped increasing FDI inflows.
       On the other hand, however, Turkey has traditionally underperformed in terms of law and order,
understood as a product of the strength and impartiality of the legal system and the popular
observance of the law. The law and order index for Turkey declined starting in 2011, in a context of a
series of controversial judiciary system reforms, which may have undermined the separation of power
in the country. It could be argued that these institutional indexes cannot per se reflect the complex and
varied nature of institutions across the world (e.g. think of China). Nevertheless, in the same way that
sovereign risk ratings by credit agencies influence investment decisions (even if they may present
caveats), international investors do take these institutional indexes into consideration when deciding
among a few countries in the same region to host their subsidiaries. Thus, any action taken by the
Turkish authorities to correct the perceived deterioration in law and order would be likely to help
enhance FDI attraction.

                      It is also worth mentioning the investment profile variable included in the analysis, which reflects
contract viability (expropriation risk), profit repatriation policies, and likelihood of payment delays.
The coefficient for this variable is only significant when macroeconomic variables are not included in
the analysis (see specification 6), probably because strong institutions tend to come hand in hand with
better macroeconomic management. Interestingly, in Latin America and the Caribbean, over the
period 1991-2010, the investment profile was the most significant variable for foreign direct
investment attraction, while law and order was not (see Sánchez-Martín et al., 2014). Countries in
which there had been notable cases of expropriation during the past decade (República Bolivariana de
Venezuela, Argentina, Bolivia) saw their FDI inflows sharply decline. As reflected in section 3, the
fact that Turkey at the moment not only seems to lag behind in terms of rule of law, but also in terms
of protection of investors, suggested that it may just be the other side of the same coin. Thus,
strengthening the investor protection framework could potentially help reap some FDI gains, although
in this case the empirical evidence is mixed.


                      Finally, as evidenced by the firm level analysis, the existence of highly significant and positive
knowledge spillovers in Turkey calls for policies aimed both at FDI attraction and also at facilitating


                                                                          26
 


the interaction between foreign and domestic firms. The latter would include programs for capacity
building which allow domestic firms to become competitive suppliers of multinationals, and the
development of entrepreneurial parks for both domestic and foreign firms, among others.


        Summarizing, since the presence of foreign subsidiaries in Turkey is having a significant
productivity-enhancing effect in domestic firms, there is a case for authorities to actively pursue the
attraction of long-term foreign capital. In a context of slowdown in the EU accession and privatization
processes, achieving larger FDI inflows in Turkey would need mitigating exchange rate variability,
expanding infrastructure (penetration of telecommunications), and strengthening institutions
(property rights protection and law and order).



5. Conclusion
This paper has addressed two main research questions: firstly, understanding the extent to which
foreign investment is contributing to productivity gains by domestic firms (both the firms receiving
the investment and other, related firms) and thus, indirectly, to economic growth; and, secondly,
identifying the determinants of foreign direct investment attraction, in order to understand how the
Turkish economy, which traditionally underperformed in terms of FDI inflows, could increase its
appeal to foreign investors.
        In order to tackle the first question we draw from the ORBIS/AMADEUS data set, featuring
financial accounting information from detailed harmonized balance sheets and profit and loss
accounts for 7,000 companies established in Turkey, over the period 2005-2012. This data set has also
the advantage of providing detailed ownership information, including the “links” between companies
and their shareholders, together with the country of origin of the investor. Both labor productivity
and total factor productivity (as in Woolridge, 2009) are computed. We first find that the main (and
only) determinant of foreign direct investment at the micro level is firm and sector productivity. Thus,
to mitigate a potential selection bias, we opt for a dynamic regression in differences, following Fons-
Rosen et al. (2014).
        We find that firms that receive foreign direct investment in Turkey see an increase in their
productivity four years after the arrival of foreign capital. In this sense, Turkey is not different from
other countries; it is a well-established finding in the literature that, in general, it takes 3-5 years to
realize potential benefits of FDI. On the other hand, while there is evidence of an increase in

                                                    27
 


employment during the second and third years of the foreign investment, this positive effect
disappears during the fourth year, which suggests some sort of staff consolidation exercise
contributing to productivity increases.
        We also look for spillovers on local firms, stemming from the presence of foreign owned
companies. Following Fons-Rosen et al. (2014), we define horizontal “competition spillovers” in
narrowly defined sectors (four-digit classification), as the entry of highly competitive foreign owned
companies is likely to impact on local competitors. At the same time, we define a “knowledge
spillover” variable that captures foreign presence in the same two-digit sector, excluding output
produced by foreign-owned companies in the same four-digit sector (which would be the direct
competitors). We find that, even if there is a small and negative competition spillover impacting
domestic companies in narrowly defined sectors, there is also strong evidence of large and positive
knowledge spillovers to domestic companies in the broader two-digit sector. This is a very important
finding, since Turkey is unique among its neighboring countries in terms of getting full knowledge
spillovers from FDI for domestic firms that are not in direct competition with the multinationals.
Thus, we argue that there is a strong case for the design of policies aimed at increasing foreign direct
investment attraction in Turkey, with the aim of helping unleash economic development.
        To reply to our second research question, how Turkey can attract larger FDI inflows, we build
a panel of data for 16 Eastern European economies (and Turkey) over the period 1999-2012. Drawing
from an eclectic theoretical framework based on existing literature, and following Sánchez-Martín et
al. (2014), we include in our empirical experiment a series of macroeconomic, endowment and
infrastructure-related, institutional, and risk variables, and conduct a series of cross-country
estimations using fixed effects. In line with previous literature focusing on Eastern and Central Europe
(Cartensen, 2004, Bevan, 2004), exchange rate stability, mobile phone penetration, government
stability, law and order, privatization, and EU candidacy are all significant determinants of foreign
direct investment. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that the fact that a series of significant
determinants of foreign direct investment have been identified in cross-country regressions does not
imply the causality of the results.
        Turkey is a country that over the past three decades has underperformed with respect to other
large emerging economies (BRICs) in terms of foreign direct investment inflows. Only after the
beginning of accession negotiations to the European Union, the country was able to significantly
increase foreign direct investment inflows. However, as the privatization process comes to an end,
and EU accession prospects cool down, attracting FDI is likely to become increasingly difficult. In

                                                  28
 


fact, FDI inflows in 2009-2013 have already been halved (1.6 percent of GDP), if we compare to
2005-2008.
    We argue that, apart from the slow progress in the adoption of the acquis-communautaire and the
internal crisis in the EU negatively affecting FDI prospects, Turkey may have missed some
opportunities due to a perceived deterioration in its rule of law since 2011. Thus, strengthening
institutions and ensuring the independence of the judiciary may be needed to increase the appeal to
the foreign investors. In addition, the introduction of macro-prudential policies to mitigate exchange
rate volatility caused by short-term portfolio inflows could also help attract long-term FDI in Turkey.
