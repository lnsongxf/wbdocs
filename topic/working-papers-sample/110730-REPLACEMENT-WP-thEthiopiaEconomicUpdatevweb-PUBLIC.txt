EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Recent Economic Developments

Strong economic growth continued in 2014/15. While the drought slowed down growth in 2015/16 the
economy still expanded by 8 percent, which is a sign of increased economic resilience. The Ethiopian
economy grew by 8 in 2015/16 due to the recent drought affecting agricultural production with spillovers on
the trade sector. Construction and services sectors account for most of the growth from the supply side. On
the demand side, growth is driven by investment followed by private consumption. Economic growth over
the past years was accompanied by a reduction of unemployment, although it remained high. Urban unem-
ployment in the formal sector declined over the last decade, albeit slowly, and was reduced from 23 percent
in 2004 to 17 percent in 2015. The urban economy is dominated by the manufacturing, construction, and
services sectors with some unskilled labor migration from rural areas. Chapter 2 of this report will analyze
these issues in more detail.
     Low inflation is another sign of economic resilience and inflation is remarkable stable; it stood at
5.6 percent in October 2016. While inflation rose temporarily above ten percent over the past year, it is
remarkably stable given the recent drought situation. Inflation entered to double digits in June 2015 and
increased to 11.8 percent one year ago in October 2015; since then it has declined and reached 5.6 percent
in October 2016. Reasons for the relatively low inflationary impact are related to high levels of cereal stock
reserves that were used during the drought and increased wheat imports.
     The fiscal deficit was virtually unchanged in 2014/15 and 2015/16. The general government fiscal
deficit (excluding SOEs) remained modest at 2.4 percent in 2015/16 similar to the preceding year despite
spending to finance drought affected areas. An increase in revenue collection, mainly from non-tax sources,
compensated the increase in total expenditure and helped to contain the fiscal deficit. An increase in non-
tax revenues was the result of larger than expected collection of state dividends from state-owned enterprises
and windfall gains to the Fuel Stabilization Fund. On the expenditure side, the general government spend-
ing stance was relaxed only marginally in 2015/16 despite additional spending for drought relief and strong
capital budget execution.
     Exports have had their worst performance in the last decade and the current account balance
remained large. The chronic current account deficit (including official transfers) continued to deteriorate
in 2015/16. The deficit reached 10.4 percent of GDP in 2015/16 improved slightly from 11.5 percent in
2014/15. This was caused by the large imbalance in import and export of goods and services, which has
reached to 19.8 percent of GDP. Goods exports were disappointing due to both volume and price effects in
2014/15—but a slight pick-up in volumes again in 2015/16—and an appreciating real (effective) exchange
rate. The downward trend in exports now continues over the last four years. Export of goods dropped by
3.7 percent in 2015/16.

         This is a good moment to re-consider the monetary policy strategy in Ethiopia. First, inflation has
    come down to below 10 percent levels after relatively high inflation rates between 2011 and 2013. Current
    success in controlling inflation will keep inflation expectations at bay in the medium-term. Maintaining low
    levels of reserve money and broad money growth within a clear monetary policy strategy that outlines appro-
    priate forward-looking institutional reforms would further cement the public’s view of successful fighting
    of inflation in Ethiopia. Second, an improved monetary policy framework is a prerequisite for an exchange
    rate regime geared towards more competitiveness. This is to be able to effectively combat any inflationary
    pressures arising from a devaluing currency. A look at the Chinese experience of monetary policy making
    (between 1987 and 2006) in Chapter 1 aims to extract lessons for strengthening the current monetary policy
    set-up in Ethiopia for such a longer-term and low inflation strategy.
         A low inflation environment is important to keep real wages stable and ensure that returns on edu-
    cation in urban labor markets are positive and to avoid the erosion of the purchasing power of wages
    for workers of all levels of education. Urban labor markets are discussed in detail in Chapter 2. Inflation
    is an important part of the wage trends observed over time in urban labor markets. High rates of inflation
    were a factor in the erosion of the value of real wages in the public sector in the past; and it is because of past
    inflation that nominal wages for public servants had to be adjusted significantly in 2014/15. Given that the
    public sector is such a major employer this affects the returns on education in urban labor markets, and also
    seems to have an effect on private sector wages.

    Economic Outlook and Challenges

    It was to be expected that Ethiopia’s strong economic growth would slow down in 2015/16 due to the
    recent drought. The drought caused by the El-Niño phenomenon affected the economy negatively through
    reductions in food production. While there was some uncertainty about the actual impact of the drought,
    preliminary actual figures from the Government for 2015/16 show now that the growth rate was 8 percent,
    in line with. With this, the growth impact is lower than originally envisaged; according to Government crop
    data released by the CSA in July 2016 there was a less than expected agriculture production impact; this is
    due to good crop production during the second season harvest of 2015/16.
         Positive growth moment will still remain. A decade of remarkable double digit growth rates helped
    the economy to cope well with the most recent challenges encountered in 2015/16. In fact, the ability to
    keep growth positive is a remarkable achievement for the Government. In similar occasions in the past,
    for instance in 1997/98 and 2002/03 the country has experienced negative GDP growth. In 1998 growth
    dropped to –3.5 percent from 3 percent in the previous year. Similarly, in 2003 it dropped to –2.2 percent
    from 1.5 percent previous year. Medium-term economic growth can be unaffected from the drought since
    the rains set in normally again in 2016/17. In addition, the completion of the Addis Ababa – Djibouti rail-
    way line, significantly eases trade logistics related constraints. The commencement of new industrial parks
    (Hawassa and Bole-Lemi Phase II) and the increasing capacity in power generation with the completion
    of transmission lines to neighboring countries (Sudan and Kenya) are also expected to improve the export
    performance and stimulate growth in the short- to medium-term. On the other hand, potential negative
    economic effects of the current unrest are a risk to the outlook.
         Economic growth is still expected to drive further reductions in poverty. Despite the poor rains and
    the associated lower agricultural production, the overall economic growth effect was modest. And growth
                                                                                                Executive Summary   xi




has been an important driver of poverty reduction in the last decade with each percent of growth reduc-
ing poverty by 0.55 percent. Based on this, the proportion of households living below the poverty line of
US$1.9 purchasing power parity (PPP) is estimated to decline from its estimated level of 27.2 percent in
2015 to 24.6 percent in 2018.
     Yet, poverty may fall less than predicted. This is due to the fact that the areas most badly affected by
the drought are the poorest parts of the country. The impact of the inadequate rains has not been equal
across the country. The areas most affected are the poorest parts of the country where many households are
poor or live just above the poverty line. Drought-induced harvest losses in these areas cause large increases
in poverty. The poverty head-count ratio estimate based on growth elasticity does not take such regional
variations into account. When district-specific data on estimated crop losses are used, the rate of poverty
reduction is potentially slower.
     The overvalued real effective exchange rate contributes to the weak export performance. The real
effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated in cumulative terms by 84 percent since the nominal devalu-
ation in October 2010. However, the speed of appreciation has slowed down over the past 6 months. While
the appreciation between July and August 2015 was 24 percent (y/y), this has slowed to 8 percent in June
2016 (i.e. slowdown in the rate of appreciation). This is primarily the work of two factors: first, a relative
decline in the rate of domestic inflation, and second, the depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to other cur-
rencies since January 2016. Since the Birr is pegged against the U.S. dollar the Birr also remained appreciated
against other currencies. Still, the Birr remains overvalued, which is hurting international competitiveness.
An overvalued currency does not help to improve export competitiveness and is a concern for the economy,
especially with exports falling for three consecutive years.
     Competitiveness also depends on labor productivity. The analysis undertaken in Chapter 2 shows that
increasing labor productivity is key not just for competitiveness, but for making urban labor markets work
more efficiently. Productivity of unskilled labor is currently very low, close to the minimum caloric require-
ments, so that wages cannot fall to clear the urban labor market.

A Functioning Labor Market for Poverty Reduction and Competitive Export Sectors

Rapid economic growth since 2004 was driven by public infrastructure investment and supported by
a conducive external environment; in addition, a modest shift in labor from agriculture to services and
construction explains up to a quarter of Ethiopia’s per capita growth over the past decade (World Bank
2015e). But while structural change contributed to economic growth in the past, it was not sufficiently
inclusive and needs to contribute much more to poverty reduction in the future. The urban space plays a
key role to advance structural change in Ethiopia, as centers of innovation and industrial development. Well-
functioning and efficient urban labor markets are a key ingredient for this transformation to take place, and
to ensure that its benefits reach all segments of the population. Yet, unemployment in Ethiopia is by and
large an urban phenomenon, particularly in Addis Ababa.
    Increasing the efficiency of urban labor markets in Ethiopia is not only key for structural trans-
formation but also for overall economic development. This Economic Update will describe the nature
of urban labor markets in Ethiopia and show how several factors contribute to curb their efficiency.
Unemployment levels are high, even among those with limited education. This can be explained in part
by low labor productivity in the private sector. Low productivity in the private sector translates into very
xii   5TH ETHIOPIA ECONOMIC UPDATE – WHY SO IDLE? WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT IN A CROWDED LABOR MARKET




      low wage levels for the less skilled, preventing wages from adjusting to clear the market. These issues are
      aggravated by the high costs of searching for a job in Ethiopian cities and the rural-urban migration influx.
      Finally, there is evidence that there are not enough opportunity for those with primary and secondary
      education in urban Ethiopia.
           Understanding the nature of urban labor markets is important for a successful transition to a
      manufacturing and service-oriented economy and to further reduce poverty. Urban labor markets differ
      from rural markets in several aspects: in large urban centers, wage employment is more important than self-
      employment, underemployment is lower but unemployment rates are high (particularly among the young,
      moderately educated population). Almost half of wage employees are employed by the public sector. The
      dominant sector in urban areas is the service sector, and it increases in importance among the educated and
      also in smaller towns. Manufacturing is more important in larger cities and among the unskilled.
           Many urban labor market trends are moving in the right direction although there has been little
      change in the structure of urban labor markets over time. Labor participation is increasing, and unem-
      ployment and underemployment are falling. Ethiopia’s labor force is becoming increasingly educated. Wage
      employment is becoming slightly more prevalent, particularly in Addis Ababa. The gender gap in labor
      participation (13 percentage points) as well as the proportion of wage employment in total employment is
      similar to countries with similar economic development. New jobs being created equally by the private and
      public sector and in proportion with the existing sectorial composition of the labor force.
           Real wage trends in urban Ethiopia have not reflected the increasing educational quality of the
      workforce, although improvements were observed from 2012 to 2014. Wages are higher for those with
      more education—in 2014 wages were more than double for those with a degree compared to those with
      a secondary education—but returns on education (changes in worker compensation related to worker
      characteristics such as education) have fallen over the last decade. The decline in wages at the beginning
      of the decade was somewhat compensated for, although not fully, by increasing wages in the last two years
      (2012–2014). These changes may in part reflect changes in worker productivity, but they are also likely a
      reflection of changes in the nominal public sector wage structure, which affects private sector wages given
      its importance as an employer in urban labor markets.
           Unemployment has fallen but remains high. Evidence suggests this is not fully explained by college-
      educated workers queuing for high quality jobs. There is evidence that while waiting for a high quality job
      educated individuals take temporary low-skilled jobs to finance the relatively high costs of searching for a
      permanent job. The temporary jobs that are taken are those that low-skilled individuals would otherwise take
      contributing to higher unemployment among low-skilled workers. However the magnitude of the crowding
      out is relatively small and this phenomenon on its own does not explain unemployment entirely. For those
      with little education, low labor productivity in unskilled jobs causes wages to be low, barely covering basic
      needs. This prevents wages from falling to fully clear the market.
           Higher levels of productivity are needed in low-skilled jobs. Within the unskilled labor segment,
      increases in productivity are desperately needed in order to ensure that the marginal product of labor increases
      above the nutrition-based wage. This will ensure that wages can adjust as needed in order to clear the market.
           Although jobs are being created faster than growth in the urban workforce, not enough jobs are
      being created for those with primary and secondary education. By analyzing how the demand for labor
      compares to the supply of labor in Addis Ababa, it becomes clear that there are not enough job opportunities
      for those with primary and secondary education levels. This might have been aggravated by the increasing
                                                                                             Executive Summary   xiii




migration from rural to urban areas. Existing data suggests that individuals living in cities with a higher
migration are more likely to be unemployed, although this may simply reflect local economic conditions.
     There is a need for both faster job creation and investments in skills for non-graduates. More and
better job opportunities for those with secondary and primary education are required. This segment of the
market is in desperate need of high-productivity employment creation. Although low-skilled workers are
more likely to be employed in manufacturing and construction than high-skilled workers, the service sec-
tor is still the primary employer of those with little education; growth in the service sector will be needed
for job-growth for non-graduates. Investments in skills of those in the job market are also needed. Many
employers report delays in finding employees with the right skills and report needing to invest in training.
This will likely require investments in on-the-job training as much as in formal training programs.
     The high costs associated with job searches also contribute to high unemployment rates. Improving
the technology used in job searches can help alleviate the high costs. The nature of the job search—search-
ing for vacancies posted on physical job boards at specific points in the city—entails high transportation
costs for the unemployed, accounting for almost 25 percent of their monthly expenditure. Increasing access
to information on job vacancies throughout the city through the use of technology can reduce the cost of
searching. Targeted safety nets and labor market programs can also help reduce unemployment by investing
in the skills of the unemployed, funding the cost of search, and improving the quality of matching.

Policy Recommendations

This Economic Update offers five policy recommendations to enhance urban labor markets:

1.	 Encourage firm creation and firm growth that creates jobs for non-graduates. This will require a focus
    on growth in services such as hospitality, as well as in construction and manufacturing, areas as these
    are sectors that are more likely to hire non-graduates. It will also require a focus on interventions that
    reduce costs associated with hiring non-graduates, such as certification of skills for secondary workers.
2.	 Increase labor productivity in the low-skill population segment by addressing constraints faced by firms
    in accessing capital (financial and physical) to ensure that the marginal product of labor increases above
    the nutrition-based wage.
3.	 Invest further in job training and technical training programs to build the skills of those in the job
    market: both for low-skilled workers to increase their productivity and for those with higher levels of
    education to increase their skill base.
4.	 Introduce targeted urban safety nets and labor market programs to invest in skills of low-skilled employ-
    ees and the unemployed, and provide financial support to enable their job search.
5.	 Enhance the use of ICT to provide information on job vacancies throughout the city and reduce the
    cost of job search.

      BOX 1.1: Monetary Policy Instruments: Evidence from other Developing Countries
      Most developing countries use a combination of instrument types: Rule-based instruments in combination with market-based instruments
      (Table 1.1).* Direct instruments are still used occasionally, but are less common than in the 1990s. Both standing facilities and reserve
      requirements are used in all developing countries studied, with the Lombard facility being the most common type of standing facility.
         SSA peer countries (The Gambia, Uganda and Zambia) discussed in Laurens (2005) also use a mixture of rules-based and
      market-based instruments. Reserve requirements have been used in all three countries, while liquid asset requirements are not
      ubiquitous. All of these SSA peers considered have used OMOs, with T-bill transactions being the most common type used.
         Comparing the instruments used in peer countries with those used in China, one main difference is that quasi-direct controls
      which were a common instrument in China over 1987–2006 are relatively rare in the 2000–2010 time frame among low income
      countries surveyed (15 percent in 2004; Table 1.1), and have not been a tool in selected SSA comparison countries since the
      1980s–1990s (Laurens 2005). On the other hand, both China and other peers rely on rule-based instruments and OMOs. The
      Gambia, for example, relies heavily on adjusting reserve requirements (IMF 2013a), just as China did in 2003–08. Many challenges
      are also similar: The Bank of Zambia was constrained in its ability to undertake repo transactions to reduce liquidity in the mid-
      2000s due to a lack of T-bills in its portfolio; and the PBC faced difficulties in sterilization from 2003 using its stock of T-bills.
         In recent years, there has been a move away from monetary growth rate targeting in SSA and towards a greater emphasis
      on interest rates as the operational target, and inflation as the final target. For example, in 2011 Uganda adopted an inflation-
      targeting “lite” monetary policy framework and Kenya (2011) and Zambia (2012) replaced monetary targeting with a policy
      interest rate target (IMF 2014, 2013b).
         * Direct instruments involve direct administrative control over interest rates/quantities in the financial sector (Buzeneca and
      Maino 2007). Rule-based instruments are more indirect instruments, but which still rely on the regulatory power of the central
      bank (Lauren 2005). Market-based instruments involve the central bank trading in the money market.

       BOX 2.1: What Does Decomposing Wage Trends Entail?
       Decomposing wage trends relies on defining a counterfactual scenario and estimating what would have happened to wages
       had the counterfactual scenario occurred. By defining a counterfactual scenario the changes that have been important to overall
       wage trends can be quantified. The figure below depicts how this can work for two different counterfactual scenarios.
          In the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, the focus is on a counterfactual of a constant relationship between worker characteristics
       (called “endowments”) and wages in urban Ethiopia. This counterfactual is used to determine which changes in worker characteristics
       could have contributed to wage changes, and how much could have changed as a result of a changing relationship between
       wages and worker characteristics. The latter is sometimes referred to as changes in returns, but really it represents how the
       conditional correlation between a given characteristic and the wage rate has changed.
          In all decomposition approaches there is an interaction effect, which can be interpreted as a measure of the correlation changes
       in endowments and returns. In the decompositions shown here it is quite small.

       BOX 2.2: Measuring Labor Productivity
       Value added per workers is defined as total output and income from services provided, minus total costs (raw materials, other
       industrial costs, and non-industrial costs) divided by the number of workers. When cost data was missing, this was treated as 0
       costs. However a missing value was kept when the total costs of raw materials and parts were missing.
          Labor costs and productivity according to the manufacturing census are based on permanent and contract workers only. That
       is, wage costs and employment of seasonal and temporary workers is excluded. Temporary workers make up about 20 percent
       of workers, so the true level of labor productivity would be lower than the levels estimated here. However, there is considerable
       measurement error in estimating the person-months engaged and the wages paid and this makes it justifiable to exclude them.
          All averages reported are weighted by firms’ number of permanent and contract workers.
          Labor costs are quite sensitive to outliers, particularly in some years such as 2009/10, and removing the top and bottom
       percentile by year or in the pooled data produces rather different numbers. Unless stated otherwise, averages presented are
       calculated after truncating the pooled data (i.e. removing the top and bottom percentiles in the pooled firm-level data).
