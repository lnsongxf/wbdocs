     Motivation
     Stunting is a widespread and persistent condition                          institutions, aim to foster knowledge exchange and
     in Indonesia with more than one-third of young                             cross-sectoral collaboration and coordination at the
     children being stunted. The national stunting rate                         project level for improving nutrition (World Bank,
     for under five-year-olds increased slightly from                           2013). As of 2016, the “Investing in the Early Years”
     36.8 percent in 2007 to 37.2 percent in 2013, based                        initiative, adopts a stepwise approach to the nature
     on official stunting rates reported by the Ministry                        of intervention needed for the healthy physical and
     of Health of the Government of Indonesia. During                           cognitive development of children by emphasizing
     the same time period, the percentage of population                         the role of reducing stunting and undernutrition
     in poverty reduced from 16.6 percent to 11.4                               for children in their first 1,000 days of their lives

     purchasing power did not translate to better                               stimulation between 1,000 and 2,000 days and the
     nutritional outcomes for children.                                         role of social protection for the nutrition and health of

     An acceleration of the progress towards reducing                           are based on the premise that the determinants of

          adequate food and nutrient intake, feeding, caregiving and parenting practices, and low burden of infectious diseases. Examples
          include: adolescent, preconception, and maternal health and nutrition; maternal dietary or micronutrient supplementation;
          promotion of optimum breastfeeding; complementary feeding and responsive feeding practices and stimulation; dietary
          supplementation; diversification and micronutrient supplementation or fortification for children; treatment of severe acute
          malnutrition; disease prevention and management; nutrition in emergencies. Nutrition-sensitive interventions and programs
          address the underlying determinants of fetal and child nutrition and development-food security; adequate caregiving resources
          at the maternal, household and community levels; and access to health services and a safe and hygienic environment-and
          incorporate specific nutrition goals and actions. Nutrition-sensitive programs can serve as delivery platforms for nutrition-specific
          interventions, potentially increasing their scale, coverage, and effectiveness. Examples include: agriculture and food security;
          social safety nets; early child development; maternal mental health; women’s empowerment; child protection; schooling; water,
          sanitation, and hygiene; health and family planning services.

6	 Simultaneous access to adequate level in all four drivers of nutrition is associated with a reduction in the stunting rate by 10.9
   percentage points which is between the reduction in the stunting rate observed for simultaneous access to two and three of the
   drivers of nutrition. This low point estimate may be mainly due to the very small number of children in this category (less than
   1%), also associated with the large confidence interval around this point estimate.
