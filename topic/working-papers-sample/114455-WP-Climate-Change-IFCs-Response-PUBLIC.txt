Climate Business Department
The Climate Business Department (CBG) was created in 2010 as a new
department and collaborative platform to coordinate, catalyze and optimize
all climate business activities within IFC on the investment and advisory
side. CBG works closely with other industry investment groups within IFC,
including Infrastructure and Natural Resources; Manufacturing, Agribusiness
and Services (MAS); and Financial Markets, as well as all Advisory Services
business lines and appropriate counterparts within the World Bank, located
both at HQ and in the regions. CBG is unique for its global perspective
on climate, technologies and development, its long-term approach to
investments, and its ability to leverage the resources of the entire World
Bank Group, as well as its commitment to maximizing value of portfolio
companies through sustained assistance.

IFC’s Initial Response to Climate Change
IFC	began	supporting	business	solutions	to	climate	change	in	1989;	just	a	
decade	after	the	term	was	coined	in	a	published	report	by	the	U.S.	National	
Academy	of	Sciences.		IFC	was	an	early	mover	in	clean	energy	investments	
around	the	world,	providing	seed	capital	to	innovative	clean	technologies	
and	renewable	energy.

Economy
IFC’s	response	to	climate	change	gives	new	meaning	to	our	commitment	
to	reduce	poverty	through	private	sector	development.	As	the	private	
sector	arm	of	the	World	Bank	Group,	IFC	is	also	an	active	partner	in	the	
design	and	implementation	of	new	initiatives	that	respond	to	the	threat	
of	a	much	warmer	world	as	reflected	in	the	publication	of	“Turn	Down	
the	Heat”,	a	review	of	what	is	known	about	the	consequences	of	global	
warming	of	4	degrees	C	or	more.
