    a voluntary commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 34 percent in
    2020 and 42 percent in 2025 relative to business-as-usual (BAU). This was part of a wider
    commitment by South Africa to contribute to the global effort in mitigating anthropogenic cli-
    mate change and to transition to a lower-carbon economy. This was reaffirmed in its Intended
Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) submission to the UNFCCC, in advance of COP 21
in Paris in 2015, which identifies the intention that South African emissions should follow a ‘Peak
Plateau and Decline’ (PPD) trajectory: peaking in 2025 within a range of 398 to 614 MtCO2e;
plateauing for approximately a decade; before beginning to decline in absolute terms, falling to
between 212 to 428 MtCO2e by 2050.

Among a suite of different policies, two, in particular, have been designed with the intention of
delivering a significant proportion of these emission reductions:

    •	 A carbon tax designed by the National Treasury (NT) to provide a price signal to producers
       and consumers of carbon-intensive products and to create an incentive to invest in cleaner
       technology. The carbon tax is expected to come into operation in 2017 at a headline rate of
       R120/tCO2e, although the effective tax rate will initially be lower as a result of a series of tax
       free allowances.

    •	 A series of carbon budgets designed by the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA)
       envisaged to provide a GHG emissions allowance (in other words, a cap), against which physi-
       cal emissions arising from the operations of a company during a defined time period will be
       tracked. In the period to 2020, the carbon budgets will not be a compliance instrument but
       rather will be used to increase understanding of the emissions profile of participating compa-
       nies, and to establish monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) processes. Beyond 2020,
       they are intended to become compulsory.

This paper provides recommendations for combining the carbon budget with the carbon tax
to support delivery of South Africa’s emissions reduction targets beyond 2020. While both the
carbon tax and carbon budget approach have merits, economic theory would suggest that there
could be risks associated with applying both instruments to the same emissions at the same time.
Stakeholder consultation also revealed significant concerns with this option. There is therefore a
desire to understand how they may be aligned to ensure that South Africa’s mitigation policy is
placed on a coherent footing on the longer term. Although they could be considered as mutually
exclusive options, the terms of reference for this study have specifically requested that possible
interfaces between these two instruments or approaches be considered, and hence the possibil-
ity of just proceeding with one or other of the options is not explored in this report.

           The analysis involves comparing four categories of policy alignment options across eight core
           principles. The four categories of alignment options, developed by the consultancy team and
           agreed in consultation with DEA and NT, and following discussion with other stakeholders are:

            •	 layering—where both instruments continue to apply to all entities;

            •	 ‘tax enforces budget’—where the tax rate applies in the event that emissions exceed an
               entity’s budget;

            •	 hybrid options with trading—where entities are allowed to trade budget allocations between
               themselves, and the tax determines the maximum and/or minimum price of these trades; and

            •	 differential instruments—where different instruments are applied to different entities.

           Within each category, there are a range of variants, as explained in the main report. The eight
           core principles were also agreed through the same process and following a review of a wider
           selection of principles evident in existing South African policy documents. The eight core prin-
           ciples are:

              1.	 Emissions reduction effectiveness: the interface option should be effective at reducing
                  emissions.

              2.	 Emissions certainty: the interface option should give policymakers and other stakehold-
                  ers confidence that it is possible to meet a particular emission level. This could apply both
                  to the flow of emissions at a particular point in time and—from a climate change perspec-
                  tive, more importantly—the cumulative emissions over a period of time.

              3.	 Cost-effectiveness: the interface option should minimise the additional costs that society
                  as a whole faces in order to reduce emissions, typically expressed on a cost per tonne of
                  CO2e reduced basis.

              4.	 Polluter pays principle: the interface option should ensure that environmental costs are
                  internalised and that increases or higher net levels of emissions lead to higher financial
                  costs.

              5.	 Equitable treatment: the interface option should treat firms and individuals that are in
                  a similar situation—in terms, for example, of the emissions they are responsible for—in
                  a similar way. This is both a principle that has its own merits and also one that helps to
                  reduce the risk of competitive distortion.

              6.	 Distributional issues: the interface option should not impose a disproportionate burden
                  on the poorest and most disadvantaged in society.

              7.	 Feasibility and simplicity: the interface option should be feasible for the responsible gov-
                  ernment agencies to design and implement, and feasible and simple for those regulated
                  by the option to comply with. It should be noted that there is a link between this principle
                  and the principle that the interface option should build on existing processes: options
                  that build closely on existing processes are likely to be easier to design and implement.

     8.	 Sensitivity to international competition: the interface option should not unduly disadvan-
         tage South African firms competing with firms based overseas not subject to the same
         intensity of emissions reduction regulatory effort.

The results of this analysis show that mitigation policy in South Africa faces something of a
trilemma; resolving this trilemma requires policymakers and stakeholders to make judgements
over which principles should be given greatest weight in policymaking. The carbon tax offers
cost-effective abatement but limited emissions certainty (at least in the short term) and raises
concerns among some business stakeholders over competitiveness concerns (notwithstanding
important design features intended to address these issues); budgets offer emissions certainty
but may be very cost ineffective and potentially have even more severe competitiveness issues;
while an emissions trading scheme (ETS)—which could offer emissions certainty and cost-­      effective
abatement, plus the opportunity to use free allowances to address competitiveness concerns—
faces a number of practical challenges in South Africa, at least in the short–medium term. These
tensions mean that different approaches may be favoured by stakeholders who attach more or
less weight to different principles. The suggestions in this report reflect both our analysis and our
understanding of how different principles may be traded off given the views of different policy-
makers and other stakeholders.

In the short term (between 2020–25) the ‘tax enforces budget’ option whereby entities pay a
tax on those emissions in excess of their budget2 is probably the easiest and most practical
way to interface the instruments and provide a price incentive at the margin to reduce emis-
sions. It is also sensitive to international competitiveness which is likely to be important given the
economic structure of the South African economy, and it is an approach that can also generate
government revenue that can either support the general budget or be recycled to reduce distri-
butional impacts. However, crucially, for this interface to be effective at reducing emissions and
providing enhanced emissions certainty, budgets would need to be set at a more ambitious level
than they would be if set in isolation; the tax rate may also need to be higher (and constant across
the economy). This option effectively creates an alternative means of complying with the budget:
rather than reducing emissions, entities can elect to pay the carbon tax on emissions in excess of
the budget. As such, the carbon tax provides a ‘safety valve’ that reduces the risk that the bud-
get will be set at a level that requires very costly abatement to be pursued. In turn, this should
allow policymakers to be more aggressive in using the budget to drive emission reductions in the
economy.

Ideally, at the same time, or shortly thereafter, the trading of budgets might be introduced.
This would effectively convert the interface option into an ‘absolute baseline and credit’ with a
ceiling price: entities would have individual budgets set and could meet these budgets by either
reducing emissions themselves or by purchasing emission reductions from others who had or
were confident of meeting their budgets. The tax rate would set the maximum price of these
trades. The introduction of trading would ensure that entities have a continuous incentive to
reduce emissions even if their emissions are below the budget. It would also further enhance the
cost-effectiveness of the system: as an alternative to paying the tax on their emissions in excess of
the budget, entities could instead choose to purchase budgets from others, if those entities were

           in a position to reduce and then sell their emission reductions at a cost or price lower than the
           ceiling price. This greater cost-effectiveness would, in turn, allow emissions reduction ambition to
           be increased over time.

           It may be appropriate to introduce restrictions on trading for Sasol in order to deal with market
           power in emissions trading concerns. The predominance of Sasol in the emissions profile of the
           South African economy may introduce concerns over trading for this company. As such it may
           be necessary to restrict the extent to which Sasol would be allowed to buy or sell its emissions
           budget to a certain percentage of its initial budget, although further detailed work on the pre-
           cise percentage would be required and it would be necessary to discuss the feasibility of such a
           restriction with the Competition Commission. Policymakers could also consider liberalisation of
           offset credit markets to allow for the further supply of credits, although the costs and benefits of
           this are beyond the scope of this report and have not been considered in detail. The treatment of
           the electricity sector in this regard is discussed further below.

           In the medium term, beyond 2025, as emissions have to first plateau and then decline, policy
           will likely have to become more ambitious, necessitating an evolution of the policy regime. This
           could be achieved in one of two ways:

            •	 If the country wishes to pursue a quantity-based ETS mechanism, the stringency of the bud-
               gets allocated to entities would need to increase particularly quickly, but some additional
               ‘budget’ would be auctioned by the government. The sum of the budget allocated to firms
               and auctioned would be aligned with the PPD trajectory.

            •	 If the country wants to pursue a price-based mechanism, as it has chosen to do to date, then
               the budget would also need to become increasingly stringent. However, no budget would be
               auctioned. Instead, as the budget became increasingly scarce, entities would end up paying
               the tax (buy-out price) over an increasing proportion of their emissions. Eventually the bud-
               gets could shrink to zero and the tax would need to be paid on all emissions.

           Under either approach the implication would be that a market-based mechanism (either through
           a tax or a quantity mechanism) would cover an increasing proportion of emissions over time,
           increasing the focus on the polluter pays principle and providing increasingly strong incentives
           for the cost-effective structural transition to a low-carbon economy. At the same time, introducing
           a price floor for the minimum price of trading would be valuable, especially if the quantity-based
           ETS mechanism is adopted.

           The treatment of the power sector is a particularly important aspect of the South African policy
           configuration, given it accounts for a large proportion of South African emissions. Discussions
           with stakeholders reveal considerable differences regarding the future evolution of the electricity
           sector in the country. These different future trajectories could have substantial impacts for how
           the sector is treated by mitigation policy. Two broad categories of options can be distinguished.

           Under the first option, the electricity sector would be treated similarly to the rest of the
           economy. In the short term, entities within the sector would have a budget set and be required to
           pay a tax for emissions in excess of the budget. These budgets would be informed by the sector’s


   xii
E x ecutive S ummar y 	                                                                                  xiii




Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) and the PPD trajectory, but would act as a compliance instrument
(as they would elsewhere in the economy) rather than just as planning tools. The budget may
even be relatively tighter than elsewhere in the economy given the relative lack of leakage issues
in the electricity sector and because a relatively tight budget would likely lead to a carbon price
signal being embedded in electricity prices, increasing the incentives across the economy for effi-
ciency in the consumption of electricity. Firms other than Eskom would have the option to trade
their budget. However, Eskom, for the same reasons as for Sasol, would likely need to face restric-
tions on the extent that it could trade its budget. A broadly common treatment between the elec-
tricity sector and the rest of the economy is consistent with a view in which the sector is steadily
reformed into a competitive market with cost-reflective prices and all firms respond to incentives
in a commercial fashion. It would promote the alignment of South Africa with international best
practice on both mitigation policy and power sector structure. Indeed, the greater use of carbon
pricing envisioned could be one part of the package of reforms to promote power sector reform
in the country.

The second option would apply a differential instrument in the electricity generation sector.
This approach would be consistent with the electricity sector remaining broadly as it is today,
with policy constraints making it difficult to envisage an across-the-board increase in electricity
price; Eskom continuing to dominate the sector; and with the view that the governance arrange-
ments of Eskom are unlikely to lead it to respond effectively to mechanisms that place increasing
emphasis on a carbon pricing signal. In this scenario, it may make more sense to place a budget
on Eskom that just focuses on its carbon intensity. This budget would be informed by the IRP and
the PPD. The existing governance structures between Eskom and the government would be used
to ensure compliance with the intensity-based budget. At the same time, other entities would
have their Scope 2 emissions included within their carbon budgets, based on an estimated emis-
sions intensity of the electricity sector that would be updated periodically. This would provide an
incentive for firms to reduce their Scope 2 emissions without an across-the-board increase in elec-
tricity price, which may have adverse impacts on vulnerable households. It could also increase the
liquidity in the market for trading of budgets as many entities in South Africa have more Scope 2
emissions than Scope 1 emissions. However, there would be less incentive for households to
improve their electricity efficiency, reducing overall emissions certainty.

A clear articulation of the strategic vision for South Africa’s low-carbon economic transition would
help policymakers and stakeholders navigate important medium–longer term strategic decisions
such as those identified above. Throughout the consultation exercise supporting this analysis, it
was clear that there were competing visions as to the broad contours by which South Africa intends
to move toward a low-carbon economy. The lack of this strategic vision means that there is limited
consensus on key issues, including the relative attractiveness of different policy options, the future
evolution of the power sector and how this relates to mitigation policy, or the relative importance
of different principles. The development of this strategic vision might also allow stakeholders to
anticipate how policymakers might respond to future unanticipated shocks that may require a shift
in policy and help stakeholders understand how the South African economy is expected to evolve
and the possible job and economic development opportunities from a low-carbon future.

1 Introduction




I
    n 2009, at the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP) in Copenhagen, South Africa made a
    voluntary commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 34 percent in 2020 and
    42 percent in 2025 relative to business-as-usual (BAU). This was part of a wider commitment by South
    Africa to contribute to the global effort in mitigating anthropogenic climate change and to transition
    to a lower-carbon economy. This was reaffirmed in its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution
(INDC) submission to the UNFCCC, in advance of COP 21 in Paris in 2015, which envisages that emissions
will peak in absolute terms by 2025 within a range of 398 to 614 MtCO2e, plateau for approximately a
decade, before beginning to decline in absolute terms from 2036, falling to a low within the range of 212
to 428 MtCO2e by 2050 (South African Government, 2015). The range for emissions presented in South
Africa’s INDC are consistent with its Copenhagen Accord Pledge.

Among a suite of different policies, two, in particular, have been designed with the intention of deliver-
ing a significant proportion of these emission reductions:

     •	 A carbon tax designed by the National Treasury to provide a price signal to producers and consumers
        of carbon-intensive products, creating an incentive to invest in cleaner technology and reduce emis-
        sions, where available. The carbon tax is expected to come into operation in 2017 at a headline rate
        of R120/tCO2e, although the effective tax rate will initially be lower as a result of a series of tax free
        allowances.

     •	 A series of carbon budgets designed by the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) envisaged to
        provide a GHG emissions allowance (in other words, a cap), against which physical emissions arising
        from the operations of a company during a defined time period will be tracked. In the period to 2020,
        the carbon budgets will not be a compliance instrument but rather will be used to increase under-
        standing of the emissions profile of participating companies, and to establish monitoring, reporting,
        and verification (MRV) processes. Beyond 2020, they are intended to become compulsory.

In the period to 2020, the integration between the two instruments is established. Firms that have been
allocated carbon budgets by the DEA will be entitled to an additional 5 percent tax free allowance. This is
in addition to a basic tax free allowance of 60 percent plus other allowances that will be provided for firms
if, for example, they are considered to be exposed to the risk of carbon leakage or if they have significant
process emissions.

The objective of this assignment is to review the principles used in approaching greenhouse gas emis-
sions reduction in South Africa and of combining the carbon budget and carbon tax;3 and assess the
appropriateness and effectiveness of combining the carbon budget with the carbon tax in achieving

3	  Carbon taxes imposed on transport fuels at the pump are excluded from the analysis because emissions from transport fuels
do not fall within the scope of carbon budgets.

South Africa’s emissions reduction goal beyond 2020. While both instruments have merits, economic
theory would suggest that there could be risks associated with applying both instruments to the same
emissions at the same time. Stakeholder consultation also revealed significant concerns about this
option. There is a desire to understand how the instruments may be aligned to ensure that South Africa’s
­
mitigation policy is placed on a coherent footing in the longer term, so that it can help deliver the emis-
sions reductions to which the country has committed. South Africa’s mitigation system is reiterative work
which will be refined over time. This analysis will be considered as an input to inform the second phase of
the mitigation system.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows:

 •	 Section 2 outlines some key principles from South Africa’s mitigation policy that can help guide how
    to assess different ways to establish an interface between the two instruments;

 •	 Section 3 outlines the current planned design features of each of the policy instruments;

 •	 Section 4 identifies some of the underlying economic principles associated with the use of these two
    instruments and provides insights from international experience on integrating multiple mitigation
    policies;

 •	 Section 5 outlines the different integration options considered;

 •	 Section 6 specifies the advantages and disadvantages of these different options;

 •	 Section 7 concludes; and

 •	 The annexes provide more information on the background to the principles assessment presented in
    section 2 and some of the international precedents that have informed the analysis.

2  Principles Used to Assess Interface Options




T
       his section sets out a range of principles that guide South Africa’s mitigation policy. These
       principles can be used to assess different ways in which to interface the two instruments; options
       for interfacing the two instruments that are consistent with, or promote, a particular principle are
       more desirable than options which are inconsistent with that principle.

       The bulk of the principles are derived explicitly from various South African policy documents
but these have been corroborated by international analysis. The key documents that have been
explored from the South African context are:

 •	 Overarching national policy documents, especially Chapter 5 of the National Development Plan;

 •	 Various documents published by the DEA including the National Climate Change Response White
    Paper and the Carbon Budget Design Document; and

 •	 Documents published by the National Treasury including the Environmental Fiscal Reform Paper, the
    Carbon Tax Options discussion paper and the Carbon Tax Policy Paper.

Many of the principles expressed in these documents are consistent with one another. Therefore, to avoid
significant repetition, in section 2.1 we briefly describe the key distinctive features of the principles from
each of these documents. A full list of principles associated with each document is provided in Annex B.
Section 2.2 synthesizes the different principles and identifies the core principles relating to this study.




2.1 Summary of principles from existing documentation

The National Development Plan identifies 14 explicit principles. These are at a very high level of abstrac-
tion, reflecting the status of the document as one which guides South Africa’s overall development trajec-
tory. Among the most relevant for the emissions mitigation policy are:

 •	 Ecosystems protection. Acknowledging that human well-being is dependent on the health of the
    planet.

 •	 Full cost accounting. Internalising both environmental and social costs in planning and investment
    decisions, recognising that the need to secure environmental assets may be weighed against the
    social benefits accrued from their use.

 •	 Transformative. Addressing the structural and systemic flaws of the economy and society with
    strength of leadership, boldness, visionary thinking, and innovative planning.
4 	Integration o f the C arb o n Ta x and C arb o n B udgets in S o uth A f rica




 •	 Delivering a managed transition. Building on existing processes and capacities to enable society to
    change in a structured and phased manner.

The National Climate Change Response White Paper has a series of nine explicit principles and also
identifies a further six factors that will guide its overall approach to climate change response that in
many ways resemble principles. The nine explicit principles place a strong emphasis on considering the
distributional implications of both climate change and the associated policy response across multiple
dimensions. This includes recognising the importance that countries should take climate action accord-
ing to their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities; that equity is crucial
and policy should address the needs of the poorest and take into account the special needs and circum-
stances of localities and people who are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change;
and that it is necessary to take account of intra- and intergenerational sustainability. The principles also
acknowledge the polluter pays principle. The six factors that guide how South Africa should structure its
climate response include recognition that climate change policy should also be developmental such that
it has significant economic growth, job creation, public health, risk management, and poverty alleviation
benefits, and that policy should be balanced and cost effective.

The Carbon Budget Design Document provides a series of more detailed principles guiding the design
of this instrument. This recognises the importance of consistency between allocation of the carbon
budget and subsequent accounting and reporting of emissions against that budget. It also identifies the
sectors in which carbon budgets might be set and that, for Phase 1 of the carbon budget process up to
2020, they should provide support to existing and planned future operations.

The 2010 carbon tax discussion paper identifies seven ‘issues which must be carefully addressed in car-
bon tax design’; these can be considered as principles. These include ensuring environmental (emissions
reduction) effectiveness, that distributional and competitiveness issues should be taken into account,
the importance of technical and administrative feasibility, and the need for alignment with other policy
options. Many of the same principles are also found in the Environmental Fiscal Reform paper, which also
acknowledges the importance of public support for the tax.

A review of international documentation suggests close overlap between the principles expressed in
South African policy documents and those used in other jurisdictions. These documents place a strong
emphasis on environmental (emissions reduction) and cost-effectiveness; feasibility (both technically and
politically); equity, including the idea of the polluter pays principle; and the need to carefully consider
policy overlaps to ensure that perverse incentives are not created.




2.2 Synthesis and identification of principles related to policy integration

We have identified 15 principles that are relevant for considering the strengths and weaknesses of dif-
ferent ways to interface the carbon tax and carbon budget. This list starts from the long list of principles
summarised above and described in more detail in Annex B. It then focuses on those that are relevant
for considering how South Africa might seek to achieve emissions reductions objectives, rather than what
those objectives might be (which has already been determined into the medium term). This means, for
instance, that principles such as common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities,
P rincip l es U sed t o A ssess I nter face Opti o ns 	                                                        5




intergenerational equity, or the precautionary principle are not considered in this list. We also seek to
aggregate principles with broadly common intent even if they are expressed somewhat differently across
different documents, as well as to give more attention to those that are common across many or all of the
documents reviewed. It should be stressed that this synthesis is done purely for the purposes of support-
ing and simplifying the analysis in this study, it is not intended in any way to replace the principles articu-
lated in the various documents.

These 15 principles are grouped into three main categories: design features, implementation and inte-
gration (Figure 1). Design features relate to the way in which instruments might be designed; implemen-
tation concerns the way in which instruments might be decided upon and introduced; and integration
relates to the way in which different policies should be combined. This is intended as a heuristic device
only.

Discussions with NT and DEA, and taking account of consultations with stakeholders led to a particular
focus on eight key principles. While all of the principles discussed above are used to assess the different
interface options to the extent possible,4 it was agreed with the NT, DEA and through the stakeholder
consultation process that eight principles should be given particular attention. These are:

     1.	 Emissions reduction effectiveness: the interface option should be effective at reducing emissions.

     2.	 Emissions certainty: the interface option should give policymakers and other stakeholders
         confidence that it is possible to meet a particular emissions level. This could apply both to the
         flow of emissions at a particular point in time and—from a climate change perspective, more
         ­
         importantly—the cumulative emissions over a period of time.

     3.	 Cost effectiveness: the interface option should minimise the additional costs that society as
         a whole faces in order to reduce emissions, typically expressed on a cost per tonne of CO2e
         reduced basis.

     4.	 Polluter pays principle: the interface option should ensure that environmental costs are inter-
         nalised and that increases or higher net levels of emissions lead to higher financial costs.

     5.	 Equitable treatment: the interface option should treat firms and individuals that are in a similar
         situation—in terms, for example, of the emissions they are responsible for—in a similar way. This
         is both a principle that has its own merits and also one that helps to reduce the risk of competitive
         distortion.

     6.	 Distributional issues: the interface option should not impose a disproportionate burden on the
         poorest and most disadvantaged in society.

     7.	 Feasibility and simplicity: the interface option should be feasible for the responsible government
         agencies to design and implement, and feasible and simple for those regulated by the option to
         comply with. It should be noted that there is a link between this principle and the principle that
         the interface option should build on existing processes: options that build closely on existing
         processes are likely to be easier to design and implement.

     8.	 Sensitivity to international competition: the interface option should not unduly disadvantage
         South African firms competing with firms based overseas not subject to the same intensity of
         emissions reduction regulatory effort.

Stakeholders also identified that some of the other principles might also be considered as having primary
importance; however, for various reasons, attaching this status to them was considered unnecessary. A
number of business representatives argued that policy certainty should also be considered a primary
principle. However, this is more influenced by the way in which any given interface option is implemented
than by the underlying design features of that option.5 Some stakeholders also suggested that ‘contex-
tualised by other policy, especially job creation and economic development’ be considered a primary
principle. However, this is captured by a combination of cost-effectiveness (interface options that impose


4	
     As discussed in more detail in the subsequent sections, assessment of the interface options against some of these principles
requires a granularity on the design of the instruments beyond 2020 that is not currently available.
5	
     As discussed further below, this is also an issue for some of the other principles, but is particularly pronounced for this option.
1 2 	Integration o f t h e Ca r b o n Ta x a n d Ca r b o n Bu d g e t s i n S o u t h A f r i c a




more costs on society per tonne of emissions reduction will hold back economic development and job
creation more than those interface options that impose fewer costs) and sensitivity to international com-
petition (options that are less sensitive to international competitiveness will restrict job development and
economic development more than those that are more sensitive to this issue).

Nonetheless, the analysis in the subsequent sections identifies the most important cases where the dif-
ferent interface options might perform relatively well or poorly against all principles. While primacy is
given to the eight principles identified above, if the different interface options perform particularly well
or poorly against any of the principles, this is discussed, in order that policymakers can take an informed
view of the appropriate interface option, taking account of all of the germane issues.

3  Planned Design Features of Each Instrument




T
        his section provides more detail—to the extent available—on how each instrument, in isola-
        tion, might be expected to operate in the period to 2020. This is discussed in sections 3.1 and
        3.2, respectively. This, in turn, allows identification of how the instruments might be expected to
        operate in the period beyond 2020 without policy reform to enhance alignment. In other words,
        this provides the ‘departure point’ from which the instruments may have to be adjusted in order
to promote alignment beyond 2020. This departure point is discussed in section 3.3. Throughout this and
subsequent sections, the analysis refers to the impact of instruments on ‘entities’; there remains important
debate in the South African context on the appropriate point of regulation and the extent to which this
is or should be the same in different instruments. While this is an important debate, in order to focus on
the underlying features of each instrument, and how they may be best aligned, the report abstracts away
from this issue.



3.1  Carbon tax to 2020
The design of the carbon tax is intended to balance South Africa’s mitigation goals with the need to
reduce poverty and maintain trade competitiveness. While providing a price signal to encourage the
transition to a low-carbon economy, the proposed policy is also intended to reduce the risk of negative
competitiveness implications and leakage through special provisions for sectors considered to be at risk.
It is also intended that the revenues raised from the carbon tax could be used to address some of the
potentially negative social impacts.

Specifically, the key features of the proposed tax policy, as laid out in the Carbon Tax Policy Paper
(2013) and the draft Carbon Tax Bill (2015), are the following:

 •	 the tax is to be levied on Scope 1 emissions—these are emissions that result from fuel combustion,
    gasification, fugitive emissions, and nonenergy industrial processes;

 •	 the tax will be levied at R120/tCO2-equiv in 2017, and the National Treasury has indicated in the guid-
    ance provided in the 2013 Carbon Tax Policy Paper, that the rate will increase at a rate of 10 percent
    per annum, and is likely to apply until 2020;

 •	 certain allowances and reductions are included;

 •	 a 60 percent basic tax-free allowance will apply to all sectors during the first phase;

 •	 a further tax-free allowance of up to 10 percent is available to firms in ‘trade-exposed’ sectors;

 •	 a further 10 percent tax-free allowance will be provided to firms in sectors where there is a structural
    or technical inability to make reductions (i.e., process and fugitive emissions);
1 4 	Integration o f t h e Ca r b o n Ta x a n d Ca r b o n Bu d g e t s i n S o u t h A f r i c a




     •	 firms will be able to use domestic offsets in relation to 5 or 10 percent of their gross tax liability
        (i.e., before the impact of exemptions);

     •	 a ‘Z-factor’ will reward firms that have a lower emissions intensity than an agreed benchmark, with a
        further tax-free allowance of up to 5 percent;

     •	 an additional 5 percent tax-free allowance will be available to companies having received carbon
        budgets;

     •	 there will be a full exemption during the period to 2020 for the agriculture, forestry, and other land
        use activities as well as waste management sectors; and

     •	 although a number of options for using the revenue raised by the carbon tax have been identified,6
        the priority in the period to 2020 will be to ensure that the carbon tax does not lead to an increase in
        the price of electricity, through a credit for the levy payable on electricity from nonrenewable sources
        and also a credit for the premium charged for renewable energy. It is understood that this will account
        for most or all of the revenues raised in the period to 2020.



3.2  Carbon budgets to 2020
Company-level carbon budgets were introduced in the National Climate Change Response Policy as a
mechanism through which South Africa’s mitigation commitments could be translated into emissions
targets for subsectors and companies. A carbon budget is defined in the Carbon Budget Design Docu-
ment as (Department of Environmental Affairs, 2015):

       . . . a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions allowance, against which direct emissions arising from the
       operations of a company, during a defined time period will be accounted. The term “carbon” in
       carbon budget is shorthand for carbon dioxide, and further, for all GHGs accounted for in the latest
       South African inventory (2010).

The first phase of carbon budgets in South Africa (2016–20) is being implemented as a voluntary pilot
in preparation for a second mandatory phase to commence in 2021. Phase 1 does not include compli-
ance measures. The decision to start with a voluntary phase was influenced by a lack of an appropriate
legal instrument.

Carbon budgets were allocated to a selection of individual entities in the form of a cumulative target
level of GHG emissions that they are permitted to emit over the five-year carbon budget period. The
Carbon Budget Design Document states that while five years is a sufficiently long period of time to allow

     In November 2015, the media statement accompanying the Draft Carbon Tax Bill identified more specifically how the revenue
raised by the carbon tax would be recycled. In addition to the measures used to ensure electricity price neutrality, this identified
funding for the energy efficiency tax incentive already being implemented, additional tax relief for rooftop (embedded) solar PV
energy as already provided for the in 2015 tax legislation, additional support for free basic electricity to low-income households,
additional allocations for public transport, and measures to encourage the shift of some freight from road to rail.

entities the flexibility to take into account fluctuations in market conditions and output while planning to
meet their carbon budgets, it is not too long to allow the DEA to respond to developments in local and
international conditions and the evolution of local mitigation policy. The entities participating in the first
phase of the carbon budgets were selected from a set of target sectors based on whether they emit more
than 100,000 tonnes of GHG emissions per annum, or produce the ‘same primary product’ as a company
that falls within this category. Entities that did not meet this criteria, but still wished to participate, could
voluntarily enter into negotiations with the DEA to also be allocated carbon budgets.

Phase 1 carbon budgets included the following design features:

 •	 carbon budgets were allocated to companies to support both current operations and existing expan-
    sion plans;

 •	 there was no consideration of any national or sectoral mitigation targets when carbon budgets were
    set;

 •	 companies are expected to report annually on their progress in terms of meeting their carbon bud-
    gets, and report at the end of Phase 1 on whether they have remained within or exceeded their car-
    bon budgets, but there will be no legal consequences if companies exceed their carbon budgets;

 •	 no transfer of unused portions of carbon budgets from the first to subsequent phases will be allowed;

 •	 no transfer of portions of their carbon budgets between companies will be allowed during Phase 1;
    and

 •	 only emissions from a company’s own operations (Scope 1 emissions) will be included in carbon
    budgets.

The DEA has explicitly identified the carbon budget process in the period to 2020 as an opportunity
for learning by doing. While it intends to use the experience gained by implementing the first phase of
carbon budgets to design the second and subsequent phases, all Phase 1 design elements will be re-
evaluated when the next phase of carbon budgets is designed, and new elements may also be included
in the next phase while some elements of Phase 1 may not be retained in Phase 2.

Although there is no legal requirement for companies to remain within their carbon budgets in the
period to 2020, there are legal requirements regarding the reporting of mitigation actions. The Pollu-
tion Prevention Plan Regulations issued under the National Environmental Management: Air Quality Act
(Act 39 of 2004) legally require companies to:

 •	 describe interventions that will be implemented to reduce GHG emissions over the course of the next
    five years, and the expected mitigation impact that these actions will have, in a pollution prevention
    plan to be approved by the Minister of Environmental Affairs; and

 •	 submit annual progress reports that outline the mitigation actions that were implemented within the
    last year, and if relevant, details of any deviations from the approved pollution prevention and reme-
    dial action to address deviations.

3.3  Assumed ‘departure point’ for 2021 and beyond
Our analysis assumes that, if there were no further efforts to enhance alignment between the carbon
tax and the carbon budget some, but not all, of the design features of the carbon tax would remain in
the period beyond 2021. The key design aspects that would change in the period beyond 2020 are as
follows:

 •	 The headline tax rate would no longer rise by 10 percent but rather by inflation. Assuming a medium-
    term inflation projection of 5.5 percent, this would imply a carbon tax rate of R168.5/tCO2 in 2021,
    R177.8/tCO2 in 2022 and R187.5/tCO2 in 2023.

 •	 The basic tax-free allowance, set at 60 percent in the period to 2020, would begin to fall. Our analysis
    assumes that it might fall by ten percentage points per year so it would be 50 percent in 2021, 40 per-
    cent in 2022 and so on. In conjunction with the assumptions on the headline rate above, this would
    imply that the effective tax rate, before the impact of further allowances might be R84.3/tCO2 in 2021,
    R106.7/tCO2 in 2022 and R131.3/tCO2 in 2023.

 •	 There would be no additional (e.g., the extra 5 percent) tax allowance for entities that also receive a
    carbon budget. In the period to 2020, this is provided as an inducement for entities to adopt a vol-
    untary carbon budget. As it is assumed that carbon budgets will become compulsory after 2020 (see
    below), this exemption becomes obsolete.

 •	 It would no longer be the case that the primary use of revenues would be to preserve electricity price
    increases. Instead electricity prices could instead rise as a result of the carbon tax with the raised rev-
    enues available for other policies.

In relation to the budgets, our analysis assumes that many of the design elements of budgets will
remain the same as in the period to 2020—for example, they would be set for entities on their Scope 1
emissions on a five-year basis with annual reporting requirements, and covering entities with annual
emissions above the threshold in the target sectors—but with the following crucial differences:

 •	 The budgets become mandatory for entities in 2021. Thus, if entities are found to exceed their bud-
    get over the five-year period, then they would be subject to an appropriate compliance mechanism.

 •	 Budgets will be set through a combination of both a bottom-up assessment of an entity’s emissions
    and its scope for reducing emissions, and a top-down assessment of the emissions that would be
    consistent with the national Peak Plateau and Decline (PPD) trajectory and each sector’s Desired
    Emission Reduction Outcomes (DEROs). While the outcome of this combined bottom-up, top-down
    process cannot be predicted for individual entities, it would result in emissions below the business-as-
    usual trajectory (BAU) and consistent with the PPD target.

It should be stressed that this departure point for the tax and budget represent a set of assumptions
used to enhance the clarity of the changes to one or both instruments that might be required in 2021
and beyond. While it is based on our understanding of the current documentation and intent of policy-
makers, it does not represent an official policy position by National Treasury and/or DEA. It is used only to
enhance the clarity and exposition of the subsequent analysis.

4  Properties of Budgets and Taxes and Insights
on Integration




T
      his section discusses the key advantages and disadvantages of the different instruments act-
      ing in isolation. Broadly put, when combining the carbon tax and carbon budget, the intention
      is to maximise the advantages provided by each instrument operating in isolation while aiming
      to reduce some of the disadvantages of each instrument. However, to do this, it is necessary to
      understand the properties of each instrument and what can and cannot be identified about their
comparative advantages and disadvantages.

It then provides a brief summary of the key insights provided by international experience in seeking to
combine multiple mitigation policy instruments. Reflecting the international interest in carbon pricing as
a policy instrument, this literature focuses in particular on the combination of carbon pricing instruments
with other mitigation policies; given the context in South Africa, this section places particular attention
on the insights from this literature in relation to combining carbon taxes with other policy instruments. It
complements the international experience provided in Annex A.



4.1  Advantages and disadvantages of the carbon tax and carbon budget
It is helpful to place the carbon budget and carbon tax in a simple policy taxonomy. This taxonomy is
not comprehensive but rather seeks to highlight key features of mitigation instruments based on eco-
nomic theory and literature that are relevant in the South African context. It distinguished policy instru-
ments on two dimensions.

 •	 Command and control versus market based. Command and control instruments specify either the
    emissions reductions that must be delivered by a particular firm or installation and/or the technolo-
    gies that should be used to deliver reductions. The carbon budget is an example of a command and
    control instrument as it will specify the emissions reductions that a firm must make. Such instruments
    are attractive if policymakers wish to directly target investment activity in certain entities or sectors
    that are of importance to the economy. By contrast, market-based instruments, such as carbon taxes
    and emissions trading schemes (ETSs), provide flexibility as to how much individual entities choose to
    emit and which technologies they choose to use to reduce emissions. In the case of a carbon tax, for
    example, entities can either choose whether and how to reduce their emissions or, if all reductions are
    expensive, pay the tax at the designated rate.

 •	 Quantity versus price. A quantity instrument reduces emissions by placing a fixed constraint on
    the amount of emissions from a certain source. The carbon budgets are a quantity instrument with
    the emissions defined at the locus of the individual firm, while an ETS places a fixed constraint on
    the total emissions from sources covered by the instrument. The attraction of this approach is that
1 8 	Integration o f t h e Ca r b o n Ta x a n d Ca r b o n Bu d g e t s i n S o u t h A f r i c a




    it provides certainty over emissions. By contrast, price instruments, such as the carbon tax, reduce
    emissions by letting emitters decide on whether they wish to pay the tax for each tonne of emissions
    for which they are responsible. Theoretical literature shows that pricing instruments are preferable
    to quantity instruments when there is relatively more uncertainty about how much it might cost to
    reduce emissions than about how much damage those emissions might do (Hepburn, 2006). They
    may also be better at incentivising low-carbon investment as the price is often stable and known in
    advance. Pragmatically, price instruments (taxes) can be relatively easily integrated into existing tax

Figure 2 depicts the two main instruments of focus for this study on this simple taxonomy (in red). It also
depicts ETSs as an instrument that share some similarities with carbon budgets, as they set a constraint
on the total quantity of emissions, but also with carbon taxes, as they are a market-based instrument that
provides flexibility to individual entities as to how much they choose to abate. ETSs are discussed briefly
further below.

The key advantage of the carbon tax is that it will deliver cost-effective emissions reduction. As the
typology shows, taxes are market-based instruments. Theoretical and empirical literature shows that
market-based instruments tend to reduce emissions at a much lower cost to society per tonne of CO2
than command and control instruments. For example, the OECD, in an international study (OECD, 2013),
found that market-based instruments reduced emissions at a cost of less than €30/tCO2 compared to up
to more than €150/tCO2 for regulatory (command and control) measures, as shown in Figure 3. This is
because market-based instruments provide the same incentive to reduce emissions across the economy
and allow those subject to the regulation to determine whether this is a strong enough incentive to
reduce emissions: faced with this signal some entities will find it easy to significantly reduce emissions and
will choose to do so; others will choose rather to pay the market price. It should be noted that the finding
P r o p e r t i e s o f Bu d g e t s a n d Ta x e s a n d I n s i g h t s o n   I n t e g r at i o n 	                           19




that carbon pricing reduces emissions at least cost is predicated on using the same carbon price across
all sectors of the economy which, in order to address other important objectives particularly around fears
of carbon leakage and lack of competitiveness (recognised as an important principle in section 2), is not a
feature of the current South African carbon tax design.

By contrast, under a command and control instrument, the regulator decides how much each firm
should reduce its emissions. Without excellent information on the amount and cost of emissions reduc-
tion in different parts of the economy, there is a risk that entities will be forced to reduce emissions even if
it is extremely costly for them to do so (it could even lead to them exiting the market).

Note: Although the OECD study refers to emissions trading, it would be expected that a carbon tax would have a very similar or
identical level of cost-effectiveness. There were no countries with examples of carbon taxes in the OECD study.

Looking at the other primary principles identified in this study, there are a range of other advantages
of a carbon tax. These include that the revenues raised can be put to good use elsewhere in the econ-
omy in a way that can promote equity; that it is a relatively simple and transparent mechanism by which
to regulate emissions (although this transparency is reduced in a system in which there are significant
differences in treatment between different entities or sectors, which likely is the case in South Africa); and
that entities in a similar position will be treated in a similar way (although again this advantage is some-
what reduced in the current South African design given the refinements brought into the design such
as the Z factor). The carbon tax is also an instrument that provides potential new entrants with a clear
understanding of how their emissions will be treated, promoting long-term efficient capital allocation and
hence structural change.

The key advantage of a carbon budget is that it provides certainty over emissions. By setting a firm cap
on emissions, policymakers can have confidence that emissions reductions will be delivered, assuming
that the budget is effectively enforced. In the context of South Africa’s commitments to the international
community, this certainty is of particular value. In terms of the other principles identified for use in this
study, the flexibility of setting different budgets for different entities may also make carbon budgets more
sensitive to international competition than a carbon tax, as a more lenient budget might be set for firms
subject to intense international competition. The same logic may also allow some targeting of budgets
in a way that addresses equity concerns. In addition, setting this emissions cap at an entity level provides
opportunities for policymakers to target emissions reductions from a particular source that, even if they
are not the most cost effective in the short run (and so may not be delivered by a market-based instru-
ment such as a carbon tax) are nonetheless crucial for the long-run decarbonisation of the economy.

With regards to emissions reductions effectiveness, it is not clear which instrument is superior—it
depends more on the way in which the instrument is implemented rather than its intrinsic characteris-
tics. A stringent carbon budget could deliver more emissions reductions than a carbon tax; by contrast a
lax carbon budget would deliver fewer emissions reductions. There are two caveats to this:

 •	 A carbon tax provides a continuous incentive to reduce emissions. In other words, an entity will
    decide for each tonne of emissions whether it is more or less costly to reduce that tonne or pay the
    tax. By contrast, once a firm is within the carbon budget it will face little incentive to continue to
    reduce its emissions and, indeed, may face a disincentive if that would lead to a more stringent bud-
    get in subsequent years.

 •	 Some experience suggests that the lack of information possessed by a regulator will lead to it
    setting budgets that deliver fewer emissions reductions than a cap. This, for example, was the experi-
    ence in the UK under the Climate Change Agreement/Climate Change Levy regime (Martin, Preux, &
    Wagner, 2009) as discussed in Annex A. On the other hand, the ability to set different budgets for dif-
    ferent entities may allow a regulator to extract deeper emissions reductions from some entities as the
    stringency of the budget would only apply to that firm and would not ‘spill over’ to other entities in
    the economy who may have an ability to obstruct ambitious economy-wide policies. However, in turn,
    the different treatment of different entities could lead to concerns about equity and may, in the South
    African context, face legal challenges.

The challenge in assessing the relative emissions reduction effectiveness of both instruments is returned
to in sections 5 and 6 below, as it also influences the assessment of the interface options.

The advantages and disadvantages of the carbon tax and carbon budget are summarised in Table 2.
This uses a selection of the principles identified in section 2; for other principles, it is not possible to say
at this level of abstraction whether one instrument is preferable to another. Those principles especially
identified by the DEA and NT are highlighted in bold. It should be stressed that these results assume the
two instruments are equal in their stringency, that enforcement is equivalent across instruments and that
information asymmetry is high. It is a short–medium term assessment.

Emissions trading systems offer an option of combining some of the advantages of the carbon price
and the carbon budget. Emissions trading systems offer the prospect of emissions certainty across those
companies included in the system, while the ability to trade allowances, creating a carbon price, provides
the cost-effectiveness benefits of a market-based instrument. This combination has proved compelling
for a number of jurisdictions ranging from the EU to California, Kazakhstan and China (see Annex A for a
discussion of some of these cases). However, as discussed further below, to date, this option has not been
considered feasible in the South African context.

4.2  Insights from international practice in combining mitigation policy
instruments
Many countries are exploring the challenges of combining multiple emissions reduction policy instru-
ments to reduce emissions. The insights gained from these challenges can be useful to South Africa as
it considers its own options. These insights tend to consider how to combine a market-based instrument
with other policies; as explained in Annex A, the practice of using budgets, especially at the firm level, is
much rarer in international experience. Within this literature, where relevant, our focus is on the insights
associated with integrating carbon taxes with other policy instruments; a host of different issues arise
when combining carbon prices from emissions trading systems with other instruments.

It is possible to identify five key insights from relevant international experience.

    1.	 The approach to addressing policy interactions needs to be informed by the overarching prin-
        ciples determining emissions reduction strategies.

    2.	 It is broadly recognised that a package of policy instruments is needed for an effective mitigation
        strategy, including, but not limited to, a carbon price.

    3.	 In any package of instruments, it is vital to be clear about the different roles of different instru-
        ments: in general, there should be no more than one policy instrument for each policy objective.

    4.	 In packages with a carbon tax, the major integration concern is ensuring cost efficiency and avoid-
        ing policy redundancy (for an option retaining both instruments in their current form).

    5.	 The way in which a carbon tax evolves over time is an important determinant of the long-term
        nature of any policy interaction.

The approach to addressing policy interactions needs to be informed by the overarching principles
determining emissions reduction strategies. Different combinations, and ways to combine instruments,
will be more or less appropriate depending on the policy objectives that are being sought. This supports
the rationale of this report which seeks to consider the most appropriate integration based on the prin-
ciples underpinning South African mitigation policy.

It is broadly recognised that a package of policy instruments is needed for an effective mitigation strat-
egy, including, but not limited to, a carbon price. It is sometimes suggested that a carbon price alone
will be sufficient to deliver necessary emissions reductions (del Rio & Labandeira, 2009). This is not backed
up by more detailed analysis which recognises that a range of policy instruments, to tackle a range of
barriers and market failures holding back emissions reductions, will be required. For instance, Acemoglu,
Aghion, Bursztyn and Hemous (2012) find that if only an immediate carbon tax is used, it needs to be
20 times higher than in the case of the combined instruments to achieve a given target. Similarly, Fischer
and Newell (2008) in a simulated model of the U.S. electricity sector find that with a combination of poli-
cies, the carbon price necessary to achieve a particular emissions reduction falls by 36 percent and the
portfolio of policies generates surplus rather than costs.

In any package of instruments, it is vital to be clear about the different roles of different instruments: in
general, there should be no more than one policy instrument for each policy objective. A common eco-
nomics principle for policymaking is that one instrument should be used to tackle one policy challenge
P r o p e r t i e s o f Bu d g e t s a n d Ta x e s a n d I n s i g h t s o n   I n t e g r at i o n 	                           23




(market failure). If this is not followed, then there is a risk that one of the policies will be redundant, lead-
ing to unnecessary administrative costs and wasting scarce political capital. The corollary of this principle,
however, is that multiple policy objectives can support the existence of multiple policy instruments. This
implies that it is important to identify the objective of each policy (or what market failure is it seeking to
address).

In packages with a carbon tax, the major integration concern is ensuring cost-effectiveness and pro-
tecting against redundancy. As described above, one of the key attractions of a market-based instrument
such as a carbon price is that it is typically a cost-effective way to reduce emissions. When combining mul-
tiple policy instruments, the biggest risk is that this cost-effectiveness will be reduced and/or that the tax
may become redundant. This is a different set of challenges compared to a situation where other policies
are being combined with a carbon price provided by an emissions trading system.

The way in which a carbon tax evolves over time is an important determinant of the long-term nature
of any policy interaction. By building in flexibility to the choice of the tax rate, as envisaged in the current
South African policy tax design, it is possible to avoid some of the most damaging interactions, as policy
can be adjusted as the impact of these interactions become clear. On the other hand, a lack of certainty
over the future tax rate may increase investment uncertainty, which is why policymakers in some jurisdic-
tions prefer to set an up-front tax rate path, identifying how the tax rate will evolve over time.7 In South
Africa, the Carbon Tax Policy Paper envisages an increase in the tax rate of 10 percent per annum over
the first five years while reducing tax exemptions.

These insights are returned to in the context of South African policy debate in section 6.

     This was the approach taken, for example, in British Colombia where an initial carbon tax of C$10/tonne was introduced in
2008, steadily increasing to C$30/tonne over the period to 2012.

5  Interface Options




T
        his report considers four categories of interface options, some of which have a range of dif-
        ferent design options, as shown in Figure 4. These options were developed by the consultancy
        team, drawing on international experience, and in consultation with the DEA and NT. They do not
        cover the full range of permutations through which the instruments might be combined but are
        considered to be the most plausible at present and capture (and in cases expand on) many of the
options being discussed in South Africa at present. Although the carbon tax and carbon budget approach
could be considered as mutually exclusive options, the terms of reference for this study have specifically
requested that possible interfaces between these two instruments or approaches be considered. Hence,
the merit of each of these instruments or approaches on their own is not further explored in this report.
In addition, the treatment of sectors where, at present, only one instrument is expected to apply is only
covered to the extent that this would need to be further addressed if it required further consideration in
the detailed design of the interface option.

 •	 ‘Layering’ involves imposing both the tax and the budget on all entities that are currently expected to
    be regulated by each instrument, leading to a situation where many entities are subject to a budget
    and also have to pay a tax on all of their emissions, adjusted for any tax free allowances to which they
    are entitled.

     •	 ‘Tax enforces budget’ refers to a situation where a firm incurs no tax liability if its emissions are below
        the budget but they become liable for the carbon tax if the budget is exceeded. There are two differ-
        ent options:

           •	 if an entity exceeds its budget, it is only liable to pay the tax on the emissions in excess of the
              budget; and
           •	 if a firm exceeds its budget, then it is required to pay a tax on all of its emissions. This is quali-
              tatively very similar to an arrangement whereby entities pay a tax on all of their emissions with
              these tax revenues then rebated if the emissions of the entity are below the budget.8

     •	 Hybrid: refers to interface options where design features of each instrument are merged to form one
        overall instrument. We consider three different designs:

           •	 An intensity-based baseline and credit scheme. Under this mechanism, a benchmark carbon
              intensity is set for each sector. Entities might choose either to undertake abatement to meet
              their intensity threshold, or to purchase credits from other entities in the sector that have
              received credits from already reducing their emissions below the intensity threshold. The
              Canadian province of Alberta’s Specified Gas Emitters Regulation (SGER) scheme requires
              yearly emissions intensity reductions for large emitters, with a price ceiling on the cost of emis-
              sions that exceeds the emissions intensity target.
           •	 An absolute baseline and credit scheme. This works in a similar way to the intensity-based
              baseline and credit scheme but the baseline is set in terms of absolute emissions. Entities
              comply with the baseline by choosing either to abate or to purchase credits from those already
              under their baselines. However, because baselines are set in the same units, tCO2, it is easy to
              buy credits from any other firm that has been set a target, rather than just entities in the same
              sector. Tokyo has an instrument of this form.
           •	 An emissions trading system. Under this mechanism, the relevant authority imposes a limit
              (cap) on the total emissions in the covered sectors of the economy, and issues a number of
              tradable allowances that does not exceed the level of the cap. Each allowance corresponds to
              one unit of emissions (typically one tonne) and entities are required to surrender one allow-
              ance for every unit of emissions for which they are accountable. Entities are allowed to trade
              allowances between themselves and often have a number of allowances allocated for free.
              There are numerous examples of ETSs around the world including in the EU, California, China,
              Republic of Korea, and Kazakhstan. There are a number of similarities between an emissions
              trading system and an absolute baseline and credit scheme. For instance, in both schemes
              entities can purchase a right to emit a tonne of CO2 rather than reduce their emissions. How-
              ever, there are also important differences between these options, as set out further in Box 1.

In all three cases, the instruments could be combined with either a price ceiling and/or a price floor
imposed through a tax arrangement. With a price ceiling, if entities consider it too costly to either reduce
emissions directly or purchase credits or units, they have the option instead to pay this ‘buy-out’ price of
tax for each tonne of emissions for which they are liable but not able to surrender an allowance or credit


8	
     These two permutations have different cashflow implications. If a tax is only paid when an entity exceeds a budget, then tax
revenues are only collected once compliance when the (five-year) budget is known. If the tax is paid annually (or six-monthly) and
then only rebated when the (five-year) budget is met, then the tax revenues are collected more frequently and an entity meeting its
budget would only receive a rebate in the future. However, for the purposes of this analysis, they are considered equivalent.
I n t e r fa c e Op t i o n s 	                                                                                       27




for. Alberta’s SGER caps the price by allowing entities to pay into a technology fund instead of further
reducing emissions or purchasing credits on the market. A price floor might work by imposing a tax
on any trading which was below the floor price, with the value of the tax being equal to the difference
between the trading price and the floor price. This, for instance, is how the carbon price floor in the UK
electricity sector works.



     Box 1.  Differences between an ETS and an absolute baseline and credit scheme

     Under an absolute baseline and credit scheme, entities are set emissions targets in tCO2. Those that are
     able to reduce their emissions to levels lower than this target can sell these reductions to entities that are
     not able to reduce their emissions so easily.

     This is very similar to an ETS in which allowances are provided to entities for free. The free allowance
     allocation is effectively the same as the target, with companies that reduce their emissions below the level
     of their free allowance allocation able to sell their excess allowances to entities who wish to increase their
     emissions beyond the free allowance allocation.

     Indeed, an absolute baseline scheme will theoretically deliver the same emissions reductions outcomes as
     a cap and trade scheme at the same cost. The impact of the scheme on consumer prices should also be
     the same. (Wood, Blowers, & Moran, 2016)

     However, it is not essential that an ETS provides allowances for free; indeed, most ETSs have over time
     moved to a situation where an increasing proportion of allowances are auctioned (Vivid Economics, 2015).
     This allows the possibility of raising revenues which can be used to offset the impact of consumer price
     increases, but imposes additional costs on entities. Entities may also have stronger behavioural incentives
     to reduce emissions when allowances are auctioned. By contrast, there is no scope to generate fiscal rev-
     enues under a baseline and credit scheme (apart from using a tax to set a price floor and ceiling).




 •	 Differential instrument application. This is an interface option where different instruments are
    applied to different entities or sectors. The different instruments that might be considered are: a tax;
    a budget; one of the other integration options combining a tax or budget; or an entirely different
    policy instrument.

6  Option Assessment




T
        hese options are described and appraised systematically. In order to facilitate a thorough
        approach, we use the same five questions to guide the description. The questions are:




    1.	 How will the interface option work?

    2.	 What are the design features of this interface mechanism that would require a policy decision, and
        how is it enforced?

    3.	 What changes would need to be made to either or both of the instruments relative to the
        ‘assumed departure point’ described in section 3.3?

    4.	 What existing features of the ‘departure point’ for the carbon tax and budgets as described in
        section 3.3 would be preserved under this interface option?

    5.	 Are there any international precedents similar to this option?

The section then scores for each of the options against each of the seven primary principles. This scor-
ing focuses on the intrinsic characteristics of the option with no assumptions made on the stringency of
the option. For example, an option which provides a continuous incentive to reduce emissions will score
more highly on emissions reduction effectiveness than an option that only requires entities to meet a
certain quantity of emissions. This approach reflects the fact that policymakers and stakeholders in South
Africa will need to reach a decision on which interface option to proceed with before the detailed design
of that interface option can be fully developed. It is important to stress that there are important and
significant differences in these intrinsic characteristics of the different interface options that allow for this
sort of assessment to be undertaken. It is similar, for example, to the way in which South Africa previously
decided to pursue a carbon tax over an ETS on the basis of the intrinsic characteristics of those instru-
ments in the South African context, rather than following a process of detailed design of each instrument.

However, in many cases, the way in which the interface is designed will influence how that option
scores against the principle. As a clear example of this, the emissions reduction effectiveness of the ‘tax
enforces budget’ option will depend substantially on the stringency of the budget and the tax rate that
would prevail if emissions were to exceed the budget. Therefore to complement the scoring based on
the intrinsic characteristics of the interface option, we describe qualitatively how the detailed design of
the instrument would change the way in which the mechanism would work, and the directional impact
that this would have on the scoring based on the intrinsic characteristics. This is necessarily qualitative as
3 0 	Integration o f t h e Ca r b o n Ta x a n d Ca r b o n Bu d g e t s i n S o u t h A f r i c a




it is beyond the scope of this paper to determine the precise implementation modalities for a particular
interface option.9

Finally, the review also considers the intrinsic characteristics of the different interface options against
the other principles articulated in section 2. This is done on a selective basis, highlighting where the
interface option may score either relatively well against that principle or relatively weakly. This selective
approach is adopted because for many of the interface options and principles there is little that can be
said at this stage of the policy development process.

No attempt is made to weight the different principles. Different stakeholders are likely to attach differ-
ent views to the importance of different principles: this analysis does not seek to make these value judge-
ments, rather the intention is to help policymakers and stakeholders understand the relative strengths
and weaknesses of different options, the trade-offs involved, and where these trade-offs may be most and
least acute. It should be noted that ‘adding-up’ the scores that each interface option scores against each
principle is equivalent to giving each principle equal weight.



6.1 Layering 10
         Question                     Detail

     1   How will the interface       This interface option layers the budgets and tax on top of each other and leaves the current
         option work?                 carbon tax and budget proposal unchanged. Each instrument is applied as expected in
                                      2021 and beyond. One option for the design of each instrument is laid out in section 3.3.
                                      The key implication of this interface option is that, for a particular firm at a particular
                                      point in time, only one instrument is ever binding: either the tax causes a firm to bring
                                      its emissions below the budget (in which case the budget is not relevant) or the budget
                                      causes a firm to reduce its emissions by more than it would under the tax (in which case
                                      the tax is not relevant, at least in the short term).10

     2   What are the design          This interface option does not economise on the policymaker decisions that need to be
         features of this interface   taken for the carbon tax and budget individually. It requires setting the:
         mechanism that would         •	   tax rate;
         require a policy decision    •	   tax relief in the form of allowances;
         and how is it enforced?      •	   firm specific budget; and
                                      •	   detailed design features of carbon budgets.
                                      The enforcement mechanism for the carbon tax would likely be enforced using the Customs
                                      and Excise Act.
                                      The enforcement mechanism for the budget would need to be determined. International
                                      practice for enforcing environmental regulation suggests:
                                      •	 levying a fine, either absolute or tied to the degree to which the budget is exceeded;
                                      •	 suspending and/or shutting down operations if the budget is exceeded too far or too
                                         frequently; and
                                      •	 imposing criminal sentences on operators.


9	
     However, in cases where the score of the instrument against the principle depends on the design features, but where, for
one interface option, there is a wide set of design features that would lead the instrument to score well on the principle, while
for another interface option there is a much narrower set of design features that would allow the instrument to score well on that
principle, then this is reflected in the intrinsic characteristic score. For example, when comparing the tax on excess emissions when
budget is exceeded with tax on all emissions if budget is exceeded then, for most tax rates and budgets, the tax on all emissions
when budget is exceeded will be a more stringent penalty then the tax on emissions in excess of budget. The tax on all emissions if
budget is exceeded would therefore contribute more to emissions certainty. However, mathematically, a very high tax rate on excess
emissions could be a more stringent penalty than a much lower tax rate on all emissions if budget is exceeded.
10	
     Although in the longer term the tax may lead to dynamic incentives as the firm seeks to reduce its emissions further.

                                        For the purpose of this analysis, we assume that the penalty for exceeding the budget is so
                                        severe (e.g., a criminal punishment) that no entity would exceed the budget.

        in section 3.3?

                           The tax creates higher costs for higher levels
                           of emissions for all emissions levels; budgets
                           create additional cost by increasing the
                           required effort to comply with the budget
                           when emissions increase. Both, however, may
                           generate different costs for polluters given the
                           tax rate exemptions and the inherent variation

                           contrast to all other options which only raise        provide additional revenues to address this
                           revenues on some emissions. Moreover, the             risk.

                           rate) in contrast to options with trading. These
                           revenues can be used to offset some of the
                           adverse distributional implications that might
                           otherwise arise.
                           The budgets can also be designed to
                           address adverse distributional issues by
                           imposing more or less strict budgets on
                           firms and/or sectors that produce goods or
                           services disproportionately consumed by
                           low-income groups. However, this may be
                           difficult to achieve in practice, including due
                           to the possibility of legal challenges, and the
                           effectiveness of this will be limited if the tax is
                           the binding instrument.

                           and report in relation to both schemes—               likely to be less intrusive and time consuming.
                           despite the fact that for any one entity at
                           any point in time, only one instrument would
                           determine emissions.
                           This interface option faces the risk of
                           adversarial and tough budget negotiations as

Layering scores very well on principles related to emissions performance but very poorly in relation to
principles relating to cost-effectiveness and sensitivity to international competition. Using two instruments
to reduce emissions increases emissions reduction effectiveness and certainty, as even if one instrument
is relatively ineffective, the other instrument may still be effective. However, the same principle of ‘double
regulation’ also means that the option scores poorly on some of the principles of greatest concern to
the business community. This was further reinforced in the stakeholder consultation exercise where most
private sector representatives considered this option to be unattractive.

In terms of the scoring against other principles important to South African mitigation policy, a number
of insights, where the option scores either particularly well or particularly poorly can be made:

 •	 the use of budgets provides those setting the budgets with an opportunity to target abatement
    activity in certain sectors or entities in the economy (which might be desirable for strategic reasons as
    discussed in the table of principles in section 2) and allows emissions reduction effort by sector to be
    contextualised by other policy priorities. For instance, laxer budgets might be set in labour intensive
    sectors or for firms and sectors expected to see significant employment increases. However, these
    benefits may not always be realised if the tax becomes the binding instrument; and

 •	 there may be concerns over the accountability and transparency surrounding the setting of the
    budget.

6.2  Tax used to enforce the budget
Tax used to enforce the budget combines budgets and taxes by establishing a budget and requiring
entities to pay a tax if the emissions exceed the budget. In effect, budgets provide the desired emis-
sions level for entities and/or sectors and the tax is used to ensure compliance.11

This interface option has two possible designs:

          1.	 Tax emissions in excess of the budget.

          2.	 Tax all emissions if the budget is exceeded.

For both options the same questions apply and their detail is summarised below.




            Question                     Detail

      1     How will the interface       This option assigns a budget to each firm and establishes a tax rate—which, in the first
            option work?                 instance, acts as an enforcement mechanism—for emissions in excess of the budget. There
                                         are two options that might be considered within this option:
                                         •	 If the budget is exceeded, the tax rate applies to emissions in excess of the budget
                                         •	 If the budget is exceeded, the tax rate applies to all emissions.

      2     What are the design          This option requires setting the:
            features of this interface   •	 tax rate;
            mechanism that would         •	 budget; and
            require a policy decision    •	 design features of carbon budgets.
            and how is it enforced?
                                         If firms exceeded their budget then they would have to pay a tax on their emissions
                                         according to which permutation of the interface option was considered. Additional
                                         enforcement, such as fines or prosecution, would only be appropriate in the event that
                                         there were some emissions on which the entity had not paid its required tax liability
                                         according to the system’s rules.
                                         The design of this option would also have to address the issue that the tax is expected to
                                         be paid on annual (or semi-annual) emissions while compliance against the budgets is only
                                         expected to be assessed over a five-year period.

      Ideally the carbon tax and carbon budgets will be defined in a way that ensures the same entities are subject to both instru-
ments. Ensuring alignment between instruments is a key element of the development of the Phase 2 South African Mitigation
System. This alignment can be achieved by defining the coverage of the two instruments to align with that of the National Green-
house Gas Emissions Reporting Regulations, as both instruments will rely on these regulations for reporting purposes. It is, however,
possible that there may be practical or legal reasons why some entities may not be subject to both instruments. It is thus important
that rules are developed to deal with cases where an entity is subject to only one of the two instruments. If an entity is subject to
a carbon budget but for some reason cannot be held liable for carbon tax, an appropriate compliance mechanism will have to be
developed to ensure that such an entity faces incentives to remain within its carbon budget that are as similar as possible to enti-
ties that are subject to the carbon tax. Likewise, the carbon tax rate for entities that are subject to the carbon tax, but cannot be
allocated carbon budgets, could be adjusted downward to approximate the incentives they would have faced if they were allocated
carbon budgets. The use of a reduced carbon tax rate would be consistent with the current carbon tax design’s use of allowances,
and could be set on the basis of applying an average ‘carbon budget allowance’ to all entities without a budget.

        Question                      Detail

                                      This may be most easily achieved by splitting the actual five-year budget into notional
                                      annual budgets and tax paid (as necessary) in relation to the annual budgets, but with year-
                                      on-year reconciliation mechanisms to allow entities to receive rebates if emissions begin to
                                      fall below the notional annual budgets after being higher than the notional annual budgets
                                      in previous years. This would require firms to have strong working capital positions. The
                                      additional fines and prosecution mechanisms would only be appropriate to use when the
                                      five-year budget period had elapsed.

 3      What changes would need       Under this interface option, the budget becomes an absolute threshold of tax-free
        to be made to either or       emissions. This creates very different dynamics to a situation where the tax-free exemptions
        both of the instruments       are provided as a percentage rebate on the tax rate (the current model). Under the current
        relative to the ‘assumed      model all emissions attract the same (relatively modest) tax rate of between 60–95 percent
        departure point’ described    of R160/tCO2 (and rising). By contrast, with an absolute tax-free allowance, all emissions
        in section 3.2?               lower than the budget attract a zero tax rate and only those above the budget attract a
                                      higher tax rate. This means that entities will be able to emit up to the budget at no cost and
                                      only need to start considering whether it is cheaper to abate emissions or pay the tax when
                                      they reach the budget.
                                      This change in dynamics means that if the tax rate and budgets were set at the same levels
                                      as set out in section 3.3 then it would be very likely that the budgets would be exceeded.
                                      Instead, for this mechanism to be emissions reduction effective, either the tax rate would
                                      need to be higher than in the currently envisaged departure point, or the budget would
                                      need to be more stringent, or both. This would be particularly important in the case that the
                                      tax was only applied on excess emissions.
                                      As the tax rate is being used to enforce the budgets, then it would be less appropriate to
                                      have different tax rates for different sectors. This would be best captured in the different
                                      budgets given to entities in the first place.

 4      What existing features        As explained above, budgets could continue to be set on a five-year basis. There would
        of the ‘departure point’      be the same flexibility to use the revenues raised from this interface option as envisaged in
        for the carbon tax and        section 3.3. Issues of which sectors to regulate could be made independently of whether
        budgets as described          policymakers adopted this interface option.
        in section 3.3 would be
        preserved under this
        interface option?

 5      Are there any international   None
        precedents similar to this
        option?



The dynamics created by this mechanism depend on whether only those emissions in excess of the
budget are taxed or whether, if the budget is exceeded, all emissions are taxed. We therefore score
these options separately, with the option of budget with tax on emissions in excess of budget in Table 4.

 Emissions               Entities have no incentive to reduce emissions        The score depends heavily on the level of the

Overall, when comparing this option against the seven key principles, it scores particularly well for fea-
sibility and simplicity and sensitivity to international competition but may be less effective at effectively
reducing emissions or providing emissions reduction certainty. This suggests it may be most appropri-
ate as an interim option for aligning the two instruments, rather than as a complete solution. This idea is
returned to in the conclusions.

A number of other principles important to South African mitigation policy are also germane to this
option:

 •	 budgets may face concerns over the accountability and transparency of setting the budget; and

 •	 budgets allow policymaker flexibility and a strategic approach that promotes structural
    transformation.

Compared to the tax applying on excess emissions, this option creates greater emissions certainty but is
less cost effective. It may also add to concerns about how budgets are set and the possibility of inequi-
table treatment, as well as its potential competitiveness impacts.



6.3  Hybrid instruments with trading
The hybrid instruments introduce the concept of trading, either across the economy (emissions trading
system or baseline and credit with absolute emissions threshold) or within sectors (baseline and credit
with intensity thresholds). As laid out in section 4.1, trading potentially provides a way of combining
emissions certainty with cost-effectiveness. In these options, the carbon tax would be used as a price floor
and/or ceiling to moderate some of the price volatility that may otherwise be created by trading options.

A key issue with any approach involving trading is the emissions concentration in South Africa, where a
very substantial proportion of emissions are associated with two entities: Sasol and Eskom. This raises
the concern that one or either of these companies may be able to either abuse a dominant position in the
market for trading allowances, distorting the effectiveness of the trading market or allowing them to use
their position in the trading market to affect the ability of other suppliers to compete to provide the same
products as these firms. In addition, relatively small proportional changes in the demand or supply of
allowances from these entities could have a very significant impact on the liquidity of the market for other
participants. Box 2 discusses some of the options that may be available to address these concerns. It
should also be noted that if trading options are combined with price floors and/or ceilings, as proposed,
then some of these potentially damaging implications would be alleviated.

       Box 2.  Options to facilitate trading given emissions concentration in the South African
       economy

       There are a number of options that might be considered:

           1.	 Subject Eskom and/or Sasol to a different regulatory instrument where there is no trading. This is
               discussed further in section 6.4.

           2.	 Place a limitation on the extent to which trading options can be used for compliance purposes.
               For instance, one or both of these entities may not be able to purchase or sell allowances equal
               to more than a certain percentage of their starting year emissions. This could be applied under a
               baseline and credit (absolute and intensity) and an ETS with free allowance allocation. It would not
               be feasible in situations where there was an ETS where these entities did not receive allowances
               for free.

           3.	 Increase the availability of offsets by accepting some international credits. At present the design
               of the carbon tax allows for regulated entities to meet a proportion of their tax obligation by
               surrendering domestically generated offset credits. In cases where the involvement of Sasol and
               Eskom is expected to only create challenges because of their large demand for credits, it may be
               possible to liberalise the rules on offset generation so that some of this demand could be met
               through the supply of international credits. This would not be a solution where there was a con-
               cern that these companies were likely to be net suppliers to the market.

           4.	 International linking. In the case of a full ETS, there may be scope for linking the South African ETS
               with one or more ETSs in other jurisdictions such that the combined influence of Sasol and Eskom
               is much smaller. This would require significant efforts to secure regulatory harmonisation with the
               other jurisdiction(s) and is only likely to be feasible over a longer time horizon, well beyond 2021.




6.3.1  Emissions trading system with tax as the floor and/or ceiling price12

         Question                     Detail

   1     How will the interface       In an emissions trading system, the total amount of capped emissions, typically calculated
         option work?                 by reference to the overall emission reduction commitment of the country, is converted
                                      into an equivalent amount of allowances that can then be freely traded across and within
                                      all sectors. Typically, some proportion of these allowances are freely allocated to entities,
                                      to reduce the absolute cost increase they face. Budgets would form the free allocation of
                                      allowances for each entity. Different entities or sectors might receive a different proportion
                                      of free allowances based on their characteristics, such as trade exposure, share of process
                                      emissions, or observed cost pass-through rates.
                                      The tax can be used as a floor and/or a ceiling for the price of traded emissions. Used
                                      as a price floor, it can ensure efficient long-term capital allocation and avoid lock-in to
                                      carbon intensive capital stocks; used as a ceiling, it can limit the potential impacts on
                                      competitiveness high costs may create. Such price ceilings and floors are already in place in
                                      the UK12 and California.




12 	
     UK: The Carbon Price Floor acts as an explicit floor price of the EU ETS in the UK and the EU ETS Market Stability Reserve may
provide a ‘soft’ price ceiling, releasing additional emissions allowances if prices increase beyond a threshold.
CA: An auction reserve price of almost US$11/tCO2 determines the price floor and the Allowance Price Containment Reserve releases
certain amounts of emissions allowances at predetermined prices (>US$40).

        Question                          Detail

 2      What are the design               This option requires setting a number of different variables including the:
        features of this interface        •	 overall cap;
        mechanism that would              •	 budget, which becomes the free allowance allocation allocated to either entities; and
        require a policy decision         •	 tax rates, which evolve into a floor and/or ceiling price.
        and how is it enforced?
                                          A detailed system of monitoring, reporting, and verification would be needed to ensure
                                          that entities surrendered allowances in line with their emissions. If the tax was used as a
                                          price ceiling, this would help with enforcement as entities could elect to pay the tax for
                                          some emissions. However, additional sanctions, such as the need to ‘make good’ any
                                          emissions for which allowances have not been surrendered or a tax paid, would need to be
                                          introduced.

 3      What changes would need           There would need to be significant changes to both instruments.
        to be made to either or           There would be a need to decide on the total emissions under the cap and then the
        both of the instruments           proportion of emissions that would be given to firms for free (this free allocation being
        relative to the ‘assumed          equivalent to the budget for that entity). The current considerations that influence the tax
        departure point’ described        rate faced by each entity would be expected to instead influence the proportion of free
        in section 3.2?                   allowances each entity received, implying that additional factors would need to be taken
                                          into account in the budget setting process.
                                          The tax rate would also need to be modified to set the floor and/or ceiling for the trading
                                          price of emissions. These are likely to require different rates from those currently used for
                                          the tax. It would also not be appropriate to use different tax rates for different entities. The
                                          tax rate would need to be set over the same time period as surrender obligations in the ETS
                                          were measured.

 4      What existing features            Budgets could continue to be set for a five-year period. The current arrangements which
        of the carbon tax and             allow entities to use offsets against their tax obligation would only need to be modestly
        budgets would be                  revised to allow entities to instead use offsets against their obligations to surrender
        preserved under this              allowances.

An ETS, with price floor or ceiling, performs well on many of the primary principles, including emissions
reduction effectiveness and certainty, as well as cost-effectiveness, but faces important practical imple-
mentation challenges in South Africa. Previous analysis suggests that it may be very difficult to accommo-
date Sasol and/or Eskom given their dominant position in South Africa’s emissions profile. This suggests
it may only be feasible in cases where there are differential instruments applied to these companies or in
the medium–longer term when there is greater scope for these issues to be addressed.


6.3.2  Baseline and credit

Baseline and credit schemes establish a benchmark level of emissions or emissions intensity for dif-
ferent entities. Entities with an emissions performance better (lower) than the benchmark can trade this
good performance with entities that exceed their benchmark. The benchmark may be set either on an
absolute emissions basis or on an intensity basis (such as tCO2 per tonne of product). As discussed in
Box 1, an absolute baseline and credit scheme performs in the same way as an emissions trading system
in which all allowances are grandfathered (in perpetuity). By contrast, in the option where intensity bench-
marks are used, trading will be restricted to entities in the same sector. In addition, entities exceeding
their benchmark may opt to pay a fee (tax) rather than trade with good performers. Because this option
makes use of trading, it faces many of the same challenges in the South African context as an ETS.


      Question                     Detail

 1    How will the interface       This option establishes a benchmark of emissions for entities, which either is an absolute
      option work?                 emissions or emissions intensity benchmark. Entities must make sure that they meet the
                                   allotted benchmark—either by reducing their emissions or by the purchasing ‘budget’ from
                                   entities that have reduced their emissions below the benchmark.
                                   The carbon tax can, as for the emissions trading system interface option, play a role as a
                                   floor and/or ceiling price for emissions. Similarly, the ceiling price may create government
                                   revenue by being a fee paid to the government to avoid purchasing emissions certificates
                                   at a market price higher than the fee.

 2    What are the design          This option requires setting the:
      features of this interface   •	 benchmarks on either an absolute emissions or emissions intensity basis; and
      mechanism that would         •	 tax rates, which evolve into a floor and/or ceiling price.
      require a policy decision
                                   As with the options where the tax is levied in the event that the budget is exceeded,
      and how is it enforced?
                                   compliance measures (such as fines or criminal sanctions) would only apply in the event that
                                   not all of the tax on the emissions that attracted the tax liability would be paid.

 3    What changes would need      Existing budgets could be used to inform absolute emissions benchmarks adjusted
      to be made to either or      downwards for South Africa’s national targets. These could be set for five years as currently
      both of the instruments      envisaged. Facilitating trading of these budgets would be a step change from current
      relative to the ‘assumed     processes.
      departure point’ described   An emissions intensity benchmark would require greater change in the budget setting
      in section 3.3?              process, although it could be linked to the current Z factor within the carbon tax design for
                                   each sector and expanded to cover more sectors.
                                   The tax rate would also need to be modified to set the floor and/or ceiling for the trading
                                   price of emissions. These are likely to require different rates from those currently used for
                                   the tax. It would also not be appropriate to use different tax rates for different entities. The
                                   tax rate would need to be set over the same time period as surrender obligations in the ETS
                                   were measured.

        Question                        Detail

 4      What existing features          Budgets could continue to be set for a five-year period. The current arrangements which
        of the ‘departure point’        allow entities to use offsets against their tax obligation would only need to be modestly
        for the carbon tax and          revised to allow entities to instead use offsets against their obligations to surrender
        budgets as described            allowances.

        preserved under this

        precedents similar to this      and credit scheme, although it is discussing moving to a carbon tax. Tokyo uses an absolute

An absolute baseline and credit scores similarly to an ETS. It performs as well, or almost as well, as an
ETS on emissions reduction and cost-effectiveness and emissions certainty; the key differences that arise
are that it may be slightly more feasible to implement and that, as it does not raise government revenue,
it scores less well on equitable treatment but better on sensitivity to international competition.

 Polluter pays                     A baseline and credit scheme internalises              The tighter the intensity benchmark is set, the
                                   environmental costs.                                   more likely it is that polluters will pay.
                                   Higher emissions result in higher cost for
                                   polluters because either emissions allowances
                                   have to be purchased or the entity has to
                                   surrender emissions allowances it could have
                                   otherwise sold.
                                   However, as with an absolute baseline and
                                   credit, there is the possibility of windfall profits
                                   as some entities may increase prices despite,
                                   effectively, receiving allowances for free.

 Equitable                         The benchmark negotiation will determine               The score depends heavily on the emissions
 treatment                         the degree of equitable treatment. The use of          intensity benchmarks set for each sector and to

                                   benchmark. However, this may be less valid in
                                   cases where the emissions intensity of different
                                   entities in a sector varies significantly for
                                   idiosyncratic reasons (as may well be the case
                                   in some sectors in South Africa).

                            above the benchmark. Benchmarks can also be
                            adjusted to take account of relative exposure
                            to international competition.



The intensity baseline and credit mechanism scores particularly well on sensitivity to international com-
petition but poorly on emissions certainty. It could also be challenging to implement in the current South
African context.



6.4  Differentiated instruments
The final category of options works by subjecting emissions from different sources to different forms
of regulation. This is a relatively common approach to potential overlap in other jurisdictions. Annex A
demonstrates that, for example, both Switzerland and France, among others, have explicitly introduced
different instruments to reflect the different characteristics of emissions sources in different parts of their
economy. It should be stressed that this option does not equate to exempting certain sources of emis-
sions from regulation, just applying different regulatory instruments to them.

          Question                      Detail

      1   How will the interface        This interface option involves using different instruments for different entities in the
          option work?                  economy. Each entity would only be regulated by one instrument, but that instrument
                                        would differ across different entities or, more likely, sectors.



      2   What are the design           The key issues associated with this interface option are to decide which instrument should
          features of this interface    apply to which entities. There are a very wide number of different permutations possible but
          mechanism that would          the most important policy instrument options are:
          require a policy decision     •	 a carbon tax;
          and how is it enforced?       •	 a carbon budget;
                                        •	 one of the other interface options that seek to combine aspects of the budget and tax;
                                           and
                                        •	 an entirely different instrument.
                                        Once different instruments had been assigned to different entities in the economy, it would
                                        still be necessary to reach decisions on the design of each of these instruments i.e., the tax
                                        rate for those entities regulated by the tax, the budget for those entities regulated through
                                        a budget, or the interface features if some entities are regulated by one of the other
                                        interface options identified above.
                                        For entities regulated by the tax or budget in isolation, enforcement would follow the
                                        current intended approach. For entities regulated by one of the interface options,
                                        enforcement would need to follow the approach described in the table explaining that
                                        interface option.

      3   What changes would need       The current expected design of the carbon tax and budget beyond 2020, as set out
          to be made to either or       in section 3.3, would continue to operate in relation to some entities or sectors of the
          both of the instruments       economy. However, the range of entities covered by that instrument would be narrowed.
          relative to the ‘assumed      If some entities were regulated by one of the interface options discussed elsewhere in the
          departure point’ described    paper, then the tax and/or budget would need to be amended along the lines discussed in

          preserved under this
          interface option? Which
          might not be compatible
          with the interface option?

      5   Are there any international   This is one of the commonest ways in which other economies integrate different mitigation
          precedents similar to this    policy instruments. For example, in France, some emissions are regulated by the EU ETS,
          option?                       emissions not subject to the EU ETS are subject to a carbon tax, and sectoral level carbon
                                        budgets exist for sectors outside the EU ETS. Similarly, Switzerland allows emissions from
                                        smaller entities to be regulated by a voluntary agreement.


It is not possible to assess this interface option using the same scoring metrics as for the other options.
This is due to the large number of different permutations that it provides; different permutations of instru-
ments on different entities would be either more or less attractive on different criteria. Instead, we there-
fore explore the general strengths and weaknesses of this approach, and then consider some of the most
obvious cases where this approach might be applied in the South African economy and the issues that
this raises.

The general attraction of this interface option is that it is a transparent solution that avoids any of the
distortions and economic/political economic challenges that can arise from layering (see section 6.1).13

13	
     In addition to the intrinsic advantages associated with the use of each individual instrument in a particular context, i.e., that
carbon taxes are cost-effective, carbon budgets provide emissions certainty.
5 0 	Integration o f t h e Ca r b o n Ta x a n d Ca r b o n Bu d g e t s i n S o u t h A f r i c a




It is also an approach that allows consistency with the international principle discussed in section 4.2 that
different policy instruments should ideally be used in cases where there are different barriers or market
failures that need to be overcome: for reasons of cost-effectiveness, a carbon tax might be used in cases
where the primary barrier to emissions reductions is the lack of commercial incentive; or budgets might
be used in cases where non-price barriers are the more important explanation for holding back mitigation
or where a targeted approach is desired to drive emissions reductions that may not be cost effective in
the short run (and so may not be realised by a carbon tax) but which are seen as necessary for the long-
term decarbonisation of the economy. The attractions of this interface option are reflected in the number
of different countries who integrate different mitigation policy instruments by using different instruments
for different emissions.

The downside of this interface option14 is that different instruments for different emissions will impose
different costs across the South African economy, both raising the aggregate cost of meeting its emis-
sions reduction targets, as well as the possibility of creating competitive distortions. For example, one
firm or sector may complain that it is unfairly penalised because it is being regulated by a carbon budget
while its competitors are being regulated by a carbon tax (or vice versa). While this risk is already inherent
in the use of entity-specific carbon budgets, this only relates to the differential application of the same
policy instrument; the risks are likely to be greater when different instruments are applied to different
entities.

To reduce the risk of competitive distortion, the same instrument could be used for emissions sources
that share similar characteristics. In particular, budgets might be used to address emissions from all
of the large point sources of emissions in the country, where one budget negotiation can cover a large
amount of emissions, while the carbon tax might be used to change behaviour where there are a large
number of diffuse entities and individuals responsible for emissions, for example, emissions from the
combustion of transport fuels.

It is also relevant to consider the issue of different instruments for different entities for the cases of
Eskom and Sasol. The large proportion of South Africa’s emissions that come from these two companies
make consideration of the effective regulation of these companies very important.

While there are a number of disadvantages to treating Eskom differently from other entities, there are
also arguments that suggest that these downsides may be smaller than if such differential treatment
was applied to other entities. The downsides relate to the challenges associated with applying different
instruments to different emissions in the economy, as described above. However, it may be worth consid-
ering the separate treatment of Eskom under an approach more akin to budget. There are a number of
reasons why this may be valuable and/or may not be as problematic as a differential approach for other
actors in the economy:

  •	 A carbon price relies on entities making commercial decisions in response to the price incentive it
     creates. The current ownership structure of Eskom may mean that Eskom makes decisions according



14	
     In addition to the intrinsic disadvantages associated with the use of each individual instrument in a particular context, i.e., that
carbon taxes do not provide emissions certainty, carbon budgets may be cost ineffective.
Op t i o n A s s e s s m e n t 	                                                                            51




     to a wide range of factors, balancing commercial and noncommercial decisions. This may render the
     impact of the carbon price on its operational and investment decisions less effective than the same
     policy would on a privately owned firm. By contrast, planning documents, such as the Integrated
     Resource Plan (IRP), and which could form the basis of a carbon budget type instrument for Eskom
     and the rest of the electricity generation sector, may be a more effective instrument to change the
     firm’s behaviour.

 •	 A carbon price applied to the power sector would ordinarily be expected to be passed through into
    higher electricity prices across the board. This is made challenging by the current and likely future
    economic context in South Africa as is reflected in the treatment of electricity prices caused by the
    carbon tax in the period to 2020. At the same time, if electricity prices are not passed through then
    one of the primary sources of abatement associated with a carbon price (demand side abatement)
    would not be realised.

 •	 The large capital investments made by Eskom may be subject to carbon ‘lock-in’ which would not be
    effectively addressed by a carbon price, but which could be tackled by a more targeted approach.

 •	 The nature of the South African power sector means that Eskom faces limited competition (especially
    as renewable production is supplied under long-term fixed price contracts) and so fewer issues of
    competitive distortion may arise.

A budget-type approach for Eskom would need to address two key issues:

 •	 Stakeholders would need to be confident that the budget-type approach used for Eskom would
    be effective at reducing its emissions and that it could be credibly enforced. It is beyond the scope
    of this paper to consider how this might optimally be achieved but it would be essential given the
    important role the company’s emissions will have in meeting the PPD trajectory, at least in the short
    term.

 •	 If one of the justifications for treating Eskom differently is due to the challenges associated with an
    across the board increase in electricity prices then this raises questions as to how demand-side abate-
    ment by electricity users could be incentivised. For many entities in South Africa, these Scope 2 emis-
    sions represent the majority of emissions and provide some of the easiest opportunities to reduce
    emissions. One option to realise this opportunity might be to include Scope 2 emissions in the
    budgets of these entities while focusing Eskom’s budget on reducing its carbon intensity. In this way,
    industrial downstream users of electricity would be responsible for reducing emissions through lower
    consumption of electricity, and Eskom would be responsible for reducing emissions through reduc-
    ing the carbon intensity of electricity generation, as well as reducing transmissions and distribution
    losses. At the same time, there would be no need to increase household electricity prices, although
    the corollary of this is that there would be less focus on the reduction of electricity consumption by
    households, which may need to be tackled in other ways such as, for instance, supportive financing
    arrangements for households undertaking energy (electricity) efficiency improvements. This is similar
    to the treatment of electricity sector emissions in a number of other jurisdictions where the electricity
    sector remains regulated, including the Republic of Korea, as discussed in Box 3.

    Box 3.  Incentivising abatement from reducing electricity consumption in the Republic
    of Korea

    The Republic of Korea implemented a domestic ETS in 2015. However, prices in the retail electricity
    market remain regulated, notwithstanding a long process of reform. (Kim, Kim, & Shin, 2013) At the same
    time it was recognised that encouraging electricity consumers to improve their consumption efficiency was
    necessary; just less than 50 percent of emissions came from the electricity sector in 2010. (IEA, 2012)

    The solution adopted was to make covered firms responsible for both their direct and indirect emissions.
    Entities have to surrender allowances equal to the sum of their direct emissions plus their electricity con-
    sumption multiplied by the emissions intensity of electricity production. This creates incentives to reduce
    power consumption. However, it has also raised administrative challenges. The measurement of the emis-
    sions factor of electricity generation can be controversial, while future linking between the Korean ETS and
    other systems will be difficult.




For Sasol, it may be considerably more difficult to justify differential treatment. While the large propor-
tion of emissions, and risk of lock-in, is still significant, the larger number of competitors that Sasol faces,
across a number of different sectors of the economy, may pose too great a risk in terms of competitive
distortion.



6.5  Scoring overview
Table 9 summarises the scores of all the considered interface options and demonstrates that there is
no clearly superior instrument across all principles. Different instruments score better and worse against
different principles. Broadly speaking, the following key patterns emerge:

 •	 Layering is likely to be effective at reducing emissions (subject to how the instruments are designed)
    and provides emissions certainty but will also raise significant concerns over cost-effectiveness and
    sensitivity to international competition. The lack of flexibility in the budget process is also likely to
    make negotiations over the budgets challenging for both government and regulated entities.

 •	 A budget with tax on excess emissions is probably the easiest design to introduce but will offer little
    emissions certainty and is unlikely to be effective at reducing emissions (subject to precisely how it is
    designed and implemented). Making entities liable for all emissions in the event that they exceed the
    budget will likely increase emissions reduction certainty but raise acute concerns over equitable treat-
    ment and is not particularly sensitive to international competition.

 •	 The emissions trading system and absolute baseline and credit (with price floor and/or ceiling)
    provide an attractive way of reconciling the tensions between the emissions certainty provided by
    budgets and the cost-effectiveness provided by the tax. However, an ETS, in particular, may be chal-
    lenging to implement in the country given both the complexity of this instrument and the emissions
    concentration within certain firms. An absolute baseline and credit mechanism, potentially coupled
    with a restriction on trading for certain firms, would be more practical but would not offer the poten-
    tial of raising as much fiscal revenue. While this means it can be more sensitive to international com-
    petition, it also means that it will be more difficult to address distributional concerns.
Op t i o n A s s e s s m e n t 	                                                                                    53




 •	 The intensity baseline and credit is particularly sensitive to international competitiveness concerns
    while still being attractive in terms of emissions reduction effectiveness. However, it would be very dif-
    ficult to be confident over achieving a certain amount of emissions under this mechanism, while the
    structure of the South African economy may create challenges in setting the intensity benchmarks.

 •	 The differentiated instrument interface option is more difficult to assess due to the large number of
    permutations it offers, but while it could deal with many of the concerns created by layering, it runs a
    significant risk of leading to inequitable treatment and competitive distortion especially if instruments

This implies that the decision on how to choose between the different options will depend on the rela-
tive weight attached to different principles. To support these deliberations, the subsections below pro-
vide more detail on the relative ranking of the different interface options against each of the principles.

6.5.1  Emissions reduction effectiveness

Emissions reduction effectiveness is primarily influenced by whether entities have a continued incentive to
reduce emissions, even when they are within their budget. Trading provides such an incentive by allowing
firms to sell surplus budget to others. As such, interface options with trading score highest. Layering also
scores well as it is always the more stringent of the two instruments that determines an entity’s emissions.

   1      Emissions trading                  Trading provides higher emissions reduction effectiveness by putting an implicit
          system                             price on all emissions, i.e., creating an incentive for further abatement.
                                             The schemes have the potentially widest sectoral coverage and scope for trading
                                             of all interface options.

   1      Layering                           Although there is no trading, the carbon tax applied to all emissions continues to
                                             provide an incentive for further abatement while entities are always required to
                                             reduce their emissions to that required by the most stringent instrument.

   2      Baseline and credit—               The trading in this option should provide similar incentives for emissions reduction
          absolute emissions                 as an ETS with the caveat that there is a greater chance that firms will be reluctant
                                             to reduce emissions if this is expected to determine their future baseline (similar
                                             incentives will not exist in an ETS when allowances are auctioned).

   2      Baseline and credit—               Although trading is limited to be within sectors, this option continues to provide
          emissions intensity                an incentive to reduce emissions.


   3      Budget with tax on all             No additional incentive to abate for entities within their budgets. However, the
          emissions if budget                threshold effect of the tax raises the price of emissions and encourages abatement

6.5.2  Emissions reduction certainty

Interface options that make greater use of budgets—set either at the entity or system wide level—­
provide greater certainty. This includes layering and the absolute baseline and credit and ETS options,
although the flexibility of providing a buyout price reduces this certainty somewhat. The emissions inten-
sity baseline and credit scheme provides little emissions certainty.

6.5.3 Cost-effectiveness

Cost-effectiveness is greatest when the marginal cost of abatement is equal across and within sectors.
This is achieved through interface options with trading, as the rating reflects.

very high costs

6.5.4  Polluter pays

The purpose of budgets and the tax is to internalise environmental cost. This is preserved in all interface
options. In the case of layering and the three options with trading of emissions (baseline and credit abso-
lute emissions, emissions intensity, and ETS) this is achieved through an explicit price; in the case of the
budget with tax on excess emissions and budget with tax on emissions above budget, this is implicit and
only applies if costs need to be incurred to get below the budget or when emissions exceed the budget.
As the options that create an implicit price only do so in some cases, these options score a slightly lower
score. Similarly, the baseline and credit schemes also score somewhat lower as they allow for the possibil-
ity of some entities achieving windfall profits. These results are shown in Table 13.

                                              The tax applies to all emissions and results in higher costs for greater emissions.
                                              The budgets can result in lower cost or uneven cost when the budget is binding
                                              instead of the carbon tax.

    1      Emissions trading                  An ETS causes entities to internalise the environmental cost in decision making:
           system                             either through having to purchase allowances for each additional tonne emitted or
                                              by having to forsake the opportunity to sell the allowance.
                                              However, in cases where allowances are provided for free, there may be scope for
                                              entities to both increase prices while not having to pay the direct financial cost of
                                              purchasing allowances, creating the possibility of windfall profits. This reduces the
                                              greater proportion of allowances that are auctioned.

6.5.5  Equitable treatment

Equitable treatment aims to ensure that cost for entities with similar emissions will be similar—in other
words, for the average cost per tonne of CO2 to be the same across all entities. None of the options
score well on this, although the emissions intensity baseline and credit scheme scores higher by avoid-
ing a potential spike in cost for sectors exceeding their benchmark due to expansion and the ETS has the
option to auction off allowances to create equal average cost per tonne of CO2; this would be in trade-off
of competitiveness concerns.

                                             However, the ETS has the option to auction all allowances, which would result in

6.5.6.  Distributional issues

Flexibility in assigning budgets can lower the cost increase of certain goods, such as energy, to low-
income consumers in order to lower distributional issues, and government revenue generated by the
interface option can help offset distributional issues. Options relying on budgets reduce government
revenue and score worse than a pure carbon tax on this aspect—which creates cost as well but equivalent
government revenue. Other options have unpredictable revenue as only emissions above the budget
attract a tax rate or a ceiling price.

6.5.7  Feasibility and simplicity

Hybrid options with trading require additional infrastructure which, although it can build on the infra-
structure created for offset use, is less feasible and simple than options combining the instruments more
closely to their current form. Although layering builds on existing processes, the stakes of budget nego-
tiations are higher because of the lack of a ‘safety valve’ if the budget is exceeded.

7 Conclusions




T
        here is no solution on how to interface the carbon tax and the carbon budget which clearly
        outperforms on all primary principles. As such, policymakers will need to make an informed
        decision based on the relative weights that they put on different principles, acknowledging that
        different policymakers may do this differently, and that the importance of the principles may
        change over time (especially as the country transitions from emissions peaking to plateauing and
then declining). At its heart, policymakers face something of a trilemma: the carbon tax offers cost effec-
tive abatement but limited emissions certainty (at least in the short term), and raises concerns among
some business stakeholders over competitiveness concerns (notwithstanding important design features
intended to address these issues); budgets offer emissions certainty but may be very cost ineffective and
potentially have even more severe competitiveness issues; while an ETS—which could offer emissions cer-
tainty and cost-effective abatement, plus the opportunity to use free allowances to address competitive-
ness concerns—faces a number of practical challenges in South Africa, at least in the short–medium term.

Moreover, how policymakers seek to resolve these decisions is made more difficult by the lack of a
clear articulation of a strategic vision for South Africa’s low-carbon economic transition. This vision
would help stakeholders understand how the South African economy is expected to evolve and the pos-
sible job and economic development opportunities from a low-carbon future, as well as the framework
and timeframe over which important decisions over particular emissions-intensive activities and sources
of emissions will be taken. It would also guide policymakers in managing the trade-offs identified above,
and allow stakeholders to anticipate how policymakers might respond.

The recommendations put forward below must be seen in this context. They reflect the consultancy
team’s best understanding of how the different principles may be traded off given our understanding of
the views of different policymakers and other stakeholders. However, alternative views on the importance
of different principles could lead to different conclusions. They are presented in three sections: opportu-
nities for alignment that appear most attractive in the immediate post 2020 period, medium–long term
interface opportunities, and the treatment of the electricity sector.



7.1  Recommended approach to interface for implementation
in short term (immediately post-2020)
A budget with tax above emissions15 is probably the easiest and most practical way to interface the
instruments and provide a price incentive at the margin to reduce emissions. It is also sensitive to
international competitiveness which is likely to be important given the economic structure of the South
African economy. However, while arguably the simplest and most feasible option, this would still require

      Entities could also retain the right to use international and domestic offsets for compliance against their budgets.

alignment between the DEA and NT on issues such as the monitoring, reporting, and verification of emis-
sions, and the appropriate point of compliance.

Crucially, for this interface to be effective at reducing emissions and providing enhanced emissions
certainty, budgets would need to be set at a more ambitious level than they would be set in isolation
or under layering to create an incentive to abate; the tax rate may also need to be higher (and constant
across the economy). This option effectively creates an alternative means of complying with the budget:
rather than reducing emissions, entities can elect to pay the carbon tax on emissions in excess of the
budget. As such, the carbon tax provides a ‘safety valve’ that reduces the risk that the budget will be set
at a level that requires very costly abatement to be pursued. In turn, this can allow policymakers to be
more aggressive in using the budget to drive emissions reductions in the economy. Critical elements of
this option include the rate of the budget and tax; the mechanics of the option allow for greater ambition
in setting the individual budgets due to the tax safety valve, and also a more aggressive tax rate because
it is only being applied on emissions above the budget. A further benefit of this is the creation of some
government revenue that can either support the general budget or be recycled to reduce distributional
impacts.

Ideally, at the same time, or shortly thereafter, the trading of budgets might be introduced. This would
effectively convert the interface option into an absolute baseline and credit with a ceiling price. The intro-
duction of trading would ensure that entities have a continuous incentive to reduce emissions even if their
emissions are below the budget. It would also further enhance the cost-effectiveness of the system: as an
alternative to paying the tax on their emissions in excess of the budget, entities could instead choose to
purchase budget from others, if those entities were in a position to reduce and then sell their emissions
reductions at a cost or price lower than the ceiling price. This greater cost-effectiveness would, in turn,
allow emissions reduction ambition to be increased over time.

This would add complexity but this can be managed. Inevitably, allowing trading of budgets between
entities would increase the complexity of the system, but international precedents suggest that the addi-
tional complexity can be justified given the benefits it provides. The infrastructure being developed to
allow for the use of offsets under the current carbon tax design could be amended to support the trading
of budgets.

It may be appropriate to introduce restrictions on trading for Sasol in order to deal with market power
in emissions trading concerns. The predominance of Sasol in the emissions profile of the South Afri-
can economy may introduce concerns over trading for this company. Under the hybrid scheme outlined
above, it may be possible to restrict the extent to which Sasol would be allowed to buy or sell its emis-
sions budget to a certain percentage of its initial budget, although further detailed work on the precise
percentage would be required and it would be necessary to discuss the feasibility of such a restriction
with the Competition Commission. Policymakers could also consider liberalisation of offset credit markets
to allow for the further supply of credits, although the costs and benefits of this are beyond the scope of
this report and have not been considered in detail. The treatment of the electricity sector in this regard is
discussed further below.
Conclusions 	                                                                                                                       65




7.2  Recommended longer term for the interface (2025 onwards)
Assuming that an absolute baseline and credit scheme is introduced, in the medium–longer term, there
are two key recommendations (with different options) for policymakers to explore.

        1.	 Carbon budgets should be aligned with the PPD trajectory (plateauing emissions in 2025–35
            and declining emissions thereafter). In pursuing this option, there are two different mechanisms
            related to whether South Africa wishes to regulate emissions through a tax-like mechanism or
            through a quantity/ETS mechanism.

            •	 If the country wishes to pursue a quantity-based ETS mechanism, the stringency of the bud-
               gets allocated to entities16,17 would need to increase particularly quickly, but some additional
               ‘budget’ would be auctioned by the government. The sum of the budget allocated to firms
               and auctioned would be aligned with the PPD trajectory. This would give entities two options
               in the event that their emissions exceeded their budget: either they could pay the tax, or
               they could purchase allowances auctioned by the government. The scheme would effectively
               become an ETS with a ceiling price, allowing additional government revenues to be raised
               and providing strong incentives to reduce emissions. It would also be possible to explore
               opportunities for linking with other ETSs under this approach.

            •	 If the country wants to pursue a price-based mechanism, as it has chosen to do to date, then
               the budget would also need to become increasingly stringent. However, no budget would be
               auctioned. Instead, as budgets became increasingly scarce, entities would end up paying the
               tax (buy-out price) over an increasing proportion of their emissions. Eventually the budgets
               could shrink to zero and the tax would need to be paid on all emissions.

In both cases, the implication would be that a pricing mechanism (either through a tax or a quantity
mechanism) would cover an increasing proportion of emissions over time, increasing the focus on the
polluter pays principle and providing increasingly strong incentives for the cost-effective structural
transition to a low-carbon economy. As identified above, the choice between these alternatives, the
speed at which it is pursued, and how it is introduced at a sectoral level, would be made much easier by
an agreed low-carbon vision for the South African economy.

        2.	 Introduce minimum price floor. In addition to the maximum ‘buy-out’ price discussed above, the
            opportunity to introduce a minimum floor price should be pursued. This would provide entities
            with a stronger incentive to undertake low-carbon investment and innovation which will require
            a minimum carbon price in order to be profitable. The precise modality for introducing the floor
            price would depend on which of the two alternatives identified above was pursued.



7.3  Treatment of the electricity sector
Within this short- and long-term vision for how the budget and tax systems might be aligned, there
are two different options for the treatment of the electricity sector. Once again, the choice between


16
     Entities exposed to considerable international competition would have the stringency of their budgets adjusted at a slower rate.
17
     Which may align with the planned decarbonisation of the power sector in the IRP.
6 6 	Integration o f t h e Ca r b o n Ta x a n d Ca r b o n Bu d g e t s i n S o u t h A f r i c a




them would require an agreed vision on the structure of the power sector in South Africa’s low-carbon
transition.

   1.	 Electricity sector treated like the rest of the economy

       Under the first option, the electricity sector would be treated similarly to the rest of the economy.
       In the short term, entities within the sector would have a budget set and be required to pay a tax
       for emissions in excess of the budget. These budgets would be informed by the IRP and the PPD
       trajectory, but would act as a compliance instrument (as they would elsewhere in the economy)
       rather than just as planning tools. The budget may even be relatively tighter than elsewhere in the
       economy given the relative lack of leakage issues in the electricity sector and because a relatively
       tight budget would likely lead to a carbon price signal being embedded in electricity prices,
       including among household consumers who will be exempt from budgets. Firms other than
       Eskom would have the option to trade their budget. However, Eskom, for the same reasons as for
       Sasol, would likely need to face restrictions on the extent that it could trade its budget, at least in
       the short term. This restriction could potentially be as extreme as to completely limit trading.

       A broadly common treatment between the electricity sector and the rest of the economy is con-
       sistent with a view in which the sector is steadily reformed into a competitive market with cost-
       reflective prices and all firms responding to incentives in a commercial fashion. It would promote
       the alignment of South Africa with international best practice on both mitigation policy and
       power sector structure. Indeed, the greater use of carbon pricing envisioned in either of the two
       medium–long-term alternatives set out in section 7.2 could be one part of the package of reforms
       to promote power sector reform in the country; successful power sector reform would be consis-
       tent with either of these alternatives.

       An implication of this approach is that electricity prices would increase for all consumers in
       proportion to the carbon intensity of the generation mix. While this is an important mechanism
       through which emissions reductions are incentivised, it could create concerns over the impact on
       vulnerable households and competitiveness concerns within industry. There are various options
       for dealing with the negative impacts, with the most attractive involving use of the benefit system
       to increase household budgets, rather than adjusting electricity tariffs in a way that distorts the
       incentive to reduce emissions.

   2.	 The second alternative would be to apply a differential instrument in the electricity genera-
       tion sector. This approach would be consistent with the electricity sector remaining broadly as
       it is today, with regulation not allowing an across-the-board increase in electricity price; Eskom
       continuing to dominate the sector; and with the view that the governance arrangements of Eskom
       are unlikely to lead it to respond effectively to mechanisms that place increasing emphasis on a
       carbon pricing signal.

       In this scenario, it may make more sense to place a budget on Eskom that just focuses on its
       carbon intensity. This budget would be informed by the IRP and the PPD. The existing gover-
       nance structures between Eskom and the government would be used to ensure compliance with
       the intensity-based budget. At the same time, other entities would have their Scope 2 emissions
       included within their carbon budgets (based on an estimated emissions intensity of the electricity
       sector that would be updated periodically). This would provide an incentive for firms to reduce
       their Scope 2 emissions without an across-the-board increase in electricity price, which may have
Conclusions 	                                                                                           67




     adverse impacts on vulnerable households (although it would also mean that these households
     would face a weaker incentive to improve their electricity efficiency, hence reducing overall emis-
     sions certainty). It could also increase the liquidity in the market for trading of budgets as many
     entities in South Africa have more Scope 2 emissions than Scope 1 emissions. As noted above,
     this is an approach that is consistent with how the regulated electricity sector has been treated in
     other emissions reduction schemes, such as in the Republic of Korea.

        classifies existing approaches to highlight differences, second, distils main lessons from
international experience and, third, provides a brief overview of selected existing schemes and
their specific lessons valuable to South Africa.

Empirical evidence of the results of combining carbon budgets and taxes is rare and the
insights of this annex are focused on theoretical and ex-ante evaluations. Only the Climate
Change Agreements (CCA) in the UK have been empirically assessed for their effectiveness. Evi-
dence in other jurisdictions is based on theoretical and ex-ante evaluations and modelling.



Classification of approaches
Established schemes can be grouped into how a carbon price is provided and what role, if any,
carbon budgets play. Figure 5 shows the schemes reviewed across two dimensions: whether and
how they use a carbon budget and whether a carbon price is introduced through a tax or an ETS.

Carbon budgets can play a role either as planning tool or as a compliance instrument. Econ-
omy-wide carbon emissions targets and associated budgets, as used, for instance, in France
and the UK, are used as planning tools. They target overall emissions reduction needs and help
inform what proportion of abatement may come from different instruments. However, in some
of these cases, such as the UK, it is the government that faces the legal obligation to meet the
economy-wide emissions budget, not individual entities. By contrast, some jurisdictions use
­
budgets as compliance tools to restrict emissions from individual entities or sectors. For instance,
Switzerland levies a fine on entities exceeding their agreed budget18 and the UK provides a
discount on a carbon-based energy tax to entities that comply from a budget. In other cases,
jurisdictions have moved away from using budgets as a compliance tool in favour of an ETS, such
as Korea.

South Africa, at the moment, would place a price on carbon via a tax but at the same time
use budgets as a compliance instrument to reduce emissions. Hybrid interface options (ETS,

      Firms can elect to be covered by the ETS instead of a budget.

             absolute and emissions intensity baseline and credit) would move South Africa toward the right-
             hand side of the classification, whereas layering and budget enforced by tax would leave South
             Africa in its current position.



             Main Lessons
             Several main lessons for South Africa can be drawn from international experience:

               •	 Budgets are more commonly used as planning tools than as compliance instruments. For
                  instance, France, the UK, and California use budgets at the overall economy or sectoral level,
                  but these are used to help stakeholders understand overall policy intent. In the UK, it is the
                  UK government that is legally bound to meet its carbon budget.

               •	 Voluntary budgets may not deliver significant emissions reductions. The UK’s experience
                  with its Climate Change Agreements, a voluntary carbon budget which reduces the cost of a
                  carbon tax on energy, shows that lax budgets failed to provide low-cost abatement that could
                  have been delivered if the full rate of the carbon tax on energy had been applied (Martin
                  et al., 2009). Given the relative uncertainty about abatement costs and potential in countries,
                  South Africa included, this implies that interface options providing a continued incentive to
                  abate by creating an explicit price of carbon, such as by allowing budgets to be traded, could
                  deliver additional abatement without imposing undue costs.

               •	 Few jurisdictions combine carbon budgets and taxes explicitly and, if so, mainly use taxes for
                  emissions not covered by budgets (within emissions trading systems, for example)—that is, as
                  differential instruments. For instance, Switzerland levies a tax on fossil fuels used by entities
    72
A n n e x A : I n t e r n at i o n a l E x p e r i e n c e 	                                         73




     not covered in their respective emissions trading schemes. Separately, under certain circum-
     stances, firms can opt out of the tax if they agree to a voluntary budget.

 •	 However, approaches creating different carbon prices across and within sectors have raised
    concerns about cost efficiency and equitable treatment. Different carbon prices applied to
    entities within an ETS and covered by a tax in Switzerland and France have raised concerns
    about the efficiency of differentiated instruments. (Sceia, Altamirano-Cabrerac, Vielled, &
    Weidmanne, 2012; Papaix & Meurisse, 2013)

 •	 Trading has been used to avoid inefficiency resulting from different carbon prices within
    and across sectors. Japan and South Korea have started from entity-specific budgets to
    incorporate emissions trading. Japan is most akin to an absolute baseline and credit scheme,
    whereas South Korea moved to an ETS. Both jurisdictions demonstrate how entity-specific
    budgets can evolve into interface options including trading, whereas a tax could evolve to
    play the role of price floors and/or ceilings.

 •	 Transitioning to trading—and hybrid interface options—require establishing and strengthen-
    ing MRV processes and institutions. The Korea ETS evolved from the Target Management
    Scheme that set emissions caps for entities and established MRV processes and institutional
    capacity, particularly for firms. Similarly, the de-facto absolute baseline and credit scheme
    in Tokyo and Saitama evolved from installation level carbon budgets that introduced selling
    and purchasing credits instead of paying a fixed fee on emissions exceeding budgets. The
    process in South Africa until 2020 could establish the foundation for such an evolution into
    hybrid interface options and can take the stepping stone over a budget with tax on an excess
    emissions option.

 •	 Price ceilings and floors can help generate more cost certainty for budgets and improve
    long-term investment allocation. The California ETS ensures continued abatement via a price
    floor that has been successfully implemented and rises over time. While few schemes have a
    hard price ceiling (the Alberta Specified Gas Emitter Regulation being an exemption), the EU
    ETS and the California ETS contain a soft price ceiling, meaning that at certain market prices
    additional allowances are released to reduce or halt the increase in prices.



Selected country details
This section summarises background information on selected countries, presenting the current
scheme and lessons learned that are applicable to South Africa.



The United Kingdom
Current scheme

Through the CCA/CCL process, the United Kingdom uses budgets both as a planning tool and
compliance instrument:

 •	 the Climate Change Levy (CCL) is a tax on different types of energy delivered to nondomestic
    users to incentivise an increase in energy efficiency and to reduce emissions.
7 4 	Integration o f t h e Ca r b o n Ta x a n d Ca r b o n Bu d g e t s i n S o u t h A f r i c a




               •	 Climate Change Agreements (CCA) are voluntary agreements made by the UK industry and
                  the Environment Agency to reduce energy use and carbon dioxide emissions. They function
                  like sector level carbon budgets. In return, operators receive a discount of 90 percent on the
                  CCL for electricity and 65 percent on the CCL for other fuels. Fifty-three business sectors par-
                  ticipate in CCAs, including: aerospace, steel, cement, plastics, glass, chemicals, and food and
                  drink. Sectors failing to meet targets lose discounts on CCLs for the next three years. Other-
                  wise, they are recertified and entitled to the discount in the next period.

             The CCA is evaluated as having been ineffective in delivering cost-effective emissions reduc-
             tions. Eighty-eight, 98 and 99 percent of entities were recertified in the first, second and third
             target periods, respectively, as negotiated budgets were seen as nonbinding, influenced in part
             also by sectors being able to choose their own baseline year. Martin et al. (2009) estimates that
             budgets could have been tightened or abolished with a better performance: ‘Had the CCL been
             implemented at the full rate for all businesses, further cuts in energy use of substantial magnitude
             could have been achieved without jeopardizing economic performance.’

             Carbon budgets also serve as planning tools to guide overall decarbonisation goals until 2050.

             Lessons

                 1.	 While budgets will deliver more emissions certainty, it is not intrinsically the case that they
                     will deliver greater emissions reductions. This depends on whether the implicit carbon
                     price in the budget is higher or lower than the explicit carbon price.

                 2.	 Options where firms or sectors can choose to opt in to one or other instrument are likely
                     to be attractive for political economy reasons and concerns over international competi-
                     tiveness, but are likely to be less effective at delivering emissions reductions.



             France
             Current scheme

             France aligns a carbon budget, carbon tax and EU ETS to ensure minimal overlap and increase
             additionality. It has:

               •	 a domestic carbon tax on natural gas, heating oil, coal and transport fuels that will increase
                  from EUR7/tonne to EUR56/tonne by 2020 and EUR100/tonne in 2030. Companies in the EU
                  ETS are exempt;

               •	 an economy level carbon budget whereby it will cut its GHG output by 40 percent by 2030,
                  and by 75 percent by 2050 (below 1990 levels); and

               •	 sector level carbon budgets ( ) have been set for three time periods, i.e., 2015–18, 2019–23
                  and 2024–28, and are aimed at industries not included in the EU ETS. However, these bud-
                  gets are used as planning tools rather than compliance instruments.

Lessons

     1.	 France is an example of a country that explicitly carved out different instruments for differ-
         ent emissions, e.g., only sectors not in the EU ETS are subject to the carbon tax and the
         budgeting approaches. This was explicitly done to avoid policy overlap.

     2.	 Budgets are more common at the sectoral level rather than at the firm level, and they are
         typically considered as policy objectives not policy instruments.

     3.	 Introducing multiple (pricing) instruments into different sectors of the economy can lead
         to concerns over inter-sectoral equity and perceived complexity—as illustrated by the
         Constitutional Council’s initial rejection of the carbon tax. Papaix and Meurisse (2013)
         claim that the rejection was ‘most probably because the rationale was not entirely under-
         stood by the stakeholders’. It was claimed that the incidence of the tax with respect to
         non-ETS firms versus ETS firms and households violated the principle of sharing costs
         equally, despite the rationale of avoiding overlap.



Tokyo and Saitama
Current scheme

Tokyo’s top-down approach disaggregates a city-wide target to installation-level caps coupled
with trading.

Tokyo’s municipal government has a GHG reduction target of 25 percent of 2000 levels by 2020
on which it derives targets for each sector required to meet this jurisdiction-wide target, resulting
in an absolute baseline and credit system, covering 40 percent of the commercial and industrial
sectors, with a similar mechanism in Saitama.
7 6 	Integration o f t h e Ca r b o n Ta x a n d Ca r b o n Bu d g e t s i n S o u t h A f r i c a




             The schemes in Tokyo and Saitama include mandatory installation level carbon budgets for differ-
             ent entities:

               •	 office buildings and district cooling/heating plants are expected to reduce emissions from a
                  base level by 8 percent in the first period (fiscal year 2010–15) and 17 percent in the second
                  (FY 2015–19); and

               •	 factories and facilities with heavier use of district and cooling plants must reduce emissions
                  by 6 percent in the first period and 15 percent in 2015–20.

             Entities must comply with their company specific target either by reducing their emissions or by
             purchasing credits, either at a fixed price or from other entities below their budgets.

             The city governments claim that the approach has reduced their CO2e emissions in line with or
             ahead of targets; however, the system faces limited external scrutiny and verification, and external
             effects, such as tighter energy efficiency measures and electricity price rises following the 2011
             Fukushima disaster, may have contributed to emissions reductions.

             Trading has been limited. Firms banked first period allowances for use in the second period,
             reflecting that budgets may have been lax in the first period due, likely, to external circumstances.
             However, they are expected to become stricter in the future. (Dabner, 2013)

             Lessons

                 1.	 Firm-specific budgets with trading allowed was perceived to be a simpler and quicker
                     approach to introduce a market-based carbon pricing scheme than having to address
                     issues around allowance allocation under a full-fledged ETS.

                 2.	 The establishment of economy-wide and sectoral targets made it easier to identify
                     company-specific caps.

                 3.	 Budgets may need to be more flexible to adapt to changing circumstances. While some
                     factors influencing the effectiveness of budgets are unforeseen, such as Fukushima, other
                     influences, such as tightening energy efficiency measures or electricity price increases, are
                     more predictable yet can still distort the strictness of budgets within their period without
                     adjustment.



             Switzerland
             Current scheme

             Switzerland aligns an ETS, a carbon tax, and a voluntary carbon budget, each of which covers dif-
             ferent types of entities:

               •	 Emissions trading system: large companies with an installed total thermal input of 20 MW or
                  more have to participate while the choice is optional for medium to smaller sized companies.
                  A link to the EU ETS is scheduled for 2016 to lower costs and level the field between Swiss
                  and EU firms.


    76
A n n e x A : I n t e r n at i o n a l E x p e r i e n c e 	                                                     77




  •	 Carbon levy: a rate per tCO2e is imposed on fossil fuels for installations not in the ETS. Small
     and medium sized companies engaged in particular industrial activities are exempt; the levy
     also does not affect motor fuels. The levy price acts as a hard price ceiling, since covered
     entities can join the ETS voluntarily and opt out of paying the levy. A third of the revenue is
     earmarked for programmes to cut emissions in the building sector; the rest is redistributed.

  •	 Voluntary GHG reductions: companies engaged in particular industrial activities that emit
     more than 100 tonnes of CO2e per year can be exempt from the CO2 levy if they commit to
     a voluntary reduction. The voluntary reduction determines the quantity of greenhouse gases
     that the company may emit during the commitment period. The emissions target is calcu-
     lated from the starting point along a linear reduction course to the end point in the year
     2020. The results are yet to be evaluated, with an evaluation only anticipated in 2021. Failure
     to meet commitments incurs tax and a penalty.

The combination of the levy and the ETS creates different carbon prices across the economy. This
divergence has only grown more significant thanks to an automatic adjustment mechanism in the
carbon levy, which increases automatically in the subsequent year.19

Lessons

      1.	 Switzerland is a further example of a country that explicitly carved out different instru-
          ments for different emissions, e.g., only sectors not in the EU ETS are subject to the car-
          bon tax and the budgeting approaches. This was explicitly done to avoid policy overlap.

      2.	 However, different instruments may still create concerns over inefficiency due to different
          explicit and implicit carbon prices, resulting in some firms undertaking more abatement
          effort than others (even if it is more costly for them to do so). The difference in carbon
          prices in different sectors creates inefficiencies as some sectors and installations face dif-
          ferent costs to others: ‘If a uniform CO2 tax is used instead of the combination of instru-
          ments, the negative welfare effects are smaller. The difference can be seen as the loss of
          efficiency caused by the differentiation of the carbon price among sectors’ (Sceia et al.,
          2012).



California
Current scheme

California uses a state-wide cap-and-trade scheme (ETS) with a price floor and soft price ceiling,
which covers 85 percent of emissions. It is based on state-level targets to reduce GHG emissions
to 1990 levels by 2020, to 40 percent below that level by 2030, and to 80 percent below 1990
levels by 2050. To that end it features a declining total cap shrinking by approximately 3 percent
each year from the second compliance period (starting 2015) onward.



19	
    The levy price rose from US$10 (CHF12) to US$30 (CHF36) from 2008 to 2010, and from US$63 (CHF60) to US$88
(CHF84) at the beginning of 2016, approximately six to eight times that of the allowances in the ETS.
7 8 	Integration o f t h e Ca r b o n Ta x a n d Ca r b o n Bu d g e t s i n S o u t h A f r i c a




             This ETS includes a price floor (effectively a tax) and a price ceiling. The price floor (legally bind-
             ing) is set at US$13.73, increasing by 5 percent annually. A February 2015 auction sold 77.39
             million allowances at this price. The price ceiling is ensured through allowances held in strategic
             reserve which can be released into the market should costs rise too high.20

             The California ETS has been successfully meeting its targets so far. However, lower than predicted
             emissions growth has resulted in allowance prices hovering only slightly above the price floor.

             Lessons

                   1.	 Ex ante work on ETS with price floors and ceilings finds that they can produce optimal
                       outcomes under economy-wide abatement scenarios. Pizer (2002) simulates the welfare
                       gains and losses incurred under the use of price, quantity, and hybrid instruments to
                       encourage emissions abatement. A ‘trigger’ price (price ceiling) at which additional per-
                       mits are sold by the government makes a permit system much more efficient (a five-fold
                       increase), ‘while preserving the political appeal of permits: the ability to flexibly distribute
                       the rents associated with emission rights’.

                   2.	 In addition, price floors and ceilings may be preferred to only one or the other. Burtraw
                       et al. (2009) model ETS programmes with a price floor and ceiling, compared to one with
                       no controls, and one with only a ceiling. They use a linear approximation to model uncer-
                       tain natural gas prices, and find the double-sided price controls preserve investment in
                       non-emitting technologies. The ‘one-sided’ programme is inferior in this respect.



             South Korea
             Scheme

             South Korea has implemented an emissions trading system with a soft price ceiling. The Republic
             of Korea’s ETS (KETS) covers direct emissions of six Kyoto gases as well as indirect emissions from
             energy consumption, for a total of 68 percent of the country’s emissions from 23 subsectors. The
             KETS evolved from a command-and-control tool called the Target Management Scheme (TMS),
             which set emissions caps for more than 500 entities, from any sector, with emissions over a certain
             threshold. Companies that failed to report emissions under the imposed level would have to pay
             a fine on emissions up to a maximum of US$8,800.

             It contains a soft price ceiling similar to the California ETS: around 5 percent of the allowances
             distributed in Phase 1 were held in reserve as a price stabilisation mechanism. Additional flex-
             ibility to promote price stability comes from unrestricted banking and limited borrowing of
             allowances.




             20	
                 Four percent of the total number of allowances are held, in three tiers. The lowest tier allowances were priced at
             US$40 in 2014 with the price increasing at 5 percent plus inflation each year.

Lessons

     1.	 The TMS in Korea suggests that it is possible to move from mandatory budgets to a
         scheme involving trading. Entities were obliged to report historical emissions to con-
         trolling agencies and to set emissions targets, as well as specific implementation plans,
         in conjuncture with those agencies, and the grandfathering method was used, setting
         targets according to a baseline year, and a reduction factor the same for all entities within
         the same sector. A survey of entities under the TMS found that they felt it had succeeded
         in assisting with the transition. Many firms claimed that ‘the TMS provided an exceptional
         opportunity to prepare . . . especially in building corporate capacities in preparing for
         third party verifications and creating emissions accounts.’ (Yoon & Won, 2013)

     2.	 The stringency of targets might depend on the maturity of the scheme. In order to
         encourage the acceptance of future measures, a ‘collaborative governance approach’,
         with caps negotiated between government and firm, was the focus. In addition, the pen-
         alties were not as stringent as might be expected from formal regulation. (Global Green
         Growth Institute, 2015)



Chile
Current scheme

Chile has signed a carbon tax into law, scheduled to be implemented in 2017. This replaced pro-
posals for an ETS. The tax will cover 42 percent of all fossil fuels—55 percent of CO2 emissions—
applied to entities that produce >50 MW of energy. Its rate is planned to be set at approximately
US$5/tCO2e.

Lesson

The tax and the monitoring, reporting, and verification system are being designed so as to be
compatible with an ETS in the future. It has been explicitly noted that the carbon tax could func-
tion as a floor price in the future were an ETS to be introduced.

                 Box 4.  National Development Plan

                 The National Development Plan identifies 14 explicit principles

                      1.	 Just, ethical and sustainable. Recognise the aspirations of South Africa as a developing
                          country and remain mindful of its unique history.

                      2.	 Global solidarity. Justly balance national interests with collective action in relation to
                          environmental risks and existential threats.

                      3.	 Ecosystems protection. Acknowledge that human well-being is dependent on the health
                          of the planet.

                      4.	 Full cost accounting. Internalise both environmental and social costs in planning and
                          investment decisions, recognising that the need to secure environmental assets may be
                          weighed against the social benefits accrued from their use.

                      5.	 Strategic planning. Follow a systematic approach that is responsive to emerging risk and
                          opportunity, and which identifies and manages trade-offs.

                      6.	 Transformative. Address the structural and systemic flaws of the economy and society
                          with strength of leadership, boldness, visionary thinking, and innovative planning.

                      7.	 Managed transition. Build on existing processes and capacities to enable society to
                          change in a structured and phased manner.

                      8.	 Opportunity-focused. Look for synergies between sustainability, growth, competitive-
                          ness, and employment creation, for South Africa to attain equality and prosperity.

                      9.	 Effective participation of social partners. Be aware of mutual responsibilities, engage on
                          differences, seek consensus, and expect compromise through social dialogue.

                     10.	 Balance evidence collection with immediate action. Recognise the immediate tools
                          needed for informed action.

                     11.	 Sound policymaking. Develop coherent and aligned policy that provides predictable
                          signals, while being simple, feasible, and effective.

                     12.	 Least regret. Invest early in low-carbon technologies that are least-cost, to reduce emis-
                          sions and position South Africa to compete in a carbon-constrained world.

                     13.	 Regional approach. Develop partnerships with neighbours in the region to promote
                          mutually beneficial collaboration on mitigation and adaptation.

                     14.	 Accountability and transparency. Lead and manage, as well as monitor, verify, and report
                          on the transition.

     Box 5.  National Climate Change Response White Paper

     The White Paper identifies nine explicit principles:

          1.	 Common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Aligning our
              domestic measures to reduce the country’s GHG emissions and adapt to the adverse
              effects of climate change with our unique national circumstances, stage of development,
              and capacity to act.

          2.	 Equity. Ensuring a fair allocation of effort, cost, and benefits in the context of the need
              to address disproportionate vulnerabilities, responsibilities, capabilities, disparities, and
              inequalities.

          3.	 Special needs and circumstances. Considering the special needs and circumstances of
              localities and people that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate
              change, including vulnerable groups such as women, and especially poor and/or rural
              women; children, especially infants and child-headed families; the aged; the sick; and the
              physically challenged.

          4.	 Uplifting the poor and vulnerable. Climate change policies and measures should address
              the needs of the poor and vulnerable and ensure human dignity, while endeavouring to
              attain environmental, social, and economic sustainability.

          5.	 Intra- and Inter-generational sustainability. Managing our ecological, social, and eco-
              nomic resources and capital responsibly for current and future generations.

          6.	 The Precautionary Principle. Applying a risk-averse and cautious approach, which takes
              into account the limits of current knowledge about the consequences of decisions and
              actions.

          7.	 The Polluter Pays Principle. Those responsible for harming the environment paying the
              costs of remedying pollution and environmental degradation and supporting any adap-
              tive response that may be required.

          8.	 Informed participation. Enhancing public awareness and understanding of climate
              change causes and impacts to promote participation and action at all levels.

          9.	 Economic, social and ecological pillars of sustainable development. Recognising that a
              robust and sustainable economy and a healthy society depends on the services that well-
              functioning ecosystems provide, and that enhancing the sustainability of the economic,
              social, and ecological services is an integral component of an effective and efficient
              climate change response.

     And a further six factors that will guide the overall approach to its climate response:

          1.	 Needs-driven and customised—Employing a wide range of different types of adaptation
              and mitigation approaches, policies, measures, programmes, interventions, and actions
              consistent with the principles outlined above, but in particular, that meet the special
              needs and circumstances of those most vulnerable as well as being specifically tailored


                                                                                                      (continued)

                        to the potential, best available solutions, and other relevant conditions related to the
                        specific actor, organisation, sector, or subsector concerned;

                    2.	 Developmental—Prioritising climate change responses that have both significant mitiga-
                        tion and adaptation benefits and that also have significant economic growth, job cre-
                        ation, public health, risk management, and poverty alleviation benefits;

                    3.	 Transformational, empowering, and participatory—Implementing policies and measures
                        to address climate change at a ‘scale of economy’ that enables and supports the required
                        level of innovation, sector and skills development, finance, and investment flows needed
                        to reap the full benefit of a transition to a lower-carbon, efficient, job-creating, equitable,
                        and competitive economy. The transition will necessarily be supported and enabled by
                        policies and measures to empower and promote the participation of all citizens through
                        changing their behaviour to more sustainable lifestyles and livelihoods. This policy is
                        therefore part of the broader social and economic transformation . . . and is funda-
                        mentally underpinned by a major shift toward sustainable consumption and production
                        patterns, which decouples growth and development from any negative impacts on the
                        environment and society;

                    4.	 Dynamic and evidence-based—Recognising that this policy has not been developed in a
                        vacuum and many sectors have already researched and have experience in implementing
                        policies and measures to address the challenges of climate change;

                    5.	 Balanced and cost effective—Implementing a balanced approach to both climate change
                        mitigation and adaptation responses in terms of cost-benefit, prioritisation, focus, action,
                        and resource allocation; and

                    6.	 Integrated and aligned—Providing for the integration of sector-related climate change
                        responses into the relevant sector planning processes and their developmental policies
                        and measures.

     Box 6.  Carbon Budget Design Document

     The Carbon Budget Design Document identifies principles in relation to coverage, company
     selection, and budget allocation.

     Coverage principles:

          1.	 Consistency between allocation and accounting—coverage of gases and activities should
              be identical with respect to any emissions data which is used for allocating carbon bud-
              gets, and any emissions data which is used at the end of Phase 1 of the carbon budget-
              ing period to determine whether a company has exceeded its budget or not.

          2.	 Consistency between accounting and reporting—since the accounting process will
              be wholly dependent on the reporting process envisaged in the draft GHG reporting
              regulations:

     	          i.	 no data which is not reported will be eligible for use in the accounting process; and
     	         ii.	 the basis for reporting and accounting should be identical with respect to gases,
                    emissions factors, and common metrics.

     Companies to be allocated carbon budgets:

          1.	 Company definition—person undertaking a greenhouse gas emitting activity as listed in
              the ‘IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (2006)’. To include Coal
              mining · Production and/or refining of crude oil · Production and/or processing of natural
              gas · Production of liquid fuels from coal or gas · Cement production · Glass production ·
              Ammonia production · Nitric acid production · Carbon black · Iron and steel production ·
              Ferro-alloys production · Aluminium production · Polymers production · Pulp and paper.

     Budget allocation in Phase 1:

          1.	 Support for existing operations—which means that CBs will be allocated to companies
              based on their existing emissions for their existing operations. No expectation that enti-
              ties will undertake additional mitigation.

          2.	 Any planned changes to emissions as a result of a change in emissions intensity, planned
              expansion. Allowance will be made for existing expansion plans for the budgeting
              period, based on the requisite information being provided by the company on planned
              expansions.

             National Treasury Documents


                 Box 7.  Carbon Tax Options Discussion Paper

                 The 2010 carbon tax paper identifies seven ‘issues which must be carefully addressed in carbon
                 tax design’

                     1.	 Emissions reduction effectiveness—The ability of the tax to reduce GHG emissions.

                     2.	 Rate of tax—To the degree possible, the tax rate should be aligned with the marginal
                         external damage costs of each additional unit of CO2e emissions.

                     3.	 Distributional implications—Government should take measures, either in tax design or
                         through complementary expenditure programmes, to offset the burden such a tax will
                         place on poor households.

                     4.	 Competitiveness—Industries that participate in international trade might be at a disad-
                         vantage when competing with countries that do not price carbon.

                     5.	 Technical and administrative feasibility—Consideration needs to be given to whether
                         the tax is placed on carbon emissions or a proxy for such emissions (e.g., fuel inputs or
                         outputs). The administrative and compliance costs of implementing the tax should be
                         weighed against the need to create the correct incentives.

                     6.	 Aligning policy objectives—The tax should be aligned with other government policy
                         interventions. For example, policies to reduce energy sector carbon emissions should not
                         be accompanied by policy measures that seek to encourage such emissions.

                     7.	 Legislative provisions—Robust legislation should provide certainty to the taxpayer and
                         minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion.

A n n e x B : n at i o n a l d o c u m e n t s 	                                                              87




     Box 8.  Environmental Fiscal Reform Paper

     The environmental fiscal reform paper identifies eight criteria for assessing environmental taxes

          •	   Emissions reduction effectiveness. There should, as far as possible, be a clear environ-
               mental objective and the tax must be well targeted to that objective.

          •	   Tax revenue. The level of tax revenues and the way in which they are used are important
               considerations. Certain environmentally related taxes will be capable of raising significant
               amounts of revenue, particularly where the demand for the good or service being taxed
               is price inelastic.

          •	   Support for the tax. Taxes are necessary to fund government activities and the provision
               of public goods and services. With every tax reform, there are likely to be winners and
               losers and these groups of stakeholders need to be clearly identified.

          •	   Legislative aspects. The Minister of Finance is responsible for the imposition of taxes,
               duties, and levies. Different environmentally related tax instruments may require different
               legislative amendments.

          •	   Technical and administrative issues. Ideally, the tax base should be as close as possible to
               the environmental objective although in certain cases, a proxy may be required. Where
               there is a clear environmental objective, the tax rate should be set according to the level
               of the externality. Where this is not possible, the tax rate must be sufficient to achieve
               the environmental (and/or fiscal) objective. Minimising the possibilities of tax avoidance,
               tax evasion, compliance, and collection costs are other important design considerations.

          •	   Competitiveness effects. The impact of environmentally related taxes on domestic indus-
               tries and other aspects of the economy such as employment and inflation are of critical
               importance. Where impacts on competitiveness are deemed ex ante to be unacceptable,
               mitigation measures may need to be considered.

          •	   Distributional impact. The possibility of making environmentally related taxes progressive
               should be integral to the design of any proposed instrument. Where there are likely to be
               adverse impacts on income distribution, mitigation, or compensation measures may need
               to be considered.

          •	   Adjoining policy areas. The extent to which environmentally related taxes can assist in
               meeting other government policy objectives is an important consideration. The extent to
               which environmentally related taxes can be designed to contribute to policy goals such
               as job creation, poverty alleviation, and the expansion of basic services is also important.
