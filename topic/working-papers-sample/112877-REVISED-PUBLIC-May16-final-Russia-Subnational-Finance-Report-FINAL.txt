    The aim of this note is to present and analyze subnational fiscal trends in Russia in the context of overall slowing
    economic growth and falling oil prices over the last few years. In particular, in 2015, GDP fell by 3.7 percent.
    Despite efforts to cut expenditures, the federal deficit increased to 2.4 percent of GDP. Subnational governments
    were also affected by the economic slowdown. Aggregate subnational revenues declined, in real terms, by 6
    percent between 2014 and 2015. Revenues from taxes (including shares of federal taxes) fell by 4 percent while
    federal transfers fell by 13 percent. Nevertheless, the aggregate fiscal performance of subnational governments
    actually improved over this period. The nadir of subnational government finances occurred in 2013, when the
    consolidated subnational deficit reached 0.9 percent of GDP. Since then, it has shrunk. In 2015, the deficit was
    equal to only 0.2 percent of GDP. This was largely achieved by drastic cuts in spending. Spending in the social and
    infrastructure sectors both fell by 9 percent in real terms between 2014 and 2015. This note examines the fiscal
    prospects of subnational governments in Russia, focusing particularly on the nature of these spending cuts and
    whether they are sustainable over the medium term.

Russia: Subnational Governments’ Fiscal Response to the Economic Downturn                                                                          1
    BOX 1: Russian federalism in the international context
    In aggregate terms, the degree of fiscal decentralization in Russia is similar to that of other large, middle-to-
    high income federal countries. The first figure below shows the share of total general government expenditures
    that are accounted for by subnational governments in Canada, the U.S., Australia, Russia, Brazil, and Germany.
    As shown, Russia is not unusual. It is less decentralized by this measure than the U.S. or Canada but roughly
    on par with the other three comparators. Another way to measure decentralization is to look at the size of
    subnational government as a share of GDP. Again, Russian subnational governments are not as large as those
    in Canada, but they are roughly on par with those in the U.S., Germany, and Brazil. Interestingly, the split in
    Russia between spending at the regional level and at the local (municipal) level is also similar to that in the
    U.S., Brazil, and Germany.

    This has not always been the case; In the 1990s, tariffs were set far
    below levels sufficient to cover operating costs, but since 1997, the
    federal government has set national norms for the percentage of total
    costs of communal services to be recovered from household bills.
    According to the World Bank’s 2006 infrastructure report, the norm
    was gradually raised from 35 percent in 1997 to 100 percent in 2005.

  BOX 3: Sharing the corporate income tax
  Russia is unusual in sharing such a large proportion of CIT with subnational governments—and sharing it on
  the basis of origin. Most countries in the region only share the PIT. While some (such as Germany) share the
  VAT, sharing is not on the basis of origin, but rather on the basis of population and other factors.

  The most obvious argument against sharing the CIT on the basis of origin is that CIT revenues tend to be
  concentrated in a few large cities where most companies are registered. As a result, the CIT does not provide
  much revenue to other places. But there is a more fundamental drawback: As a general principle, the taxpayers
  of one jurisdiction should not be allowed to impose the costs of the services they consume on taxpayers who
  live elsewhere. CIT sharing allows them to do so. Although CIT revenues are collected from companies, the
  ultimate burden of the tax is shifted—backward onto stockholders or labor, or forward onto consumers. There
  is no reason to believe that these stockholders, workers, or consumers are located in the jurisdiction where
  the company is registered. As a result, sharing the CIT on the basis of origin allows the residents of places
  where companies tend to be registered (e.g., Moscow and St. Petersburg) to extract implicit subsidies from
  residents of other jurisdictions. The current arrangement, in which CIT revenues are partly distributed on the
  basis of the location of company assets and labor, goes some way to addressing this, but not entirely.

  One solution to this problem would be to entirely abolish CIT sharing on the basis of origin. Instead, the
  subnational share of CIT revenues could be folded into the pool of resources used to finance the equalization
  transfer. In this way, the equalization transfer would aim to reduce per capita disparities only in the PIT.

  BOX 4: Russia’s equalization transfer: Good practice?
  In most respects, Russia’s current equalization transfer represents good practice. It has a logical target (bringing
  the per capita discretionary revenues of all regions up to a uniform percentage of the national average) and is
  based on objective, readily measurable variables. The general design of the formula for determining the level
  and distribution of the transfer is fixed in law and is therefore stable and relatively invulnerable to short term
  political pressures.

  The system does, however, have its critics. Some would argue that it is too complex, given the variety of
  adjustment factors and the two-stage process for calculating the amount due to each region. Others would
  say that it places too much of the risk of economic fluctuations on the federal government (as noted in the
  main text, the transfer represents an open-ended commitment by the federal government to bring the per
  capita revenues of each regional government up to the target level, regardless of the amount required). Some
  would say it is insufficiently equalizing, noting the wide variation in per capita revenues that remains even
  after the transfer is distributed.

  But these characteristics represent policy choices; tradeoffs between equally desirable objectives. The
  complexity of the transfer formula represents an effort to reflect variations in the unit costs of services among
  regions. The open-ended nature of the federal commitment reduces regional governments’ vulnerability to
  economic turbulence. The existing degree of equalization also represents a tradeoff. On one hand, it can be
  argued that regional taxpayers should be the ones who benefit from the taxes they pay; e.g., that the taxes
  paid by the people of Moscow should remain with the Moscow City Government. On the other hand, it can
  be argued that many of the services provided by subnational governments have implications that extend far
  beyond the boundaries of a single jurisdiction. One would not want the quality of education in a poor and
  remote region to depend solely on the strength of its tax base. In evaluating a transfer system, the relevant
  question is whether it strikes the right balance between these competing objectives.

 BOX 5: MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT REVENUES
 Regional governments have considerable discretion over the financing of their municipalities, subject to
 general guidelines in the Budget Code. The Code authorizes regional governments to use two instruments to
 provide general budget support (as opposed to earmarked funding for functions such as education) to their
 municipalities.

 First, they may assign a fixed percentage of their own taxes (including their shares of the personal income taxes)
 to their subordinate jurisdictions. As noted earlier, municipalities are legally entitled to 15 percent of the PIT
 revenues collected in their jurisdictions. (In the case of jurisdictions with two tiers of municipal government,
 the upper-tier’s share is 5 percent of the PIT in urban jurisdictions and 13 percent in rural jurisdictions.)
 However, regional governments may increase these percentages on their own cost, provided the shares are
 uniform for all municipalities and are distributed on the basis of origin.

 Second, they may establish formula-based Figure B3: Sources of municipal revenues
 equalization transfers. The Code envisions that
                                                                           5%
 these will be allocated on the basis of tax capacity

 shared taxing mechanisms and transfers.

 As shown in the figure above (Figure B3), shared taxes (consisting almost entirely of the PIT) constituted 18
 percent of municipal revenues in 2015. Transfers (including equalization transfers and earmarked transfers)
 constituted 64 percent. As noted earlier, municipalities are also entitled to 100 percent of the revenue from
 the simplified tax on imputed income, the building tax, the land tax, and the single agricultural tax revenues
 (municipalities do not administer these taxes but are allowed to set their rates). Together with various non-tax
 revenues, these account for 13 percent of municipal revenues.

     BOX 6: NON-CONTRACTUAL LIABILITIES
     The explicit fiscal difficulties of subnational governments are exacerbated by their implicit liabilities. These
     liabilities include: (1) public employees’ wage arrears, (2) deferred payables to suppliers of utilities to
     government institutions, (3) deferred payables and debt of regional and municipal public enterprises, and (4)
     liabilities of joint stock companies in which regional governments possess shares. The scale of these liabilities
     cannot be determined with the data at hand. Information on these liabilities is not collected and published
     on a regular basis by the federal government or by the regions. It would be worthy, nevertheless, of further
     investigation.

  BOX 7: DEBT REGULATIONS
  If subnational deficits persist, could borrowing get out of control? At present, subnational borrowing is
  controlled by a tight system of regulations. The current Budget Code sets out the regulations on subnational
  borrowing. These include three types of debt ceilings.

  The first refers to deficits. Budget deficits of regional governments may not exceed 15 percent of annual
  revenues. For municipalities, the ceiling is 10 percent. In both cases, the calculation of revenues excludes all
  intergovernmental transfers. In the case of municipalities, it also excludes revenues from shared regional taxes.
  Even tighter limits are placed on regions that are highly dependent on transfers. For regional governments
  that derived more than 40 percent of revenues from transfers during two of the three previous years, the
  deficit may not exceed 10 percent of revenues, excluding intergovernmental transfers. For municipalities that
  derived more than 50 percent of revenues from transfers, deficits may not exceed 5 percent of revenues
  (again, excluding transfers and shared regional taxes).

  The second ceiling refers to debt stocks. The Budget Code stipulates that the outstanding debt of a region or
  municipality may not exceed 100 percent of its annual revenues, excluding intergovernmental transfers. For
  transfer-dependent regions and municipalities, the ceiling is 50 percent.

  The third ceiling refers to debt service. The Budget Code stipulates that the debt service of a region or
  municipality may not exceed 15 percent of expenditures of the relevant year.

  Taken together (or even individually), these ceilings would appear to be quite restrictive. By excluding
  intergovernmental transfers (and shared taxes, in the case of municipalities) from the calculation of revenues,
  the ceilings severely limit borrowing by jurisdictions that are dependent on these sources. (Technically, a
  region that depended entirely on transfers would not be able to borrow at all.)

  Recent calculations of the debt-to-revenue ratios of each regional government indicate near-universal
  compliance with the Budget Code ceilings. But the ceilings have one loophole: until 2017, they do not apply
  to federal refinancing loans. If those loans are included, 18 of Russia’s 85 regions would exceed the ceilings;
  12 of the regions subject to the 100 percent ceiling and six of the transfer-dependent regions subject to the
  limit of 50 percent.

     BOX 8: FUNCTIONAL REVIEWS: A MIXED TRACK RECORD
     Some of the most ambitious efforts to right-size the public sector take the form of functional reviews. The
     scope of functional reviews varies. Some look broadly at the role of the public sector in order to identify
     functions that could be abandoned, privatized, or transferred to subordinate levels of government. Functional
     reviews also vary in terms of the units of government they cover. Some look at the entire public sector, while
     others look at specific ministries or even specific programs to see how existing functions could be performed
     more efficiently.

     The record of functional reviews is, at best, mixed. Several former socialist countries have used functional
     reviews to identify government activities that could best be performed by the private sector. This has led to
     the privatization of a wide range of formerly state-owned commercial and industrial enterprises. But efforts to
     right-size the residual functions of government—defense and internal security, public education, and health
     care—have been less successful.

     There are cases of ostensible success. One of the most widely cited is the Canadian comprehensive program
     review of 1994/95. The Canadian effort, launched after years of half-starts and in the midst of a fiscal crisis,
     required each agency of the federal government to review its own programs to determine which could
     be offloaded onto the provinces, the private sector, or abandoned altogether, or—if none of the above—
     performed more efficiently. The Canadian effort reportedly resulted in a 19 percent reduction in the federal
     workforce (although many positions were merely transferred to the provinces), reduced the number of
     ministries from 35 to 23, and eliminated 73 government agencies/boards.

     New Zealand’s functional review, while also focusing on paring down the role of the central government,
     attempted to increase accountability in the functions that remained. It restructured the government into
     departments whose functions could be quantitatively measured. Targets were then specified for each
     department and incorporated in performance agreements, whose results were monitored and, if met,
     rewarded.

     A very extensive set of sector-specific functional reviews has recently been completed in Romania. Eastern
     Europe has also seen more modest efforts such as the functional review of the Latvian Ministry of Agriculture.
     This identified and evaluated 161 separate functions within the ministry, of which nine were pegged for
     privatization, 40 for rationalization, and 12 for transfer to other ministries.
