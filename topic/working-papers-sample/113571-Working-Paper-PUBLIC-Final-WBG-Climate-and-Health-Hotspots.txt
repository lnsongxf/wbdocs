Climate change is a risk multiplier that threatens to unravel decades of development gains. Among the
most critical and direct risks to humans is the impact of climate change on health. Heat stress will worsen
as high temperatures become more common and water scarcity increases; malnutrition, particularly in
children, could become more prevalent in some parts of the world where droughts are expected to become
more frequent; and water- and vector-borne diseases are likely to expand in range as conditions favor mos-
quitoes, flies, and water-borne pathogens. Worse still, these threats will be greatest in regions where the
population is most dense, most vulnerable, and least equipped to adapt, pushing more people in poverty
and reinforcing a cycle of environmental degradation, poor health and slow development.
    Addressing these climate-associated health risks is critical. Alongside risk, there is opportunity. Responses
to climate change have unearthed significant potential for improving both human health and the environ-
ment. Low carbon hospitals can draw upon the many advances made by the energy sector in developing
cleaner and renewable resources. Pharmaceutical supply chains can benefit from more efficient and less
polluting transport. And food and nutrition can be improved by the advances achieved through climate-
smart agriculture.
    Climate change challenges are multi-sectoral and so too are the solutions. At the World Bank Group, we
are tackling different dimensions of these environment and health threats in different ways. For example,
the ‘Pollution Management and Environmental Health’ Trust Fund addresses air pollution, toxic land pol-
lution, and marine litter. Work on Climate-Smart Agriculture aims to sustainably increase food productivity
and human well-being in a changing climate. We are putting in place a new operational framework for
strengthening human, animal, and environmental health systems in response to disease threats. And within
the health sector, we have made Universal Health Coverage core and increasingly considerate of climate
change and resilience.
    At the World Bank Group, we work with the broader development community to create solutions that
can respond to and reduce these risks. Our work aligns with other global efforts aimed at improving envi-
ronmental and human health, such as the work of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, Global Alliance
for Clean Cookstoves, One Health and Planetary Health communities, and broader efforts to achieve the
Sustainable Development Goals.

      Along with developing approaches and interventions, identifying geographic “hotspots” will help target resources to maximize
  impact and minimize risk. This report draws on the latest literature to highlight those regions and countries most likely to be adversely
  impacted and where action is most needed. While it is not a comprehensive resource for climate and health geography, the report
  creates entry points for discussions with country-level stakeholders.
      The work presented here is expected to assist the development community in further mainstreaming climate change and health into
  development operations so that we may address the emerging needs of vulnerable communities, particularly women and children. We
  are committed to working with development practitioners around the world on climate change and health, capitalizing upon associ-
  ated opportunities and technologies, and contributing to the overall goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

Executive Summary


Climate change and the pollutants associated with it1 have impacts across many dimensions of life.
Importantly this includes the health of those who are living in areas most vulnerable to its effects and
who are subject to the various forms of air pollution that help drive climate change in the first place.
Accordingly, countries should be encouraged to place health improvements at the core of their efforts
to address climate change and its drivers, based on the best estimates of how they or their regions are
being impacted now and will be in the years ahead.
    Without proactive, integrated planning, the impacts of climate change will fall disproportionately on
the poorest people worldwide, further hampering efforts to alleviate poverty, provide universal health
coverage, and ensure shared prosperity. Climate impacts on population’s health can be direct (heat
waves, floods), or mediated through natural systems (air quality, water and vectors), or socioeconomic
systems (food production, health care, poverty). Naturally, climate change and the drivers behind it
affect countries differently, and each country will also differ in terms of its readiness and capacity to
cope with these developments and implications for national health. The question that has become
more pressing is which countries are most vulnerable to climate change and its drivers from a health
perspective and what they could do to mitigate or adapt in the face of this challenge.
    This report addresses this need by examining the latest climate change research and evaluating the
strength of national health systems worldwide to provide a guide to those countries that would most
benefit from immediate efforts to ensure that health considerations are at the forefront of climate change
adaptation responses and mitigation measures. We have drawn upon recognized vulnerability indices
related to health outcomes, data outlining the disease burden linked to pollution, and proxies that
measure country health systems’ performance or readiness to cope with increased burden of disease.
    The objective is not to rank countries, but rather to provide a ready guide to those most vulner-
able. The World Bank Group and others can then prioritize their efforts to help countries mitigate the
drivers of climate change (thereby alleviating the associated health impacts of air pollution) or adapt
to the impacts of climate change in their respective development policies and programs. It is important
to recognize that climate change and the emissions that promote it are not limited by national borders
or regional boundaries. However, the World Bank and others work with national governments to help
them adapt and mitigate impacts, requiring data provision and analysis on a country basis. It should
also be noted that threats can vary within countries, and indeed climate change and emissions might
well not even rank among a country’s most significant sources of death and disease in the face of other
health threats.
    As such, this work will inform the World Bank’s approach to health-related aspects of climate
change across its work with countries, including through a proposed 5-year action plan to integrate

Introduction


In the last 5 years, the number of voices calling for stronger international action on climate change and
health has increased,2 as has the scale and depth of activities. But current global efforts in climate and
health are inadequately integrated. As a result, actions to address climate change—including World
Bank Group investment and lending—are missing opportunities to simultaneously promote better
health outcomes and resilience.
     Accordingly, the World Bank Group has developed a 4-year action plan and new approaches to
integrate health-related climate considerations into World Bank sector plans and investments. This
“Approach and Action Plan” seeks to stimulate and support greater attention to both the health
dimensions of climate-smart investments across sectors and to climate risk in health sector knowledge
products and operations.
     An initial step—presented here—is the use of existing indicators to identify countries where climate
change, or exposure to drivers of climate change (i.e., kinds of air pollution), are expected to most
significantly alter the burden of disease and expose vulnerabilities in existing health systems. While
not based on primary analysis, this paper will serve as an initial filter, focusing the approach on spe-
cific countries or “hotspots” where World Bank operations can maximize positive health outcomes in
the face of climate change and its drivers, and to prioritize the approach on the basis of vulnerability
and exposure. The analysis presented in this work will ultimately be combined with sector analyses in
additional analytic work to further specify approaches to climate-health action.
     This paper begins by identifying the health impacts that are being felt today and that are projected
to worsen in the future without efforts to ensure health considerations are central to any and all cli-
mate change adaptation and mitigation measures. Chapter 1 includes an outline of the scope of health
impacts from climate change and its drivers, the means of transmission, and a description of the drivers
of climate change, and their sources.
     What is needed to ensure that health is put at the forefront of climate change action is a guide
to those countries most vulnerable to increasing numbers of deaths and greater illness from climate
change, and co-pollutants from GHG sources, referred to here as climate drivers. Chapter 2 describes
the methodology used to identify these nations and determine their preparedness for coping with these
impacts. Chapter 3 identifies hotspot countries based on this analysis, and narrows the focus to those
countries that are both most likely to bear the brunt of a greater burden of disease and death from
climate change and climate drivers, and that are the least ready to cope.
     Coping mechanisms—through mitigation and adaptation measures—are outlined in Chapter 4, as
are the multiple benefits that can be expected from multi-sector, concerted efforts to address health
impacts from climate change, and its drivers.

2  Climate change has been called both the ‘biggest global health threat’ and the ‘greatest global health opportunity” of the 21st
century (Costello, 2009; Watts, 2015). The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) has called climate change
“the defining global health threat of the 21st century,” and the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change has noted “a climate agreement is a global health agreement.”

          Change and Its Drivers


          The Scale and Scope of Health Impacts Due to Climate Change
          and Climate Drivers
          Climate change complicates the search for solutions to almost all development challenges and threatens
          to erase the many development gains of the past several decades. There is clear and mounting evidence
          that health outcomes will—in large part—be negatively impacted by climate change. Heat stress is
          seen increasing with higher temperatures. A growing number of climate-related extreme events such
          as floods and torrential rains could increase the incidence of waterborne diseases and affect crops,
          increase food insecurity and, potentially, undernutrition. Rising sea levels affect populations of entire
          islands and coastal areas. Rising average temperatures can open new areas to the transmission of certain
          vector-borne diseases (i.e., those transmitted by carriers such as insects). These effects are detailed
          below. The emissions that drive climate change are also associated with various public health threats
          through air quality impacts that are linked to respiratory and cardiac threats, as well as certain cancers.
              These impacts will be greatest in the poorest countries and regions where the populations are most
          dense, most vulnerable, and least equipped to adapt. Here, health and malnutrition hold the potential
          for broad intergenerational impacts; a whole generation of youth risks becoming disenfranchised and
          held back in school (World Bank, 2014). Moreover, in general, poor and disenfranchised groups, women,
          elderly and children, are most at risk (Smith et al., 2014; World Bank, 2012, 2013).
              Given the complexity of social and environmental factors that influence disease and health outcomes,
          the precise extent of these impacts is difficult to establish, though estimates from the most informed
          health sources expect climate change will increase the incidence of several diseases. The World Health
          Organization (WHO), for example, estimated in the early 2000s that climate change was already account-
          ing for an additional 150,000 deaths a year (WHO, 2004). Updated data suggest that, compared to a
          future without climate change (for the year 2030), an additional 38,000 deaths are expected due to heat
          exposure in elderly people, 48,000 due to diarrhea, 60,000 due to malaria, and 95,000 due to childhood
          undernutrition3 (WHO, 2014b). This will correspond to an additional 250,000 deaths per year from heat
          exposure, undernutrition, malaria, and diarrheal disease due to climate change each year from 2030
          through 2050. This estimate is low, however, because it does not include all climate-sensitive health
          impacts, such as pollution, injuries, non-malarial infectious diseases, and others for which projection
          data are lacking (WHO, 2014b).
              This additional burden of disease comes with significant economic impacts. One study estimated
          additional costs associated with climate-change related cases of just three sets of diseases (malaria,
          diarrheal illnesses, and malnutrition) to be between US$4–12 billion in 2030 under a 750 parts per



          3  Following this period, there is a projected decline in child mortality from malnutrition and diarrheal disease between 2030 and
          2050. Conversely, over the same period, deaths related to heat exposure (over 100,000 per year) are projected to increase.

          For the purpose of this paper a “hotspot” is defined as a country that is already experiencing, or is
          likely to experience, a changed burden of disease due either to: 1) the direct, ecosystem-mediated, or
          human system-mediated impacts of climate change (an “impact” hotspot); or 2) a population’s exposure
          to emissions associated with the drivers of climate change, such as greenhouse gases or short-lived
          climate pollutants (an “emissions” hotspot).
              Given that substantial work has been done on the health effects of both vulnerability to climate
          impacts and exposure to air pollution emission by country, we have built upon existing methodologies
          and datasets at the national level to answer the questions posed in this paper. However, there remain
          several gaps with respect to the ideal methodology for characterizing health outcomes in a detailed
          and comprehensive way at this level.


          Identification of “Impact” Hotspots
          There is no available comprehensive estimate of the change in burden of disease attributable to climate
          effects. While the burden of many climate-sensitive diseases has been identified, it is impossible to
          correlate the changes in incidence and prevalence of this burden with a specific change in climate ver-
          sus other factors (let alone correlate a specific pathway with death and disease). This is the case both
          for acute natural disasters caused by climate extremes (heat waves, floods and drought, storm surges,
          typhoons, etc.), and progressive climate changes (increasing overall temperature and number of hot
          days, rising sea levels, etc.). The exceptions are a handful of climate-sensitive transmissible diseases.
              The ultimate heath outcome of a disease is a function of, among other things, the exposure to the
          disease-causing factor, the genetics and socioenvironmental factors of the individual, the quality of
          health care, general socioeconomic development of the country and other mediating factors mentioned
          in Figure 1.2. Taking into consideration a few of these factors and the abundant literature on some
          diseases and accepted climate models, certain research/advocacy groups have developed composite
          indices attempting to quantify the effects of climate in a very limited number of transmissible diseases,
          as well as direct exposure to health impacts and nutrition.
              Several widely used indices are described in Table 2.1 and assessed for their relative merits, includ-
          ing ND-GAIN, Climate Monitor, Center for Global Development, and the Global Climate Risk Index.
              Based on a review of the indices, the ND-GAIN country index was chosen for its robust methodol-
          ogy for characterizing health vulnerability due to climate change and, in particular, for its specificity
          in including multiple health and human habitat impacts in its analysis that span the full range of
          recognized exposure pathways.
              The ND-GAIN country index is a “living” index that is updated regularly but as used here it represents
          the November 2015 release of the 2014 indices. The ND-GAIN summarizes a country’s vulnerability

          Assessing “Impact” Hotspots Associated with Climate Effects
          As stated, the impacts of climate change do not follow country boundaries but as the World Bank’s
          operational work and policy dialogues are country-driven, we assess and present “impact” hotspots
          at the national level. Nevertheless, there are many ways to characterize both climate-sensitive health
          impacts and the geographies to which they correlate; many of those either cut across countries or
          describe variability within a country. Some of the most salient are discussed below.
              Tropical and equatorial latitudes have been identified as more vulnerable to illness and disease
          due to heat. These impacts will also be greatest in cities, which amplify heat effects. Additional stud-
          ies have suggested that heat will be a particularly significant problem for South Asia (Takahashi et al.,
          2007, as cited in The World Bank, 2013) and Sub-Saharan Africa, especially inland populations with
          limited water supplies.
              Populations in flood plains, in small catchments and on coasts are most susceptible to floods and
          storms, particularly in the tropics where heavy rain and storm events are most common. Asia, Africa,
          and Central and South America also have been highlighted by IPCC (Smith et al., 2014).
              Those regions most vulnerable for vector-borne disease include: for malaria, Africa and Southeast
          Asia; for Dengue, Asia/Pacific; for Lyme disease, temperate areas of Europe, Asia and North America.
          Encephalitis is present in Europe, Russia, Mongolia, and China. Hemorrhagic fever occurs globally
          (Smith et al., 2014; World Bank, 2013), dengue is more frequent in cities, and leishmaniasis—spread
          by sand flies—is common in desert regions.
              Food- and waterborne diseases are projected to have significant impacts in Southeast Asia
          (Kolstad & Johansson, 2011, as cited in World Bank, 2013). Models suggest Sub-Saharan Africa, South
          Asia, East Asia and the Pacific are the regions most susceptible to food system disruptions due to climate
          change (Lloyd et al., 2011, as cited in World Bank, 2013).

 5  The “Health” subindex assesses the projected variation in expected deaths from climate change-induced diseases (diarrhea and malnutrition), projected change of malaria
 hazard, dependency on external resources for health services, slum populations, medical staff, and access to improved sanitation facilities. The “Human Habitat” subindex
 assesses vulnerability of human living conditions to climate change, considering weather extremes, urban development, demography, and transport infrastructure. Indicators
 include: projected change of heatwave hazard, projected change of flood hazard, urban concentration, age dependency ratio, quality of transport and trade infrastructure, and
 paved roads. Both subindices incorporate aspects of ecosystem response through the underlying climate modeling on which the two different aspects of risk are measured.
 This inclusion of ecosystem response in both subindices is necessary to accurately reflect both sets of risk, but is not the cause of the observed correlation.

 4        What Can Be Done:
          Adaptation and Mitigation


          Global average temperature increases due to climate change are expected to increase the frequency and
          severity of extreme weather events, as well as climate variability. As has already been observed, these
          events are and will continue affecting health outcomes, mostly negatively. These impacts could slow
          or, on occasion, even reverse the decades-long trend of gains in health. Globally, those most vulnerable
          to these effects are poorer countries and poorer populations.
               Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (mitigation) will, in the long term, reduce the magnitude
          of global climate change and, if adequately targeted, can reduce local co-pollutants that worsen short-term
          health outcomes. But projections indicate that the world is already locked into a two-degree centigrade
          warmer climate, which is expected to have negative health effects. Minimizing these effects will require
          institutional, behavioral, built environment, etc., adjustments (adaptation). Therefore, minimizing
          the health impacts of climate change and CO2 co-pollutants requires both adaptation and mitigation.
               Some global trends add to the complexity in taking action. These include rapid and unplanned
          urbanization, aging populations, and rising energy demand from a growing population. Other global
          trends, however, can facilitate mitigation efforts and boost population resilience. These include increased
          literacy, improvements in health service coverage, and technological innovations in infrastructure
          engineering, medical prevention diagnosis and treatment, renewable energies, remote sensing, and
          disaster preparedness. In climate change and in other areas, development can have positive as well as
          negative effects on vulnerable populations. Environmentally sustainable and well targeted measures
          (i.e., pro-poor and covering the most vulnerable populations) can ensure positive net final outcomes.


          Adaptation
          The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines adaptation as “the process of adjustment
          to actual or expected climate and its effects.” In the case of health, the purpose of the adjustments is to
          avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities to improve health outcomes. Climate change effects on
          health outcomes are mediated through multiple environmental, social and public health factors. Effec-
          tive adaptation measures to reduce both the current and future estimated additional burden of disease
          are equally complex, requiring structural, behavioral and technological changes that are well targeted
          and cost-effective across several sectors and administrative levels. In most cases, such measures reduce
          the burden of disease due to both climate- and non-climate-sensitive diseases. General improvements
          in infrastructure and interventions to improve health in general can also reduce the burden of disease
          due to climate change.
              WHO estimates that climate change may add as much as US$2–4 billion in annual health sector
          costs by 2030. International funding for health adaptation to safeguard against these costs, by contrast,
          would be less than 1 percent of this figure (WHO Euro, 2013). World Bank financing could therefore
          have a significant impact and result in long-term cost savings.

Beyond air quality, other actions to address the emissions that
drive climate change can affect health in more moderate ways.7
Given that actions to address the key drivers of climate change
can influence important determinants of health, we describe the
relationship between these drivers and various components of
the burden of disease, present the geographic patterns of that                                                                                  Ambient air

    Unlike the climate-health impacts discussed in the prior sec-

of air pollution are more directly linked to mitigation responses
(although some future adaptive measures may still be needed to
deal with extreme air quality conditions associated with natural                                                       Household

Conclusion


The drivers of climate change and co-emitted pollutants8 have significant impact on both the health
of humans and the planet.
     This paper is an attempt to identify the geographies and people within that are most vulnerable to
the health impacts of these climate co-pollutants as well as the impacts of climate change. The paper
also links these impacts to country readiness to improve resilience in an attempt to tie these physical
functions to sociological response. This analysis of hotspots provides the foundation for developing
better responses and provides a guide for these geographies and countries that face the highest burden
of impact so that they can confront them in ways that are cost-effective and scalable.
     These data can be used to prioritize both countries and types of interventions. Following the results
of this paper, a next step might be to perform a more detailed diagnosis of the causes and sources of the
climate-sensitive health impacts. Better understanding of vulnerability can inform systematic country diag-
nostics, country partnership frameworks, and other relevant operations under preparation. Tailoring relevant
projects—chiefly in health, nutrition, and population (HNP), but also in sectors that have direct impacts
on HNP outcomes—can ensure that climate-health considerations are woven into economic analysis and
project design.
     Some tools exist and others are under development to support team efforts and minimize their bur-
den; for instance, two operational guidance notes to guide health sector interventions are in progress.
The Climate Change Cross-Cutting Solutions Group can provide technical support to HNP teams to
carry out climate and health vulnerability assessments and the design of interventions, such as climate
services for health, early warning systems, climate smart surveillance systems, “greening” the health
sector, and preparing requests for climate funds.
     The Cross-Cutting Solutions Group is also developing a programmatic approach to efficient, clean
cooking and heating that can significantly reduce household air pollution, including black carbon. This
is in addition to developing new operational tools that will help municipal administrations to under-
stand the potential air quality and health benefits of actions that are within their authority. Moreover,
additional analysis can better identify operational strategies to maximize development benefits tailored
for countries suffering from ambient air pollution, household air pollution, or both. These steps to curb
emissions have the dual benefits of saving lives now and contributing to climate change mitigation,
thereby reducing impacts on health in the future.
     In general, this paper should be taken as an entry-point for furthering dialogue with countries and regions
to improve understanding and action on climate change and health. There are an increasing number of tools
available for making most appropriate climate changes and health interventions, and it is expected that we
will work further to improve and enhance this chest of resources moving forward. It is important that World
Bank staff and others working in development become aware of these challenges and opportunities so that
we might collectively—and simultaneously—improve climate, health, and overall development outcomes.


8 Climate drivers that affect health outcomes include fine particulate matter (including black carbon which is a strong warming
agent and other components of aerosol particulate that may offset a portion of that warming) and methane, which contributes to
the formation of ground-level ozone or smog.

A       Typology of Pollutants That Drive
        Climate Change, Health Impacts,
        or Both


        Carbon Dioxide and Long-Lived Greenhouse Gases
        The chief driver of climate change is unquestionably carbon dioxide (CO2) due to its long atmospheric
        lifetime and its key role in stabilizing the climate system at a habitable temperature. Human activities
        have altered the global carbon cycle causing a rise in ambient concentrations of CO2 and upsetting a
        balance that has been in place for centuries. Based on the latest observations, a 7.5 percent increase
        in radiative forcing from greenhouse gases (GHGs) occurred between 2005 and 2011 alone, with CO2
        contributing 80 percent toward this increase (Hartmann et al., 2013). Long-term climate stabilization
        cannot be achieved without large and rapid reductions of CO2 emission that achieve net zero carbon
        emissions in the latter half of this century (World Bank, 2014).
             The sources of CO2 are numerous and include virtually all forms of combustion spanning our
        energy system, as well as a few other sources such as the calcination reaction in cement production
        (Fischedick, et al., 2014). While CO2 itself is not toxic to humans at ambient concentrations, it is almost
        never emitted alone. Rather, a wide variety of co-emitted pollutants constituting a large majority of
        global air pollution accompany the release of CO2 from various combustion sources. The variation in
        sources tracks the variation in co-emitted pollution and, therefore, the variation in health impacts.
             Nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur dioxide (SO2), mercury and other heavy metals accompany the CO2
        emitted from fossil-fuel power generating facilities. These co-emitted pollutants vary considerably in
        terms of their emission rate depending on the fuel type and the degree of post-combustion control
        technology in use at individual generating units. These pollutants play a significant role in the second-
        ary formation of particulate matter (PM2.5) and contribute to the regional transport and formation of
        ground-level ozone (WMO/IGAC, 2012).
             Transportation sources (cars, trucks, buses, aircraft), residential and commercial buildings, and
        industrial sources also are collectively significant sources of CO2 while emitting NOX, SO2, volatile
        organic compounds (VOC) and carbon monoxide (CO), which is subsequently oxidized to become CO2,
        and other precursors to fine particulate matter and ground-level ozone.


        Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs)
        SLCPs, such as black carbon (BC), methane (CH4), ground-level ozone (O3), and many hydrofluoro-
        carbons (HFCs), have a warming effect on climate, and most of them are also dangerous air pollutants
        with detrimental impacts on human health, agriculture and ecosystems (CCAC, 2013). The rapid reduc-
        tion of black carbon emissions along with co-emitted components of particulate matter could avert
        approximately 0.18–0.19°C of warming by 2050 (Rogelj et al., 2014; Shindell et al., 2012). Interventions
        that address methane could yield a similar climate benefit with combined temperature reductions of

B       Geographic Analysis of Climate Drivers


        Greenhouse gas emissions serve as an excellent basis for identifying hotspots that reflect the drivers of
        climate change. Table B.1 presents national emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions expressed
        as CO2 equivalent or CO2e (sorted two ways). However, these lists are a relatively poor indicator of
        the geographical specificity of the health impacts given that the drivers of health impacts are the
        co-emitted pollutants that accompany emission of GHGs rather than the GHGs themselves. This imper-
        fect alignment between GHGs versus traditional air pollutants (fine particles and ground-level ozone)
        limits the analysis presented here. For example, the degree of overlap between climate and health
        drivers will differ significantly by national circumstance. China, U.S., India, Russia, and Japan top
        the list of GHG emitters and clearly are the focus of carbon mitigation efforts. However, with respect
        to health impacts of co-emitted air pollution, these countries are at very different stages of addressing
        their air quality concerns.
             Table B.2 presents similar data on greenhouse gas emissions, but it presents the top 10 GHG emitters
        within various income brackets sorted by gross national income per capita. Countries at the top of these
        lists will have lower economic efficiency per unit of GHG emissions (alternatively, these countries could
        be described as having a relatively higher GHG intensity per unit of GDP). This often is correlated with
        less efficient combustion and greater health impacts, but also will result in less direct association with
        the determinants of health most directly associated with mitigation activities discussed in the main text.
             A second way to examine the same data is by income bracket. The second list also presents to
        top GHG emitters (expressed in CO2e) but presents only the top 10 emitters for each income bracket
        based on the World Bank fiscal year 2015 income classifications (high income with annual per capita
        GNI ≥ US$12,746; upper-middle income: US$4,125–12,745, lower-middle income: US$1,046–4,125,
        and lower-income ≤ US$1,045).

C       Health Driver Mapping Based on Burden
        of Disease


        The data below are taken from 2013 Global Burden of Disease analysis performed by the Institute of
        Health Metrics and Evaluation and the Health Effects Institute (IHME, 2015). Both tables present the
        population normalized burdens of disease (in terms of disability adjusted life-years, or DALYs) attribut-
        able to ambient air pollution (AAP, in second column) and household air pollution (HAP, third column)
        in 2013 (fine particulate pollution only). Only countries with levels greater than one standard deviation
        above the median value of all countries appear in the table. The left table is ranked by AAP and the
        right table by HAP. Shaded rows indicate countries that lie more than one standard deviation (yellow),
        two standard deviations (orange) or three standard deviations above the median value in both lists.
