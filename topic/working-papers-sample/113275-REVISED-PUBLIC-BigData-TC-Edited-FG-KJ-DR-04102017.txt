FOREWORD
Big data - data that is vast at an unprecedented scale, comes from a range of new and old sources, is extremely
high in frequency, and which can now be analyzed and combined in very sophisticated ways - has the potential
to augment the efforts of institutions like the World Bank Group working to deliver high-impact development
solutions to countries around the world.

Within the Bank Group’s Trade & Competitiveness Global Practice, we believe that investigating the potential of
big data for development is a worthwhile pursuit as we support countries to boost the volume and value of
trade, enhance their investment climates, improve competitiveness in sectors, and foster innovation and
entrepreneurship.

Big data solutions have the potential to accelerate the work of our teams by deriving timely, accurate, and
actionable insights from alternative data sources in order to close data gaps and inform policymaking. For
example, pilot projects underway in the Trade and Competitiveness practice are exploring the use of data
science techniques to harness publicly available government and commercial data to aid competition authorities
in detecting cartels and other anti-competitive practices. We are also mining Internet data to measure
innovative economic activity in cities, so agencies can make better informed policy decisions and, we are
collecting regulatory data to classify and assess the impacts of non-tariff measures on economies and their
competitiveness.

Of course, there are limitations to operationalizing big data to inform our work—navigating privacy policies and
other challenges to access, for example—but we continue to pursue big data’s potential because we know it can
support the Bank Group’s goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity.

This paper, prepared in collaboration with Deloitte and with other global practices within the Bank Group,
highlights data-driven pilot projects underway in the Trade & Competitiveness Global Practice and shares
compelling cases of how big data is changing the way we look at the challenges countries are facing and how we
can best support them.

These are exciting times for big data for development. We hope that these cases will prove useful for
policymakers, academics, students, trade and competitiveness practitioners, data enthusiasts and many others
as they pursue and develop breakthroughs in big data-driven development solutions.

INNOVATIONS IN BIG DATA FROM THE TRADE & COMPETITVENESS GLOBAL PRACTICE
Leveraging Big Data to Help Competition Agencies Tackle
Anticompetitive Behavior
By Georgiana Pop, Andrew Whitby

Summary:
Anticompetitive practices have been found to yield negative effects on productivity growth in developed and
developing economies. Cartels across the world, for instance, negatively impact consumer welfare through price
overcharges in the order of billions of dollars. But detecting these practices requires a better understanding of the
nature of such anticompetitive practices by market operators across various markets and jurisdictions. This is not
an easy task. Currently, competition authorities and researchers who study effects of anticompetitive behavior
may have to gather this data manually, which is both time-consuming and inefficient.
In response, this project aimed to develop a database of key decisions by the competition authorities relating to
anti-competitive practices. Using machine learning and web scraping techniques, the project automates the
collection and organization of data from sixteen pilot countries. The database would serve as an essential
infrastructure for future visualization and analyses to identify signals of anti-competitive behavior.
Challenge:
Data on anticompetitive practices is an integral part of Competition Authorites’ work. For example, in the case of
cartels, such data may cover data on market characteristics, specific regulations, conduct, decisions, and sanctions
imposed. But many times competition authorities do not currently have ready access to cross-market, cross-
jurisdictional data on such anti-competitive practices. This is because this type of data is often collected manually
from public sources such as competition authorities’ websites, media, and specialized international organizations
and consultancies. Moreover, building and maintaining a repository of this data "by hand" is time consuming--
and can yield imperfect results.
Innovation:
Using machine learning techniques and web scraping, this project aimed to automate the collection and
organization of key information on anti-competitive practices from sixteen pilot countries.
The database would allow competition authorities to better understand, detect, and take actions against actors
that systematically engage in anti-competitive practices. At the World Bank Group, it would allow the Competition
Policy Team to further develop its analytical tools and systematize its corpus of evidence on the effects of
anticompetitive practices, including cartels in developing economies.

Further, this initiative could potentially be expanded to the analysis of various anticompetitive practices as well
the implementation of other policies, e.g., investment policy and state-aid control policy.

Process and Results:
The team initially started out with a set of countries where competition authorities had published documents-- in
either English or Spanish-- relating to anti-competitive practices. This initial set was narrowed down to sixteen
pilot countries where a comprehensive set of records on past decisions was available. The pilot focused on the
following sixteen countries: Albania, Botswana, India, Moldova, Romania, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Macedonia,
Pakistan, Serbia, Bosnia, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Peru, and Seychelles.
In the first phase of the project, the team worked with a partner organization with technical expertise in machine
learning and web-scraping to scan thousands of pages of documents and gather semi-structured data on anti-
competitive practices. This involved creation of an algorithm that picked out relevant information from 5000
documents-- including the actors involved, type of anti-competitive practice, products/markets affected, type of


                                                                                                                  20
anticompetitive practices, decision taken, and sanctions, if any. This phase required the imposition of both
automated and manual checks and troubleshooting to ensure credibility and quality of data collected.

The second stage, which is in progress, involves the extraction and structuring of this information so that it is ready
for analysis.

In the third phase, the team hopes use this database to gather insights on anti-competitive behavior. This could
potentially include: (1) snapshots of anti-competitive behavior by product/market, (2) network mapping and
analysis to identify companies linked to previous record-holders across different markets, jurisdictions, and
geographies, and (3) likelihood analysis of potential anticompetitive behavior for companies with links or previous
records, etc.
Lessons learned:
1) Allocate time and resources to communicate domain knowledge with technical experts: Machine learning and
web scraping expertise needs to be complemented by transfer of domain-specific knowledge to technical
experts. For this, the team found it important to allocate enough time and resources to make sector-specific
terms and analytical approaches/ practices explicit to technical experts.
2) Human oversight is crucial in ensuring quality: There is no perfect analytical technique when it comes to
unstructured data, because so much depends on the quality of documents available online. Since there is a lot
that needs to be taught to the machine, the human factor is very crucial in ensuring quality of outputs.
For example, while a human expert may intuitively place the terms “cartel”, “price agreement”, and “horizontal
agreement” in the same category of anti-competitive practice, a machine has to be explicitly taught that this is
the case. Breaking down what a human does into concrete steps and feeding it to the machine takes time—both
in terms of algorithm design and in terms of cross-checking, so the process cannot be entirely automated at this
time.
3) Anticipate adjustments to time-frame: From database creation to completing complex analyses, each phase of
the project builds on the previous one. The team found it important to factor in additional time so that quality
can be assured adequately throughout the project lifecycle.

INNOVATIONS IN BIG DATA FROM THE TRADE & COMPETITVENESS GLOBAL PRACTICE
Using Big Data to Measure City Innovation Capacity
By Megha Mukim and Juni Zhu

Summary
City leaders around the world have been grappling with economic development challenges in the face of slowing
growth, changing demographics, and increasing unemployment rates, especially among youth. Task teams at the
WBG are searching for ways to better understand these challenges and find solutions to help their clients.
Private-sector firms are the main drivers of job creation, productivity, and wage increases; they also drive much
innovation. Despite the role that privately-held start-ups play in innovation-led growth, cities currently lack
reliable, up-to-date, and comparable data necessary to understand and inform policy decisions that affect start-
ups.
The Start-Up City Dashboard aims to (1) provide reliable, comprehensive, and comparable data on start-up
activity and innovation ecosystems in data scarce environments; (2) provide a better understanding of start-up
activity drivers to guide more targeted policy; and (3) demonstrate the use of big-data tools for more
standardized WBG data and analysis. The Start-Up City Dashboard is comprised of three interactive visual
diagnostic tools that help measure and compare the health, diversity, and scale of innovative economic activity
in 22 pilot cities: the Health of the Innovation Ecosystem Tool, Industry Benchmarking and Uniqueness
Dashboard, and the Innovation Archetype City-by-City Comparison. These tools allow city governments to obtain
an up-to-date and accurate picture of their innovation ecosystems and to learn from other cities that are
operating differently.
Challenge
The Trade & Competitiveness Global Practice’s report, “Competitive Cities for Jobs and Growth: What, Who and
How,” aims to help cities understand how to facilitate private sector growth to create jobs, raise productivity,
and increase incomes. The report identified four enabling factors for growth: (1) institutions and regulations; (2)
infrastructure and land; (3) enterprise support and finance; and (4) skills and innovation. The findings also
suggested that the creation of innovative small firms and the displacement of incumbents was one of the main
sources of innovation and – according to the team’s experience – a topic of interest for many city governments.
City leaders asked three key questions related to the role start-ups play in innovation-led growth: “Who are the
entrepreneurs and start-ups in my city?”; “What industries do they focus on, and are these unique to my city?”;
and, “How is my city doing compared to others?”
Cities lack reliable, up-to-date, and comparable data on their innovation ecosystems that would help them
answer these questions. Moreover, readily-available data sources are not much help for a variety of reasons. For
example, most available data is often aggregated at the national level. Even when sub-national data is available,
it is often limited to industrial sectors. It is difficult to find data necessary to assess the factors that contribute to
a successful start-up ecosystem in cities, especially those that are intangible in nature, such as networking assets
to help entrepreneurs get connected, or a city culture that tolerates failures and encourages collaboration.
Innovation
To provide cities with a reliable diagnostic tool, the team gathered data on each of the following factors that
contribute to a successful start-up ecosystem: human capital, financial infrastructure, urban amenities,
collaborative culture, and networking assets. They did this by identifying proxy indicators for each of the factors
for which open-source data could be updated frequently and rapidly, and by using a combination of data science
tools including R, Python, STATA, Excel and Tableau for data collection, transformation, analysis, and
visualization. For example:
•   Strength of human capital in a city is determined by the number of universities as obtained in real-time from
    Open Street Maps.

                                                                                                                       22
•   Financial infrastructure is captured by the number of banks or ATMs in a city as obtained in real-time from
    Open Street Maps.
•   The nature of networking assets can be assessed through information on available networking activities, for
    example, incidence of mentee-mentor relationships and presence of serial investors. The dashboard used
    AngelList to determine the percentage of entrepreneurs who are well-connected as a proxy for the strength
    of a city’s networking assets.
•   Urban amenities is approximated by the ubiquity of coffee-shops, pubs and restaurants as obtained in real-
    time from Open Street Maps.
•   Lastly, collaborative culture is assessed by examining the percentage of technicians who are active on
    collaborative online platforms, such as Stack Overflow.
By virtue of being problem- and demand-driven, the project benefited from unique approaches in both design
and process. Rather than being a purely academic endeavor, the project had a concrete goal of addressing
concerns that clients consistently brought up in consultations, such as whether start-ups in their cities are
creating competitive jobs for young people. In addition to speaking with World Bank clients to inform the design
process, the team also consulted other Global Practices and Regions within the WBG. These consultations lent
relevance to the project and led to the enthusiastic reception from clients.
Results
Three tools comprise the Start-Up City Dashboard, whose prototype has data on twenty-two pilot cities ranging
from Dar es Salaam to New York:
1) The Global Start-Up City Snapshot provides a snapshot of the innovation ecosystem’s health, including an
overall rank and a breakdown score for each of the five factors that contribute to a start-up ecosystem.
2) The Industry Benchmarking and Uniqueness Tool allows for the identification of the industrial mix of the city’s
start-ups and how these industries compare with two to three similar cities.
3) The Archetypes of Innovation Activities Tool allows for one-to-one comparison of cities against the four
innovation archetypes identified by the consulting firm, McKinsey & Company: science-based, engineering-
based, customer-focused, and efficiency-based. This tool indicates a city whether it is strong or weak in a
particular type of innovative activity compared to competitor cities.
Sub-national clients have responded enthusiastically to the prototype dashboard. For example, city leaders in
Shanghai were able for the first time to compare Shanghai’s performance to Seoul, Tokyo, New York, and even
other Chinese cities, disaggregate the data by sector, and ask what other cities might be doing differently. The
Dashboard is now being piloted in Tanzania as part of a broader initiative to understand entrepreneurial
ecosystems, leading to the design and preparation of a US$100 million lending operation.
The team is keen to build upon its success. First, by working with a capstone group, the team is focusing on
understanding the direction and the magnitude of the possible bias using these new sources of data obtained
through web scraping methods as compared to data obtained from other traditional sources in select OECD and
upper middle-income cities. Second, the team is exploring opportunities for corporate partnerships with IBM
and LinkedIn to further the work on gathering reliable data on entrepreneurship and to deepen and scale the
Dashboard to include additional variables. Third, the team is looking to scale the project to include up to 600
cities worldwide, including many in low-income countries.
This project also illustrates that similar web scraping methods from open-source websites to obtain national or
sub-national proxy data can be employed to develop monitoring and diagnostic tools for other projects within
the Trade & Competitiveness Global Practice and the WBG. Once these tools are established, efforts to maintain
and scale them could be marginal.
Lessons Learned
1) Design based on a solid analytical foundation: This project was built on two years of initial research to
understand the importance of helping clients with economic development challenges. The project brought

                                                                                                                  23
together team members with skill sets in urban and private sector development, which was critical to
developing a broad-based tool for task teams operating across different thematic areas.
2) Demand as a foundation for design: This project proved the importance of aligning design in response to
demand. The initial thinking underlying the tool was based on increasing demands from clients to understand
start-up activity, particularly from a project in China. Strong demand kept the project focused and ensured its
outputs were impactful for and responsive to its end-users (i.e. city leaders). In addition, the team continually
reached out to regional task teams and experts in other Global Practices (GP) (Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) & Transport GP, Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience GP) to solicit feedback, which made the
tool flexible to the needs of different clients and users.
3) Seek help on technical expertise: This project was fairly new for the team and the WBG. As a result, the team
faced many challenges, including finding the right technical skills in the absence of a standardized Terms of
Reference for the required expertise. For this, the team turned to other advisors both within the Trade &
Competitiveness Practice and the Big Data team, and even to private sector firms, for advice. It helped to have a
clearly identified knowledge lead in the GP to provide guidance and regular feedback and support.

            Non-Tariff
Classifying Non-Tariff Measures Using Machine Learning
By Michael J. Ferrantino and Siddhesh V. Kaushik

Summary
Non-tariff measures (NTMs) are defined as policy measures other than tariffs that could impact the prices or
quantities of goods traded. NTMs are of particular concern to exporters and importers in low-income countries,
as they impede international trade and can prevent market access. Systematic collection of NTM data continues
under a multi-agency process coordinated by the UN Conference on Trade and Development, but the process of
collecting and classifying NTM data is cumbersome, time consuming, and heavily dependent on consultant skills.
As a response to this challenge, this project sought to automate the manual process of classifying NTM data. By
using available data on Malaysia, this pilot project illustrates how machine learning and text mining techniques
can be used to automate and accelerate the NTM classification process and improve data quality. This solution
can help governments, international agencies, businesses, and researchers get a better sense of which NTMs are
in place in a given country, and in turn, to assess the impact they have on the wider economy.
Challenge
Consider the following cases: Country A imposes a restrictive licensing system on imports of noodles to boost
local manufacturing and agriculture. Country B bans the import of a particular chemical compound used by paint
manufacturers, citing health dangers linked to the compound.
These are both examples of NTMs. NTMs can fall into various categories, from sanitary or environmental
protection measures to other restrictions such as quotas and price controls. Their impact can reach beyond the
policy or regulation’s original intentions. In country A, consumers may end up paying significantly higher prices
than if the goods could be imported from a neighboring country. In country B, despite the import ban on the
chemical, import of paints containing the same compound continues to be allowed. This may protect factory
workers in the paint industry from harm, but does nothing to protect consumers.
Availability of comprehensive data on NTMs is crucial for governments to make informed decisions on these
issues. Data on NTMs allows policymakers to accurately assess the impact of policies and regulations that affect
trade; data even enables the calculation of the dollar equivalent impact of NTMs. Accurate information on NTMs
is also necessary to negotiate modern trade agreements. It is equally important to allow private sector firms to
avoid uncertainties in conducting cross-border business. It familiarizes them with requirements and levels of
compliance, such as labeling and certification, that trading with a particular country would require.
However, collecting data on policy measures and classifying them as NTMs is a laborious and manual process. To
begin with, data collection relies heavily on consultants who have to be trained to read thousands of pages of
regulatory documents and identify trade-related regulations as well as the countries and products they affect.
Data collectors must also correctly classify a regulation as a NTM. For some countries, it can take up to nine
months to fully classify the NTMs. In addition, many low-income countries often maintain this information in
hard copy, and even when digitized, they are often stored as picture files. Data quality assessments of
consultants’ output face similar problems.
Process and Innovation
Through machine learning and text mining techniques, the project sought to address the challenge of gathering
data classifying NTMs in an efficient and accurate manner. For the pilot initiative, the team chose Malaysia.
Since NTMs have already been classified for Malaysia, the pilot’s data could be evaluated for accuracy. The
project used machine learning and text mining, in particular, a Support Vector Machine to train the algorithm to
identify patterns in existing documents and replicate the process. First, 60 percent of the data from Malaysia
was used as training data in which 8,400 paragraphs of text were evaluated. The algorithm achieved 92 percent
accuracy in identifying whether paragraphs contained NTMs or not, and 85 percent accuracy in identifying

                                                                                                                25
whether the NTMs fell into categories A or B under the NTM rules. The extracted information was categorized
as: Source, Document Title, Regulation Title, Regulation Agency, Regulation Date, Regulation Description,
Regulation URL, and Regulation Text. The algorithm can also help identify affected countries and products.
Results
First, the pilot significantly reduced the time and resources required to identify, assess, and classify documents
relating to NTMs. Second, it allowed for more accurate and consistent classification of NTMs by reducing human
intervention and error. Third, it will provide better, timely and more comprehensive data to inform policy
decisions and reduce barriers to trade.
The pilot paves way for classification of NTMs in more countries. Further functionality can also be added to the
product to allow for automatic periodic updates or to develop the ability to process documents in languages
other than English. The same process can be borrowed to gather data on other trade-related issues, such as
intellectual property and rules of origin.
