growth as well as a decline in remittances after years of strong
growth. Healthy financial flows have helped ease some of this
pressure but without an adequate policy response the external
situation is unsustainable. Similarly, the fiscal deficit widened to
5.8 percent in FY2017, 2 percentage points higher than the bud-
geted target. This was mainly a result of weak federal tax collec-
tion, lower external non-tax flows and unexpectedly high fiscal
deficits by provinces.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
The outlook is for moderately higher growth. On the supply side,
impetus to growth is projected to come from the services and
industrial sectors. On the demand side, growth will be driven by
public and private consumption, aided by a moderate increase in
investment.

THE WORLD BANK GROUP AND PAKISTAN
The World Bank’s program in Pakistan is governed by its Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2015-20 1. The four results areas
of the CPS - Energy, Private Sector Development, Inclusion, and
Service Delivery – remain consistent with the Pakistan One Na-
tion One Vision 2025, and are aligned with the WBG’s twin goals
of eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

Pakistan is an IDA/IBRD blend country. The IDA17 allocation ($3.4
billion) was fully utilized. The IDA18 allocation is also about $3.5
billion over 3 years. Additionally, Pakistan will have access to var-
ious IDA set-aside sources, such as the Scale-Up Facility, the Re-
gional Set-Aside and the Private Sector Window. Pakistan is also
eligible for IBRD financing; IBRD has committed $895 million in
investment operations and guarantees. The Bank administers a

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    This project recognizes: that the Government of Sindh’s strong interest in strengthening technical and vocational education and training (TVET); that the labor force’s lack of skills
    poses significant constraints; and that the TVET sector faces substantial challenges. Project design takes into account the need for both structural reforms to strengthen the quality
    and relevance of TVET, and short-term improvements in the provision of training.

    The project development objective is to support the Government of Sindh in strengthening its training programs to improve the skills and employability of trainees. The project
    includes three components:
    ■■     Supporting the provision and relevance of short-term vocational training to 45,000 targeted trainees through private and public training providers selected through a
           competitive process.
    ■■     Results-based support for competitively selected programs and training providers to develop market-driven training with a focus on curriculum development and equipment
           provision. (19 percent of funding)
    ■■     Technical assistance to strengthen capacity of the Sindh Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (STEVTA) to implement component two activities.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
    ■■     Seventy training programs were competitively selected and 24 programs were equipped with competency-based curricula-compliant equipment. Institute Management
           Committees with private-sector representation have been established in each of the selected training institutes.
    ■■     83,097 unemployed youth were given short-term training and 40 percent of them were employed within three months after completion of the training. Fifty-three percent
           of the participants trained/beneficiaries were female, which is beyond the target of 28 percent.

    IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
    STEVTA.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Government of Sindh (GoS) has made significant progress in improving the policy framework for the education sector. In accordance with the 2009 National Education Policy,
    the GoS passed the Sindh Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act of 2013, which ensures the right to free education for children aged 5-16. Sindh Education Sector
    Plan (SESP) for 2014-18 has been launched, setting the framework and objectives for the educational sector development.
    However, the province has seen very slow progress in enrollment, mainly due to continuous volatile security conditions in the province, frequent floods and natural disasters. Weak
    planning and implementation capacity of districts and below district levels also contributed to the slow implementation. The validity of various data sets has also been an issue in
    determining the actual enrollment trends. The project has been restructured to address the school and district level factors that are an impediment to enrollments and retentions.

    The GoS has set educational development as one of its key priorities and the strong commitment is shown by the declaration of an Education Emergency in the province. In this
    context, the project restructuring has been completed to ensure complete accomplishment of educational reforms introduced during the project period and reorientation of the
    project to overcome specific bottlenecks that were identified – including hiring better qualified teachers, specifically for Science and Mathematics, and improving the basic quality
    of specific schools.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
    Under the Second Sindh Education Sector Reform Project, a series of reforms have been introduced and contributed to improving sectoral governance and accountability. A merit-
    and need-based teacher recruitment system has been introduced; school consolidation is improving the management of schools and head teachers have been hired to further
    improve quality of schools. School-based grants have been made available through School Management Committees (SMC) and School Specific Budgets (SSBs). The department
    has carried out detailed district level situational reviews focusing on school status, teacher and student absenteeism as well as teacher rationalization. Clear and specific actions for
    re-opening closed schools, and rationalization of teachers and actions against teacher absenteeism have been given to the districts.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Slow progress on improvements in human development indicators undermines Pakistan’s, and hence the Punjab’s, competitiveness, economic growth, and efforts to alleviate
    poverty. While Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, still provides the largest share in terms of GDP, it has experienced a sharp decline in economic growth since 2004/2005,
    remaining under 4 percent in each of the last four years. To address constraints to growth in the province, the Government of the Punjab has prepared an ambitious 2015-2018
    growth strategy that identifies skills development as one of the key pillars of growth. The main challenges in the skills development sector of Punjab include: a limited supply of
    skilled workers; a weak institutional framework; a lack of evidence-based policy making; low quality and relevance of training; market failures in industry-provision of training;
    and low access to skills training. The project aims to support the state government’s reform agenda in the skills sector by improving training provision of existing public-training
    providers with a focus on employability, as well as encouraging private-sector provision of training.

    The project development objective is to improve the quality and labor market relevance of skills training programs in priority sectors in the Punjab, as well as access to those
    programs. The project:
    ■■     Uses results-based financing to support the achievement of the government’s Growth Strategy and the Punjab’s Skills Development Strategy and Vision 2018 objectives
           through five sub-components along three strategic lines: strengthening the skills training system, improving the quality and relevance of skills training and increasing access
           to market-relevant trades. For each sub-component, a DLI has been identified with time-bound targets.
    ■■     Provides technical assistance and capacity building required to enable the achievement of the DLIs, and to manage project implementation, using a traditional disbursement
           mode based on unaudited interim financial reports.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
    The project became effective on July 4, 2015, and has achieved the following:
    ■■     Roll out of Competency Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) Packages
    ■■     Initiated Functional Reviews of TTB, PBTE and P-TEVTA (in progress)
    ■■     Partnership Framework developed and used to seal four partnership agreements which were signed with industry for strengthening collaboration between training providers
           and employers to improve quality and relevance of training delivery
    ■■     62 percent of students enrolled in industry partnership courses were employed.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Government of Pakistan joined the Global Partnership for Education in 2012 and an allocation of $100 million has been made available for Pakistan. The provinces of Sindh
    ($66 million) and Balochistan ($34 million) were shortlisted to receive the financial grant after detailed discussions between the development partners and the Government of
    Pakistan. The World Bank has agreed to be the supervising entity for the proposed grant; UNICEF is the coordinating agency for the grant. The project development objective is to
    increase school enrollment and retention in project-supported schools, with a special focus on girls’ participation, and to develop mechanisms for information collection and use
    for improved management of education. The project will benefit four groups.
    ■■     Children who will enroll in the newly established schools and those already enrolled in government schools (grades K through 10) will benefit from improved school envi-
           ronments and access to teaching learning materials.
    ■■     Girls who did not have the opportunity to enroll in higher grades will benefit from an opportunity through up-gradation of girls schools.
    ■■     Teachers and education managers will benefit from professional development, provision of teaching material and capacity-building programs.
    ■■     Communities who receive project interventions, especially the parents of the children enrolled in schools, are expected to benefit from access to better quality education.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
    The project has finalized selection of a majority of project sites for school up-gradation and construction. Teacher recruitment tests have been conducted for almost 90% of the
    teaching posts and teacher training is planned for the newly inducted teachers on early learning, mathematics and science. Approximately 28% of the teaching staff have been
    given contracts after the test and selection process, and placed in community-supported schools. Construction has been initiated on 20% of the selected school sites. All the
    potential school sites have a Parent Teacher School Management Committee formulated to support and provide oversight to the construction and operationalization of schools.
    The Project Management Unit has now digitized the monitoring framework and prepared a dashboard for reporting the results of the project, there is comprehensive, up-to-date
    information readily available for decision-making and tracking progress of project activities.
    In light of the recent progress made in the implementation of project activities, it is expected that implementation will accelerate in the upcoming months.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Pakistan has made progress in improving education outcome indicators over the past decade. However, there has been persistent underperformance at its level of per capita
    income in comparison to other developing countries, including in South Asia. Pakistan has the world’s second highest out-of-school population, 6.7 million (12 percent of the
    world’s total), of which 56 percent are girls. This issue is made more challenging by a relatively high population growth rate (1.65 percent compared to 1.3 percent regionally
    in 2013). Public spending for education as a share of the country’s GDP is low at 2.5 percent in 2013. Pakistan’s social development indicators place it among the least socially
    developed countries in the world. Less than half of the country’s population has completed primary education. Approximately 42 percent of people (age 10 years and above)
    cannot read and write. About 45 percent of children under 5 years old have a stunted growth. Low social development is also prevalent in Punjab Province, and strikingly so in its
    low-performing districts (LPDs).

    The Government of Punjab (GoPunjab) is committed to support ongoing reforms and implement new initiatives such as ECE and stipends for out-of-school children, to bring
    about transformative change. It aims to have a better managed and accountable education system, which enables the best quality education opportunities and environment for
    children, especially in its priority districts. The 2018 goals are grouped into four areas: (a) ensure high-quality teaching and learning in the classroom; (b) improve leadership
    and accountability at all levels; (c) enable an environment for students that is conducive to learning; and (d) promote a high-quality school infrastructure. The Third Punjab
    Education Sector Project (PESP III) supports the implementation of the Government of Punjab’s larger education program supporting the 2018 Education Goals. The project will
    be implemented over the period FY2016/17–2021/22 and consists of two parts; a results-based component to support the GoPunjab’s education reform efforts and a technical
    assistance component to support the design and verification of achievement of education reforms. Specifically, the project supports:
    ■■     Increasing access to schooling for the poorest through education vouchers, public private partnerships, and stipends for secondary school girls.
    ■■     Ensuring quality teaching and learning for all by expanding early childhood education, strengthening merit-based teacher recruitment and teacher placement, providing
           mentoring support to teachers and strengthening student assessments
    ■■     Improving leadership, management and accountability through the provision of school specific non-salary budgets, and data strengthening and performance management
    ■■     Technical Assistance: Financing essential advisory, technical, and capacity-building support.

    KEY RESULTS EXPECTED:
    ■■     Enrolling more than 1 million additional children in school through public private partnerships in Education by 2021
    ■■     Establishing 7,000 Early Childhood Education classrooms that meet quality standards by 2021
    ■■     Increasing secondary school enrollment for girls in low performing districts to 450,000 students

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Pakistan’s electricity sector faces a large gap between supply and demand. Widespread load shedding – disconnecting the electric current when demand is greater than supply – is
    prevalent, affecting economic growth. A shift over the past decade toward expensive fuel oil has also increased the cost of electricity generation. Expanding hydropower generation
    is therefore fundamental to address Pakistan’s long-term energy issues. The project is an important element of the Bank’s energy sector strategy of supporting strategic investment
    projects in generation and transmission infrastructure that contribute to the structural shift to a low-cost, low-carbon fuel mix. The project involves constructing power houses,
    modifying tunnels, and installing six 470 megawatt (MW) power units on an existing Tarbela Dam located 60 km north-west of Islamabad on the River Indus.

    The dam was constructed as part of the Indus Basin Project following the Indus Water Treaty between India and Pakistan in 1960. The dam has five tunnels and two spillways and
    the hydropower units are installed on Tunnels 1 to 3 (3,478 MW). Tarbela Fourth Extension Project (T4HP) and Additional Financing for construction of Tarbela Fifth Extension
    Project (T5HP) will add 1,410 MW each to increase total capacity to 6,298 MW. T4HP and T5HP are expected to start generation from June 2018 and June 2021 respectively during
    the high-flow season that coincides with the peak-demand summer period. Two major contracts (i) construction of power house by M/s Sinohydro (civil works) and (ii) installation
    of turbines and equipment by M/s Voith (electro-mechanical) for T4HP were awarded in September 2013 and February 2014 respectively. AF/T5HP became effective in August
    2017 and hiring of construction supervision consultants is in progress.

    EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■     Increase in electricity supply – 3,000 GWh (T4HP) and 1,800 GWh (AF/T5HP);
    ■■     Availability of additional generation capacity during summer months – 1,410 MW each from T4HP & T5HP;
    ■■     Reduction in overall production cost of energy by 2.4 percent from PKR 7.02 to 6.85 per kWh; and
    ■■     Successful pilot of installing floating solar plant leading to expansion of solar generation from Tarbela.

         ;* Financing for the project is being undertaken to match the project implementation schedule. For more information, see the Project Appraisal Document. An IDA credit in the amount of SDR 379.7 million ($588.4 million
         equivalent) and an IDA Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) in the amount of $460 million were approved by the World Bank for DHP-I in June 2014. Bank involvement in the Project gave comfort to local commercial banks to lend
         PKR 144 billion ($1.4 billion equivalent) and raise $350 million of foreign currency financing using IDA Partial Credit Guarantee of $ 250 million. Remaining IDA PCG will be used for a Bond transaction.


    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Dasu Hydropower Project (DHP) is part of the Indus Cascade and is also a part of a least-cost solution to mitigate power shortfall and reduce cost of generation in the country. It is a
    run-of-river greenfield project about 240 km upstream from Tarbela Dam. The total size of the project is 4,320 megawatt (MW). However, it is optimal to develop the project in two
    stages of 2,160 MW each. DHP Stage 1, including six generating units of 360 MW each and 350-km, 765kV transmission line from Dasu to Islamabad. In June 2014, World Bank
    approved $588.4 million primarily for the preparatory works and resettlement and an IDA Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) in the amount of $460 million to mobilize commercial
    financing and time it in a manner that funds are available at the time of award of three major contracts civil works (MW-01 and MW-02) and electro-mechanical (EM-01). MW-01
    and MW-02 contractors have been mobilized and EM-01 is at the bidding stage.

    The overall project development objective is to facilitate the expansion of electricity supply of hydro-power in Pakistan. The project would trigger the development of Indus Cascade
    that will change the energy landscape in the country which presently relies on expensive thermal generation based on imported fuels. The financing model uses an innovative
    approach in which instead of an upfront financial close funds are being mobilized to match the investment needs, thus minimizing the project’s financing cost. Additional
    financing will be processed to cover any gap after the design of the transmission line is complete, all costs are known, and other additional sources of funding have been finalized.
    The project is a “high-risk-high-reward” operation aimed at providing low cost non-carbon renewable energy.

    EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■     DHP-I will supply 12,225 gigawatt hours (GWh) annually (~12 percent of total existing supply) at a very low cost.
    ■■     It will improve socio-economic services in the project area and directly benefit more than 20,000 people.
    ■■     The project will also strengthen WAPDA to develop other large hydropower projects.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Project Development Objective is to support Government of Pakistan efforts in promoting an inclusive and transparent financial sector that is able to better intermediate
    resources for long term finance. The PDO will be achieved through three pillars: (i) Improving access to finance and enhancing financial inclusion; (ii) Fostering long-term finance;
    and (iii) Enhancing transparency of the financial sector.
    ■■     Despite being a stand-alone operation, the project builds on ongoing development policy financing engagement with the Government of Pakistan and focuses on continuing
           the reform momentum toward a significant overhaul of the legislative and institutional framework of the financial sector.
    ■■     The operation supports policy actions in three broad areas:
    ■■     First, to enhance financial inclusion, launching a national DTA Scheme is aimed at facilitating the expansion of accounts and financial products. Modernizing the Central Direc-
           torate of National Savings (CDNS) is aimed at supporting better utilization of existing access points in the country. Approving the Companies Bill allows for a better regulatory
           framework for SMEs to set up and grow and get access to credit. The Deposit Protection Act inspires confidence in deposit-taking financial institutions.
    ■■     Second, to address gaps in intermediation of long-term finance, developing a national infrastructure finance policy creates a vision and framework to identify the funding
           challenge to meet Pakistan’s growing infrastructure needs. Issuing Prudential Regulations for long-term finance streamlines the regulatory framework for the financial sector
           to tap various sources of financing to meet the funding challenge. Overall, availability of long-term finance is necessary for the government (e.g. for infrastructure), private
           sector (e.g. for productive investment), and individuals (e.g. for housing finance).
    ■■     Third, financial sector transparency is likely to be enhanced by the Benami Transactions Prohibition Bill, conducting a National Risk Assessment for Anti-Money Laundering
           and Combatting Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), assessing corporate governance of state-owned insurance corporations, and launching a registered prize bonds scheme,
           will all contribute towards enabling the financial sector to play an enhanced role in the economy.

    EXPECTED RESULTS:
    To measure results, the following outcome indicators will be used:
    ■■     Ease of access to finance and enhanced financial inclusion
           -	      Number of transactional accounts at financial institutions by gender; target: 50 million (women 7.5 million)
           -	      percent of NSS client’s profits distributed through the banking sector; target: 5% out of more than 7 million NSS accounts
           -	      percent increase in number of companies registered; target: 6.5 percent or 4,265 companies
           -	    percent increase in deposit base of banking sector; target 15 percent
    ■■     Unlock the constraints to long-term finance
           -	      Long-term loans as percent of total banking sector loans; target 10%
    ■■     Enhance the transparency of the financial sector
           -	      Adjudicating authority established and operational
           -	      Pakistan remains in compliance with FATF Recommendation-1
           -	      Value of registered prize bonds as a share of outstanding prize bonds; target 2 percent
           -	      The Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of SLIC meet the fit and proper criteria

         *as of June 30, 2017


    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Program Development Objective is to improve transparency and resource management of targeted departments. The project has the following three result areas:

    1.	 Transparency and access to services to improve citizens’ access to information and facilitate access to key services.

    2.	 Monitoring of service delivery to support performance management and support decision-making to improve services.
    3.	 Resource mobilization and value for money: to improve the collection of the urban immovable property tax (UIPT) and to increase accountability and efficiency in public
        procurement.

    KEY INTERVENTIONS:
    ■■     Promoting proactive disclosure of information required under the Punjab Right to Information Act (RTI Act) on government websites.
    ■■     Facilitating access to information about public services through call centers.
    ■■     Monitoring the performance of public service providers with smart phones and real-time data analysis on management dashboards.
    ■■     Building a digital property tax data base and broadening the tax base by including previously unregistered properties.
    ■■     Making public procurement more efficient by tracking all procurement processes in a Management Information System.

    KEY RESULTS:
    All targets of the program’s Disbursement-Linked Indicators (DLIs) for the first four years have been achieved, as confirmed by annual Third Party Validation (TPV) reports. Progress
    toward the Program Development Objective is on track. Key results include the following:
    ■■     75 government organizations are publishing institutional information on their websites as required by the RTI Act.
    ■■     A Citizen Contact Center is providing information by telephone, SMS, email, and Whatsapp to citizens’ enquiries on 27 public services.
    ■■     The delivery of six public services provided by the education, health, and livestock departments is being tracked in real time thanks to data collected through smart phones
           from all 36 districts and reported on management dashboards. Indicators monitored through this system include teachers’ and students’ attendance in schools, the adequacy
           of medical supplies in hospitals, the immunization of children, and agricultural extension and veterinary services provided to farmers.
    ■■     The urban property records of 18 districts have been digitized and over 300,000 additional properties have been added to the database. This has the issuance of automated
           invoices and contributed to the growth of UIPT receipts by 98% since FY13. The digitization of urban property records in the remaining 18 districts is due to be completed in
           the final year.
    ■■     A public procurement Management Information System is being used to track procurements by 90 government organizations and generate statistics on their procurement
           performance (speed of procurement completion, number of bidders, contract prices).

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Sindh, the most industrialized and second largest province with a population of 48 million, is facing important development challenges and has yet to realize its full potential.
    Improving revenue mobilization and expenditure management performance is necessary to raise the provincial curve of economic and social growth. While federal transfers,
    which constitute 70 percent of the revenues of the province, provide a significant base for provincial expenditure, federal transfer revenues are not adequate to finance the existing
    infrastructure and social development needs. The development objective of the project is to strengthen public-sector performance in Sindh through improved revenue generation
    and expenditure management. The project has two components:
    ■■     Results-based financing to support selected public sector management (PSM) reforms ($40 million). These reforms concern four results areas: (i) increasing tax revenue
           mobilization; (ii) enhancing performance of PFM systems; (iii) strengthening of public procurement performance; and (iv) improving management of the development
           portfolio.
    ■■     Technical assistance (TA) support capacity building and institutional strengthening required for the achievement of the targeted reforms ($10 million) in all four results areas
           of the project.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESULTS:
    ■■     The Project Development Objective indicators are the following: increased collection of sales tax on services; improved credibility of budget execution; and reduced time-
           frames for the completion of public procurement processes. The first two indicators are fully on track.
    ■■     Sindh Tax Reform Strategy and Public Financial Management Strategies have been approved.
    ■■     The Sindh Sales Tax to Services targets for 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16, and 2016/17 were achieved.
    ■■     The staffing plan of the Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) has been revised to reflect current staffing needs. A pre-service training program for incoming staff is under way.
    ■■     Most required elements of the automation plan of SRB have been implemented, and the remaining ones are in progress.
    ■■     SRB has submitted the combined Annual Reports for FY2014/15 and FY2015/16 for the approval of the Chief Minister.
    ■■     The external debt management manual of FD has been prepared and is awaiting approval by the Chief Minister.
    ■■     Recruitment of managerial staff for the Internal Audit Department of the Finance Department (FD) is under way, but no working-level auditors have been hired or re-assigned.
           The FD is working on an internal audit approach and methodology.
    ■■     The Sindh Public Procurement Regulatory Authority is working to finalize the certification course on procurement processes.
    ■■     The Annual Development Plan Management Information System is being rolled out to monitor the implementation progress of projects by five departments (Education;
           Health; Irrigation; Energy; Construction and Works).

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) is one of Pakistan’s less developed regions, with a number of economic and social development indicators lagging behind the national averages. With
    the devolution of competences to provinces in several areas and increased federal transfers, KP has increased spending on public services but the increase of funds has strained its
    Public Financial Management (PFM) system. Dispersion of resources in Public Investment Management (PIM) has also resulted in quality issues in service delivery. The province
    also has much scope to further increase its own-source revenues and reduce its dependency on federal transfers.

    The development objective of the Governance and Policy project (GPP) is to strengthen the capacity for Sales Tax on Services (STS) collection, and improve public investment
    management and accountability of public service delivery with a focus on the water sector, a priority sector for the provincial government with a large share in the development
    budget. The GPP has three components:
    ■■     Increasing government’s capacity for revenue mobilization (STS collection) and PFM ($5.25 million). This component includes the development of a revenue mobilization
           framework based on an assessment of the province’s revenue potential, technical assistance and training for STS administration and the development of a PFM reform
           strategy.
    ■■     Strengthening public investment and accountability in public services ($5.25 million). This component includes assessing, developing and implementing an action plan
           for improving KP’s PIM system; increasing the geo-mapping and online publication of public investment assets in the water sector for improved monitoring (results-based
           financing); and improving the effectiveness of key Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRMs) and accountability institutions.
    ■■     Improving capacity for the coordination of governance reforms and operational management ($2.5 million) notably through the establishment of a Governance Reform
           Support Unit in the Planning and Development Department (P&DD).

    EXPECTED RESULTS:
    The Project targets the following key results:
    ■■     Increased collection of the STS
    ■■     Increased average size of the appropriation per water sector project in the Annual Development Program (ADP)
    ■■     Increased citizen engagement through regular collection of citizen feedback and direct engagement of citizens in monitoring service delivery in the water sector (particular
           attention will be paid to having 50% of the feedback providers and monitors be women)
    ■■     Improved skills of public officials (certification in FM, procurement, project management, and M&E)

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Balochistan is the poorest of Pakistan’s provinces and has the lowest social indicators and widest gender disparities. As such, the province was the biggest beneficiary of the 7th
    NFC award of 2010 which allowed for greater spending on public services, but has also strained the implementation capacity of the public administration with challenges to fully
    execute the development budget. In addition, Balochistan’s own-source tax collection is the lowest among the provinces with much scope to increase the collection of the Sales Tax
    on Services (STS) especially, for which the province has now taken responsibility. Public investment management and procurement is hampered by project fragmentation resulting
    in sub-optimal service delivery.

    The Governance and Policy Project’s development objective is to strengthen the capacity for STS collection and improve accountability in public financial management and public
    service delivery in the education and irrigation sectors. These two sectors have the largest allocations in the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) of the province. The Project
    has four components:
    1.	     Increasing effectiveness of sales tax collection ($5.5 million). This component includes the development of a strategic tax revenue mobilization plan based on an assessment
            of the province’s revenue potential and technical assistance and training for STS administration.
    2.	     Strengthening accountability in public financial management ($5 million). This component will include the development of a PFM reform strategy and establishing various
            key functions and units in the Finance department.
    3.	     Improving public investment management and accountability in public services ($6 million). This component will include assessing, developing and implementing an
            action plan for improving Balochistan’s PIM system; developing a policy framework for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), developing government’s M&E capacity and
            improving the effectiveness of key Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRMs) and accountability institutions.

    4.	     Improving capacity for the coordination of governance reforms and operational management ($2.5 million), notably through a Governance Reform Support Unit in the
            Planning and Development Department (P&DD).

    EXPECTED RESULTS:
    The Project targets the following key results:
    ■■      Increased collection of the STS.
    ■■      Increased average size of education and irrigation sector projects included in the PSDP
    ■■      Increased number of investment projects in the education sector and irrigation sectors that have been geo-mapped and published online
    ■■      Increase in the cases related to education resolved by the Office of Balochistan Ombudsman
    ■■      Increased number of officials with certification in financial management, internal audit, procurement, project management, and M&E

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) constitute Pakistan’s poorest and most-conflict affected region. Security risks, complete dependence upon and uncertainties about
    federal financing, financial management constraints, and low capacity across sectors have kept public service provision below national levels. The uncertainty, lack of capacity and
    transparency has particularly affected the budget process and public investment management which in turn hinders effective service delivery
    The Governance and Policy Project GPP) aims to increase transparency and effectiveness in public resource management and strengthen accountability of public service delivery.
    The project’s interventions focus on the agriculture sector (including livestock and irrigation), due to its critical contribution to the livelihoods of people in the region. The GPP in
    FATA has three components:
    ■■     Increasing transparency and accountability in the use of public resources ($6.5 million). This component supports priority PFM reforms towards a credible and transparent
           budget process and strengthening public procurement.
    ■■     Strengthening public investment management and service delivery ($7 million). This component includes assessing, developing and implementing an action plan for
           improving FATA’s PIM system; and the use and strengthening of performance management and citizen engagement tools to strengthen accountability and expand access to
           services in the agriculture sector.
    ■■     Improving capacity for the coordination of governance reforms and operational management ($3 million) through the establishment of a Governance Reform Support Unit
           in the Planning and Development Department (P&DD).

    EXPECTED RESULTS:
    The Project targets the following key results:
    ■■     Improved reporting of transactions through the extension of the National Financial Management Information Systems (NFMIS) at the level of the agencies and frontier
           regions of FATA;
    ■■     Timely disclosure of key budget documentation and dissemination through public hearings;
    ■■      Increased share of procurements conducted through competitive selection and published notices;
    ■■     Increased number of cases resolved by the FATA Tribunal; and
    ■■     Increased citizen engagement through regular collection of citizen feedback and direct engagement of citizens (at least 30 percent women) in monitoring service delivery
           in the agriculture sector

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Punjab, with 53 percent of the total population, holds the key to Pakistan’s progress towards attaining the SDGs. The Punjab Health Sector Strategy was approved in March 2013
    and the PHSR Project was financing the implementation of the strategy. During its implementation, the GOPb decided that some of the processes to achieve the objectives need
    to be changed and the focus was diverted. The project restructuring was done in April 2017 in order to realign the PHSRP with the Government of Punjab’s (GOPb) new reform
    priorities, as well as with the structural changes in the Punjab Department of Health since project approval.
    The Project Development Objective (PDO) remains relevant and the overall project focus remains unchanged. The project design is to assist the implementation of reforms
    proposed in the Punjab Health Sector Strategy and at the same time ensure that service disruption does not occur. The project has a Technical Assistance (TA) component to provide
    an opportunity to the Departments of Health (Departments of Specialized Healthcare and Medical Education & Primary and Secondary Healthcare) to avail specific skills that are
    required during the reform process. The pace of implementation has improved and the project rating has been upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in the latest ISR.
    The project components are:

    Component 1: Improving Health Service Delivery; Component 2: Enhancing Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Health System; Component 3: Strengthening Provincial Department
    of Health Management Capacity; Component 4: Improving the Capacities in Technical Areas; and Component 5: Strengthening Nutrition Interventions.

    Under the restructuring, the focus of the interventions under each component has been modified, due to: (i) the change in policy directions and consequent deletion of related
    DLIs, and (ii) the increased focus on malnutrition activities. The original Component 1 remains as is, but with a renewed focus on family planning and maternal health, to be
    financed through DLIs. The original Components 2 and 3 now focus on: complaint management systems and health care waste management. Technical assistance activities under
    Component 4 was modified to provide support for the agreed policy reforms, the bifurcated departments, and service delivery actions. Input-based financing will continue to be
    used for this component. A new Component 5 has consolidated all activities concerning nutrition to allow for a more focused implementation and monitoring of the activities.

    EXPECTED RESULTS:
    Increase in the number of fully immunized children 12-23 months of age and births attended by skilled health personnel; Increase in modern contraceptive prevalence rate;
    Children 0-24 months of age receiving basic package of nutrition services; Increase in the proportion of children 0-24 months of age being screened (at least biannually) for
    malnutrition in the target districts.

         * as of August 31, 2017. Project financing additionally includes $25 M from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation as a partial buy-down to be made available within 6 months of project closure, dependent on achievement
         of performance targets.


    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    There is intense international scrutiny on Pakistan’s polio eradication efforts. Global polio eradication depends on Pakistan and Afghanistan interrupting transmission in 2017. If
    this does not occur, the projected global resources required to meet the goal will expand by an additional $800 million each year. The Bank has provided financial support of about
    $250 million for Pakistan’s polio eradication efforts from 2003 to 2014. At the same time, routine immunization in Pakistan has performed poorly, with some of the worst coverage
    in the region – concentrated in the poorest populations. Consequent outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases such as measles frequently cause significant childhood mortality
    and morbidity, provoking public anger. The Bank, therefore, in partnership with Gavi, USAID, the Gates Foundation, and the Government has developed the National Immunization
    Support Project (NISP), with a results-based structure with an emphasis on strengthening provincial capacity to manage and implement this essential public health function.

    The project also addresses the historical fragmentation of financing of routine immunization. The NISP IDA Credit of $50mil is co-financed with the Government of Pakistan
    Immunization Programs (Federal and Provincial), as well as a multi-donor trust fund for immunization contributed to by Gavi and USAID (total $94 million, of which $79.60
    million is for recipient executed activities). NISP also includes an innovative financing instrument – the “results-linked buy down”. Disbursement-Linked Indicators (DLIs) govern
    disbursement of the majority of the credit and grant resources, but these are also complemented by partial loan cancellation commitment from the Gates Foundation ($25
    million), subject to achievement of the same DLI targets.
    CSOs: With poor children as the major beneficiaries the project has a strong poverty focus. The project specifically aims to benefit vulnerable groups and previously neglected
    groups to increase their access to immunization by engaging CSOs. The role of CSOs will be expanded to address the barriers to routine immunization at policy and planning,
    services provision, and community levels. Formal CSO representation on the Steering committee of the multi-donor trust fund has been instituted, to ensure an effective voice
    for the project beneficiaries in project activities.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
    ■■     An innovative mechanism for coordinated procurement of vaccines between the Federal and Provincial levels of Government was developed with Bank technical assistance
           – ensuring efficient and continuous national vaccine procurement. A new system of national accounts for immunization has also been developed, which will promote evi-
           dence-based planning and sustainable financing for this key public health program.
    ■■     The technical and fiduciary capacity of the provincial and federal government agencies responsible for implementing the immunization program have been increased. All
           provinces report achievement of the first year DLI target in instituting and using detailed supervisory plans for vaccination at the local level.
    ■■     Procurement of $36 million in essential vaccine storage and transport equipment has been approved, which will leverage an additional $20 million in grant resources in
           kind, to ensure vaccines are delivered quickly and with high quality to the sites of service delivery.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    For decades, Pakistan has had persistently high rates of stunting (and other forms of malnutrition) and currently has the third highest number of stunted children in the world.
    Nationally, 44 percent of children under five suffer from stunting; in Sindh Province, the rate of stunting is 48 percent. To reverse the situation, the Government has developed and
    approved an Accelerated Action Plan for Reduction of Stunting and Malnutrition (AAP) with the ambitious goal of reducing stunting from 48 percent to 30 percent by 2021 and
    has requested Bank support in achieving this goal. The Government has estimated the cost of implementing the AAP over the period 2017-21 at approximately $646 million. The
    proposed project in the amount of $63 million would contribute to the implementation of the AAP through a results-based approach to link disbursements to the achievement of
    agreed-upon, pre-defined indicators.

    The Project Development Objective is to reduce the stunting rate by targeting the most affected districts in Sindh Province. The project proceeds will finance: (i) results
    contributing to the achievement of the objectives set forth in the Sindh Government’s AAP; and (ii) technical assistance and other inputs needed by the government to facilitate
    the implementation of the AAP. Under Component 1 (Expanding Access to a Multi-sectoral Package of Services for Reducing Stunting --$45 million), the project will support a multi-
    sectoral package of services shown to contribute to the PDO by financing results, measured by the achievement of DLIs, under a defined Eligible Expenditure Program (EEP). Under
    Component 2 (Strengthening Key Cross-cutting Nutrition-related Interventions and Project Management-- $18 million), the project will finance technical assistance and selected
    inputs to support: (i) measures for implementing the pilot Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program for women and children in the poorest quintile to access health and nutrition
    services; (ii) development and implementation of an overarching multi-sectoral communications strategy for social and behavior change; and (iii) institutional arrangements for
    cross-cutting interventions including coordination, strengthening accountability, citizen engagement, integrated multi-sectoral data information systems, monitoring, evaluation,
    gender and supervision.

    EXPECTED RESULTS:
    For the nutrition-specific interventions (health and nutrition), the indicators targeting vulnerable groups include: (i) pre-natal visits, iron supplementation, tetanus toxoid

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    This operation combines a single-tranche stand-alone IDA DPC of $500 million and an IBRD policy-based guarantee (PBG) in the amount of $420 million to support commercial
    financing by Pakistan. The operation has two development objectives: (i) improving the business environment and (ii) enhancing fiscal management by improving revenue
    management and making public spending more pro-poor. After successfully restoring macroeconomic stability, supported by the previous FSIG DPC series, the Government of
    Pakistan is stepping up efforts through deeper reforms and an accelerated pace of implementation. Implementation continues in important areas that have been supported by
    previous operations, such as the removal of discriminatory tax exemptions and efforts to improve the business environment. Reform efforts are becoming more granular and
    focusing on more difficult aspects. For example, in order to expand the tax base and improve tax compliance, FBR is reforming its approach to audits and is increasing its focus
    on large taxpayers. Efforts to reform SOEs are going beyond privatization transactions and focusing on reforming whole sectors and improving the information base for both
    privatization and SOE reform.

    The operation supported a significant overhaul of the legislative and institutional framework of the financial sector. The Government has adopted a revised poverty line, which
    increases the poverty headcount from below 10 percent to almost 30 percent. The WBG will support the country’s efforts to develop the financial sector and facilitate Pakistan’s
    access to international markets. The operation and the choice of instruments are well-aligned with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development adopted in July
    2015, with a strong focus on domestic resource mobilization as well as the use of multilateral development finance to leverage additional resources from the private sector. The
    PBG was used in June 2017 by the Government of Pakistan to raise $700 million through a loan, significantly extending maturity while also securing good pricing.

    EXPECTED RESULTS:
    To measure results, the following outcome indicators will be used:
    ■■     In the Doing Business 2018 report, the Distance to Frontier Indicator for Getting Credit will have increased to 50.
    ■■     By March 2017, the number of taxpayers who submit a tax return online will have increased to 773,000. (Achieved)
    ■■     By June 2017, listed capital in capital market will have increased by 15 percent to PKR 1.46 trillion
    ■■     By 2017, housing finance market will have increased to 2 percent as a percentage of private sector credit.
    ■■     By 2016, consolidated SOE financial information will be available to the public. (Achieved)
    ■■     By end June 2016, State Life Insurance Corporation will be subject to the same rules as other corporate insurance companies by complying with Companies Ordinance 1984.
    ■■     By June 2017, the overall tax collection is at least 12.2 percent of GDP. (Achieved)
    ■■     By June 2017, the share of foreign debt as a percentage of total public debt is between 20-35 percent, in line with the Medium-Term Debt Strategy. (Achieved)
    ■■     By June 2017, the number of households with updated poverty scorecard information registered in the National Socio-Economic Registry will have reached 2.5 million.
           (Achieved)
    ■■     By June 2016, the Government of Pakistan will have published a new poverty rate using the latest data (2013/14) along with trends in poverty on the old line. (Achieved)

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    In response to militancy, in June 2014 the Pakistan Army launched a second security operation in five FATA Agencies (North Waziristan, South Waziristan, Orakzai, Kurram
    and Khyber) resulting in displacement of approximately 340,000 families and necessitating a safety net response. With the success of military operations in most areas, the
    Government has started the TDPs repatriation process. The World Bank has provided support to the Government of Pakistan (GoP) through the FATA Temporarily Displaced Persons
    Emergency Recovery Project (TDP ERP) to support early recovery of families affected by the militancy crisis, promote child health, and strengthen emergency response safety net
    delivery systems in affected areas of FATA.The project has two main components:
    ■■     Early Recovery Grant (ERG) and Livelihood Support Grant (LSG). This component will aim to support the early recovery of approximately 326,000 TDP families from FATA
           through two unconditional cash grants; (i) a one-time Early Recovery Grant (ERG) of $350 per family and; (ii) a Livelihood Support Grant (LSG) of $160 per family in four
           monthly installments of $40. The LSG will be delivered through One-Stop-Shop (OSS) registration and delivery centers to be set up in FATA through a phased rollout.
    ■■     Promoting child health in selected areas of FATA. Under this component, a conditional cash grant shall be provided with the intent to promote uptake of child health services
           offered to families with children aged 0-24 months through four pilot OSSs. Registration of eligible families and periodic attendance of awareness sessions at OSS will be
           accompanied by a Child Wellness Grant (CWG). The grant amounts to $75 provided in three installments of $25 each for promoting positive health seeking behavior of
           families for their children. The World Bank support is budgeted to support 300,000 beneficiaries. Based on the learning and outcomes from the initial phase of testing the
           component in 4 OSS, the Government has now decided to roll out to all OSS.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
    ■■     Fourteen of the planned fifteen One-Stop-Shops (OSS) have been deployed in the five affected agencies of FATA.
    ■■     This is the first project globally to have attained readiness under STEP. All procurement activities are now being managed through the online procurement system.
    ■■     The project has achieved 65 percent of targets within the first year of operations. 85% of the results are overachieved per the timeline.
    ■■     Initial data from the field shows that despite the use of soft conditionality (self-election of beneficiaries for use of Child Wellness Package after receiving under CWG), over
           65 percent of beneficiaries opt to use the Package.
    ■■     98% of transfers withdrawn with 93% of beneficiaries satisfied with the program delivery

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Floods hit parts of Pakistan in early September 2014, including Punjab and the districts of Neelum, Hattian, Bagh, Poonch, Haveli, Kotli, Bhimber and Muzaffarabad. The disaster
    caused 367 deaths, mostly in Punjab province, in addition to damages to houses, agriculture, transport, irrigation and communications infrastructure. It is estimated by the
    NDMA that the floods affected over 2.5 million people in both rural and urban areas. The federal and provincial governments were proactive in relief operations in the immediate
    aftermath of the floods. Following the conclusion of the relief phase, the government moved towards medium- and longer-term planning for recovery, reconstruction, and
    increasing resilience. The Disaster and Climate Resilience Improvement Project was prepared in response to the government’s request for assistance in responding to the floods
    of 2014.
    The project development objective is to support restoration of flood protection infrastructure and strengthen government capacity to manage disasters and climate variability. The
    project comprises four components:
    ■■     Restoring Flood Protection Infrastructure and Upgrading Flood Management Systems ($100 million): to enhance physical resilience through the restoration, rehabilitation,
           and improvement of critical flood protection infrastructure.
    ■■     Managing Disasters and Climate Variability ($17 million): to strengthen the government’s capacity to better manage disasters. It would finance risk identification, institution-
           al strengthening for improved management of disasters and enhancing fiscal resilience.
    ■■     Project Management ($8 million): will be implemented through mandated government departments including Punjab Irrigation Department, Punjab Disaster Management
           Authority, and the State planning and development department. It will support engagement of additional resources at project implementation units within these depart-
           ments.
    ■■     Contingent Emergency Response Component: In the event of a natural disaster, critical emergency response and recovery costs in the province may be supported through
           this component upon activation.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
    ■■     In Punjab, 7 priority flood embankment works are at advanced stages of implementation and would be completed by the end of the year while 15 works are at advanced
           stages of preparation and expected to be awarded by early next year. Capacity Assessment of PDMA has been completed and specialized equipment for Provincial Emergency
           Operations Center (PEOC) including incident command vehicles have been procured. A draft Disaster Risk Financing Strategy for the Province will also be presented to the
           Finance Minister by the end of the month.
    ■■     In the State, capacity assessment of SDMA, DRM plan, logistics plan and early warning mapping and assessment has been completed and 10 District Emergency Operations
           Centers (DEOCs) have been established.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Sindh Resilience Project (SRP) will focus on improving institutional capacities, performance, and preparedness at key agencies responsible for managing disaster risk in
    Sindh. In addition, the Project will further contribute toward enhancing resilience to hydro-meteorological disasters including floods and drought through physical infrastructure
    investments. The dialogue with Government of Sindh has established floods and droughts as the highest priority areas, owing to high frequency and impact. The dialogue has
    further identified critical needs in these areas, along with an estimate of resources needed to address these priorities.
    The project development objectives are to mitigate flood and drought risks in selected areas and to strengthen Sindh’s capacity to manage natural disasters. The project comprises
    three components:
    ■■     Strengthening Disaster and Climate Risk Management ($23.75 million): To primarily focus on key disaster management institutions in terms of strengthening operational
           systems and capacities at the provincial and district levels. In addition, it will support the Government of Sindh to develop greater ‘fiscal resilience’ through strengthening
           financial capacity and risk financing mechanisms, and mainstream disaster risk reduction in development planning and budgeting processes.
    ■■     Improving Infrastructure and Systems for Resilience ($96 million): This will primarily support restoration and improvement of embankments at high risk sites along the Indus
           for protection against riverine floods as well as construction of small rainwater-fed recharge dams in drought prone regions in Sindh. It will also assist the Sindh Irrigation
           Department towards implementing project interventions and increasing operational efficiency.
    ■■     Contingent Emergency Response: In the event of a natural disaster, critical emergency response and recovery costs in the province may be supported through this component
           upon activation.

    KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
    ■■     3 civil works projects on flood embankments will be awarded this year and work commenced. Combined, the 3 projects will protect 371,334 people and 227,450 acres of
           land from floods.
    ■■     Capacity assessment of PDMA is underway, based on which capacity building activities would be designed and rolled out.
    ■■     An initial Fiscal Disaster Risk Assessment (FDRA) has been completed for the Province.

    environment regulatory reforms (e.g. business registration, permits and licensing, contract enforcement and property registration) as well as motivate and finance the deployment
    of important soft and hard industrial infrastructure along the economic spatial development plan (e.g. industrial zones and industrial cluster development centers). The project will
    promote sustainable industrialization from an environmental and social point of view (e.g. Combined Effluent Treatment Plants and special amenities for female workers within
    industrial zones). The implementation of the actions required to achieve the results will be supported by a parallel program of Bank-executed technical assistance financed by DFID.

    EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■     -	    Aggregate improvement of Punjab’s performance with respect to business registration, contract enforcement, construction permits and property registration.
    ■■     -	    Steps taken by Punjab to improve its contribution to Pakistan’s compliance with the GSP+ Labor Conventions. This DLI is directly linked to the second Program Key
           Result.
    ■■     -	    Steps toward improvement of investment promotion, measured in particular through the number of investment announcements by foreign investors.
    ■■     -	    Steps toward developing and implementing a spatial strategy for Punjab, to prioritize and coordinate public investments.
    ■■     -	    Steps toward the effective development of industrial infrastructure through public private partnerships.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Pakistan depends on relatively scarce water resources, especially those of the Indus Basin. The extensive system of canals that distribute Indus water supports an irrigation sector
    that represents close to one quarter of the national economy and employs 45 percent of the labor force. As population and water demands grow, Pakistan faces increasing water
    management challenges, including: (i) increasing water productivity in irrigation; (ii) improving the process of water accounting and equitable allocation; (iii) closing power
    shortfalls including through hydropower development; (iv) reducing water pollution, and (v) improving resilience to drought and floods that are expected to worsen with climate
    change.

    The project aims to improve the management and investment planning of water resources in the Indus River Basin, including through building the capacity of federal and
    provincial institutions for water resources planning and management, strengthening water management policy and governance, and improving the technology and capabilities
    for water measurement and water resources analysis.

    Based on successful completion of WCAP phase I (see key achievements below), a request of government of Pakistan $ 34.95 million Additional Financing was approved by the
    Bank to sustain the momentum of the project and to continue to deliver high-level strategic support to addressing water sector challenges for Pakistan.

    In the second phase the project will guide implementation of the National Flood Protection Plan-IV and the National Water Policy, establish modern systems for water measurement
    for the major Indus Basin Irrigation System infrastructure, improve flow forecasting and technical aspects of water resources planning and management at the basin scale, and
    strengthen the capacity and water research infrastructure within the provinces.

    EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
    ■■     Feasibility study and detailed engineering design for eleven small / medium dams
    ■■     Preparation of the Pakistan Water Statistics Handbook
    ■■     Preparation of the National Flood Protection Plan-IV
    ■■     Development of a GIS/MIS Centre and Decision Support System for the Indus River System Authority
    ■■     Informing preparation of the (draft) National Water Policy

       * as of June 30, 2017


    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Balochistan is comprised of eighteen river basins crossing six agro-ecological zones. Given the challenges of topography and inadequate water distribution infrastructure less than
    half of the water available to Balochistan from the Indus is utilized. Less than 40 percent of Balochistan’ s available water is from the Indus River, and this fraction is only available to
    around 5 percent of the area of the province. The nature of the climate also means that extended droughts and destructive flash floods are relatively common, and are expected to
    worsen with future climate change. Groundwater is a small fraction of the overall resource but its comparative reliability means it is in high demand. In the absence of regulation or
    coherent management, groundwater has fueled horticultural development, the most economically important component of agriculture in Balochistan, and supports most urban
    areas and is thus over-abstracted leading to major declines in groundwater levels.
    In spite of its considerable mineral and energy resources and lack of reliable water, weak governance and a lack of investment mean the province is still highly dependent on
    agriculture (60 percent of provincial GDP and 67 percent of labor). Recent economic growth has been largely driven by expansion of tube-well irrigation for high-value agriculture,
    especially horticulture with key agricultural products including wheat, apples, grapes, vegetables, barley, milk and meat. While per capita water availability in Balochistan is well
    above the national average, this simply reflects the low population. Variability in water availability is far higher than the national average and per capita water storage is only
    20 percent of the (grossly inadequate) national value. As a consequence, Balochistan is the least water-secure province in Pakistan, the most at risk from climate change, and
    the least able to cope with water-related development challenges. In the current context improving rural livelihoods and stimulating economic growth require vastly improved
    management of the scarce water resources of the province.
    The Project Development Objective is to strengthen the provincial government’s capacity for water resources monitoring and management and to improve community-based
    water management for targeted irrigation schemes in Balochistan.
    The project will be implemented in two high priority river basins (the Nari and Porali) as a first step in a long-term process of province-wide water sector strengthening and
    reform. In each river basin, the project will support: (A) Institutions, Capacity and Information – including intuitional strengthening, and hydrometeorological data collection and
    management; and (B) Water Infrastructure and Management Investments – rehabilitating irrigation schemes, improving watershed and rangeland management, improving on-
    farm water management and productivity.

    EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
    The project will primarily benefit around 70,000 rural households (approximately 570,000 people) through more productive and better managed irrigation schemes and livestock-
    supporting rangelands, reduced flood protection and improved potable water supplies. However, the project will also benefit provincial government agencies through training in
    water planning and management, and new investments in hydrometeorological monitoring and modeling.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Bank Alfalah Limited (“BAFL” or the “Bank”) is the fifth largest private sector bank in the country. It has a network of 650 branches that includes 153 Islamic Banking Branches. BAFL
    has an asset base of $9.1 billion, deposits of $6.3 billion and an equity base of $609 million as of June 17 with a ~6.0% market share (based on total assets). It also has presence
    in Bangladesh, Afghanistan and UAE and is listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. The Bank also has one of the largest Islamic banking networks in the country in terms of branches
    across Pakistan. BAFL is majority owned by the Abu Dhabi Group comprising members of the Al Nahyan family, one of the ruling families of the UAE and leading businessmen
    and associates based in UAE.

    IFC’s relationship with BAFL started in 2007 through the GTFP/ trade program with an original limit of $20 million that has been gradually increased to $80 million. On the AS
    side, IFC completed a SME advisory program with the Bank related to capacity building of its SME banking operations in June 2014. This engagement paved the way for an
    equity opportunity in the Bank, and IFC made an equity investment of $66.7 million for 15% stake in December 2014. IFC is now engaged with the Bank on other AS discussions
    including agricultural financing and non-financial services.

    IFC is currently engaged with the Bank on a supply chain finance advisory initiative, the mandate of which is expected to be signed in September 2017. Also, the IFC investment
    team is discussing a $50-75 million SME facility to support the Bank in growing its SME portfolio. The concept note on the facility is already approved. Additionally, a sustainable
    energy finance facility is also being discussed to enable BAFL to build its green banking portfolio.

    KEY RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
    ■■     The equity investment provided critical capital support to the Bank. IFC’s investment is supporting the Bank to grow its conventional and Islamic banking operations, increase
           penetration into priority areas like SME banking and agricultural finance, helping improve access to finance in the country
    ■■     The SME Advisory project ran from June 2012 to June 2014, where a new SME unit was set up, the credit processes were re-engineered to be more efficient and attuned to
           the smaller SMEs, and competitive differentiation was ensured through introducing non-financial advisory function.
           ■■     o	          BAFL became the first bank in the country to host SME toolkit, which offers a web-based platform outreach to the market.
           ■■     o	          BAFL has disbursed 61,858 new SME loans since IFC’s SME Advisory engagement in September 2012, amounting to $6 billion.
    ■■     The GTFP/ trade facility helped BAFL finance trade commitments of approximately $495 million since inception, supporting trade of essential commodities such as oil and
           gas, agricultural products, chemicals and others.
    ■■     BAFL has developed an environmental and social management system and is implementing it across its portfolio expected to have a demonstration effect and will help in
           making sustainable lending a sector wide trend.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    China Three Gorges Corporation (“CTGC”), one of the largest renewable power companies in the world is a key partner for IFC in the Pakistan power sector. CSAIL was established
    by CTGC’s international investment arm – China Three Gorges International Corporation (“CTGI”) - and was joined by IFC as a founder shareholder, with a 15% shareholding for
    a committed investment of $125 million. Silk Road Fund also joined CSAIL in 2017 as an equity partner, with a 15% shareholding. CSAIL is structured as a scalable investment
    platform to develop, own and operate renewable power generation projects in Pakistan. It represents one of the largest renewable energy platform investments for IFC, structured
    as a strategic engagement, targeting a significant development impact in the Pakistan power sector and a clear and well defined additionality role for IFC.

    CSAIL currently owns a portfolio of multi-stage renewable power projects with total capacity of around 2,600 MW, for an estimated investment of around $6b. The portfolio
    comprises an operational wind project (50MW), two wind projects (100MW) and a hydro project (720MW) financially closed and under construction, and two hydro projects
    (1,124 MW & 640 MW) at early development stages. All portfolio projects are majority owned and managed by CSAIL through locally incorporated project-financed, single purpose
    companies. The under-construction wind and hydro projects are expected to be operational in 2018 and 2021 respectively, while the two under development hydro projects are
    expected to achieve phased commissioning by 2025.
    IFC partnership in CSAIL is premised on bringing together IFC’s sector, country, E&S, governance and commercial expertise, and CTGC’s technical, operational and financial strengths
    to create a large independent and investible power company that can attract further private capital and eventually be listed internationally. IFC continues to make focused value
    added contributions to the evolution of CSAIL, primarily in the form of adopting best practice international corporate governance standards and developing in-house capabilities
    and requisite systems to follow IFC Performance Standards for each of its portfolio projects. In terms of the significant development impact of this project, IFC participation not
    only helps address the country’s power supply deficit through development of sizeable incremental low cost generation capacity, utilizing indigenous, renewable resources but
    it also facilitates the single largest investment in Pakistan’s power sector, as a demonstration effect for increased private investment in the renewable energy sector in Pakistan.

    IMPACT/ EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■     Bridge half of Pakistan’s existing supply shortfall, estimated at around 5,000 MW;
    ■■     Increase the available generation capacity in Pakistan by 10-15% and renewable power generation by 25-30%;
    ■■     Significantly reduce the average cost of generation by substituting expensive oil-fired generation with low cost hydros,
    ■■     Substantial foreign exchange savings through the substitution of imported fuel oil, a critical benefit given Pakistan’s balance of payments weaknesses;
    ■■     Increase private sector share in overall generation by 10-15%; and
    ■■     Provide access to electricity for 11.2 million individuals – 6% of the total population.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    ■■     The company owns and operates the first LNG receiving re-gasification and storage terminal at Port Qasim near Karachi in Pakistan. In 2014, the company signed a 15-year
           LNG Service Agreement with Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC); whereby SSGC (along with Pakistan State Oil) is responsible for the LNG supply at the terminal while paying
           a tolling fee for LNG handling and storage services on take-or-pay basis. For the re-gasification and storage of LNG, the terminal relies on a Floating Storage and Regasification
           Unit (FSRU), which is being leased under a long-term arrangement from Excelerate Energy L.P-- a world leading LNG storage and regasification solutions provider.
    ■■     The project’s sponsor is Engro Corporation, which is one of Pakistan’s largest industrial conglomerates.
    ■■     The project entails an A-loan of $20 million, mobilization of $30 million in the form of a Parallel loan from ADB and a straight equity investment of around $14.1 million for
           a 20% stake.
    ■■     Since commissioning in March 2015, Elengy Terminal is the only operating LNG import facility in Pakistan. The terminal is handling a contractual LNG volume of around 1.5
           MTPA during the first year of operation and 3 MTPA starting the second year of operation. In addition, the company is in discussion with SSGC to handle an additional 200
           mmcfd of LNG at the terminal to increase total throughput to 4.5 MTPA

    IMPACT:
    ■■     The project has a significant development impact addressing the country’s severe gas supply deficit, which is expected to grow over the coming years. Since its commissioning
           in March 2015, Elengy Terminal is the only operating LNG import facility in Pakistan. The terminal is handling the contractual LNG volume of around 1.5 MTPA during the first
           year of operation and 3 MTPA starting the second year of operation
    ■■     The project enables import of natural gas as a more economically viable feedstock for electric power generation, at a time when rapidly diminishing indigenous gas resources
           have resulted in the power sector becoming over-reliant on expensive imported fuel oil. In addition, it diversifies the country’s fuel supply mix and helps open one of the
           largest gas markets in Asia to the global LNG market;
    ■■     Success of the project has led to LNG being a major component of Pakistan’s energy mix (3 new LNG terminals are under development).

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Headquartered in the Netherlands, FrieslandCampina (FC) is the sixth largest dairy group globally with $12.2 billion sales in 2016 in more than 100 countries. Over recent years,
    FC has focused on growth in emerging markets where it currently generates around 40% of its revenues. FC is wholly owned by Zuivelcooperatie FrieslandCampina, Europe’s
    largest cooperative with 19,000 member farmers from the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.
    IFC has recently invested in FC’s acquisition of 51% of Engro Foods (EF) shares through a Dutch offshore SPV created for the purpose of this transaction. The IFC financing was to
    partly finance the acquisition and comprised (i) a structured equity investment with two tranches, a quasi-equity of €27.5 million and a straight equity of €12.5 million, for 9.2%
    of the shares in the SPV alongside an equal parallel structured equity investment by FMO, and (ii) an A loan of $100 million to FC (the Project). IFC’s indirect shareholding in EF is
    around 4.7%. The EF acquisition was completed in December 2016.

    EXPECTED IMPACT:
    The IFC investment features strong additionality, which include: (i) increased benefits to small-holder dairy farmers (200,000); (ii) enhancing supply-chain efficiencies in milk
    collection (270,000 distributors); (iii) job creation and inclusive growth; (iv) improving food safety and food security; and (v) promoting foreign direct investments to Pakistan
    (which as a result of the Project more than doubled since 2015).

    In addition, IFC participation (i) sends a strong market signal on the positive outlook for the Pakistani economy; (ii) provides support to a global company in a scalable manner;
    and (iii) helps to share risk in a challenging environment. In the absence of IFC’s participation, FC would opt for a smaller shareholding in the Company and as a consequence, the
    development impact benefits associated with the Project would be less likely to be realized.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    The Gulpur Hydropower Project consists of the construction, operation and maintenance of a greenfield, 102MW run-of-the-river hydro power plant, on the Poonch River, under
    a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer scheme. The project site is approximately 167 kilometers south-east of Islamabad and 28 kilometers upstream of the Mangla Dam Reservoir. The
    project is the third independent power producer of hydropower in Pakistan and will sell all of its electricity to the Central Power Purchasing Authority of Pakistan under a 30-year
    Power Purchase Agreement.
    The project will:
    ■■     Help increase much needed generation capacity using a domestic renewable resource, thereby increasing security of energy supply; Ease the severe energy demand-supply
           deficit in the country and the resulting drag of power shortages on economic growth;
    ■■     Help diversify the generation mix away from thermal power and contribute to lowering the average economic cost of power generation in Pakistan;
    ■■     Provide significant climate change and environmental benefits compared to alternative thermal power options in terms of displacing greenhouse gas emissions;
    ■■     Create jobs during the project construction and operating phase;
    ■■     Reduce reliance on imported fuel oil and help to offset trade and current account deficits.
    By providing long-term loan and guarantees to a much-needed infrastructure project, IFC & MIGA will play an important role in the overall project financing at a time when
    international commercial lenders and insurers are not open to long term financing/guarantees in Pakistan.

    EXPECTED RESULTS:
    ■■     Provision of clean power to the national grid by 2019.
    ■■     Provide environmental benefits compared to alternative thermal power options in terms of displacing greenhouse gas emissions.
    ■■     Create jobs during the construction and operation phase.

         IFC Project Summary.
         ** Total GTFP facility approved amount is $50 million.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Habib Bank Limited (HBL) is the largest bank in Pakistan in terms of assets, with a market share of approximately 17 percent. In April 2015, IFC invested $225m in HBL through a
    $150 million senior loan (including $86million mobilization) and $75m equity for a 3.08 percent equity stake. IFC’s relationship with HBL started in 2006 through a $50 million,
    eight-year, tier 2 sub debt which was fully repaid in December 2014. The purpose of the loan was to strengthen the capital base and support HBL’s turnaround and expansion post
    privatization. This engagement paved the way for IFC Advisory Services (AS) to help HBL improve its training infrastructure and processes. A GTFP facility was initiated with HBL in
    2007 with a $20 million line, which was enhanced over time to $100 million. Currently the line stands at $50 million. IFC entered into an AS agreement with HBL in June 2011
    to provide capacity building in Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) banking, which concluded in June 2013. IFC helped the bank: a) develop a value proposition for SMEs; b)
    re-engineer its credit and risk process; c) strengthen staff skill levels; and d) pilot its SME banking services. Subsequently, IFC launched a Rural Banking Advisory project with HBL
    in July 2013 to help develop new agri/rural products aimed at farmers and rural SMEs. This project is ongoing and is expected to improve access to finance in the rural finance
    market. In 2014, IFC launched another advisory project with HBL to help it position itself as a champion for women in the marketplace in Pakistan, both as an employer and as a
    bank for women. This project was successfully completed in June 2015 and led to HBL’s launch of a sub-brand for women called “Nisa”. In 2014, under the privatization program
    supported by the IMF, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) was looking to divest its shareholdings in the banking sector including the balance 41.5% shares in HBL, valued at over
    $1 billion. To facilitate the offering, GOP sought IFC’s support to catalyze international investor interest. IFC brought in CDC Group to invest $121 million and IFC’s name helped
    attract other international investors like Lazard, Templeton and Fidelity; which enabled the GOP to fully divest its stake in HBL in April 2015. The GOP offering was over-subscribed
    by 1.6 times with foreign investors participating with $750 million (75% of the offering); with the total issue closing at $1.02 billion making it the largest capital market transaction
    in Pakistan and in the Asian Frontier Markets at the time. IFC’s participated in the HBL privatization process with an investment of $ 75 million for a 3.08% equity stake. During
    the same period IFC also provide a $150 million senior loan to HBL (including $86 million mobilization from the ‘Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Program’); the “Loan” aiming
    to support HBL’s domestic and international growth, while the equity helped the GOP to successfully complete its critical target of HBL’s privatization. IFC’s investment in HBL
    was the largest investment by IFC in Pakistan, including mobilization, which was processed in a record time of 36 days. Given HBL’s outreach of more than 1,700 branches, IFC’s
    investments in HBL are expected to have a transformational impact in an IDA country ranked 5th globally among financially excluded populations. It will help increase financial
    inclusion, SMEs and rural and agri finance, women owned businesses and sustainable energy financing (SEF). It would also support HBL’s expansion in markets that are important
    for Pakistan for trade and remittances.

    During 2017, IFC partially reduced its equity investment in HBL given that IFC’s role to support the GOP’s privatization was complete. IFC’s shareholding in the Bank is currently
    2.06%. In August 2017, the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS), the main US supervisor and regulator of Habib Bank Limited’s (HBL) New York branch, enforced
    a civil penalty of up to $630 million on account of violation of a compliance program that the HBL NY bank branch was under over the past few years. Subsequently a settlement
    has been reached between the DFS and HBL on a fine of $225 million. Furthermore, HBL will voluntarily be closing their NY branch on a gradual basis.

    IMPACT/ KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
    ■■     IFC’s participation in the equity helped attract significant investor interest helping the largest equity offering by a Pakistani entity to be oversubscribed by 1.6x. IFC’s support
           was critical amidst the security, political, and economic uncertainties in Pakistan.
    ■■     SME & Agri AS: HBL has disbursed 131,864 new SME loans since September 2011, amounting to $7.1 billion and opened 310,697 new SME deposit accounts with help
           from IFC SME AS (completed in June 2013). IFC Agri AS is expected to complete by Dec 2017. It has helped HBL disburse 42,784 new agri loans amounting to $183 million.
    ■■     As a result of IFC’s Women Markets AS project that was completed in June 2015 and resulted in the launch of “Nisa”, a HBL sub brand for women, HBL has already added
           936,139 new deposit accounts for women and disbursed 23,569 consumer loans to female borrowers since January 2014.
    ■■     The GTFP trade facility helped HBL finance trade commitments of about $600 million since inception, supporting trade of essential commodities such as oil and gas, agricul-
           tural products, chemicals and others.
    ■■     HBL has developed a comprehensive environmental and social management system and has started implementing it across its portfolio. Given that HBL is the largest bank
           in the country this will have a demonstration effect and will help in making sustainable lending a sector-wide trend.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Karot Power Company Limited (KPCL) is a special purpose company dedicated for the construction, operation and maintenance of a 720 MW run-of-the-river hydropower plant
    being developed under a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) scheme on the Jhelum River in Pakistan. The project is the first hydropower IPP undertaken by China Three Gorges
    (CTG) in Pakistan under the China Three Gorges South Asia Investment (CSAIL) platform, an IFC investee company. It is expected to generate 2,970 GWh (net) annually and sell
    all its energy to the state-owned Central Power Purchasing Agency Guarantee Limited (CPPA-G), under a 30-year power purchase agreement. The base project cost, excluding
    contingencies, is $1,740 million, which will be funded by a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. IFC committed an A Loan of $100 million on November 25, 2016 and financial close was
    achieved on February 22, 2017. The remaining $1.3 billion debt is being provided by a consortium of Chinese lenders including the Export Import Bank of China (CEXIM), China
    Development Bank (CDB) and the Silk Road Fund (SRF). This is the largest hydropower and renewable energy project undertaken by IFC in its history. It is also the first hydro IPP
    to be financed by Chinese banks in the country. The project will:
    ■■    Set the precedent and help promote private sector investments in future large hydro IPPs
    ■■    Pave the way for financing of future hydro IPPs in Pakistan by Chinese banks, giving additional avenues of foreign currency financing to mitigate the pressure on Pakistan’s
          exchange rate
    ■■    Establish international best practice standards for environmental and social systems as well as corporate governance and financial systems for similar future hydro projects
    ■■    Produce lower cost electricity by utilizing a cost-competitive, indigenous, renewable resource to help mitigate Pakistan’s significant reliance on imported fuel for power
          generation
    ■■    Reduce the burden on two critical deficits: power deficit and sector financial deficit, both of which have significant negative spillovers on the country’s economic growth and
          development

    EXPECTED IMPACT/ RESULTS:
    ■■    Generate a total of c. 2,970 GWh of energy on an annual basis, thereby reducing the power supply deficit
    ■■    Provide access to electricity for approximately 3 million individual residential consumers
    ■■    Reduce GHG emissions of around 1.4 million tons of CO2 equivalent per annum
    ■■    Create approximately 3,000 temporary jobs during construction and 80 permanent jobs during operations

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Pakistan is facing one of the most severe energy crisis in the world with 144 million people either off-grid or suffering on average over 12 hours of load shedding a day. Annually
    households spend an estimated $2.2 billion on battery powered torches, candles and kerosene lanterns for lighting. This crisis impairs Pakistan’s capacity for economic growth and
    leaves families reliant on inefficient lighting solutions that account for an average of 13 percent of their household income.
    Lighting Global was developed by the World Bank and IFC, as a platform to support sustainable growth of the international off-grid lighting market, as a means of increasing
    energy access to people not connected to grid electricity, or areas poorly served by the grid.

    The Lighting Global program provides market insights, steers development of quality assurance frameworks for modern, off-grid lighting devices and systems, and promotes
    sustainability, in partnership with industry.

    IFC and World Bank jointly manage off-grid lighting programs in more than 11 African countries through the Lighting Africa program. The success of Lighting Africa has inspired
    programs in India, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

    Lighting Global supports Lighting Africa, Lighting Asia and Lighting Pacific, which work along the supply chain of off-grid lighting products and systems to reduce market entry
    barriers and first mover risks.

    Lighting Pakistan works to promote the development of a sustainable, clean and modern solar lighting market in Pakistan targeting households, businesses and micro-enterprises
    that are unserved or underserved by the grid. The program aims to increase access to lighting and associated services to 1.5 million people through:
    ■■     Quality Verification: Working with manufacturers who meet the Lighting Global Minimum Quality Standards;
    ■■     Business Development: Providing B2B connections between manufacturers and distributors/financiers;
    ■■     Market Intelligence: In-depth research into the off-grid lighting market to support client investment decisions;
    ■■     Consumer Awareness: A two year consumer awareness campaign to help consumer differentiate between good quality and poor quality lighting products.

    KEY IMPACT/ RESULTS:
    ■■     Number of Lighting Global Quality Certified Products Sold to date: 108,438
    ■■     Number of People with Access to Improved Services: 542,190
    ■■     GHG Emissions Reduced (t): 10,844

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    IFC has taken a lead role in supporting private wind energy projects in Pakistan by investing in five wind projects for a total of 356 MW, including: (i) 56MW Zorlu Energy; (ii) 50MW
    Metro Power; (iii) 50 MW Gul Ahmed Wind (iv) 50 MW Dawood TGL; and (v) 150 MW Tricon Boston (“Wind Energy Projects”). These projects are being undertaken under the 2006
    Policy for Development of Renewable Energy on a Build, Own and Operate (“BOO”) basis. The power produced will be purchased by Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee)
    Limited (CPPA-G), the state-owned off-taker, under a 20-year Energy Purchase Agreement (“EPA”) and fed into the national grid. Government of Pakistan (“GoP”) support in the
    form of sovereign guarantee for performance and payment obligations of CPPA-G are provided in the Implementation Agreement. Of the five projects, one project, Zorlu Energy,
    is operational since 2013, three others were commissioned in September and October 2016 (Metro, Gul Ahmed and Dawood TGL), while one project (Tricon Boston) has recently
    achieved financial close. IFC played an important role in mobilizing a total of $275 million debt from international financial institutions for these Wind Energy Projects. The Projects
    will:
    ■■     Help fill the significant power supply demand gap in Pakistan.
    ■■     Promote the use of renewable energy sources and contribute to the diversification of the existing generation mix by reducing the use of expensive imported oil and shifting
           towards a zero emission power.
    ■■     Promote energy efficiency and decrease GHG emission.
    ■■     Help mobilize funding by other DFIs to broaden the funding sources for this project as well as future wind projects.
    ■■     Support local banks to provide sustainable long-term financing for the development of renewable energy projects in Pakistan.

    EXPECTED RESULTS
    ■■     Generate a total of around 1,080 GWh of energy on an annual basis, providing additional power supply and helping reduce the power deficit.
    ■■     Provide access to clean electricity for approximately 1.2 million people
    ■■     Reduce GHG emissions of around 500,000 tons of CO2 equivalent per annum.
    ■■     Create approximately 300 permanent jobs during operations

    KEY PARTNERS:
    FMO, Proparco, OPIC, DEG, Asian Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, Alfalah Bank and local commercial banks.

    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
    Star Hydro Power Limited (SHPL) is a special purpose company for construction, operation and maintenance of a 147 MW run-of-the-river hydro power plant situated 120 km
    north of Islamabad, near the village of Patrind in the city of Muzaffarabad. SHPL will be the second hydropower IPP in Pakistan. It has an off-take agreement to sell electricity to the
    state-owned, Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited (CPPA-G) under a 30-year power purchase agreement. SHPL is 80 percent owned by Korea Water Resources
    Corporation (K-Water) and 20 percent by Daewoo Engineering and Construction Company Limited. The total project cost is approximately $436 million, including contingencies.
    In December 2011, IFC committed a $60 million ‘A’ loan that has a grace period of up to 66 months and final maturity of up to 17 years. In 2012, MIGA issued a guarantee for
    $148.5 million to cover an equity investment in SHPL by K-water, acting on behalf of itself and Daewoo, incorporated in Pakistan through KDS Hydro Private Limited of Singapore.
    The project will:
    ■■     Help increase much needed generation capacity using a domestic renewable resource, thereby increasing security of energy supply; Ease the severe energy demand-supply
           deficit in the country and the resulting drag of power shortages on economic growth;
    ■■     Help diversify the generation mix away from thermal power and contribute to lowering the average economic cost of power generation in Pakistan;
    ■■     Provide significant climate change and environmental benefits compared to alternative thermal power options in terms of displacing greenhouse gas emissions;
    ■■     Create jobs during the project construction and operating phase;
    ■■     Reduce reliance on imported fuel oil and help to offset trade and current account deficits.
    By providing long-term guarantees to a much-needed infrastructure project, MIGA will play an important role in the overall project financing at a time when international
    commercial insurers are not open to long term guarantees in Pakistan.

    IMPACT/ RESULTS:
    ■■     Provision of clean power for 310,000 customers by 2018.
    ■■     Economic rate of return of 17 percent.
    ■■     Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of about 280,000 tons of CO2 a year.

    KEY PARTNERS:
    Korea-Exim, Asian Development Bank, and Islamic Development Bank.
