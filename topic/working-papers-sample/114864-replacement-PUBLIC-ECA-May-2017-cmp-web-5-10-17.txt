Executive Summary
After strong economic headwinds in recent years, economies in Europe and Central Asia
(ECA) are returning to a more stable growth path. In the European Union a sustained, al-
beit modest, recovery has started to reduce unemployment, pushing inflation into positive
territory. In Eastern Europe the stabilization of oil prices at about $50 a barrel has provided
some breathing room for governments, which have begun adjusting their policies to the
lower prices.
    Even if the cyclical economic headwinds abate, major challenges remain. Brexit has
thrown the European Union into unchartered territory. In the eastern part of the region, the
decline in oil prices has left the financial system in many countries in dire straits. In most
countries in the region, the adjustment to the “new normal,” in which the conditions of the
boom period cannot be replicated, is still incomplete. Pivotal upcoming elections and sus-
tained geopolitical tensions further complicate the outlook for the region.
    Major changes in international specialization patterns also have implications for the
region Global competition and technological changes are shifting employment opportuni-
ties across occupations and sectors and changing the nature of labor contracts. In this envi-
ronment, the call for trade protection has become louder.
    Trade has contributed to development in ECA. It was critical to transition economies’
success in raising living standards during, and especially after, the 1990s. Integration into
global markets for energy, agriculture, and manufactured products enabled a more effi-
cient use of resources. Integration into the value chains of “factory Europe” led to techno-
logical catching up and the upgrading of industrial structures. The slowdown of China’s
exports, which has driven the recent slowdown in global trade, has opened up new op-
portunities for ECA.
    As trade remains a key part of their future success, many countries in ECA will have to
navigate three important new transitions. The first is the continued shift of resources from
production that is not internationally traded to production that competes in international
markets. During the boom period, large oil revenues, large capital inflows, and substantial
inflows of labor remittances allowed countries to import substantially more (nonenergy)
products than they exported. In the new normal, doing so is no longer possible; countries
need to engage in a sustained shift from imports to exports.
    The second transition is a reorientation toward Asia. ECA currently relies strongly on
intraregional trade and is underperforming in Asian markets. Robust future growth re-
quires a rebalancing of these trade links.
    The third transition is the shift from goods to services, where most future growth op-
portunities lie. The share of services in global consumption is rising, and services are in-
creasingly becoming tradable across borders. These trends are reflected in the rising share
of services in exports from Western Europe, but other parts of ECA are falling behind.
    All three transitions will have consequences for specialization patterns, investment pat-
terns, and labor markets. As countries navigate these transitions, they will have to rethink
not merely trade relations but the way factor markets are organized.

1.1	Overview
Countries in ECA have gone through turbulent times since the global financial
crisis of 2008. In the western part of the region, the European Union and neigh-
boring countries were mired in the fallout from the financial crisis, with weak-
ened banking sectors, lack of growth, high unemployment, and greatly narrowed
fiscal space. The Brexit vote—and voters’ dissatisfaction more generally—have
threatened European cohesion, and the refugee crisis has tested Europe’s capac-
ity to implement a unified policy responsive.
    In the Russian Federation and Central Asia, the fall in oil prices resulted in
greater income losses than experienced after the global financial crisis, creating
challenges well beyond income losses and fiscal pressures. Monetary policy re-
gimes became sustainable, prices of real estate and other assets tumbled, several
banks became insolvent, and demand for workers in construction and domestic
services softened.
    Calmer waters are probably on the horizon. In the western part of the region,
a continued recovery has begun to reduce unemployment, and inflation has
moved decisively into positive territory. In the eastern part of the region, govern-
ments have begun adjusting policies to the lower level of oil prices, which have
stabilized at about $50 a barrel. Exchange rate depreciations have reduced fiscal
pressures and made tradable sectors more competitive. Governments have
started resolving insolvencies in the banking sectors, although major challenges
remain. Fiscal policies are being modified to align with new economic realities.

              As the economic cycle moves into a more neutral phase, there is more space to
          address profound structural changes. New specialization patterns are emerging
          after the adjustment of commodity prices and the rebalancing in China. New
          technologies are changing production methods and upending traditional labor
          market relations. Most economies in ECA will have to facilitate the shift from
          nontradable production to internationally competitive production of tradable
          goods and services.
              As after any extraordinary boom and subsequent crisis, a new growth model
          is needed. During the boom, secular trends that challenged the existing growth
          models could be ignored, because incomes were rising. During the crisis and its
          direct aftermath, policy makers and economic decision makers were occupied
          with countercyclical responses. Now that the economic headwinds are easing,
          structural challenges are clearer and need to be addressed.



          1.2	 Despite political tensions, solid growth is likely
          Political rifts, social tensions, and geopolitical conflicts have dominated recent
          news about ECA. But the economic news has been positive (table 1.1). In the Euro-
          pean Union, recovery is being sustained, with 2017 and 2018 likely the fourth and
          fifth consecutive years in which growth will average almost 2 percent. As a result,
          unemployment rates are falling and inflation returning to more normal levels. In
          Eastern Europe and Central Asia, activity is rebounding after the fall in oil prices
          at the end of 2014. Stabilization of oil prices at around $50 per barrel—well above
          the in January 2016 low of $30 per barrel—has supported the rebound.
              The sustained recovery is most evident in Central Europe, where GDP growth
          continues to exceed 3 percent a year and the structure of the economy has im-
          proved. Exports of goods and services are growing more than twice as fast as
          GDP. The current account deficit, which peaked at close to 8 percent of GDP in
          2007, turned into a slight surplus in 2015. Government debt, which rose sharply
          after the global financial crisis, is stabilizing at about 50 percent of GDP.
              In 2009 Northern Europe experienced the steepest contraction of all ECA sub-
          regions. The contraction was especially steep in the Baltic States, which suffered
          a sudden reversal in capital inflows. The change forced an abrupt and sharp de-
          cline in these countries’ current accounts, which had deficits of more than 15
          percent of GDP in 2007. By 2009 Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania had surpluses.
          The contraction was followed by a lackluster recovery, but this subregion is now
          back on a stable growth path of more than 2 percent a year. Throughout this re-
          covery, fiscal deficits have remained limited, with factors other than government
          spending driving the resumption of growth. As in Central Europe, exports are
          growing twice as rapidly as GDP, at more than 4 percent a year.
              In the Western Balkans, GDP growth is projected to accelerate to 3.5 percent a
          year in 2018. Although the rate is significantly below the average annual growth
          of 5.5 percent during the 2000–08 boom period, it represents the strongest growth
          since the global financial crisis. Export growth has been an important driver of
          the recovery in the Western Balkans, where the volume of goods and services

exports increased by 8 percent a year in 2013–16. Although current deficits re-
main substantial, averaging 6.5 percent of GDP in 2016, they are much smaller
than the more than 19 percent registered in 2008. Exceptionally high unemploy-
ment rates remain one of the biggest economic problems facing the Western Bal-
kans. Although lower than the 32 percent rate in 2009 and the even higher rates
during the boom before the global financial crisis, unemployment still remains
very high, averaging 24 percent of the labor force in 2016.
    Turkey has entered a new phase, after a long period of remarkably strong
growth. The rebound following the 2001 crisis exceeded expectations, with
growth averaging more than 7 percent a year in 2002–07. Turkey was one of the
few countries in the world in which growth was equally strong before and after
the crisis, with annual growth averaging 7.4 percent in 2010–15. Growth slowed
to 2.9 percent in 2016, as exports declined, the currency weakened, inflation rose,
and investment slowed and business confidence declined in the wake of the
failed coup. Even with the slight acceleration forecast for 2017 and 2018, growth
is projected to remain well below the pace of the last 15 years. Structural weak-
nesses will prevent a return to the high growth rates of the past.
    In the South Caucasus, near-term growth prospects are much weaker than in
the western part of the ECA region. After a 2.2 percent contraction in 2016, no
growth is expected this year, and growth of just 1.6 percent is projected for 2018.
During the boom years of 2000–08, the average annual growth rate was 13.5 per-
cent. Even in the period right after the global financial crisis (2009–13), annual

          growth averaged 3.7 percent. The main cause of the current lack of growth is the
          fall in oil prices at the end of 2014, which has directly affected Azerbaijan and
          indirectly affected Armenia and Georgia (through diminished remittances and
          reduced export opportunities). Regaining competitiveness in international mar-
          kets is perhaps more essential for further recovery in the South Caucasus than in
          other subregion of ECA.
              Average annual growth in Central Asia grew was more than 9 percent during
          2000–07. It fell to 3.5 percent during the global financial crisis but recovered to 6.5
          percent in 2010–14. After the fall in oil prices in 2014, average annual growth
          dropped below 3 percent in 2015 and 2016, with the sharpest slowdown in Ka-
          zakhstan, where output actually contracted. Kazakhstan also suffered a double-
          digit income decline as a result of the terms of trade losses after the fall in oil
          prices. Despite the many vulnerabilities the oil price shock created in Central
          Asia, a modest cyclical growth rebound is expected in the next few years.
              Of all oil exporters in the region, Russia managed the most agile response to
          the price decline. It was the first country to float its currency to allow the un-
          avoidable depreciation, and it implemented fiscal adjustments without much
          delay. These inevitable macroeconomic adjustments led to a 20 percent real de-
          preciation, a one-time jump in import prices and consumer prices, a cumulative
          35 percent decline in import volumes, a 15 percent decline in consumption, and
          a 3 percent decline in GDP. The current account surplus persisted, and the fiscal
          deficit remained limited. The sharp declines in imports and consumption are
          consistent with the large terms-of-trade loss and the required change in the struc-
          ture of the economy. Growth in Russia is projected to turn resume in 2017 and
          2018, with consumption growth surpassing GDP growth.
              For the ECA region as a whole, this short-term outlook is more positive than
          the one presented half a year ago, as illustrated in table 1.1. For most subregions,
          growth is expected to be more robust in 2017 (the South Caucasus, where the
          impact of the fall in oil prices on Azerbaijan is more damaging than earlier pro-
          jected, is a notable exception).
              Despite the improved outlook, several challenges—many of these which can
          be grouped under the label “adjustment to the new normal”—require urgent at-
          tention. For many countries in the western part of the region, the drivers of sus-
          tainable growth are now different from the drivers during the boom period that
          ended 10 years ago. For countries in the eastern part of the region, the new nor-
          mal is characterized by sustained lower oil prices, lower imports, higher exports
          of nonoil products, fewer workers producing goods and services that are not inter-
          nationally tradable, and new employment in internationally competitive sectors.
              Other major challenges are linked to long-term trends in technological change
          and shifts in the international division of labor, which have potentially far-reach-
          ing consequences for the way product and labor markets are organized. These
          changes could be largely ignored during the boom period, when growth was
          robust even without adjustments, or during the direct aftermath of the crisis,
          when all hands were on deck to mitigate the deep recession. These underlying
          trends can no longer be ignored. If the problems originating from these structural
          shifts are not addressed, political instability, economic anxiety, and social ten-
          sions will likely remain.

1.3	 The region has entered a more neutral cyclical phase
After years of economic setbacks, most economies in ECA have now moved into
a more neutral cyclical phase. Monthly data on region-wide aggregate industrial
production show that the region has been on a steady growth path since 2014
(figure 1.1). Growth remained strong in 2016 despite the weakening of activity in
the rest of the world, excluding China.
    Inflation figures provide another indication that the region is entering a more
neutral cyclical phase. In 2016 the median increase in consumer prices in the
European Union was 1 percent, up from just 0.2 percent in 2015. Virtually all
countries experienced rising inflation (figure 1.2). In many European countries,
the GDP deflator was already rising at almost 2 percent a year in 2015, signaling

          a roughly normal utilization rate of production capacity. The consumer price de-
          flator had remained low because of terms-of-trade gains, in particular the down-
          ward effect on consumer prices of cheaper energy imports. Now that oil prices
          have stabilized, consumer price inflation is converging to the rise in the cost of
          domestic production, as reflected in the GDP deflator.
              This return to positive inflation rates across the board implies that the authori-
          ties will soon begin discussing a tapering of monetary stimulus. The central bank
          in Sweden has been creative in finding ways to push interest rates into negative
          territory to avoid deflation. But the GDP deflator in Sweden rose to 2 percent in
          2015, and in 2016 consumption prices also started rising, convincing the mone-
          tary authorities that the economy has reached a more neutral cyclical phase.
              Inflation in the eastern part of the ECA region was the mirror image of infla-
          tion in the western part. All countries except Azerbaijan experienced a drop in
          inflation in 2016. The drop was steep in energy-exporting countries—7.5 percent-
          age points in Russia and more than 5 percentage points in Kazakhstan—indicat-
          ing that the jump in prices in 2015 was a one-time relative price adjustment rather
          than the start of an inflationary spiral. Depreciations led to sharp increases in
          import prices but not prices of domestically produced goods. This unavoidable
          adjustment after the fall in oil prices provides the incentive for adjustments in
          production and consumption patterns.
              These one-time adjustments in relative prices illustrate the dilemma facing
          monetary authorities in oil-exporting countries. The fall in oil prices forced them
          to abandon a system of stable exchange rates to allow the unavoidable real de-
          preciation. The change in exchange rate regime required a new monetary anchor
          and a rebuilding of trust in the currency. However, changes had to be made in an
          environment in which low trust in the local currency had already triggered a
          partial dollarization of financial sectors. It is therefore understandable that cen-
          tral banks in oil-exporting countries aimed to shift to inflation targeting and an
          attempt to stop double-digit inflation in its tracks. If, however, the target is con-
          sumer price inflation, the data can easily be misinterpreted. The sharp rise in
          consumer prices largely reflected relative price changes between domestically
          and foreign produced goods and services rather than inflationary tensions in the
          domestic economy. In short, in both the eastern and western part of the ECA re-
          gion, cyclical tensions may have been weaker than consumer price inflation or
          deflation suggest.
              Reduced underutilization of capacity has also become visible in unemploy-
          ment data. In most EU countries, unemployment rates are now back at or even
          below 2005 levels, when the global economic boom was in full swing (figure 1.3).
          Unemployment rates in Central Europe and Germany have dropped to remark-
          ably low levels. In Germany only 4.1 percent of the labor force is considered un-
          employed, down from 9.1 percent in 2005. In Poland unemployment declined by
          even more, falling from 18.2 percent to 8.9 percent. Unemployment rates in Bul-
          garia, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, and the Slovak Republic
          are substantially below their 2005 levels, on average by 2 percentage points.
              The situation is different in Southern Europe, where the financial crisis hit
          hard and more profound structural reforms were needed to find new sources of
          stable growth. Unemployment rates in 2016 were 13.5 percent higher than in 2005

in Greece, 10.5 percent higher in Spain, 4.0 percent higher in Italy, and 3.5 percent
higher in Portugal. But even in these countries unemployment rates are now on
average 4 percentage points lower than their recent peaks, signaling that slow
recovery is taking hold in Southern Europe.
   The rise in participation rates in the European Union is even more remarkable
than the decline in unemployment rates. In Northern, Western, and Central Eu-
rope, participation rates are now higher than they were in 2005 (figure 1.4). Only
in Southern Europe is the share of the population participating in the labor mar-
ket smaller than in 2005.
   The broad-based rise of participation rates in Europe is surprising given pop-
ulation aging and the fact that participation rates are lower among older people
than young people. If participation rates per age cohort remain constant over
time, the participation rate should decline as a country’s population ages. But the
data show sharp increases in the overall participation rates of two of region’s most
rapidly aging countries, Bulgaria and Germany, over the past 15 years (figure 1.5).
   The divergence between the actual and extrapolated participation rates sug-
gests that behavior within cohorts is changing. More people in older age cohorts
are now willing to remain active in the labor market—because they expect to live
longer and feel healthier, because there are more opportunities for them in labor

                                                        other policies make it more difficult to retire. These developments also make
                                                        clear that technical extrapolations of behavior can be misleading and are not

                                                        Policies should thus focus on facilitating behavioral adjustments rather than on
                                                        achieving fiscal sustainability based on technical extrapolations.

1.4	 The new normal requires new policies
Deep global economic crises change the world economy and economic policies
for many decades. The role of the government was never the same after the Great
Depression: Governments now spend one third or more of national income—a
multiple of the single-digit percentages of the period before the Depression. The
larger role of the government reduced the volatility of market economies through
built-in automatic stabilizers. Large government sectors became the new normal
for many decades—arguably until today.
    Economic policies drastically changed after the oil crises of the 1970s. Al-
though the share of government in total spending remained substantial, the role
of market mechanisms became much more prominent. Europe liberalized capital
flows and privatized utility and other companies. Developing countries inte-
grated into global markets for goods and services, and the centrally planned
economies of Europe ultimately transitioned to market economies.
    This wave of liberalization and globalization followed a period of inward-
looking development after World War II. Western Europe was rebuilt with little
international reserves available to engage in intensive cross-border economic re-
lationships. Central Europe was absorbed into the system of centrally planned
economies. Governments in several Asian countries strengthened their control
over production and distribution. In Latin America import-substitution was the
leading paradigm for quickly developing national industries.
    These inward-looking policies were running into their own limitations at the
time of the oil crises. The new wave of globalization that started in earnest during
the 1990s addressed those problems and resulted in a sharp acceleration of
growth in developing countries. One can argue that relying more on the market
has been the new normal since the late 1980s or early 1990s.
    It is likely that the global financial crisis of 2008 will also change the direction
of policies to address emerging problems and the limitations of existing growth
models. It is too early to define these new policies in detail, but they will probably
address inequality of opportunity, which has been rising since the beginning of
this century. The drivers of rising inequality of opportunity include new tech-
nologies that change the way production, work, and merchandizing are orga-
nized; the globalization of production, labor, and capital; and the accumulation
of wealth, which when transferred to new generations gives some young people
advantages over others.
    Technological progress and integration of economies across is welcome, be-
cause they yield huge overall benefits and create new opportunities. However,
new measures are needed to ensure that everyone has a fair chance to seize the
new opportunities and share in these benefits.
    The current volatile political landscape, including increasing populism in the
western part of the ECA region and rising social tensions in the eastern part,
could well be harbingers of dramatic policy changes. A positive outcome of such
changes would be a more level playing field and reduction of the concentration
of economic power.
    Rising inequality of opportunity is an example of underlying trends that are
often ignored during a boom period, because all incomes are rising. Such trends

                              are often also largely ignored during the ensuing recessions, when policy makers
                              focus on firefighting. Now that the cyclical situation is normalizing, there is a
                              strong case for addressing the structural problems that have emerged. Leveling
                              the playing field might well move to center stage. Rethinking economic and so-
                              cial rules so that more people can participate in the economies of the ECA region
                              could become a key element of the new normal.
                                  Other elements of the new normal are changes in the structure of economies.
                              During the boom period, many countries enjoyed large capital inflows, substan-
                              tial inflows of remittance, rising oil revenues, or a combination of the three. As a
                              result, imports grew faster than (nonoil) exports, and these economies started
                              growing rapidly through investments in the nontradable sectors, especially real
                              estate. In the new normal, capital inflows are more moderate, oil prices have
                              stabilized at lower levels, and the purchasing power of remittances has declined.
                              As a result, large current account deficits, which had become prevalent in Central
                              Europe, the Baltics, and the Western Balkans, were no longer sustainable.
                                  Romania is one of many countries that experienced a sudden tightening of its
                              current account balance after the global financial crisis (figure 1.6). After the fall
                              in oil prices, in 2014, the large (nonoil) current account deficits in the eastern part
                              of the region were no longer sustainable.
                                  As current account deficits tighten or even reverse, growth can no longer
                              come from increased production of nontradables. It must come from production
                              of goods and services that are tradable in internationally competitive markets.
                              This structural change in the new normal has far-reaching consequences. It
                              means that financial sectors, education systems, and competition policies that
                              supported old firms in existing sectors will have to adjust so that they can ensure
                              that new firms are able to compete internationally.
                                  In the new normal, countries can also no longer rely on high investment rates.
                              During the boom period, investment rates rose to grow the capital stock fast
                              enough to keep up with rapidly expanding GDP. Once GDP growth fell, as the
                              boom reached its limits, capital accumulation was too rapid. The result was rising
                              capital-output ratios, lower returns to capital, and the underutilization of capital.

Chapter 1: Time to Adjust to the New Normal	                                                                                             ●  13



Where a boom is exceptionally strong and the growth slowdown sharp, it takes
many years of low investment to adjust the capital stock to GDP.
   Spain is a clear example of this phenomenon (figure 1.7). Despite the lower
investment rate after the crisis, the capital-output ratio continued to increase.
Only in recent years did the ratio decline; it still remains well above levels during
the boom period. Even once the capital-output ratio falls back to its original level,
the equilibrium investment rate will still be lower than during the boom, because
high, unsustainable GDP growth rates are unlikely to return. The equilibrium
growth of the capital stock—and the equilibrium investment rate—will be lower
than during the boom.
   The high level of the current capital stock in several countries is the most
plausible explanation of why low interest rates—and loose monetary policy more
generally—have not significantly boosted investment rates. Investment rates will
not recover fully if GDP growth does not return to the precrisis level. Rather than
trying to boost overall investment, policy makers should focus on adjusting pro-
duction patterns to the conditions of the new normal.
   Technological changes in the rest of the world, demographic changes, growth
differentials, the maturation of global value chains, and changes in commodity
prices have led to changes in specialization patterns and patterns of trade. These
changes could be ignored during the boom period, when old specialization pat-
terns generated sufficient income growth, and during the recession, when com-
panies focused on short-term survival and governments focused on countercycli-
cal measures (which actually reinforced existing production patterns, by
supporting existing spending patterns). As many economies in ECA enter a more
neutral phase, adjustment to changed global specialization patterns can no lon-
ger be postponed.
   Adjustment to the new normal requires structural reforms rather than coun-
tercyclical responses. These adjustments will not emerge automatically. Mone-
tary policy that worked well in the case of large capital inflows, large oil reve-
nues, or substantial remittances will have to adjust when these inflows remain

           permanently at lower levels. Financial institutions that served mature companies
           in existing sectors well will have to adjust to serve start-ups in new sectors. Social
           protection systems that were designed when long-term, steady employment was

Shifting Trade Patterns




2.1	Overview

During the first half of the 1990s the value of global trade in goods and services
averaged a little less than 19 percent of global GDP. By 2008, at the end of the
global economic boom, that percentage had risen to almost 31 percent (figure
2.1). In slightly more than a decade the global economy had radically trans-
formed itself. Centrally planned economies had transitioned into market econo-
mies, with several of them integrating into the European common market; 29
transition economies and developing countries had joined the World Trade Or-
ganization (WTO); high import tariffs and import substitution had largely be-
come phenomena of the past; China had developed into the world’s manufactur-
ing powerhouse, quadrupling its share in global industrial production; and
global value chains had revolutionized the way companies cooperate across bor-
ders (Taglioni and Winkler 2016).
    The rapid integration of developing and transition economies in global mar-
kets came with a sharp acceleration of their per capita GDP growth, closing part
of the income gap with high-income countries (figure 2.2). The wave of globaliza-
tion culminated in the global boom between 2003 and 2007. Globalization had
become an unrelenting force, driving innovation and spreading technologies
across borders.
    Integration into global markets for goods and services played an instrumental
role in the transition of many countries in ECA to market economies. The open-
ing up to international trade resulted in a convergence of domestic relative prices

                             to levels consistent with global demand and supply, which triggered a more ef-
                             ficient use of resources. Integration into European value chains induced crucial
                             technological catch-up. Specialization patterns in transition economies started to
                             reflect their comparative advantages, and comparative advantages started shift-
                             ing, as a result of technology transfers. As a result, industries in Central Europe
                             moved up the value chain, as their production became more skill intensive.
                                 The surge in global trade and production also created imbalances. Domestic
                             credit booms and rapidly expanding cross-border capital flows, both fueled by
                             financial innovation, led to spiraling asset prices and unsustainable private sec-
                             tor debts in numerous countries, ultimately leading to the global financial crisis.
                             Several countries in the region ended up with outsized current account deficits,
                             overinvestment in real estate, a production structure tilted toward nontradables,
                             and excessive dependence on foreign currency loans.

    Global trade volumes slowed down dramatically after the financial crisis and
are no longer growing twice as fast as global production. In fact, it is no longer
clear that globalization remains the dominant and persistent force driving
growth. Increasingly, negative side-effects of trade are emphasized—especially
on the job security of the middle class. Although there is little evidence of a rise
in protectionism, support for shielding domestic markets from international
competition is growing.
    Trade still has many more upsides than downsides in ECA. Unlike the trade
slowdown at the global level, ECA’s trade volumes are still growing twice as fast
as GDP. And trade remains a crucial element of strategies to find new sources of
growth. As emphasized in chapter 1 of this report, reduced capital inflows, smaller
oil revenues, and diminished remittances are forcing countries to increase produc-
tion in internationally competitive sectors. Once again, former transition econo-
mies are restructuring their production patterns through international trade.
    This shift toward increased competitiveness in international markets is not the
only transition countries in ECA are navigating. A second transition is the shift
from intraregional to global trade, in order to benefit more from dynamics in Asia
and the advantages global brands offer. A third ongoing transition is the shift
from international trade in goods to international trade in services. Services are
increasing as a share of global consumption, and services are progressively be-
coming more internationally tradable. Supporting opportunities for digital de-
velopment is essential to benefit from this third transition.



2.2	 Integration in global markets enabled the transition
     to market economies

Until the fall of the Berlin Wall, in November 1989, trade between Central Euro-
pean countries and the Soviet Union and among the republics of the Soviet Union
was largely centrally managed. It did not necessarily reflect comparative advan-
tages or encourage an optimal use of resources. Trade with market economies
was limited, and relative prices within the centrally planned economies often
deviated significantly from global prices.
    When the transition economies opened up to world markets, these old trade
relations and the associated specialization patterns broke down (Broadman
2005). The immediate impact was a collapse of overall trade and production.
From the mid-1990s, however, new trade relations and production patterns
emerged. Meanwhile, in 1993 the European Union completed the establishment
of a common market, with free movement of goods, services, people, and money.
    These two developments—the opening up of the transition economies and the
integration of the European Union—transformed international trade in the ECA
region, with trade volumes of the transition economies tripling in a decade, while
trade volumes of the European Union doubled. The deepening of trade contin-
ued during the 2000s, as many transition economies joined the WTO and several
joined the European Union. Tariffs were reduced to the lowest levels in the world
(figure 2.3).

                                 The first consequence of the reintegration of transition economies into global
                             markets was that relative prices became consistent with global demand and sup-
                             ply. The change ensured a more efficient use of resources, in which specialization
                             patterns and trade patterns clearly reflected comparative advantages. Central
                             Europe specialized in high-skilled manufacturing, while Central Asia specialized
                             in natural resources (figure 2.4). Central Asia’s manufactured exports are more
                             low-skill intensive, consistent with education differentials between Central Eu-
                             rope and Central Asia.
                                 With these two distinct specialization patterns, ECA countries were drawn
                             toward two nodes of economic activity. Countries in the Baltics, Central Europe,
                             and the Western Balkans intensified their participation in Western Europe, as
                             they received FDI and became part of cross-border value chains or their workers
                             migrated west. Countries in Central Asia, and to some extent the South Cauca-
                             sus, benefited from rising Russian oil revenues, which provided export opportu-
                             nities as well as employment opportunities in Russia.
                                 Perhaps even more important than the new trade patterns were the domestic
                             efficiency gains that came with the transition. The oil-producing countries are an
                             example of this more efficient use of resources. Domestic energy prices in-
                             creased as they converged toward the higher prices in global markets, causing
                             domestic energy to be used more efficiently. In Russia, for example, per capita

energy consumption was 30 percent lower at the end of the 1990s than at the
beginning of that decade. The reduction in domestic demand enabled more oil to
be exported, a change that had a profound impact on global energy markets.
Despite robust global economic growth, reduced energy demand in the oil-ex-
porting transition economies created a glut in global oil markets. Oil prices de-
clined until they hit the nadir of just $10 a barrel at the end of the 1990s.
    Once the glut was absorbed, oil prices started rising, benefitting the oil-ex-
porting countries in the region. With a long delay, global oil supply adjusted to
high oil prices, which finally pushed oil prices down again, forcing production
patterns in Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and surrounding countries to adjust.
    This experience illustrates the strong interaction between international mar-
kets and domestic production patterns. Indeed, open trade relations are not
merely opportunities to earn export revenues or consume imported goods and
services. They are also a conduit for aligning domestic production and consump-
tion patterns with global markets forces. The key role played by trade in the
transition to market economies was not an accident. Open trade relations directly
affected the functioning of domestic product and factor markets.

                                       Integration into global markets had a particularly important impact in Central
                                   Europe, where it enabled domestic manufacturing to become part of “Factory

                                   automotive industry. The surge in exports of intermediate and final vehicles was
                                   a broad-based phenomenon in Central Europe (figure 2.5). As Central European
                                   companies became part of the cross-border value chains, Factory Europe become

                                       The impact on domestic markets did not come simply from opportunities to
                                   export existing production. Associated FDI inflows provided access to more ad-

                                     Many transition economies—including not only Central European economies
                                 like Poland but also oil exporters like Russia—have shifted from low-skill- to
                                 high-skill-intensive manufactured products (figure 2.6). Trade openness has led
                                 to specialization patterns that are consistent with comparative advantages. These
                                 patterns are not static: as companies engage in global competition and participate
                                 in global value chains, workers gain access to new technologies, bringing high-
                                 skill intensive production within reach. In the mid-1990s almost all transition
                                 economies underperformed in high-skill-intensive manufacturing exports; two
                                 decades later, they have an export pattern that is consistent with their fundamen-
                                 tals according to global empirical models (figure 2.7).
                                     Since the early 1990s, trade in Europe has surged and brought domestic prices
                                 in line with prices in global markets. It has encouraged a more efficient use of
                                 resources, facilitated the upgrading of production structures, and provided ac-
                                 cess to a broader consumption package. The opening up to trade has transformed
                                 economies.
                                     It is difficult to calculate the exact contribution of trade openness to income
                                 growth. Part of the difficulty is that production and trade influence each other in
                                 complicated and simultaneous ways, making it difficult to determine the direc-
                                 tion of causality. In addition, third factors may affect both income and trade. FDI

cies, the introduction of new technologies, prudent macroeconomic policies, the
elimination of dual exchange rates, and the deepening of financial sectors can all
raise both trade and income. Whatever the direction of causation, rapid growth
in income tends to coincide with rapid growth of trade.
    One way to illustrate this phenomenon is by correlating the growth of trade
volumes with the unexplained residuals from standard equations explaining in-
come growth (figure 2.8). This correlation suggests that transition economies in
Central Europe may have benefitted more from a trade-productivity spiral than
did countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
    The transition to market economies and the deepening of the common market
in the European Union since the early 1990s occurred against the backdrop of a
worldwide wave of globalization. The global trends of tariff reductions, FDI
flows, technology transfers, and behind-the-border measures were more pro-
nounced in ECA. In the early 1990s, the brisk changes in several transition econo-
mies created hardship in the form of deep recessions; changed rendered large
parts of production capacity and employment obsolete. The subsequent conse-
quences of the transition more than compensated for these losses, however.

                           In the wake of the global financial crisis of almost a decade ago, sectoral adjust-
                        ments have taken center stage once again in the western part of ECA. In the eastern
                        part of the region, adjustments are occurring in the wake of the fall in oil prices in
                        2014. The financial crisis and the fall in oil prices have led to the dissolving of finan-
                        cial institutions and the downsizing of construction sectors. Significant changes in
                        relative prices require the creation of new jobs in new sectors. New technologies are
                        changing the way people work, products are produced, and merchandise is sold.
                           Governments and companies have to navigate these adjustments. Doing this
                        are particularly challenging because global comparative advantages have
                        changed and global trade slowed sharply in recent years. In this period of adjust-
                        ment and uncertainty, it is worth exploring whether trade is still part of the solu-
                        tion or has become part of the problem.



                        2.3	 Is there too little or too much trade?

                        For two decades, from the mid-1980s until the mid-2000s, globalization of pro-
                        duction through rapid expansion of international trade was incontestably the
                        dominant economic trend across developing and high-income economies. The
                        reintegration of China in global markets, the deepening of the common market

   The slowdown in trade growth. Since the global financial crisis, global trade
growth has slowed considerably. In recent years, global trade volumes have not
grown faster than global production volumes, raising the question of whether
trade remains a viable development strategy. Simultaneously, concerns are grow-
ing that there has been too much trade, that in many countries trade has replaced
middle-class jobs and has weakened job security. Has globalization come to a
standstill? If so, what are the implications for the ECA region?
   The volume of global merchandise trade grew 1.3 percent in 2016, a full per-
centage point less than the 2.3 percent growth in the volume of global GDP (fig-
ure 2.9, panel a). This slow growth of global trade seems to have become the new
norm. Between 2010 and 2016, global merchandise trade grew at an average rate
of 1.9 percent a year while global GDP expanded by 2.6 percent annually. This
pattern is the inverse of what had been the norm for a long time. At least since the
mid-1980s, on average global trade outpaced global GDP growth, culminating in
the 2003–07 boom, when trade volumes grew by about 8 percent a year, twice as
fast as GDP.
   Cyclical swings in trade have also been much more pronounced than cyclical
fluctuations in GDP. In 2009, for example, global trade contracted 15 percent be-
fore largely recovering in 2010. The main reason for the strong cyclical behavior
of trade is that cyclical components of GDP, especially investment and durable

           consumption, have relatively large import content. The least cyclical components
           of GDP tend to be less tradable in international markets. Industrial production
           (panel b of figure 2.9) normally follows GDP closely, but like trade, it is also
           closely linked to the more cyclical components. One therefore expects a closer
           link between merchandise trade and industrial production than between trade
           and GDP.
               One reason for the changing relationship between GDP and merchandise
           trade is that services are becoming a larger share of GDP. The increase reflects
           both the rise in income and the increasing tradability of services like health and
           education. One could therefore expect trade in in goods and services to expand
           more rapidly than trade in good, as it has in recent years (figure 2.9, panel c).
               Panel d of figure 2.9 compares growth in global industrial production and
           growth in global goods and services trade. The two variables are much more
           closely correlated than GDP and trade in goods (panel a of figure 2.9). Even with
           this closer correlation, however, a structural break is evident. The conclusion is
           that global trade—not only merchandise trade relative to GDP but also trade and
           services relative to industrial production, which better captures the cyclical char-
           acter of tradable production—is slowing down.
               Explanations of the structural slowdown in trade focus on three drivers that
           boosted the earlier globalization of production (Boz, Bussière, and Marsilli 2014;
           Freund 2016; Word Bank 2015a). First, the sharp decline in tariffs during the 1990s
           and early 2000s—as transition economies opened up, developing countries
           joined the WTO, and high-income countries engaged in deeper integration—is
           thought to have temporarily boosted trade growth. Once the larger trade shares,
           consistent with lower tariffs, were reached, trade remained at elevated levels but
           did not continue to grow at the same pace. There is debate about whether protec-
           tionism has increased in recent years. Evenett and Fritz (2015) find some evidence
           of rising protectionism, which Hoekman (2015) and Kee et al (2013) downplay.
           Whatever the trend in protectionism has been, trade liberalization is no longer the
           dominant trend, if only because tariffs have already reached very low levels.
               Second, the global value chains that were created in the 1990s, have matured
           (Ferrantino, Michael and Taglioni 2014). Their growth came with a sharp increase
           in cross-border trade. Trade flows remain at higher levels but are no longer in-
           creasing at the same pace.
               Last, and empirically not least, is the rise of China (Hong, Lee, Liao, and Sen-
           eviratne 2015). China’s share in world merchandise exports (at current prices)
           was 2 percent in 1990, 4 percent in 2000, 12 percent in 2010, and 15 percent in 2015.
           Its rapid gain in market share during the 1990s and 2000s was a major factor in
           the acceleration of global trade. Booming Chinese exports did not merely replace
           exports from other countries, they also created new cross-border trade. As the
           country opened up and its companies became more productive, China became
           the manufacturing powerhouse of the world. Its share of global industrial pro-
           duction rose from only a few percent during the 1990s to 25 percent in 2016. This
           concentration of industrial production replaced production in other countries
           that had been local, resulting in large increases in global trade.
               It is now much more difficult for China to increase its market share. On the
           supply side, labor is becoming scarcer and thus more expensive. On the demand

side, saturation set in, and it is arithmetically impossible to continue to increase
market shares at the same pace. The maturation of China’s market shares in
global consumption is an important driver of the slowdown in global trade.
   Should trade still be a central element of an economic growth strategy? At
least from the perspective of ECA, the answer is an unqualified yes. European
trade is still growing relatively rapidly. In contrast to the rest of the world, where
trade dropped sharply relative to GDP growth in recent years, export growth in
ECA is much brisker than growth of GDP for several reasons (figure 2.10). First,
exports of services from Northern and Western Europe increased. Second, Fac-
tory Europe can still compete with Factory Asia. The massive increase in China’s
share in global industrial production came mostly at the cost of regions other
than ECA, whose market share declined only slightly (figure 2.11).
   Exports from the European Union continue to grow faster than GDP. They lag
GDP in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, but they have done so since 2000,
largely because of Dutch disease, cause by high and rising oil prices. This wors-
ened export competitiveness. Between 2000 and 2014, export volumes in the east-
ern part of the ECA region grew at the same rate as GDP, while import volumes
grew more than twice as fast as GDP. This pattern reflected the rapidly rising

                                      international competitiveness. After the fall in oil prices at the end of 2014, im-
                                      ports started declining and exports started rising faster than GDP, although GDP
                                      growth has been very low the past two years. More adjustments are needed to

                                      international competitiveness. The real depreciations in the wake of the fall in oil
                                      prices are important steps toward doing so.
                                          The costs of globalization. Is there too much trade from ECA’s perspective? How
                                      relevant for ECA is the global debate on the negative side effects of trade on job
                                      security, uncertainty, and inequality (Becchettam and Jansen 2011)?
                                          Trade affects different sectors of the economy and different parts of the labor
                                      market in different ways. Middle-class workers tend to be more exposed to trade
                                      in manufacturing products than other workers. In Romania, for example, work-
                                      ers with secondary education, who are likely to belong to the middle class, are
                                      more likely than other workers to be employed in sectors that export manufactur-
                                      ing products or sectors that compete with manufacturing imports. Workers with
                                      tertiary education and workers with only primary education tend to be employed
                                      in sectors that do not compete in international markets (figure 2.12, panel a).
                                          Shifts in trade patterns and price changes in international markets affect some
                                      workers more directly affected than others. But trade does not necessarily hurt
                                      workers in the middle class, for several reasons. First, middle-class workers may
                                      suffer more from import competition, they also benefit more than other workers
                                      from export opportunities. Trade exposure by itself seems less important than
                                      whether a country runs a current account deficit or surplus. During the boom
                                      before 2008, for example, export exposure in Romania declined because its cur-
                                      rent account deficit was ballooning (Baumgarten, Geishecker, and Gorg, 2010),

education had little to do with trade policies and everything to do with capital
inflows and the macroeconomic policies that created the deficit.
    Second, it is very difficult to determine whether international competition or
technological progress and automation are responsible for changes in labor mar-
ket conditions (Autor, Dorn, and Hanson 2015). Workers that are more exposed
to trade often perform routine jobs, which are more prone to disappear because
of automation (figure 2.12, panel b).
    Third, the indirect effects of trade on labor markets may be as important as the
direct effects. An obvious example is the impact of oil prices on labor markets in
oil-exporting economies. When oil prices rose, all domestic prices increased

           (through the Dutch disease effect), and it became profitable to invest in domestic
           nontradable sectors (World Bank 2016b). Jobs were created in construction and
           domestic services like retail. When oil prices fell, many of these jobs, which are
           not directly exposed to trade, were eliminated. These indirect effects spread well
           beyond the borders of oil-exporting countries, because high oil prices created
           jobs in oil-exporting countries for migrant workers. In a similar way, cheaper
           imports can create better jobs in domestic retail sectors. Labor markets are too
           integrated to derive firm conclusions from the direct effects of trade exposure.
               The continued importance of trade. The most important reason why ECA should
           still embrace new trade opportunities is that many countries in the region have
           to shift from non-tradable production following sharp adjustments in the current
           accounts. Because of changes in the external environment (lower oil prices, re-
           duced capital inflows, and lower purchasing power of remittances), many coun-
           tries need a new growth strategy. The creation of new jobs in sectors that compete
           internationally must be a central part of that strategy.
               At least for ECA, there is no reason to declare that there is too little or too much
           trade. The status quo is not stable, however. In addition to moving away from
           nontradables, ECA countries have to navigate at least two other transitions in
           trade. One is the shift from intraregional trade to global trade. Integration into
           Factory Europe, especially the value chains around German industry, has been
           very successful for Central European countries. These value chains serve primar-
           ily the regional market. It is one of the reasons why intraregional trade in ECA is
           more than predicted by a global gravity model (figure 2.13). This figure shows
           first for the eastern part of the region and then for the western part of the region
           the export performance in different destinations, in deviation from the expected
           export performance in those destinations. For example, for both parts of the re-
           gion exports of high-skilled manufacturing to other ECA countries is stronger
           than expected. But those high-value added exports to East Asia and most other
           regions are weaker than expected.
               In order to fully catch up with high-income countries, however, countries in
           the region need to develop more global brands that can be sold worldwide. Major
           opportunities remained unexploited to intensify trade links with Asia, which is
           increasingly becoming the center of global commerce. Initiatives to revive the old
           silk road are an important part of this transition to global trade.
               Another ongoing transition is the shift from international trade in goods to
           international trade in services (Papageorgiou, Wang, Loungani, and Mishra
           2017). The share of services in total exports has risen steadily in Western Europe
           since 2011 (figure 2.14). This trend has not yet reached other parts of the ECA
           region. Supporting opportunities for digital development is essential to benefit
           from this third transition.
               During the transition of the 1990s, trade played an essential role in transform-
           ing the domestic economies of the formerly centrally planned economies. Even
           against the backdrop of a worldwide wave of globalization, the opening up to
           international trade was more critical in ECA than for most other regions. During
           the coming years, trade will once again play a decisive role in adjusting domestic
           production structures in ECA. And once again, it is likely that trade will be par-
           ticularly important.
