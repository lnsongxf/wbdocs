2016 CPIA AFRICA REPORT

Summary
u	 Policy and institutional quality weakened in Sub-Saharan Africa amid a difficult global economic
   landscape and challenging domestic conditions. The average Country Policy and Institutional
   Assessment score for the region’s IDA-eligible countries edged lower to 3.1 in 2016.
u	 Forty percent of the countries saw a deterioration in their overall quality of policies and institutions
   in 2016, more than in 2015, and the number of countries with a decline in CPIA score outpaced
   improvers by a margin of two to one. Weaker performance was evident across a range of countries,
   especially among commodity exporters and fragile countries.
u	 The dispersion in policy and institutional quality among the region’s IDA countries increased in 2016. With
   a CPIA score of 4.0, Rwanda again led all countries in the region; Senegal and Kenya were among the top
   scoring countries, each posting a score of 3.8. The number of countries with relatively weak performance
   (scores of 3.2 or less) ticked up, and now accounts for more than half the countries in the region.
u	 Eroded macroeconomic policy buffers constrained the scope for countries to formulate policies to
   mitigate the effects of less favorable terms of trade, slowdown in global growth, and difficult domestic
   conditions on economic activity. The quality of economic management deteriorated in many Sub-
   Saharan African countries, extending the downward trend of this policy cluster of the CPIA. The
   slippage in performance was evident across all three policy areas: monetary and exchange rate policy,
   fiscal policy, and debt policy. Among the structural policies cluster, improvements in financial inclusion,
   especially digital financial inclusion, continued to be observed across the continent, but rising risks in
   the financial sector in several countries pulled down the performance of this sector.
u	 On the upside, there were positive developments in policies for social inclusion and equity. Namely,
   the human development policy area improved slightly, reflecting gains in health sector performance
   in a few countries, and the quality of social protection and labor edged up due to a strengthening
   of safety net programs in some countries. Reversing the trend observed in 2015, there was a modest
   net gain in the number of countries registering an improvement in performance of the public sector
   management and institutions cluster: 10 countries experienced an increase, while six recorded a
   decline. Within this cluster, there was an uptick in the quality of public administration.
u	 There is considerable variation in performance across country groups in Sub-Saharan Africa. Countries
   exhibiting economic resilience lead other countries on strength of macroeconomic policy frameworks,
   quality of policies that help bolster and sustain growth over the longer term and make it more
   inclusive, and accountability and effectiveness of public institutions.
u	 The latest CPIA results show that performance on policy and institutional quality in Sub-Saharan
   Africa’s non-fragile IDA countries remains comparable to that of similar countries elsewhere. The
   reverse pattern is seen for the region’s fragile countries, which generally continue to lag fragile
   countries outside the region. Overall, the average CPIA score for the region’s IDA countries is weaker
   than the average of other IDA countries.

Recent Trends and Analysis
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) Africa is an annual report that describes the
progress Sub-Saharan African countries are making on strengthening the quality of their policies and
institutions. The report presents CPIA scores for the 38 African countries that are eligible for support
from the International Development Association (IDA), the concessional financing arm of the World
Bank Group.1 CPIA scores reflect the quality of a country’s policy and institutional framework across 16
dimensions, grouped into four clusters: economic management (cluster A), structural policies (cluster
B), policies for social inclusion and equity (cluster C), and public sector management and institutions
(cluster D, also referred to as the governance cluster). The scores, which are on a scale of 1 to 6, with
6 being the highest, are computed by World Bank staff and based on quantitative and qualitative
information. The assessment also relies on the judgments of World Bank staff.

CPIA scores are used mainly to inform IDA’s allocation of resources to poor countries. Yet the
information contained in the CPIA is potentially valuable to governments, the private sector, civil
society, researchers, and the media as a tool to monitor their country’s progress and benchmark it
against progress in other countries. By presenting the CPIA scores for African countries, this report
aims to provide stakeholders with information that can support evidence-based debate that can, in
turn, lead to better development outcomes.

This year’s report assesses developments in policy and institutional quality in 2016 as measured by the
CPIA score.

Sub-Saharan Africa faced another challenging year in 2016. Economic activity continued to weaken,
amid less favorable terms of trade, slowdown in global growth, and difficult domestic conditions.
Output growth decelerated sharply to 1.3 percent, the slowest pace in over two decades and not as
stellar as the average annual growth of around 5 percent in the pre-global financial crisis period of
1995–2008. Regional growth in 2016 was insufficient to raise gross domestic product (GDP) per capita,
which contracted by 1.3 percent. At the same time, Sub-Saharan Africa’s poverty rate remains high:
41 percent of the region’s population—nearly 390 million people—were living in extreme poverty
in 2013. Weak economic performance threatens gains in poverty reduction, and the region urgently
needs to regain momentum on growth and make it more inclusive.

Some countries have shown signs of economic resilience, growing at much faster rates than others
(figure 1). Recent analysis undertaken in Africa’s Pulse identifies countries that have experienced
strong growth, and examines the links between the quality of policies and institutions and better
economic performance. Countries with a strong GDP growth rate—above the top tercile of the Sub-
Saharan African distribution (5.4 percent) between 1995 and 2008—in recent years and over a longer
period are classified as “established.” “Improved” countries are those with a growth rate below the top
tercile in 1995–2008, but with a recent rate of growth higher than that of the top tercile. Established
and improved performers are viewed as being resilient.2 The latest data show that only seven of 45
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa exhibit resilience: Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Rwanda, Senegal,
and Tanzania. Overall, the analysis finds that the difficult economic conditions facing the region in
2015 and 2016 have taken a toll on countries’ economic resilience.

1	 The report covers the 38 IDA-eligible countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that had a CPIA score in 2016. See appendix B.
2	 Other countries are not viewed as having economic resilience. Countries with recent growth performance between the bottom and top
   tercile are classified as “stuck in the middle”; those with persistently weak performance are classified as “falling behind”; and those with a
   growth rate below the bottom tercile in recent years, but not over a longer period, are classified as “slipping.”

                   Resilient countries have better policy and institutional quality than other countries. Although

                   improved performers compared with other countries. Public debt-to-GDP ratios are also lower in these
                   countries (figure 2). Relatively stronger macroeconomic policy frameworks mean that these countries

clusters was less widespread, at six countries apiece for the structural policies, policies for social inclusion
and equity, and governance clusters. The sharpest fall in the aggregate CPIA score was witnessed in
Mozambique and South Sudan, a decrease of 0.3 point. For Mozambique, the decline reflects the economic
crisis in the country following the discovery of hidden debts in 2016. For South Sudan, the deterioration in
the score indicates the broad-based erosion of policy and institutional quality amid conflict and political
instability. Both countries have seen a cumulative decline of 0.5 point in their score since 2012. Zimbabwe’s
0.2-point decline, which reversed the 0.2-point gain in the CPIA in 2015, was largely due to lack of fiscal
prudence and central bank financing of the fiscal shortfall. Other countries experienced a less sharp
slippage in policy and institutional quality: Benin, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Chad, Cabo Verde,
the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Uganda
all saw a 0.1-point drop in the CPIA. In some cases, the slippage reflects a continuing weakening of the
policy framework (Burundi, Cabo Verde, and Nigeria).

Countries with improvement in policy and institutional quality experienced modest gains in the
aggregate CPIA. Gains were capped at 0.1 point in all seven countries in this category: Côte d’Ivoire,
the Comoros, Cameroon, Guinea, Madagascar, Mauritania, and Sudan. All but one of these countries
experienced stronger performance in the quality of governance, especially in the quality of budgetary
and financial management. In a few countries, the quality of policies for social inclusion and equity also
improved. The higher score in the Comoros and Guinea represents the second consecutive year of gains.
A few countries saw tangible improvements in one or more policy areas of the CPIA that did not translate
into a lift in the aggregate country score (Burkina Faso, Tanzania, and Togo). Elsewhere, improvement in
one policy area was offset by weakness in another (Senegal and Ethiopia).

There were notable divergent trends in the regional performance of the components of the CPIA.
Unfavorable economic conditions continued to take a toll on countries across the region, deepening

                  years (2014-16). The slippage in performance was evident across all three policy areas: monetary and
                  exchange rate, fiscal, and debt. The most affected was fiscal policy, with nearly one-fourth of the region’s
                  countries experiencing a worsening of this component. In some cases, weakness in the macroeconomic
                  framework was evident across all policy areas of economic management (the Republic of Congo and
                  Mozambique). Among the structural policies cluster, rising risks in the financial sector in several countries
                  pulled down the performance of this sector (and the CPIA score of this component), but the cluster score
                  was unchanged. Improvements in financial inclusion were observed across the region, and financial
                  infrastructure is being strengthened as well.

                  There were positive developments in policies for social inclusion and equity. Namely, the human
                  development policy area improved slightly, reflecting gains in health sector performance in a few countries,
                  and the quality of social protection and labor edged up due to a strengthening of safety net programs in
                  some countries. Yet, these favorable trends did not translate into measurable improvements in the policies
                  for social inclusion and labor cluster score. Reversing the trend observed in 2015, there was a modest
                  net gain in the number of countries registering an improvement in performance of the public sector
                  management and institutions cluster: 10 countries experienced an increase, while six recorded a decline.
                  Within this cluster, there was an uptick in the quality of public administration, but not in the cluster score.

                  The divergent trends across the components of the CPIA narrowed the gap between the four policy
                  clusters. A deterioration in the quality of economic management in recent years has pulled down the
                  score for this cluster to that of structural policies and policies for social inclusion and equity. At the same
                  time, the governance cluster continues to lag all other clusters, with a score of 3.0. The pattern of a weaker
                  macroeconomic framework marks a departure from the generally sound macroeconomic policies that
                  countries had adopted in the period preceding the global financial crisis and in the wake of the crisis. This
                  worsening trend, along with limited improvement in other policy areas, constrains countries’ efforts to
                  regain the momentum on growth.

                Analysis of CPIA Components
                CLUSTER A: ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
                The quality of monetary and exchange rate, fiscal, and debt policies is covered under
                this cluster.

                The quality of economic management deteriorated to a CPIA score of 3.2, extending the downward trend
                in this policy cluster.

                Continued low commodity prices and a slowdown in global economic growth made 2016 another
                difficult year for many African economies. Unfavorable external developments, in conjunction with often
                difficult domestic conditions, put pressure on already weakened fiscal and external buffers. The scope for
                pursuing counter-cyclical policies to mitigate shocks to economic activity was constrained, complicating
                economic management in many Sub-Saharan African countries. The score for cluster A fell to 3.2 in 2016,
                as the quality of economic management continued the downward trend that began in 2014. The weaker
                performance was experienced across the three policy areas of economic management: monetary and
                exchange rate policy, fiscal policy, and debt policy (figure A.1).

                fragile, reflecting that conflict and fragility can heighten macroeconomic vulnerability. The sharpest
                decline in the quality of economic management was seen in Mozambique, where the discovery of
                previously undisclosed external debts compounded the problems of low commodity prices, droughts,
                and conflict, and dented confidence in the economy and management of public finances and derailed
                economic stability. Often, countries experienced a decline in more than one policy area in 2016, reflecting
                the interconnected nature of economic management (table A.1). Bucking the weakening trend, four
                countries saw an improvement in the quality of economic management—in some cases on the back of
                efforts aimed at restoring macroeconomic stabilization.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
This component covers the quality of monetary and exchange rate policies in a coherent macroeconomic
policy framework. Following a 0.1-point decline in 2015, the regional score for this policy fell a further
0.1 point to 3.3 in 2016, the lowest level in over 10 years. Eight countries saw a reduction in their score
(Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nigeria,
South Sudan, and Zimbabwe) and one country posted an increase (Guinea).

Erosion of external buffers meant that countries had reduced flexibility to use policies to absorb external
shocks. In this challenging policy environment, the monetary and exchange rate policy response in some
countries was not consistent with economic stability and sustained medium-term growth. Current account
deficits stabilized across the region in 2016, but remained elevated. At the same time, cross-border flows to
the region fell, especially foreign direct investment and bond issuance. High current account deficits across
much of the region and declining capital flows put downward pressure on exchange rates and international
reserves. The number of countries with a decline in reserves of over 20 percent was sharply higher (figure
A.3A). Overall, liquidity buffers have been eroding in recent years, indicating the need to rebuild these
buffers. Regional inflation ticked up, as several commodity exporters saw large currency depreciations and
food prices rose in countries affected by drought (figure A.3B). Although rising inflation often prompted

                   began. Monetary policy remained accommodative, with reserve money rising by one-third, driven by
                   Central Bank financing of the budget deficit. Inflation rose to nearly 19 percent by January 2017, fueled by a
                   combination of factors, including a depreciated currency, accommodative monetary policy, increase in fuel
                   price, and higher power tariffs.

                   Deep currency depreciation contributed to rising inflation in Mozambique. The 37 percent decline in
                   the value of the metical against the U.S. dollar in 2016 was underpinned by declining exports, lower
                   investment, and decreasing confidence. Investment inflows, which had slowed on the back of low
                   commodity prices, contracted further following the revelation of previously undisclosed debt. Debt
                   developments generated uncertainty about the state of the country’s public finances, prompting
                   foreign investors to hold off investment and external credit lines to the private sector and donors to halt
                   budget support. Year-over-year inflation averaged 25 percent in October 2016, with food inflation rising
                   to 40 percent. Regional droughts and internal political conflict also contributed to the spike in prices.
                   To stabilize the currency and rein in inflationary pressures, the Central Bank tightened monetary policy,
                   raising the policy interest rate by 600 basis points in October.

Elsewhere, South Sudan’s economic woes deepened amid conflict and political instability, greatly
complicating macroeconomic management. The currency depreciated sharply in the parallel market—from
18.5 South Sudanese pounds (SSP) to the U.S. dollar in December 2015 to 90 SSP per dollar in December
2016 and 150 SSP per dollar by mid-June 2017—and inflation accelerated by 334 percent from May 2016
to May 2017. In Burundi, restrictions on foreign exchange transactions limited the depreciation of the
official exchange rate (to about 5 percent) and inflation remained moderate. But the wedge between the
official and parallel market rates jumped to 60 percent in 2016, compared with 25 percent in 2015. In the
Democratic Republic of Congo, the current account deficit deteriorated sharply, reducing foreign currency
reserves to less than one month of imports of goods and services, from nearly six weeks at end-2015. The
currency depreciated by nearly 10 percent in 2016, and inflation climbed to an average of 5.7 percent, well
above the 1.3 percent level in 2015. After remaining at 2 percent for four years, the Central Bank raised the
policy interest rate to 7 percent in September, and further tightened monetary policy in early 2017.
Among positive developments, Guinea successfully completed an International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Extended Credit Facility Program, for the first time in the country’s history. The completion of the program
marks an important achievement for the country, which is recovering from the Ebola crisis, and has
contributed to better macroeconomic management and economic performance..

Fiscal Policy
This component assesses the stabilization and resource allocation aspects of fiscal policy. Fiscal policy
adjustment to a less favorable economic landscape has been inadequate, especially in commodity
exporters, but also in nonresource-rich countries. Fiscal buffers continued to erode in 2016 amid mounting
fiscal pressures and weak implementation of policies. Low commodity prices and weak economic growth
translated into revenue shortfalls in several countries. In some cases, a slowdown in fiscal consolidation
efforts contributed to expenditure overruns, deepening budgetary challenges. Sizable exchange rate
depreciations raised debt service costs, heightening fiscal pressures in a few countries. Strong public
investment spending, especially in non-resource-abundant countries, added to fiscal imbalances. Fiscal
outcomes in 2016 were weaker than in recent years, and less favorable compared with the pre-global
financial crisis period (figure A.4). The median size of the fiscal deficit in IDA countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
is around 5.0 percent of GDP. Although the resilient group of countries and other countries have seen a
deterioration in fiscal balances, the gap in performance between resilient and other countries is substantial,
with the deficit being larger

this policy area: Benin, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique,
Niger, Nigeria, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe. A good many of these countries are fragile or resource-rich.
Notwithstanding the downward trend, a smaller number of countries (Ethiopia, Mauritania, and Sudan)
posted gains in the quality of fiscal policy. For example, Ethiopia strengthened revenue mobilization and kept
deficits low despite large spending for drought-related relief; Mauritania successfully lowered the budget
deficit through tighter fiscal policy; and Sudan undertook fiscal reforms, including phasing out subsidies on
petroleum products and electricity.
Fiscal policy challenges deepened in several countries. In South Sudan, conflict, weak implementation
capacity, and poor performance of the oil sector severely affected the fiscal policy stance. Fiscal revenues
remained depressed amid low prices and declining production of oil, and underperformance of non-oil
revenues due to challenges with tax collection. This combined with increased operational and capital
expenditures and subsidies to the national oil company, along with spending on salaries, widened the
fiscal deficit. The fiscal deficit is estimated at around 14 percent of GDP in FY16/17 and 13 percent in
2015/16, well above the 3.3 percent in FY13/14, financed mainly by the Central Bank of South Sudan.
Elsewhere, Zimbabwe’s fiscal position deteriorated in 2016, as fiscal austerity measures were reversed. The
general decline in economic activity in the country led to underperformance of revenues, by about 10
percent of what was initially budgeted. At the same time, actual expenditures increased beyond budget
allocations. The fiscal deficit widened to nearly 10 percent of GDP, and the government borrowed heavily
in the domestic market using treasury bills.
The fiscal imbalance continued to deteriorate in the Republic of Congo, as weak oil prices sharply lowered
revenues. Lack of funding affected ongoing public investments, and resulted in a sizable buildup of
domestic arrears. But the wage bill continued to grow, and its size relative to GDP was double that in
2013. Despite a substantial scaling back of capital spending, the fiscal deficit reached an estimated 17
percent of GDP in 2016. Fiscal adjustment is needed to help restore macroeconomic stabilization and
promote sustainable growth. Revenues were also pulled down by low commodity prices and declining
mining and oil production in the Democratic Republic of Congo. With the contribution of the mining
sector to domestic revenue remaining below potential, the contribution from the value-added tax yet to
reach the anticipated level, and a relatively high share of recurrent spending in total expenditures, fiscal
consolidation efforts focused on reducing spending on infrastructure, to around 2 percent of GDP. The low
share of capital spending on infrastructure raises concerns for growth in the medium term, and reflects
limited policy space to absorb aggregate demand shocks.
Ghana saw substantial fiscal slippage in 2016, and the country missed fiscal targets on its IMF–supported
program by a large margin. Expenditure overruns ahead of elections, coupled with revenue shortfalls,
widened the fiscal deficit (on a cash basis) by more than 3 percent of GDP above the programmed level
of 5.3 percent of GDP. The accumulation of new arrears and financial deficits of state-owned enterprises
in the energy sector further compounded the fiscal difficulties facing the country. Given the relatively
large size of public debt, the higher fiscal deficit increases the vulnerability to exchange rate, rollover,
and liquidity risks. In Mozambique, the revelation of previously undisclosed borrowing by state-owned
enterprises heightened fiscal risks. The contingent liabilities stemming from this borrowing deteriorated
the country’s debt position. The disclosure of $1.4 billion in external debt led to a suspension of the
country’s IMF program and budget support by donors; these sources financed about 6 percent of the
budget over the past three years. The depreciation of the currency and a larger stock of debt increased
debt service obligations. In October 2016, the country announced that it would seek debt restructuring

payment on its sovereign bond).

Debt Policy
This component assesses whether the country’s debt management strategy is conducive to ensure
medium-term debt sustainability and minimize budgetary risks. It covers (i) the extent to which external
and domestic debt is contracted with a view to achieving/maintaining debt sustainability; and (ii) the
effectiveness of debt management functions.

Debt conditions have become more challenging, as public debt in Sub-Saharan Africa has continued
to rise amid large and widening fiscal deficits and weak economic growth. Public debt-to-GDP was 48
percent (median value) in 2016 for IDA countries in the region, more than 10 percentage points above the
2014 level (figure A.5). There is considerable variation in performance across countries. For example, the
bottom quartile of countries had public debt-to-GDP ratios below 32 percent, and this ratio exceeded 70
percent for countries in the top quartile. Resilient countries typically have lower public debt-to-GDP ratios
than other countries. Some countries have seen a more rapid rise in debt ratios. For example, 14 countries
saw a 10-percentage point rise in this ratio during 2014–16, and six of these countries saw increases of 20
percentage points or more.

The results of the latest IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) suggest that several countries
in Sub-Saharan Africa are caught in an environment of low growth prospects, widened fiscal deficits,
weaker currencies, and lower export revenues, and could face problems in repaying their debt. Figure
A.6 shows that of the 35 low- and middle-income countries in the region with a DSA, the number of
countries at low risk of debt distress halved to six, or less than 20 percent, during 2014–16. In tandem,
there has been an uptick in the number of countries that are considered at “moderate” and “high” risk of
debt distress. A few countries with deteriorating debt dynamics, such as Mozambique and the Republic of
Congo, have received credit rating downgrades, which signal higher borrowing costs for these countries.

                risk. As these markets deepen, longer maturities and fixed rates for public debt issuance will reduce the
                exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The capacity of debt management organizations across countries
                requires upgrading as well.

                The regional average score for debt policy and management declined to 3.2, a level last seen in 2010. The
                weaker score reflects rising vulnerabilities to export, growth, and foreign exchange shocks. The quality of
                debt policy and management deteriorated in seven countries: Cabo Verde, Central African Republic, Chad,
                Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Sudan, and Uganda. In many of the countries, rising domestic
                public debt combined with a very low export base continued to weigh on debt vulnerability. Signs of
                significant accumulation of domestic arrears and growing delays in the payment of current expenditures,
                including salary payments, contributed to the weakening of the debt policy score in some countries.

                Two countries (Ghana and São Tomé and Príncipe) registered an improvement in the overall score, on an
                upgrading of debt management. As part of its stabilization program, Ghana began preparing a Medium-
                Term Debt Strategy, concurrently with the budget in 2016, and debt indicators have been incorporated
                in determining fiscal rules going forward. Debt management has now become an integral part of the
                macroeconomic framework, and not a residual policy. The increase in the score for São Tomé and Príncipe
                reflects progress in key areas of debt management practices. Although the country remains at high risk
                of debt distress, a recent evaluation of its debt management practices finds that debt management and
                fiscal and monetary policies are coordinated most of the time. The Debt Management Office (DMO)
                provides timely debt service projections to the Budget Office, and a common set of official economic
                projections underpins budget and debt projections. The Central Bank informs market participants of
                debt that is issued for fiscal purposes and that for monetary policy purposes. The DMO has been in place
                for more than five years. It keeps adequate records (physical and electronic) of all loan and guarantee
                contracts, although backup arrangements could be improved. Reliable, comprehensive debt data are
                available in a timely manner. Quarterly debt reports, including all loans and some arrears to suppliers, are
                made available online and included in the budget and state general account documents.

CLUSTER B: STRUCTURAL POLICIES
Cluster B of the CPIA covers policies affecting trade, the financial sector, and the
business environment.

The regional average score for cluster B was unchanged at 3.2 in 2016, although weaker financial
sector performance in several countries pulled down the score of this component of structural
policies.

Trade
The trade component score, which assesses a country’s trade policy regime and trade facilitation,
edged slightly lower. Except for one country, Zimbabwe, for which the score declined, there were
no changes in the overall CPIA trade score for other IDA countries in Sub-Saharan Africa between
2015 and 2016. Looking at the two categories that comprise the overall score, only three of the
38 countries registered a small increase in the score for trade facilitation. This suggests that the pace
of trade reform in Africa has stagnated.

One of the key elements that affects the score for trade policy is the external tariff. The average
external tariff across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa barely changed, from 12.46 percent in 2005 to
11.54 percent in 2015 (weighted by the total imports of each country, the average was 8.29 percent
in 2005 and 8.11 percent in 2015). The average tariff in Sub-Saharan Africa remains considerably
higher than the average tariff of 7.9 percent in East Asia, the region that has developed fastest over
the past two decades. There has been more of a change in the applied external tariff, which accounts
for the preferences that countries grant to trade partners in free trade areas and customs unions.
The average applied tariff in Africa declined from 12.26 percent in 2005 to 10.14 percent in 2015. The
decline reflects the increasing number of countries (more fully) participating in free trade areas, such
as the Southern African Development Community.

Many countries in Africa are members of a customs union, so the scope for individual countries,
especially small countries, to determine their external tariff is limited. Nevertheless, for many customs
unions in Africa, it may be opportune to review the level of the external tariff to enhance integration
into the global economy, and as efforts intensify to enhance regional free trade through the Tripartite
Free Trade Area and Continental Free Trade Area. From an economic perspective, there is risk that
removing tariffs against some trading partners while maintaining relatively high tariffs against others
increases distortions in the economy and may reduce welfare. A first step would be careful analysis
of the implications of reducing external tariffs for domestic producers that compete with imports,
producers that use imported inputs and capital goods, and companies seeking to integrate into
global value chains, as well as for consumers and government revenues.

Another key element of the CPIA score for trade policy relates to nontariff barriers, such as those
arising from the application of regulatory measures that impose heavier costs on traded goods than
on those sold domestically. Here the information is much more difficult to obtain than that on tariffs.
However, the available evidence suggests that nontariff barriers are often more restrictive than tariffs,
and are typically significant barriers to trade and value chain development. Many countries in Africa




                                                             19
                    are working to reduce nontariff barriers, individually and through their regional communities. Unlike
                    tariff reform, removing nontariff barriers often requires regulatory reform and building the capacity of
                    regulatory agencies.3

                    A key indicator used to define the subscore for trade facilitation is the Logistics Performance Index (LPI).
                    Here again, there has only been limited improvement in Sub-Saharan Africa over the past 10 years, with
                    the overall score increasing from 2.25 in 2007 to 2.47 in 2016. In contrast, the East Asia region has seen
                    substantial improvement in the LPI, from 2.66 in 2007 to 3.14 in 2016. The quality of trade logistics is a key
                    determinant of the costs and timeliness of trade, which in turn affect the competitiveness of traded goods
                    and the attractiveness to investments in trade-related activities, such as those related to global value
                    chains. Africa has clearly fallen back in logistics performance relative to a key competitor region.

                    The Trading Across Borders indicator of Doing Business shows that African countries lag the best global
                    performers (as measured by distance to the frontier) (figure B.1). Moreover, only three of the 38 IDA countries
                    in the region are ranked in the top half of the global distribution of this indicator across 190 countries, with
                    18 countries in the bottom quintile, that is, with a rank of 152 or lower. There have been a few successes,
                    such as Lesotho and Rwanda, which are ranked 39 and 89, respectively, in the 2017 Doing Business exercise
                    for Trading Across Borders. The region’s weak performance reflects the cost of domestic logistical procedures,
                    such as on border and documentary compliance of exporting and importing (figure B.2), as well as high
                    domestic transportation costs. For most of the African countries, there is still enormous scope and need for
                    improvements in the time and cost to import and export.

Financial Sector
The financial sector component measures policies and regulations that affect financial stability, efficiency,
and access. The region’s average score for this component slipped to 2.8 in 2016. Eight of the region’s 38
IDA countries saw deterioration in policy and regulatory quality of the financial sector. The decline largely
reflected weaker performance around financial stability. The pullback in the overall regional score is not
mirrored in other IDA countries (figure B.3).

fairly high levels. Significant delays were sometimes observed, particularly in 2016, on payments to
government contractors (with small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) being particularly affected) and,
in a few cases, to civil servants. Capital buffers have generally been allowed to absorb the shock so far,
but individual bank failures were observed (often reflecting poor governance practices and inadequate
supervision in the earlier boom period). In several small and fragile countries, banking systems are
distressed, affecting future recovery prospects.

Countries continue to implement efforts to strengthen prudential regimes, introduce risk-based
supervision, and improve enforcement of prudential standards. Recent episodes of individual bank
failures highlighted remaining weaknesses (and difficulties in minimizing bank resolution costs). Increased
attention is being paid to strengthening cross-border banking supervision to address pan-African banking
groups, which are dominant and systemic actors across the continent. Resolution regimes are being
strengthened in the largest countries, but most jurisdictions do not yet have an adequate framework to
respond flexibly to banking crises. An increasing number of African regulators are including mobile money
in their supervisory approach and deposit insurance schemes.

There was an apparent acceleration of financial deepening in 2015, which was later reversed in several
jurisdictions in 2016 (the median ratio of banking assets to GDP increased from 38 percent in 2014 to
45 percent in 2015, and declined to 43 percent in 2016). Banks’ exposure to the sovereign increased
significantly, primarily through the acquisition of government securities, but also through direct lending
to governments, their agencies, as well as state-owned enterprises. Crowding out of the private sector is
observed in multiple countries. Many financial systems started experiencing significant liquidity pressures,
particularly in access to foreign currency liquidity. Profitability generally remained robust in 2015, with
some declines observed in 2016 as the cost of risk started to increase significantly and activity slowed (for
example, international transactions). In an often-adverse macroeconomic environment, efforts to develop
local capital markets are increasing (in a context of rapidly increasing issuance of domestic government
bills and bonds and reduced access to international capital markets).

Improvements in financial inclusion, especially digital financial inclusion, continue to be observed across
the continent. Innovations are particularly vibrant in the mobile money space, with a growing number of
services offered (including credit and insurance). Recent studies on fintech innovations paint a glowing
picture of potential growth in digital financial services, due to rapidly growing mobile penetration and
smartphone ownership, a lack of constraints from traditional legacy banking systems, and a growing
population with a strong entrepreneurial spirit. Financial infrastructure is being strengthened across the
region (particularly in credit information and movable collateral).

Business Regulatory Framework
The business regulatory environment component of the CPIA assesses the extent to which the legal,
regulatory, and policy environment helps or hinders private businesses in investing, creating jobs, and
becoming more productive. The three subcomponents measured are (i) regulations affecting entry, exit,
and competition; (ii) regulations of ongoing business operations; and (iii) regulations of factor markets
(labor and land).

The regional average score for the business regulatory environment in 2016 remained unchanged at 3.1,
and compares favorably with that of other IDA countries (figure B.4). The region’s resilient countries have
a better business environment than other countries in the region, and non-fragile countries maintain a

experience a weak business
regulatory environment, which kept scores low (below 2.5).

Two countries (Lesotho and Madagascar) recorded a gain in their overall score for the business regulatory
environment in 2016, but twice as many countries registered a decline (Benin, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and
Senegal). The higher score for Lesotho is underpinned by improvements in dealing with construction
permits and protecting minority investors. The country’s global ranking in the 2017 Doing Business
indicator improved 12 points, from 112 to 100, and its distance to the frontier score rose from 57 to 61.
Similarly, Madagascar saw increases in its overall ranking and distance to the frontier score. The country
made it easier to start a business by reducing the number of procedures and hours (from 13 to 11) needed
to register a company, much lower than the Sub-Saharan Africa average of 27 hours.

According to the 2017 Doing Business report, over one-quarter of all reforms (28 percent of 280 total
reforms) in the review period were in Sub-Saharan Africa. Eighty reforms were adopted, across 37
countries in the region, representing a pickup in the pace of reforms. Over half of the reforms were
implemented by the 17 members of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa
(OHADA).4 The region’s economies reformed most in the areas of resolving insolvency (with 18 reforms)
and starting a business (15). For example, Nigeria and Rwanda made starting a business easier by
introducing or improving online portals. Elsewhere, as part of the OHADA reform agenda, Cameroon
introduced a new conciliation procedure for companies in financial difficulties, making it easier to resolve
insolvency by allowing additional outlets to settle debts.

For the second time in a row, Kenya was among the top 10 improvers in the world. The country
implemented reforms in five Doing Business areas. For example, starting a business was made easier by
removing the stamp duty fees required for nominal capital, memorandums, and articles of association,
and eliminating the requirement to sign the compliance declaration before a commissioner of oaths; and
in the area of resolving insolvency, a reorganization procedure and regulations for insolvency practitioners
were introduced. The country also streamlined the process for getting electricity, reducing the time for
grid connection by almost two weeks.


4	 The 17 OHADA countries are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Comoros, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic
   Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, the Republic of Congo, Senegal, and Togo.

                    Although several of the region’s countries have made notable progress in reforming their business
                    environment, improvements in distance to the frontier are slow (figure B.5). More than half of all IDA
                    countries in the region have a distance to the frontier score of 50 or less, and fewer than one-third have
                    seen a five-point or larger gain in this score between 2012 and 2017.

                    CLUSTER C: POLICIES FOR SOCIAL INCLUSION AND EQUITY
                    A wide range of policy areas, such as gender equality, equity of public resource use, human
                    development, social protection, and environmental sustainability, are covered under this
                    cluster.

                    The regional score for cluster C was 3.2 in 2016, continuing the flat trend observed since 2010.

                    Gender Equality
                    The gender equality component assesses the extent to which a country has enacted and put in place
                    institutions and programs to enforce laws and policies that promote equal access for men and women to
                    human capital development and productive and economic resources, and which give men and women
                    equal status and protection under the law. At 3.2, the average score for this category has remained
                    unchanged since 2005. This trend reflects not only the large gender inequalities in Sub-Saharan Africa, but
                    also the difficulty of changing norms about gender.

                    The CPIA score for Sub-Saharan Africa is lower than the global average for IDA countries. This may partly be
                    explained by the higher level of fragility in the region. For example, of 30 IDA and IDA/International Bank
                    for Reconstruction and Development blend countries that the World Bank listed as being fragile situations
                    in FY17, 19 are in Sub-Saharan Africa. These fragile countries perform poorly across all the subsections of
                    the gender equality component of the CPIA: seven of the 10 countries in the region with the lowest overall
                    scores for this component are classified as being fragile situations, compared with only three of the 10 best
                    performing countries. This is not surprising, as fragility negatively affects every aspect of women’s lives,
                    including access to services that are essential for basic human development, economic opportunities,



                                                                         24
and protection from violence and other legal violations. There is a particularly high level of fragility in West
and Central Africa, which is also reflected in the CPIA scores on gender. Eight of the 10 worst performing
countries are in West or Central Africa: Guinea-Bissau, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Guinea. The 10 best performing countries include
three countries in East Africa (Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda), three in West Africa (Senegal, Ghana, and Cabo
Verde), and four in Southern Africa (Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, and Madagascar).

The average performance on the human development aspects of gender equality continues to be lower than
performance on the economic opportunity and legal protection aspects. This indicates that there is still an
urgent need for countries in the region to make more progress improving access to basic services for women
and girls, including services that support reproductive health, family planning, and equal access to education
for boys and girls. While these human development gaps have tended to be the focus of most research
on gender, there is a growing evidence base on the factors underlying gaps in economic empowerment
and the types of interventions that can close these gaps. The economic empowerment gaps are especially
important in Sub-Saharan Africa, given the small size of formal wage markets and the predominance of self-
employment, including in agriculture. Box C.1 summarizes some of the emerging evidence in this area.


   Research from the World Bank’s Africa Gender Innovation Lab (GIL) suggests that occupational sex                        BOX C.1
   segregation is an important factor behind earnings gaps between women and men. Studies in Uganda                        Emerging
   and Ethiopia indicate that access to information and having a male mentor may play important roles in                   Evidence on
                                                                                                                           Gender Gaps
   allowing women to cross into the more profitable and more highly remunerated sectors that tend to be                    in Economic
   dominated by men.                                                                                                       Opportunity

   It has long been recognized that legal discrimination in property and inheritance rights negatively affects
   women’s ability to find the collateral required for business loans. Innovative approaches to easing this
   constraint are being tested by researchers. For example, in the Women Entrepreneurship Development
   Project in Ethiopia, GIL is testing the impact of using a short psychometric test that predicts the likelihood
   that an entrepreneur will repay a loan. If the loan applicant achieves a high enough score on the test, she gets
   the loan, with no need for any collateral. So far, the repayment rate is over 99 percent.

   In the agriculture sector, joint GIL and Development Research Group research across six countries in the
   region revealed large gaps in productivity between women and men farmers, ranging from 24 percent
   in Ethiopia to 66 percent in Niger (figure BC.1.1). These gaps are explained by women’s lower access to a
   variety of productive inputs and lower returns to the use of those inputs, with farm labor being an especially
   significant constraint. This evidence suggests that providing women with financing to hire farm labor,
   adopt labor-saving technology, and use community-based childcare could help close the productivity gap,
   increasing rural incomes and food security.

   Across agriculture and nonagricultural self-employment, emerging evidence from World Bank researchers
   and outside academics, including Michael Frese, suggests that noncognitive skills, such as personal initiative,
   may be particularly important for closing gender gaps in performance. In Malawi, analysis of household
   survey data suggests that women’s noncognitive skills are associated with their adoption of a key export crop.
   Future impact evaluation work will test whether low-cost psychological interventions can equip women
   farmers with these skills. In Togo, the preliminary results of a randomized control trial indicate that personal
   initiative training is more effective than traditional managerial training in increasing firm profits, especially for
   women entrepreneurs.

                  Equity of Public Resource Use
                  The equity of public resource use component of the CPIA assesses the extent to which the pattern of
                  public expenditures and revenue collection affects the poor and is consistent with national poverty
                  reduction priorities. Organized into three subcomponents, equity of public resource use gives snapshots
                  of (i) available poverty measurement tools and monitoring systems, covering the extent to which poverty
                  measurement, monitoring, and evaluation instruments exist, and the degree to which poverty-related
                  information is made publicly available; (ii) government priorities and strategies, particularly those related

Building Human Resources
The human development component of the CPIA assesses the quality of national policies and public and private
sector delivery in health and education. The human development CPIA score for Sub-Saharan Africa increased
in 2016 to a score of 3.6, from 3.5 in 2015, continuing the upward trend that has been evident since 2010. There
continues to be a sizable gap in this score between resource-rich countries (score 3.5) and non-resource-rich
countries (score 3.7), and between fragile countries (score 3.3) and non-fragile countries (score 3.8).

                    The evolution of the average score for the health component exhibits a flat trend between 2015 and 2016.
                    The average CPIA score for the health component among the 38 IDA countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
                    is 3.4. Of these countries, 30 (79 percent) have the same score in 2016 as in 2015, five (13 percent) have
                    higher scores, and three (8 percent) have lower scores.

                    Among the countries with improving scores for health in 2016 were Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Guinea-
                    Bissau, Liberia, and Mauritania. The three countries where the scores for health weakened in 2016 were the
                    Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Eritrea.

                    Figure C.5 shows a positive, albeit weak, correlation between the CPIA ratings and various measures of
                    national income and health financing. The correlation is especially weak for gross national income per
                    capita and health spending as a percentage of government spending, where the R-squared is around
                    5 percent. The relationship seems to be a bit stronger for public spending on health as a percentage of
                    GDP (R-squared of almost 10) and public spending on health as a percentage of total health spending
                    (R-squared of 13). Within each CPIA rating level, there is a significant amount of variation, despite the
                    overall upward trend.

By contrast, the correlations for the health outcome–related indicators seem to be much stronger, as
depicted in figure C.6. The R-squared values run from 24 percent for life expectancy to 42 percent for
under-five mortality. Countries that scored higher on the CPIA appear to have higher life expectancy and
lower maternal, infant, and child mortality. Except for infant mortality, the range of values in each CPIA
level is much smaller than it is for the economic indicators.

                   Education
                   The score for education remained at 3.5, unchanged since 2014. Bucking this stable trend, a few countries
                   (Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Kenya) saw an improvement in scores, underpinned by improving access
                   and the quality of learning outcomes, and efforts to improve teacher quality that have been part of the
                   governments’ education strategy and agenda in the past years. The focus has been to improve learning
                   outcomes. For example, in recent years, the Government of Côte d’Ivoire has implemented several
                   initiatives to improve teacher training, including the development of a new curriculum, as well as the
                   reorganization of the governance structure on teacher training centers. An equal number of countries
                   experienced a slippage in this component of the CPIA (Eritrea, South Sudan, and Uganda).

                   The unfinished agenda of ensuring universal completion of primary and lower secondary education. Improving
                   learning levels, especially in the foundational years, is one of the top priorities of Sub-Saharan African
                   countries. However, this must be done at the same time as ensuring universal access to and completion of
                   primary and lower secondary education, the latter being one of the Sustainable Development Goals.

                   The access rates at the beginning and end of the primary cycle (grades 1 and 6) and lower secondary
                   cycle (grades 7 and 9), as measured by the gross intake ratio (GIR), indicate that although access in grade
                   1 tends to be high across the vast majority of countries, the access rates throughout the rest of the cycle

Implementing What Works).

Access in grade 1 is very high, even in countries that had relatively low grade 1 GIRs in 2000, such as
Burkina Faso and Ethiopia. In many countries, it is above 100 percent, reflecting the enrollment of under-
age and over-age children as well as “hidden repetition,” where children who have previously attended
school return to grade 1.
Nevertheless, retaining children even to the end of primary school (as reflected by the GIR in grade 6)
is proving difficult for most countries. Apart from countries in group 1 (of which Botswana and Ghana
are examples), where the grade 6 GIR is relatively high, in all other countries, there is a sharp drop in the
grade 6 GIR. Further, in most countries shown in figure C.7, the drop in the GIR between grades 1 and 6 is
steeper than the drop between grades 6, 7, and 9.
The cumulative effect of this loss in coverage is that, apart from the countries in group 1, the GIR in
grade 9 is less than 20 percent. This means that the vast majority of young people do not complete
the education level that is required to become fully engaged and active citizens and for productive
participation in the labor market.
Addressing gender and wealth disparities. Over two-thirds of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have a
Gender Parity Index (GPI) of 0.95 or above in primary school enrollment; Niger has the lowest GPI at 0.82.
However, only about half of the countries have a similar GPI at the lower secondary level. In general,
apart from the group 1 countries, which have attained gender parity at the lower secondary level, most
of the others have a GPI of less than 0.8. Chad and Benin have among the lowest GPIs, at 0.64 and 0.65,
respectively. Girls’ participation in and completion of lower secondary education contributes to lowering
fertility and increasing women’s empowerment.
Many children in the primary and lower secondary age groups are currently out of school. Figure C.8
illustrates the stark wealth disparities in the out-of-school incidence in these age groups, comparing
the rates for the poorest and wealthiest households. In Mali, the out-of-school rate among the poorest

   mean grades 7–9. In practice, some countries have slightly different cycles for primary and lower secondary.

                  are 57 and 20, respectively. The gap between the out-of-school incidence for the poorest and wealthiest
                  households tends to be highest among Francophone and Lusophone countries, such as Mozambique,
                  Angola, Benin, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Chad.

                  Social Protection and Labor
                  Social protection and labor systems help build resilience to shocks, improve equity, and build
                  opportunities, by helping people and families find jobs, improve productivity, and invest in the health and
                  education of their children.

Pension systems and labor market insurance generally cover only a small share of the population—civil
servants and those employed in the small formal sector—while often consuming a large share of the
national social protection budget. There is vast need—and often limited national budget—for social
assistance measures to protect the very poorest. Social safety nets or social assistance are noncontributory
schemes, which aim to provide protection for the poorest and most vulnerable and incentivize them to
improve their livelihoods and participate productively in society. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the number of
countries implementing at least one social safety net program increased from six in 2000 to 20 by 2008
at the onset of the economic crisis, to 46 in 2017 (Beegle, Coudouel, and Monsalve forthcoming).6 There
is a wide variety of experience with social safety nets, and this is reflected in the heterogeneity in CPIA
scores. Food insecure and conflict-affected countries typically have low scores; more stable countries with
stronger social protection systems have higher scores (figure C.9).

Despite the heterogeneity across the continent, social protection is becoming a core instrument in the
effort to reduce poverty. More and more African countries are preparing social protection strategies to
serve as the foundation on which to build effective and efficient social protection systems. A recent study
(Beegle, Coudouel, and Monsalve forthcoming) finds that by 2016, 30 African countries had established
social protection as one of the pillars of their stand-alone national social protection strategies. Following
a series of devastating climatic shocks in recent years, adaptive safety nets have been placed high on the
governments’ agendas. The shocks demonstrate the need for a national, scalable social safety net. For
example, the study finds that in the Sahel, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal are testing
mechanisms with temporary transfers to reach households affected by shocks, and the Productive Safety
Net in Ethiopia incorporates several features to respond to climate change. The study also finds that the
development of a safety net system is in progress in 27 African countries; several countries already have in
place safety net systems with adequate policies and delivery capacity (Botswana, Cabo Verde, Mauritius,
Namibia, the Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania).

                  In countries that experience repeated crises, it can be challenging to transition between immediate
                  humanitarian response and a longer-term safety net that strengthens resilience. Only a few years ago,
                  the most common social safety net programs were school feeding programs, public work programs,
                  emergency and categorical transfer programs, and general subsidies with low coverage of the poor. Now,
                  there is increasing representation of national poverty-targeted cash transfers (including in Ghana, Kenya,
                  Rwanda, Senegal, and Tanzania), and increasingly these are being designed such that their targeting and
                  distribution tools can be used in times of crisis to channel additional resources to the needy (box C.2).

                  support in Rwanda provides cash transfers to extremely poor households with no labor, and does not require
                  beneficiaries to comply with any conditions.

                  The Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN) in Tanzania is among the largest cash transfer programs in the region,
                  benefiting 9.7 percent of the total population (1,098,856 households in 2016). The cash program in Senegal
                  covered 15.9 percent of the total population in 2016 (197,751 households). Coverage in Ghana (213,414
                  households), Kenya (1,765,000 individuals), and Rwanda (86,772 households) is around 3.5 percent of the total
                  population. Spending on these programs is on average 0.23 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), with
                  Rwanda spending the most as a percentage of GDP (0.48 percent of GDP in 2015).

                  In 2014, around 50 percent of the cash transfer beneficiaries in Rwanda were poor; in Ghana, 70 percent of
                  the beneficiaries were in the bottom 60 percent of the consumption distribution in 2012a; and the majority of
                  PSSN beneficiaries in Tanzania (83 percent) were in the bottom 40 percent of the consumption distribution.b
                  In Kenya, there is no robust evidence on the effectiveness of targeting. However, some evidence shows that
                  safety net programs are mostly succeeding in targeting resources to poor counties.c

More and more impact evaluations are being undertaken, contributing to a growing body of evidence
on safety net programs in Africa. Ralston, Andrews, and Hsiao (2017)7 conducted a meta-analysis of 55
impact evaluations since 2005, covering 25 safety net programs in 13 African countries. Overall, the
impacts on consumption and food security make a strong case for investment in safety net programs as
vehicles to reduce poverty. Safety net programs also show strong potential for building risk management
capacity and promoting resilience. They also have transformative potential to boost education and health
outcomes, and can promote productive inclusion of the poor.

In general, the CPIA ratings for labor markets (2.6) and pensions (2.5) are lower than those for safety nets
(3.1). The demographic “youth bulge” is increasingly recognized as a key adverse factor in risk of political
instability. Youth employment opportunities and skills training for appropriate and available jobs are sorely
needed.

The overall CPIA score for social protection and labor increased from 2.9 in 2015 to 3.0 in 2016. The results
show that there were no downgrades, even for countries experiencing conflict. Three countries—Côte
d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, and Madagascar—increased their ratings following a renewed priority by the
government on safety nets and support to a scaled-up social assistance program from the World Bank.

In Côte d’Ivoire, the set of overall social safety net programs remains limited, but efforts to reduce
fragmentation started in 2016. As of late 2016, Côte d’Ivoire has started implementing community
mobilization, proxy-means testing, and community validation for targeting and identification under
its national social safety net system, having previously relied mainly on limited donor-financed vertical
programs. A national cash transfer program, household registry, reliable and efficient payment system,
and accompanying measures to support human capital and household productivity were launched.
The government began implementing the cash transfer program in 2016: 5,000 beneficiaries received
identification cards for receiving cash transfers following proxy-means testing and community validation
during August to October 2016.

In Guinea-Bissau, the government has prepared a Social Protection Strategy and the development of a
social registry. The social registry contributes to two goals: the first is to identify households in poverty and
provide basic social services coverage for them; the second is to gather information, which could be used
for the diagnosis, conception, and implementation of future social protection programs. The government
is currently implementing a pilot cash transfer program (financed by IDA) to provide incremental income
to 2,000 vulnerable households.

In Madagascar, safety net programs are well targeted and cover the main vulnerable groups (particularly
the extreme poor); the programs are built to be responsive to shifting needs (for example, disaster
response); and they are increasingly coordinated across government ministries and entities as well as
development partners (the United Nations Children’s Fund, European Union, World Food Progamme, and
others). The pilot conditional cash transfer program, launched in 2015 to cover 5,000 households, was
scaled up to cover about 39,000 households by the end of 2016. In addition, the government launched
the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) through cash for work, covering more than 30,000 households
over a three-year period in six regions of the country. In response to the severe drought in the south of
the country, Development Intervention Fund (Fonds d’Intervention pour le Developpement, or FID, as it is
called locally) (with financing from the World Bank) has prepared an emergency cash transfer program for
up to 68,000 households in five affected districts. The emergency program combines cash transfers with
livelihood recovery grants and nutrition services (provided through the National Nutrition Program). As of
December 2016, it was already covering 15,000 households.

The proxy-means test–based targeting instrument has been scaled up in Madagascar and is being used
for the conditional cash transfer program as well as the Productive Safety Net Program. The ministry is
envisaging its use for its own programs, beyond those financed by the World Bank, and is discussing
with some development partners the joint application of the instrument. This development should not
only provide the country with an objective and transferrable targeting instrument, but also contribute to
greater equity by ensuring that the poorest population is included in social programs.

Policies and Institutions for Environmental Sustainability
The environmental and natural resources management (ENRM) component of the CPIA relies on a
standard scoring tool measuring (i) the appropriateness and implementation of policies across a range
of environmental topics: air pollution, water pollution, solid and hazardous waste, freshwater resources,
marine and coastal resources, biodiversity, commercial renewable resources (mainly forests and fish),
commercial nonrenewable resources (mainly minerals), and climate change; and (ii) the strength of
cross-cutting institutional systems, including the quality of the environmental impact assessment

                  coordination, and accountability. Solid and hazardous waste, freshwater resources management, and
                  commercial nonrenewable resources management also improved. Zimbabwe registered improvements
                  in cross-sector coordination, access to information, solid and hazardous waste management, and

                  and water pollution showed the worst ratio (one country improving and four decreasing in both cases),
                  despite that on average public participation has one of the highest scores for the region. Ecosystem
                  and biodiversity was the metric with the highest score for the region on average; air pollution scored the
                  lowest. The only metric that did not change since 2015 was the one for climate change; two countries
                  improved their score, while six declined.

                  The relative performance across the 14 metrics was similar to previous years:

                  •	 Accountability (public access to information, participation, environmental assessment, and coordination)
                     remained the 12th lowest metric and a long way behind the other institutional measures.
                  •	 The ecosystem and biodiversity metric was the best performing sector-specific measure.
                  •	 Pollution-related measures continued to perform poorly, and showed a declining trend compared with
                     2015. Solid waste was the only pollution-related metric with an average score above 3, and improving
                     since 2015.

CLUSTER D: PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT AND INSTITUTIONS
Cluster D covers governance and public sector capacity issues: property rights and
rule-based governance; quality of budgetary and financial management; efficiency of
revenue mobilization; quality of public administration; and transparency, accountability,
and corruption in the public sector.

Inclusive governance and public institutions that can deliver quality services are critical to improving
people’s well-being. Not surprisingly, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which represent the
aspirations of people across the continent, call for strong institutions.8 IDA 18, which offers a strong
policy and financial package for Africa to undertake catalytic investments that can shift the development
trajectory to deliver results by 2030, has a special focus on governance and institutions as well.9

Governance and public institutions serve as a foundation for investments in growth, resilience, and
opportunities. These institutions span, facilitate, and underpin all development sectors, and are relevant for
quality education and health care, fair economic policies, and inclusive environmental protection, among
others. Building these institutions requires strengthening the core systems at the center of government,
which are necessary for
channeling resources to

8	 The SDGs are officially known as Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. There are 17 aspirational goals and
    169 targets. Goal 16 calls to “Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build
    effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels.”
9	 Governance and Institutions is one of the special themes of IDA 18; other themes include Jobs and Economic Transformation; Gender; Climate;
    and Fragility, Conflict, and Violence. The emphasis on governance seeks to facilitate an integrated, multisectoral approach to public sector
    reform that builds on lessons learned and promotes results-driven delivery of IDA. The approach also recognizes that progress in governance and
    institutional capacity development often requires longer-term investments spanning more than a three-year IDA replenishment cycle.

                   Open and accountable governance institutions ensure responsive, inclusive, and participatory decision
                   making; strengthen the rule of law; promote transparency; enforce property rights; and ensure equal
                   access to justice for all. These institutions also help reduce illicit financial flows, fight crime, and promote
                   peace in society. Effective revenue collection, coupled with sound budgetary and financial management,
                   enhances predictability in public investment. A sound revenue base underpins countries’ ability to
                   deliver the services required to sustain the social contract between citizens and the state, while offering
                   other benefits of reduced dependence on development assistance, and serving as a catalyst for broader
                   improvements in government responsiveness, resilience, and capacity.

                   Sub-Saharan African countries are diverse, with mixed governance performance. The regional average score
                   for cluster D in 2016 is 3.0. The average score for fragile countries is 2.8; non-fragile countries, 3.3; non-
                   resource-rich countries, 3.1; and resource-rich countries, 3.0. These variations in average scores indicate a
                   multiplicity in policy motivation for pursuing public sector reforms to underpin development efforts, and
                   the effects of institutional context on governance performance.

                   Across the board, resilient countries are associated with higher than average CPIA scores (figure D.3).
                   Public sector scores in resilient countries, such as Rwanda, Senegal, and Tanzania, are better compared
                   with countries that are falling behind, such as Nigeria and the Republic of Congo, and those that are
                   stuck in the middle, such as Ghana and Benin. The average score for efficiency of revenue mobilization
                   for resilient countries is 3.8, compared with around 3.4 for other countries. The average score for quality
                   of budget and financial management is likewise higher for resilient countries (3.6) compared with other
                   countries (3.1). For the quality of public administration, the average score is 3.3 for resilient countries,
                   compared with 2.8 for other countries.

                   Furthermore, the score for property rights and rule-based governance for resilient countries is 3.2,
                   compared with 2.7 for other countries. And the score for transparency, accountability, and corruption in

Quality of Public Financial Management
Public financial management plays a central role in the implementation of development policies that lead to
poverty alleviation and inclusive growth, by promoting fiscal stability, sustainability, and efficient delivery
of public services, and ensuring the transparency and accountability of public resource management.11
Public financial systems, institutions, and stakeholders aim to achieve these outcomes by strengthening
governments’ budgeting; treasury; accounting; controls; audit; and cash, public investment, asset,


11	 Public financial management addresses several objectives. It can be implemented in response to a particular fiscal problem or crisis, typically a
    growing deficit and the need to raise revenues, curb expenditures, or use existing resources more efficiently. It can be implemented as part of a
    social and political agenda to ensure better service delivery in health, education, or other sectors. For more details, see, for example, Public Financial

In Côte d’Ivoire, improvement in budget policy links has been observed. The government is making
headway in the development of sector and global Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks and program
budgets in all ministries, as per the West African Economic Monetary Union’s financial management
guidelines. Budget classification allows the identification of pro-poor spending with the use of a budget
information system (SIGFIP). The preparation of budget investment is done through an investment
planning platform that interfaces with the expenditure chain (SIGFIP). The expenditure chain, which covers
the budget execution and control cycles, is fully computerized and interfaces well with the procurement
(SIGMAP) and treasury system. SIGMAP, after an upgrade, is now web-enabled.

The authorities have also deployed a local public financial management system in 12 localities, for better
resource utilization and transparency at the deconcentrated level. Furthermore, resource management for
budget planning is improving. The interface between the human resource system and the budget system
(SIGFIP) has been created, which allows for smooth transmission of human resource data to the payroll system.
All these automated systems have helped with the budget preparation process and its timely approval by the
Parliament, including prior consultation with concerned ministries and preparation of reports.

In addition, the Ivorian government continues to work on improving the transparency, accountability, and
performance of public enterprises through the centralization and close monitoring of operations. About
78 national public enterprises operate stand-alone accounting systems, which are not connected to the
central government’s budgeting system. Connection would allow for rapid exchange of data, reporting,
and monitoring. To address this accountability and control challenge, on a phased basis, the authorities
have set up a central system in the Ministry of Budget and established an interconnection with some
important national public enterprises.

Furthermore, fiscal reporting and transparency, in line with the commitments to the Open Government
Partnership, have improved. To this end, an Open Data Portal was launched, although the content and
coverage are still limited. More financial and fiscal data are online for public use. Budget execution
statements are published quarterly, and the Ivorian government’s financial statement is being produced in
a timely manner.

In Madagascar, the budget and financial management system has seen several upgrades. Budget quality
and its links to policy are now better. The improvements are reflected in increased allocation for priority
sectors, the successful preparation of fiscal aggregates on a rolling basis for the past few years, and the
timely preparation of budget documents.

In addition, policy decision making has benefitted from a robust normative framework, which meets
international standards. The government’s budget classification comprises five sub-classifications:
administrative, economic, functional, geographic, and programmatic, and by source of funding. The
functional classification complies with the public administration classification/classification of public
administration functions, included in the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2011. The Malagasy
Chart of Account is now compliant with International Accounting Standards/International Financial
Reporting Standards. In view of these factors, the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
rating for Madagascar is A, under the PEFA PI-5 Indicator for Comprehensiveness and Transparency –
Classification of the Budget.12

Furthermore, monthly budget execution reports are available online. The government reduced the delay
in the production of the annual public account. It is now compliant with existing legislation regarding
the timeliness of the presentation of the audited account to the Parliament. The Court of Account held a
public presentation of its report for the first time in more than 30 years.

In Mauritania, public financial management was strengthened by reforms to increase budget integration,
introduction of information systems, and fiscal reporting to improve citizens’ access to information. The
implementation of the Public Investment Program—the Council of Ministers Decree No. 2016-179 of 2016
that defines steps for the evaluation, selection, and implementation of the public investment program13—
was successfully initiated. Operation manuals and supporting regulatory texts defining monitoring
and evaluation arrangements for this framework were developed. Furthermore, investment budget
monitoring was improved through the drafting of a Finance Law, which was submitted to the Parliament
in November 2016. This law, once promulgated, seeks to unify for the first time the national and external
financing of public investment, adopting a common budget nomenclature. In addition, a new medium-
term development plan was advanced to address inadequacies in the effectiveness of investment
spending, in line with the priorities of the development plan and to reduce the risk of over-indebtedness.

Notable progress has been made in consolidating and introducing new information systems for effective
financial management in customs administration and debt management in Mauritania. Customs operations
have been computerized using a modern IT system (SYDONIA World version) in customs administration
offices in Nouakchott, Nonaudio, and Rosso. The system permits automated management of key customs
procedures, including processing declarations; releasing goods for consumption, transit, suspension of
duties, and taxes; handling authorizations for vehicles imported temporarily by nonresidents; and processing
the clearance of vehicle parts and components. For improved treasury operations, a new Debt Management
and Analysis System to replace the Excel-based tool was implemented. The new system helps to facilitate
data exchange between debt management, payment systems, and other treasury solutions. In addition, a
budget preparation software was tested to support budget planning.

The major focus of the Mauritanian authorities has been to improve the fiscal reporting of the parastatal
sector, to increase information to citizens and boost economic debate. For this purpose, the Ministry
of Finance has published the audited financial statements of the five largest state-owned enterprises,
namely, the state-owned iron-ore company, SNIM; the Port Authority of the Port of Nouakchott; the
national oil company, SMHPM; the national gas company, SOMAGAZ; and the government-owned electric
utility, SOMELEC. Moreover, monthly fiscal reports have been introduced on the Treasury website, which
covers budget execution reports, mining and petroleum operators’ reports (including the audit report of
the petroleum fund), a series of tables on the Financial Operations of the State, the monthly situation of
the Treasury, and other bulletins.

Revenue Mobilization
Although it is a development priority under Vision 2030, there were few gains in the quality of revenue mobilization
in 2016. According to the Doing Business report, Sub-Saharan Africa needs to improve its tax payment
systems to fund development programs. For example, it takes 304 hours per year to complete the paperwork
and other formalities for paying taxes in the region, compared with 198 hours per year in East Asia and the

13	 This new framework consolidates capital expenditure and enforces the integration of all public investment, including by state-owned enterprises,
    in the Public Investment Program. The new regulation also introduced various types of filters, including those aligned with (i) the evaluation of
    investment projects, (ii) the presence of a stable regulatory framework, (iii) coordination of investment plans with the country’s development
    strategy, and (iv) integration of investment budgeting into the government’s overall medium-term fiscal plan.

Pacific and 208 hours per year in the Middle East and North Africa. The number of tax payments per year is
also high in Sub-Saharan Africa, at 39, compared with 23 in East Asia and the Pacific and 18 in the Middle East
and North Africa (table D.2). The level of revenue to GDP remains modest in Sub-Saharan Africa (tax revenue
to GDP was nearly 16 percent in 2013), suggesting the potential to increase these revenues.

Guinea is the only country in the region to record an upgrade in the quality of revenue mobilization
in 2016. This improvement has been mainly due to tax administration measures coupled with steady
policy measures, despite the post-Ebola shock and the negative impact of the fall in prices of metals
and minerals. The country has accelerated its efforts to strengthen tax administration with development
partner assistance (for example, the European Union and France). The key objectives include developing
a strategic approach, improving user-oriented service, building capacity, establishing and implementing
a multi-annual training plan, carrying out a taxpayers’ survey in the field, and implementing a modern
information system. The authorities have made progress in the development of a real estate database and
carrying out a survey to populate a database of professionals.

                 Property Rights and Rule-Based Governance and Transparency, Accountability,
                 and Corruption in the Public Sector
                 Sub-Saharan Africa is lagging in property rights protection and the fight against corruption, weighing down
                 on overall performance of Cluster D. For example, justice sector performance in the region’s IDA countries
                 is weaker than that in other IDA countries (for the property rights and rule-based governance indicator,
                 the average score in Sub-Saharan Africa is 2.8, compared with 3.0 in other IDA countries). Similarly, Sub-
                 Saharan Africa’s IDA countries’ score for transparency, accountability, and fight against corruption (2.7) is
                 lower than that for other IDA countries (3.0). These low scores imply a loss of public resources that could be
                 effectively channeled toward development programs. The World Governance Indicators also suggest that
                 transparency and effective judicial enforcement (which are closely associated key elements of the cluster D
                 indicator) need to be radically improved to put a dent in corruption and build trust in public institutions.15

                 Furthermore, the CPIA scores for both governance dimensions remained unchanged in 2016 compared
                 with 2015. The cause may have been lack of attention by the authorities to justice sector capacity
                 building, and the difficulty of policy decision making due to a dearth of data on justice performance.
                 Another potential explanation would be the continuation of violence, corrupt practices, and political and
                 ethnic conflict in many countries, which are keeping institutions opaque and unaccountable, and citizens
                 vulnerable and at risk.

For strengthening property rights, fighting corruption, and promoting governance accountability,
international experience suggests: reforms that alleviate delays and reduce backlogs in courts; promote
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms; provide free legal assistance and reduce court fees; build the
skills of justice sector officials and judges and their disciplinary systems; and bring services closer to the
people, especially vulnerable groups.

Conclusion
In moving forward, implementation of ongoing governance and public-sector reforms (such as
financial management system upgrades) need to be expanded, and new dimensions added (such
as rights protection, transparency, and fighting against corruption) to achieve a more integrated
approach to addressing governance challenges. The findings of the 2017 World Development Report
on Governance and the Law also stress the need to reduce policy implementation gaps by improving
the interaction among stakeholders and the processes by which they interact as power brokers.17

Given that governance underpins all sectors of development, promotion of capacity, systems
upgrade, and reforms across all sectors could significantly enhance accountability and effectiveness.
This integrated governance approach, in line with the aspirations of the SDGs and Vision 2030, could
help Sub-Saharan Africa take advantage of the historic opportunity to leverage IDA18 resources and
radically improve development outcomes.




17	 In confronting development challenges, the World Development Report stresses a rethinking of “the processes by which state and non-state
    actors interact to design and implement policies”, within a given set of formal and informal rules that shape and are shaped by “power”, which is
    defined as “the ability of one actor to make others undertake an action that is in the actor’s interest, and that the others would not otherwise take.”

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared with the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details, see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA.

      sustainability and minimizing budgetary risks.


B. Structural Policies

Appendix C: Guide to CPIA
The Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) is a diagnostic tool that is intended to capture the
quality of a country’s policies and institutional arrangements—that is, its focus is on the key elements that are
within a country’s control, rather than on outcomes (such as growth rates) that are influenced by elements
outside the country’s control. More specifically, the CPIA measures the extent to which a country’s policy and
institutional framework supports sustainable growth and poverty reduction, and consequently the effective
use of development assistance. The outcome of the exercise yields an overall score and scores for all of the 16
criteria that compose the CPIA. The CPIA tool was developed and first employed in the mid-1970s. Over the
years, the World Bank has periodically updated and improved it to reflect the lessons of experience and the
evolution of thinking about development.

In June 2006, the World Bank publicly disclosed for the first time the numerical scores of its 2005 CPIA. The
CPIA exercise covers country performance during a given calendar year with the results for the IDA eligible
countries disclosed in June of the following year.

The CPIA has undergone periodic reviews to update and refine the content of the criteria. The most
recent revision of the criteria took place last year and was applied to the 2016 CPIA exercise. The revisions
were guided by the conclusions of an Independent Evaluation Group evaluation, relevant findings in the
literature, and lessons learned in carrying out the annual CPIA exercise in the past few years. In undertaking
the revisions, special attention was given to ensuring that the content of the revisions was commensurate
with the availability of information and the ability to assess country performance, and that some degree of
continuity was preserved in the criteria. The revisions have not resulted in significant changes in country
scores. Among the revisions are the following:

  •	 In criterion 4 (Q4, Trade), trade policy and trade facilitation are now equally weighted; more emphasis is
    placed on the trade regime, not just imports; services are explicitly introduced; and the trade facilitation
    subcomponent is elaborated.
  •	 The coverage of social assistance programs, including coordination, reach, and targeting issues in Q10
    (Social Protection and Labor), was strengthened.
  •	 Q15 (Quality of Public Administration) was revised to include a stronger focus on the core public
    administration and, when relevant, a more explicit treatment of subnational governments.
  •	 Q16 (Transparency, Accountability, and Corruption in the Public Sector) was revised to include a new
    dimension to cover aspects of financial corruption that had not been treated consistently. Coverage
    of fiscal information is now more explicit, and capture and conflicts of interest as distinct forms of
    corruption are treated more consistently.
CPIA scores help to determine International Development Association allocations—concessional lending and
grants—to low-income countries.
