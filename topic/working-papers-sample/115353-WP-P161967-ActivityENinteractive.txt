What is the Lagging Regions Initiative
The scope of the EU Cohesion Policy is to narrow development gaps and reduce disparities between Member
Countries and regions. To this extent, around €454 billion of ESI (European Structural and Investment) Funds
have been allocated to help EU regions become more competitive. However, not all EU regions have been able
to fully take advantage of the benefits of EU growth, due to the effects of the 2008 economic crisis and due to
a host of structural problems.

To this end, Corina Crețu, the Commissioner for Regional Policy, together with the Task Force for Better
Implementation has started the Lagging Regions Initiative. The aim of the Initiative is to identify what holds
back growth in less developed regions, and to provide targeted actions for unlocking their growth potential.
Thus, these lagging regions will be assisted to involve a broad range of stakeholders (regional and local
administrations, educational institutions, business support institutions, SMEs, entrepreneurs, investors, NGOs,
IFIs) to help respond to concrete needs they have and to maximize the impact of regional investments. Two
types of lagging regions have been identified:

•	   LOW GROWTH REGIONS, which cover the less developed and transition regions that did not converge to
     the EU average between the years 2000 and 2013 in Member States with a GDP per Capita (PPS) below
     the EU average in 2013. These include almost all the less developed and transition regions in Greece, Italy,
     Spain and Portugal

•	   LOW INCOME REGIONS, covering all the regions with a GDP per Capita (PPS) below 50% of the EU average
     in 2013. This group covers the less developed regions of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Romania.

Poland and Romania are the first countries to pilot this initiative, with two regions each – Swietokrzyskie and
Podkarpackie in Poland, and North-West and North-East in Romania. In April 2016, Commissioner Crețu together
with Marshal Adam Jarubas in Swietokrzyskie and Marshal Wladyslaw Ortyl in Podkarpackie have officially
launched the Polish part of the Lagging Regions Initiative called „Catching-up Regions Poland”. The „Catching-
up Regions Poland” is an implementation-focused program that aims at providing tailored support to the two
Polish regions to boost the impact of EU and private investments in specific areas selected by the two regions.

Over a year of joint work, the World Bank provided hands-on technical assistance and helped coordinate five
activities that were selected by the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie regions in coordination with the European
Commission, Ministry of Economic Development, and the Bank. The five selected activities were:

•	   Improving the commercialization of Research & Development (R&D) results generated by public research
     facilities and enabling better utilization of existing technology transfer centers in the Podkarpackie region.

•	   Strengthening the vocational education and training system in the Swietokrzyskie region, using best practice
     examples from around the world and tailoring them to the regional context.

•	   Activating entrepreneurship in deprived areas in the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie regions.

•	   Identifying ways to improve conditions for starting a business in the Podkarpackie and Swietokrzyskie
     regions.

•	   Supporting the creation of in-house financial instruments in the Podkarpackie region.

This report constitutes one of the outputs of the “Catching-up Regions Poland” work. More outputs, including
an overview report and reports for individual activities in both English and Polish can be accessed on the World
Bank’s website.

  Box 3      Online business registration by foreigners


  Foreigners should be encouraged to use the S24. At present it is possible to register foreign legal or natural persons as partners or
  members of the board in the S24. Their identity can be verified in the system based on passport details instead of the PESEL number.
  However, the S24 service and user information are only available in the Polish language, making them inaccessible to foreign users. Also,
  certain aspects of foreign-related registration, makes it more time-consuming and less successful.

  Recommendations at the national level:

  - Foreigners should be required to upload via S24 passport scans and potentially other documents, to enable better verification
  and a swift criminal record check.
  According to court clerks, the data provided on application forms by foreigners (e.g., passport number and name, often misspelled
  when transposed from Russian to Latin alphabet) is insufficient to identify the person and accurately verify their criminal record. More
  detailed information concerning foreign partners/board members could streamline and expedite the registration process.

  - There should be accurate and reliable information in foreign languages about company registration in Poland.
  The contents of the government’s business registration website should be translated for foreigners. Also, the website should provide
  information relevant to foreign applicants, such as the documents required under Polish regulations (e.g., in connection with docu-
  menting a foreign legal entity’s rules of representation, or proving that the parent single-partner company is not single-partner owned).
  At present, even though foreign-related cases constitute only a small portion of total inflow, errors by foreigners are in general one of
  the most frequent reasons for the return of applications.

  - The S24 service should be available in other language versions.
  The S24 should follow the practice of CEIDG service (Central Registry and Information on Business, used primarily by sole proprietor-
  ships), and the online registration form should be provided in foreign languages as well.

                                                         Often, the name of the company includes the legal form (“spółka z o.o.”), which

Court information desks play an
important role in reducing the
number of failed application cases.
Direct     communication      with     the
applicants who visit or call the court in
search of guidance on the registration
procedure is an opportunity to avoid
returned or failed applications. An easily
accessible and competent information
desk may significantly reduce the
amount of applicants’ mistakes and the
workload of the KRS division. It is crucial
to ensure that the applicants can receive
help from experienced staff who are up
to date on legislative developments and
local jurisprudence.

Box 5      Guidance provided by court staff – a survey


Practical guidance on the registration procedure by experienced court staff will reduce the number of failed applications. In Rzeszów,
there is a customer information desk in the main hall of the court, but it does not serve KRS clients. Their calls and visits are redirected
to the KRS division, and not all clients are persistent enough to find the division. In Kielce as well, the general information desk in the
main building of the court does not serve KRS clients. There is, however, a separate information desk for KRS in the division building.
Both in Kielce and in Rzeszów, the court staff was able to correctly answer customer’s questions about parts of the form that are com-
monly filled incorrectly. It is important to keep this level of quality of customer service, especially since increasingly all communication
with clients is being handled by information desks rather than the KRS division.

                           Box 6      Reducing delays resulting from backlogs


                           Consider two divisions of a court with one assistant each. Each division, at 100% capacity, receives and
                           processes one case per day.

                           A backlog is created if the number of new cases exceeds those that are processed. This will happen, for
                           instance, if the number of cases in division B triples and the capacity remains unchanged. This situation is
                           depicted in the table below. Division B has received three cases on Day 1, but with the current resources
                           it is able to process only one case that day and will handle the second case on Day 2 (1 day delay), and
                           the third case on Day 3 (2 days delay). As a result, the case arriving on Day 2 will be dealt with on Day 4,
                           and so on. The spike in cases on Day 1 will lead to a total of three days of waiting time for the cases arriv-
                           ing on that day (and two days for the single case arriving the next day and each of the following days).

                           Can the delay be reduced if the assistant is transferred from Division A to Division B? Such a reassign-
                           ment will inevitably create a backlog in Division A, but it will also help minimize the number of waiting
                           days for the divisions’ clients.” This is shown in the table, below. The total number of delayed days is
                           smaller when two assistants work in the division with the larger inflow of cases than when they work
                           at full capacity in two separate divisions.

 For instance, assistants need to handwrite on each of the draft registration decisions that the application was reviewed without hearing. This is
an obvious formula in the case of business registration, but inserting it 45,000 times for all newly registered LLCs in Poland wastes 90 workdays.

                                                                                         4 - EXPEDITING APPLICATION PROCESSING                  31

Incentives for staff to process
more cases

At present, the employees at KRS
divisions in Kielce and Rzeszów have
limited incentives to perform above
expectations. Judicial clerks are given
a target number of cases to close during
a month, but they are not rewarded for
managing more cases than expected.
Assistants have no targets and no
incentives.

Experience from the district court in
Białystok shows that performance
pay mechanisms can be successfully
used in KRS divisions. In Białystok,
assistants at the KRS division have
specified targets of cases that they have
to handle in a month. In addition, they
have been offered additional pay (Polish
dodatek) if they exceeded these targets.
The additional pay is different from the
customary reward payments used in the
Polish public sector because they are
disbursed based on pre-agreed levels
and the funds for these extra payments
are guaranteed. Staff has been shown to
handle more cases on a daily basis for a
fraction of the salary of new employees.
Staff and management praise this
mechanism as a transparent and efficient
tool for dealing with a seasonal increase
of workload in the KRS divisions.
