Executive	Summary	
1.      This	 comparative	 analysis	 examines	 the	 enforcement	 of	 uncontested	 monetary	
claims	in	the	EU-11,	as	well	as	in	FYR	Macedonia	(hereinafter	“comparator	countries”),	and	
outlines	options	available	to	policymakers.	The	users	of	this	analysis	will	be	policymakers	in	
environments	that	are	strained	by	backlogs	of	such	claims.	Primarily,	these	will	be	Western	
Balkans	countries,	especially	those	of	the	former	Yugoslavia.	The	analysis	may	also	benefit	
policymakers	elsewhere	who	wish	to	improve	enforcement	of	uncontested	claims.		

2.     When	 exploring	 enforcement	 of	 uncontested	 claims,	 the	 report	 gives	 particular	
attention	 to	 utility	 bills	 since	 they	 form	 a	 significant	 portion	 of	 such	 claims.	 Additionally,	
enforcement	of	utility	bills	is	a	sensitive	policy	matter	due	to	the	social	significance	of	these	
services.				

3.      Uncontested	claims	are	enforced	in	two	stages:	first,	obtaining	enforceable	title;	and	
second,	execution	of	the	enforceable	title.	In	all	comparator	countries,	these	two	stages	are	
carried	out	by	two	different	authorities.	None	of	the	comparator	countries	have	chosen	to	
combine	the	two	stages.	In	contrast,	in	Serbia	and	in	Montenegro	these	two	stages	form	part	
of	a	single	enforcement	procedure	carried	out	by	an	enforcement	agent.		

4.     The	report	divides	procedures	for	obtaining	enforceable	title	into	two	principal	types	
of	procedures:	 an	order	for	payment	or	 issuance	of	writ	of	execution	based	on	authentic	
document.	These	have	different	scopes	(with	the	order	for	payment	procedure	being	broader	
in	scope)	but	are	based	on	common	characteristics:	they	are	designed	to	enforce	uncontested	
claims	and	are	non-litigious	in	nature.		

5.      The	non-litigious	nature	of	obtaining	enforceable	title	calls	for	competent	authorities	
to	 enforce	 uncontested	 claims	 in	 a	 manner	 that	 is	 fast,	 fair	 and	 cost-effective.	 Most	
comparator	countries	have	bestowed	this	responsibility	on	 first-instance	courts.		Hungary,	
Croatia	and	FYR	Macedonia	have	assigned	this	function	to	notaries.	In	contrast,	in	Serbia	and	
in	Montenegro,	enforcement	agents	both	issue	enforceable	titles	and	execute	them.		

6.      A	 few	 countries	 have	 opted	 for	 a	 centralized	 process	 whereas	 others	 rely	 on	 the	
traditional	 territorial	 jurisdiction	 of	 competent	 authorities.	 Some	 countries	 with	 limited	
territorial	jurisdiction	report	unequal	caseload	of	officials	and	serious	regional	differences	in	
timelines.	 Centralized	 systems,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 ensure	 uniform	 workload	 across	 the	
country.		

7.      Use	 of	 information	 and	 communications	 technologies	 (ICT)	 often	 helps	 to	 ensure	
quick	and	efficient	processing	of	requests	for	issuance	of	enforceable	titles.	In	all	comparator	
countries	with	centralized	systems,	electronic	filing	is	mandatory	for	creditors	wishing	to	use	
the	 expedited	 procedure.	 Comparator	 countries	 with	 non-centralized	 systems	 either	 have	
only	paper-based	filing	or	provide	creditors	the	choice	to	file	electronically.		

8.      An	 important	 instrument	 in	 managing	 procedural	 conduct	 is	 the	 fee	 collected	 by	
competent	 authorities.	 The	 fee	 covers	 the	 costs	 for	 operating	 the	 system	 and	 should	
incentivize	creditors	to	choose	the	most	cost-efficient	procedure.		

9.       Procedures	for	obtaining	enforceable	titles	for	uncontested	claims	are	designed	to	be	
quick.	 In	 comparator	 countries	 with	 centralized,	 electronic	 systems,	 authorities	 issue	 the	


                                                    1	
enforceable	title	within	a	few	days	from	the	filing.	Elsewhere,	timelines	are	less	predictable.	
Timelines	are	the	longest	where	procedures	incorporate	litigious	elements.		

10.     Service	of	enforceable	titles	to	debtors	in	uncontested	claims	is	critical	to	ensuring	
debtors’	right	to	fair	trial.	Service	in	comparator	countries	is	carried	out	by	different	types	of	
entities:	 court	 employees,	 notary	 employees,	 postal	 service.	 Methods	 of	 service	 without	
proof	of	receipt	by	the	debtor	often	give	rise	to	protests.	However,	such	methods	are	usually	
seen	as	indispensable	to	the	effective	enforcement	of	uncontested	claims.		

11.     Objections	 are	critically	important	in	enforcing	uncontested	claims	since	titles	enter	
into	 force	 only	 in	 the	 absence	 of	 objection.	 Most	 comparator	 countries	 allow	 partial	
objections,	 which	 may	 lead	 to	 increases	 in	 processing	 times	 but	 allow	 for	 more	 flexibility.	
Frivolous	objections	may	increase	caseloads	and	expenses	for	creditors	and	debtors.		

12.     In	 all	 comparator	 countries,	 execution	 over	 debtors’	 assets	 is	 carried	 out	 by	
authorities	that	are	different	from	the	ones	issuing	the	enforceable	title.		Usually,	these	are	
private	professionals	operating	in	highly	regulated	environments.	Effective	execution	may	be	
aided	 by	 ICT	 facilitating	 case	 management,	 disciplinary	 proceedings,	 identification	 and	
freezing	 of	 debtors’	 assets,	 or	 obtaining	 information	 on	 companies’	 and	 citizens’	
indebtedness.		

13.     National	 enforcement	 policies	 should	 ensure	 adequate	 mechanisms	 for	 preventing	
disproportionate	measures	or	excessive	harm	to	debtors	in	the	course	of	enforcement.	The	
two	main	groups	of	measures	for	 protecting	debtors	are	the	prohibitions	or	restrictions	on	
directing	 enforcement	 at	 some	 categories	 of	 debtors’	 assets,	 and	 the	 adoption	 of	 laws	 on	
insolvency	of	natural	persons/households.	

14.      The	report	explores	 reform	management	at	both	stages	of	enforcement.		Obtaining	
enforceable	title	for	uncontested	claims	is	generally	reformed	by:	introducing	an	order	for	
payment	 procedure;	 assigning	 notaries	 with	 the	 authority	 to	 issue	 enforceable	 titles;	
digitalization;	and/or	centralization	of	this	function.	The	most	significant	reform	in	the	area	
of	execution	is	the	introduction	of	private	enforcement	agents.		

15.    The	report	explores	factors	contributing	to	the	generation	of	backlogs	in	the	area	of	
enforcement.	It	finds	that	rules	on	the	interruption	of	periods	of	limitation	in	the	course	of	
pending	execution	and	rules	on	dormant	execution	cases	have	a	direct	effect	on	the	likelihood	
of	accumulating	backlog.			

16.     Finally,	the	report	explores	 opposition	to	reforms	in	comparator	countries	and	finds	
that	while	there	was	generally	little	opposition	to	reforming	the	issuance	of	enforceable	titles.	
The	introduction	of	private	enforcement	agents	was	met	with	opposition	in	some	comparator	
countries.	Opposition	to	reforms	often	occurred	not	at	the	time	of	their	introduction	but	at	a	
later	stage,	after	the	systems	had	been	operating	for	a	few	years	and	their	deficiencies	had	
been	 observed.	 Nevertheless,	 successful	 reforms	 in	 the	 region	 offer	 good	 models	 for	
countries	that	experience	similar	problems	and	share	common	cultural	and	legal	traditions.

Methodology	
17.      This	 comparative	 analysis	 examines	 the	 manner	 in	 which	 enforcement	 of	 unpaid	
utility	bills	is	organized	in	the	EU-111,	as	well	as	FYR	Macedonia	(hereinafter	referred	to	as	
“comparator	 countries”	 or	 “comparator	 states”),	 and	 outlines	 the	 various	 policy	 options	
available	to	countries	wishing	to	reform	these	systems.	It	is	expected	that	the	primary	users	
of	this	analysis	would	be	Western	Balkan	countries	where	court	resources	are	strained	by	a	
massive	backlog	of	unresolved	cases	for	enforcing	unpaid	utility	bills.	At	the	same	time,	the	
identified	efficiencies	and	good	practices	might	also	benefit	countries	further	afield,	including	
comparator	countries	wishing	to	optimize	these	processes	in	their	regulatory	framework.		

18.     The	 analysis	 subdivides	 the	 process	 of	 enforcement	 of	 utility	 bills	 into	 two	 distinct	
stages	and	explores	the	main	features	of	both	stages	in	comparator	countries.	The	first	of	
these	stages	is	obtaining	an	enforceable	title	based	on	an	unpaid	utility	bill.	The	second	stage	
is	the	actual	execution	of	the	enforceable	title.	For	countries	that	implemented	reforms,	the	
study	examines	the	reform	management	process,	the	main	drivers	of	reform,	opposition	that	
reform	efforts	may	have	encountered	and	implementation	problems	that	may	still	persist.		
The	study	explores	the	issue	of	backlogs	in	enforcement	and	discusses	possible	contributing	
factors.		

19.     The	methodology	for	developing	this	analysis	entailed	desk	research	and	the	use	of	
country	rapporteurs	who	filled	out	detailed	questionnaires	regarding	utility	bills	enforcement	
in	comparator	countries.	In	each	comparator	country,	there	may	be	more	than	one	route	to	
enforce	 utility	 bills.	 The	 report	 explores	 the	 routes	 that	 are	 ordinarily	 chosen	 by	 utility	
providers	as	the	quickest	and	most	cost-efficient.	Additionally,	the	optimal	procedural	path	
for	enforcing	utility	bills	in	each	comparator	country	is	never	tailored	solely	to	utility	bills.	It	
usually	 applies	 to	 many	 other	 types	 of	 pecuniary	 claims.	 Therefore,	 the	 usefulness	 of	 this	
comparative	 analysis	 extends	 beyond	 utility	 bills	 and	 applies	 to	 most	 monetary	 takings,	
especially	uncontested	ones.		

1.	Problem	Statement	
20.     Enforcement	of	claims	based	on	utility	bills	has	been	recognized	as	a	major	reason	
for	 court	 overload	 in	 some	 Western	 Balkan	 states.	 The	 Serbia	 Judicial	 Functional	 Review	
2014	estimated	that	unpaid	utility	bills	make	up	around	80	percent	of	enforcement	caseload.		
Around	1.7	million	of	the	2	million	enforcement	cases	pending	in	Basic	Courts	at	the	end	of	
2013	 related	 to	 unpaid	 utility	 bills.2	 Following	 legislative	 amendments,	 new	 enforcement	
cases	are	channeled	through	private	enforcement	agents	but	it	remains	a	challenge	to	both	
clear	existing	backlog	at	Basic	Courts	and	ensure	that	the	pattern	of	excessive	caseload	is	not

simply	transferred	from	courts	to	private	enforcement	agents.	The	Judicial	Functional	Review	
identifies	the	principal	causes	for	utility	case	backlogs	in	Serbia3.	

    Box	1:	Drivers	of	Utility	Backlog	in	Serbia	

    §     Statute	of	limitations:	Companies	have	12	months	to	initiate	an	enforcement	case	or	their	claims	
          will	expire	under	the	statute	of	limitations.	They	therefore	flood	the	courts	with	thousands	of	
          enforcement	cases	using	a	process	automatically	generated	by	their	software	systems.		
    §     Non-joining	of	cases:	The	nominal	value	of	unsettled	claims	is	often	trivial	(e.g.,	below	10	EUR).	
          Repeated	small-value	enforcement	cases	(with	the	same	creditor,	same	type	of	debt,	and	the	
          same	debtor)	for	persistent	non-payers	accumulate	over	time	but	are	never	joined.		
    §     Social	issues:	Poor	residents	who	are	unable	to	service	their	bills	accumulate	debts	over	time.			



21.    Bosnia	 and	 Herzegovina	 (BiH)	 also	 struggles	 with	 enforcement	 of	 utility	 bills.	 A	
Diagnostic	Assessment	of	the	Enforcement	Regime	of	Final	Civil	Claims	in	BiH	estimates	that	
in	 2015	 approximately	 1.5	 million	 utility	 cases	 represented	 93.5	 percent	 of	 the	 total	
enforcement	 caseload.4	 The	 same	 study	 identifies	 four	 principal	 causes	 for	 utility	 case	
backlogs	in	BiH5.		

    Box	2:	Drivers	of	Utility	Backlog	in	BiH	

    §     Poor	quality	of	data	about	the	users	of	utility	services:	many	cases	refer	to	people	whose	address	
          is	wrong,	who	are	deceased,	who	pay	in	installments,	or	who	have	already	paid	their	debt.	
    §     Difficult	socio-economic	situation	of	many	BiH	citizens.	
    §     Lack	of	an	effective	enforcement	system	which	encourages	reduced	compliance	with	financial	
          obligations.	
    §     Massive	inflow	of	cases	sent	by	utility	companies,	due	to	short	statute	of	limitations	and	very	
          rigid	rules	that	publicly	owned	companies	have	to	follow.	



22.   As	illustrated	in	the	cited	analyses,	Western	Balkan	states	share	common	traits	and	
problems.	Some	of	these	could	be	addressed	using	comparator	countries’	experience.		

2.	Statute	of	Limitations	
23.     A	peculiar	characteristic	of	countries	that	were	part	of	the	former	Yugoslavia	is	the	
short	 statute	 of	 limitations	 for	 utility	 claims	 against	 natural	 persons.	 In	 BiH,	 Croatia,	 FYR

Macedonia,	Serbia	and	Slovenia,	such	receivables	need	to	be	claimed	within	one	year	of	their	
due	date.	This	legal	peculiarity	affects	the	procedural	conduct	of	utility	companies	since	they	
file	for	enforcement	frequently	over	relatively	small	amounts.	The	frequent	filing	leads	to	a	
proliferation	 of	 enforcement	 cases	 for	 utility	 bills.	 By	 contrast,	 in	 all	 other	 comparator	
countries	the	statute	of	limitations	for	utility	claims	is	much	longer,	as	illustrated	Figure	1.6	
Latvia	 and	 Lithuania	 have	 significantly	 longer	 statutes	 of	 limitations	 for	 utility	 claims	 as	
compared	to	all	other	comparator	countries.

24.     The	 limitation	 periods	 for	 claims	 based	 on	 utility	 bills	 are	 usually	 shorter	 than	 the	
general	 limitation	 periods	 in	 comparator	 jurisdictions.	 However,	 these	 shorter	 limitation	
periods	are	applicable	only	with	respect	to	the	first	stage	of	enforcement,	i.e.	obtaining	an	
enforceable	title.	Usually,	once	the	enforceable	title	is	obtained,	the	grounds	for	the	claim	are	
considered	 to	 have	 been	 transformed	 (i.e.	 it	 is	 no	 longer	 considered	 a	 claim	 based	 on	 an	
unpaid	utility	bill	but	a	claim	based	on	an	enforceable	title)	and	the	general	and	ordinarily	
longer	limitation	period	becomes	applicable.	Thus,	in	Bulgaria,	the	limitation	period	for	utility	
claims	is	three	years	but	upon	obtaining	an	enforceable	title,	a	new	five-year	limitation	period	
commences;	in	 Poland,	it	is	three	years	but	upon	obtaining	a	title,	the	renewed	limitation	
period’s	 length	 is	 ten	 years;	 in	 Croatia,	 a	 one-year	 limitation	 period	 is	 applicable	 to	 utility	
claims	but	once	there	is	a	writ,	the	new	period	of	limitation	is	ten	years.		

25.      The	statute	of	limitations	that	affects	creditors’	decision	when	to	seek	enforcement	
of	 their	 claims	 is	 the	 shorter	 limitation	 period,	 which	 is	 applicable	 before	 obtaining	
enforceable	title.	This	limitation	period	for	utility	claims	is	particularly	short	in	the	countries	
of	 the	 former	 Yugoslavia	 (i.e.	 one	 year).	 This	 policy	 choice	 was	 possibly	 based	 on	 social	
protection	 considerations.	 However,	 it	 leads	 to	 very	 frequent	 filing	 for	 issuance	 of	
enforceable	 titles	 for	 utility	 bills	 and	 may	 contribute	 to	 the	 overburdening	 of

enforcement	action,	this	setup	could	ultimately	burden	debtors	excessively	as	well7.		

3.	Prevention	of	Default	
26.    Countries	 that	 have	 effective	 measures	 in	 place	 to	 prevent	 default	 can	 preempt	 a	
range	 of	 problems	 with	 utility	 bill	 enforcement.	 The	 most	 common	 default	 prevention	
measure	is	the	possibility	for	utility	companies	to	stop	providing	the	service	in	case	of	non-
payment.	Where	cut-off	of	services	is	admissible,	this	encourages	higher	rates	of	voluntary	
payment	of	bills.	However,	due	to	the	social	significance	of	the	service,	utility	cut-off	may	be	
prohibited	 or	 constrained	 by	 law,	 leaving	 utility	 companies	 with	 the	 sole	 option	 to	 seek	
enforcement	through	the	legal	system.		

27.     Romania,	 Estonia	 and	 the	 Czech	 Republic	 allow	 utility	 shut-off	 in	 case	 of	 non-
payment.	 In	 Croatia,	 Latvia	 and	 Bulgaria,	 utility	 companies	 also	 have	 such	 rights	 by	 law.	
However,	in	these	countries	the	cut-off	may	prove	practically	impossible	where	it	requires	
entry	into	the	premises	of	the	debtor	(e.g.	heating	for	households	in	Bulgaria)	because	the	
debtor	cannot	be	obligated	to	provide	access.	Additionally,	if	provision	of	the	utility	service	is	
technically	connected	to	other	households	–	for	example,	in	communal	heating	of	apartment	
complexes	–	cut-off	might	again	be	impossible	in	practice.		

28.     In	other	countries,	cut-off	is	restricted	by	law.	 FYR	Macedonia	and	Hungary	prohibit	
cut-off	of	water	supply	to	households	for	hygienic	reasons	(but	limitation	of	water	supply	is	
possible	in	Hungary).	In	 Lithuania,	electricity	supply	to	socially	vulnerable	consumers8	shall	
not	be	terminated	if	they	owe	less	than	three	basic	social	benefits9	(i.e.	if	they	owe	less	than	
EUR	114).	Vulnerable	consumers’	electricity	supply	may	not	be	cut-off	on	Fridays,	weekends,	
before	 festivals,	 on	 public	 holidays	 or	 in	 emergency	 situations	 (when	 the	 maximum	 day	
temperature	 is	 lower	 than	 -15	 or	 higher	 than	 +30	 degrees	 Celsius).	 Lithuanian	 legislation	
allows	for	termination	of	utility	services	provision	only	in	case	there	are	appropriate	technical	
conditions	to	terminate	the	service	only	for	the	particular	household.	In	Slovakia,	cutting	off	
electricity	and	gas	supply	is	possible.		However,	shutting	off	water	supply	and	waste	water	
service	to	apartment	buildings	where	the	contract	regarding	these	services	is	between	the	
supplier	and	an	administrator	of	the	building	is	not	allowed.		

29.     Another	measure	that	prevents	default	in	the	payment	of	utility	bills	is	pre-payment.	
In	Hungary,	a	recent	development	aims	to	prevent	the	accumulation	of	unpaid	utility	bills	by	
allowing	the	public	utility	providers	to	install	(at	request)	pre-paid	meters	at	the	premises	of	
certain	 high-risk	 groups	 (i.e.	 individuals	 with	 a	 history	 of	 unpaid	 bills,	 etc.).	 Such	 pre-paid	
meters	must	be	‘charged’	in	the	same	way	as	pre-paid	cell	phone	SIM-cards.	Consequently,	if	

7
 	While	fees	for	relatively	large	claims	are	usually	calculated	as	a	percentage	of	the	claim,	there	are	in	many	
countries	minimal	fixed	amounts	of	the	fee	(e.g.	2%	but	no	less	than	EUR	20).	Thus,	when	several	small	claims	
are	not	joined	(as	in	the	case	of	frequent	filing),	the	resulting	fee	would	be	larger	than	if	they	had	been	joined.	
In	some	countries	(Estonia),	there	is	a	single,	flat	fee	for	the	electronic	processing	of	orders	for	payment.	In	
these	cases,	too,	non-joining	would	lead	to	much	higher	costs.	If	the	creditor	is	successful	in	the	enforcement	
action,	these	fees	would	ultimately	be	paid	by	the	debtor.		
8
    	These	are	persons	who	due	to	a	very	bad	financial	position	receive	financial	support	from	the	State.	
9
 	In	Lithuania,	the	current	value	of	one	basic	social	benefit	is	EUR	38,	i.e.	the	cumulative	value	of	three	basic	
social	benefits	is	appr.	EUR	114.

a	 debtor	 fails	 to	 charge	 the	 meter,	 the	 service	 would	 automatically	 be	 suspended,	 but	 no	
debts	would	accrue	vis	á	vis	the	public	service	provider.		

     Box	3:	Linking	Utility	Bills	to	Credit	Dossiers		
     An	 interesting	 example	 of	 a	 measure	 that	 effectively	 reduced	 arrears	 in	 payments	 to	 utility	
     companies	 is	 cited	 in	 Doing	 Business	 2017.	In	 the	 United	 States,	 DTE	 Energy—an	 electricity	 and	
     natural	gas	company—began	fully	reporting	customer	payment	data	to	credit	bureaus	in	August	
     2006.	DTE	customers	with	no	prior	credit	history	(8.1%	of	the	total)	gained	either	a	credit	file	or	a	
     credit	score	and	began	to	prioritize	making	payments	to	DTE.10	Within	six	months	DTE	had	80,000	
     fewer	 accounts	 in	 arrears.	 This	 good	 practice	 is	 also	 being	 implemented	 in	 some	 developing	
     economies.11		


30.      Prevention	measures	have	a	role	to	play	in	reducing	the	volume	of	utility	claims,	but	
the	scale	of	their	effect	is	not	sufficient	to	reduce	the	volume	of	incoming	claims	for	enforcing	
utility	bills.		

4.	Uncontested	Monetary	Claims		
31.     Oftentimes	 unpaid	 utility	 bills	 fall	 within	 the	 category	 of	 uncontested	 monetary	
claims.	In	other	words,	even	though	debtors	do	not	pay	their	bills,	they	would	not	actively	
contest	the	claims	in	a	court	of	law.	As	a	result,	enforcement	of	an	unpaid	utility	bill	ordinarily	
commences	 using	 the	 procedure	 for	 enforcing	 an	 uncontested	 claim	 in	 the	 respective	
country.	 If	 the	 debtor	 does	 not	 object,	 an	 enforceable	 title	 can	 be	 acquired	 quickly	 and	
inexpensively.	On	the	other	hand,	if	the	debtor	objects,	the	nature	of	the	procedure	changes	
and	the	case	follows	the	path	of	a	civil	claim.	This	report	explores	mainly	the	procedures	for	
enforcing	utility	bills	as	uncontested	claims	since	this	is	the	route	utility	cases	usually	take.		

32.     Ideally,	 a	 national	 procedure	 for	 enforcing	 uncontested	 monetary	 claims	 would	
comply	with	the	Minimum	Standards	for	Uncontested	Claims	Procedures	set	out	in	Regulation	
(EC)	No	805/2004	of	the	European	Parliament	and	of	the	Council	of	21	April	2004	creating	a	
European	 Enforcement	 Order	 for	 Uncontested	 Claims	 (hereinafter,	 Regulation	 (EC)	 No	
805/2004).	 Such	 compliance	 would	 ensure	 that	 enforcement	 titles	 issued	 in	 EU	 member	
states	are	eligible	for	certification	as	European	Enforcement	Orders.

 Box	4:	Which	Claims	Are	Uncontested?	

 Article	3	of	Regulation	(EC)	No	805/2004	defines	the	situations	in	which	a	claim	may	be	considered	
 uncontested.	These	are:	
 (a)	the	debtor	has	expressly	agreed	to	it	by	admission	or	by	means	of	a	settlement	which	has	been	
 approved	by	a	court	or	concluded	before	a	court	in	the	course	of	proceedings;	or	
 (b)	the	debtor	has	never	objected	to	it,	in	compliance	with	the	relevant	procedural			requirements	
 under	the	law	of	the	Member	State	of	origin,	in	the	course	of	the	court	proceedings;	or	
 (c)	the	debtor	has	not	appeared	or	been	represented	at	a	court	hearing	regarding	that	claim	after	
 having	initially	objected	to	the	claim	in	the	course	of	the	court	proceedings,	provided	that	such	
 conduct	amounts	to	a	tacit	admission	of	the	claim	or	of	the	facts	alleged	by	the	creditor	under	the	
 law	of	the	Member	State	of	origin;	or	
 (d)	the	debtor	has	expressly	agreed	to	it	in	an	authentic	instrument.


33.     Thus,	when	enforcing	unpaid	bills,	the	utility	company	initiates	the	procedure	based	
on	 the	 assumption	 that	 the	 debtor	 would	 not	 contest	 the	 claim.	 In	 the	 course	 of	 this	
procedure	the	claim	needs	to	meet	the	conditions	enumerated	above	in	order	to	qualify	for	
issuance	of	enforceable	title	for	uncontested	claims.			

5.	Stages	of	Enforcement		
34.      In	all	comparator	countries,	unpaid	utility	bills	are	not	directly	enforceable.	Therefore,	
the	procedure	for	enforcing	them	entails	two	distinct	stages:	first,	obtaining	an	enforceable	
title;	and	second,	execution	of	the	enforceable	title.		

35.     In	 all	 comparator	 countries,	 these	 stages	 of	 enforcement	 represent	 two	 distinct	
procedures	that	are	carried	out	by	different	authorities.	The	authority	competent	for	issuing	
an	enforceable	title	is	usually	a	court	or	a	notary,	whereas	the	responsibility	for	carrying	out	
execution	usually	lies	with	enforcement	agents.	Countries	rarely	combine	these	two	stages.	
Exceptionally,	in	Serbia	and	Montenegro	these	two	stages	are	combined	and	both	form	part	
of	a	single	enforcement	procedure	carried	out	by	an	enforcement	agent.	This	policy	decision	
is	questionable	for	several	reasons	that	will	be	discussed	later	on	in	this	analysis,	as	well	as	in	
the	examination	of	competent	authorities	in	comparator	countries.		

36.      Assignment	of	responsibility	for	issuance	of	an	enforceable	title	and	for	execution	to	
two	different	authorities	serves	several	purposes.	First,	when	the	authorities	are	different,	
the	 authority	 that	 issues	 the	 enforceable	 title	 is	 disinterested	 in	 the	 outcome	 of	 the	 case.	
Once	the	creditor	has	paid	the	fee	for	the	request,	the	decision	to	issue	or	not	an	enforceable	
title	 does	 not	 affect	 the	 competent	 authority’s	 future	 workload	 or	 income.	 Second,	 most	
comparator	 countries	 have	 procedures	 for	 issuance	 of	 enforceable	 titles	 that	 very	 quickly	
distinguish	contested	from	uncontested	claims	and	allow	the	latter	to	proceed	on	a	separate,	
fast	track.	If	claims	are	uncontested,	an	enforceable	title	is	issued.	If	claims	are	contested,	the	
enforcement	case	proceeds	as	a	litigious	claim.	Third,	specialization	of	competent	authorities	
is	more	easily	achieved	with	two	separate	procedures.	Finally,	when	the	two	stages	represent	
separate	 procedures,	 the	 first	 one	 is	 closed	 quickly	 and	 does	 not	 remain	 unduly	 pending	
because	of	difficulties	in	execution	unrelated	to	the	contestability	of	the	claim.		



                                                   8	
37.      Under	 the	 Serbian	 and	 Montenegrin	 systems,	 which	 bundle	 the	 two	 stages	 of	
enforcement	into	one,	one	of	the	reasons	for	the	heavy	caseload	is	the	non-joining	of	similar	
cases12.	In	principle,	there	are	economic	mechanisms	to	encourage	joining	of	cases,	one	of	
which	 is	 the	 advance	 fee	 paid	 by	 the	 creditor	 for	 every	 single	 small	 claim	 that	 would	 be	
enforced.	The	fee	is	usually	a	percentage	of	the	claim,	but	if	the	value	of	the	claim	is	small,	as	
is	 often	 the	 case	 with	 utility	 claims,	 the	 fee	 is	 a	 fixed	 minimum	 amount	 exceeding	 that	
percentage.	This	type	of	fee	structure	encourages	the	creditor	to	join	identical	claims	rather	
than	file	them	separately.		

38.     However,	when	enforceable	titles	for	utility	claims	are	issued	by	private	professionals	
who	also	carry	out	their	execution,	some	of	these	professionals	seek	to	attract	large	creditors	
by	proposing	economic	incentives,	which	may	discourage	joining	of	claims.	Examples	of	such	
incentives	would	be	allowing	the	creditor	not	to	pay	fees	in	advance	or	providing	a	discount	
on	fee	payment.	In	this	situation,	utility	companies	would	have	no	incentive	to	join	claims.	On	
the	contrary,	both	the	utility	company	and	the	private	enforcement	agent	may	be	incentivized	
to	enforce	a	large	number	of	identical	small	claims	rather	than	one	large	claim	since	upon	
successful	execution,	the	debtor	would	have	to	pay	higher	fees	and/or	legal	costs.	There	is	no	
such	incentive	to	file	numerous	small	claims	separately	when	the	issuance	of	enforceable	title	
and	its	execution	are	two	separate	procedures	carried	out	by	different	authorities.		

6.	Types	of	Procedures	for	Obtaining	Enforceable	Title		
39.      There	 are	 two	 principal	 types	 of	 procedures	 used	 to	 obtain	 enforceable	 title	 on	
unpaid	utility	bills	in	the	comparator	countries:	first,	order	for	payment;	and	second,	issuance	
of	 writ	 of	 execution	 based	 on	 authentic	 document.	 While	 they	 differ	 in	 every	 comparator	
state,	they	are	based	on	common	characteristics.	The	main	feature	of	these	procedures	is	
that	they	are	designed	to	ensure	enforceability	of	 uncontested	claims.	Therefore,	they	are	
non-litigious	in	nature.		In	the	course	of	these	procedures,	the	competent	authority	examines	
the	request	of	the	creditor	and	makes	a	pronouncement	without	the	debtor’s	participation.	
The	examination	is	administrative	in	nature,	regardless	of	whether	the	competent	authority	
is	judicial	or	not.		If	an	adversarial	element	appears	in	these	procedures,	such	as	a	debtor’s	
objection,	the	dispute	is	decided	in	a	separate	litigious	civil	case.		




12
  	The	term	“similar	cases”	as	used	here	shall	mean	cases	including	the	same	creditor,	the	same	debtor	and	
the	same	type	of	debt,	i.e.	cases	that	under	the	relevant	procedural	laws	could	be	joined	but	the	creditor	has	
chosen	to	file	them	separately.

40.     The	 Order	for	Payment	 procedure	is	used	for	obtaining	enforceable	titles	for	utility	
claims	in	most	comparator	countries.	It	is	also	widely	available	in	most	EU	member	states.	
This	 procedure	 is	 designed	 to	 ensure	 a	 quick	 and	 inexpensive	 path	 for	 obtaining	 an	
enforceable	 title	 for	 a	 broad	 array	 of	 uncontested	 monetary	 claims.	 In	 some	 of	 the	
comparator	countries	(Estonia,	Bulgaria,	Poland,	Czech	Republic),	there	is	a	cap	on	the	value	
of	the	claim;	in	others	(Lithuania,	Romania,	Slovakia),	the	amount	of	the	claim	is	irrelevant.	
In	Hungary,	the	value	cap	for	the	use	of	the	procedure	is	so	high	(EUR	1.33	million)	that	it	has	
no	effect	on	the	enforcement	of	utility	bills	(for	practical	purposes,	Figure	2	shows	Hungary	
as	 having	 no	 value	 cap	 for	 the	 initiation	 of	 the	 procedure).	 Another	 peculiarity	 of	 the	
Hungarian	system	is	that	for	monetary	claims	with	a	value	of	up	to	approximately	EUR	3,300,	
the	use	of	the	order	for	payment	procedure	is	mandatory13.

  	The	mandatory	use	of	the	procedure	in	Hungary	means	that	for	a	claim	with	a	value	under	EUR	3,300	the	
uncontested	claims	route	would	have	to	be	tried	first	even	if	the	creditor	believes	that	that	there	would	be	an	
objection	on	the	part	of	the	debtor	and	the	case	would	anyway	need	to	proceed	to	a	full-blown	civil	case).

41.       Creditors	file	a	standardized	request	to	initiate	an	order	for	payment	procedure.	The	
request	is	examined	by	the	competent	authority	and	if	it	meets	all	formal	requirements,	a	
payment	order	is	issued.	Normally,	the	debtor	has	a	short	period	of	time	to	object	following	
the	 service	 of	 the	 order.	 If	 no	 objection	 is	 filed,	 the	 payment	 order	 becomes	 final14	 and	
triggers	the	issuance	of	an	enforceable	title	(or	the	final	order	itself	represents	an	enforceable	
title).	If	an	objection	is	filed,	this	procedure	is	stayed	or	aborted	and	the	claim	converts	to	a	
litigious	civil	case.	Thus,	in	a	typical	order	for	payment	process	there	should	be	no	litigious	
element	 at	 all.	 Any	 objections	 would	 take	 the	 case	 outside	 of	 the	 order	 for	 payment	
procedure	and	would	initiate	a	new	civil	case.	In	some	comparator	countries,	an	objection	
would	 automatically	 transform	 the	 case	 into	 a	 litigious	 one	 (Poland,	 Croatia).	 In	 others,	
following	an	objection,	the	creditor	would	have	to	decide	whether	to	initiate	a	litigious	case	
or	not	within	short	timelines	after	the	objection	 (Bulgaria,	Estonia).	The	latter	arrangement	
where	the	creditor	needs	to	actively	pursue	a	litigious	case	following	an	objection	contributes	
to	a	policy	of	discouraging	litigious	cases	and	allows	creditors	more	flexibility	in	managing	
their	costs	and	procedural	behavior.		

42.      The	procedure	for	issuance	of	a	writ	based	on	authentic	document	is	currently	used	
for	utility	bills	only	in	those	comparator	countries	that	formed	part	of	the	former	Yugoslavia.15	
It	bears	many	similarities	to	the	Order	for	Payment	procedure	but	is	narrower	in	scope.	It	
generally	applies	to	utility	bills,	bills	of	exchange,	checks,	public	documents,	business	records	
excerpts,	legally	certified	private	documents	and	documents	considered	by	law	as	public.	In	
jurisdictions	where	the	issuance	of	a	writ	based	on	authentic	document	is	the	only16	type	of	
expedited	procedure	for	obtaining	an	enforceable	title	for	uncontested	claims,	there	may	
be	 a	 large	 number	 of	 pecuniary	 claims	 which,	 although	 uncontested,	 are	 not	 based	 on	 an	
authentic	document.	In	the	absence	of	an	order	for	payment	procedure,	enforceable	titles	
for	such	claims	should	be	obtained	through	the	standard	civil	cases	track.	This	may	present	
an	 unnecessary	 burden	 for	 the	 court	 system,	 which	 would	 have	 to	 engage	 in	 expensive	
litigious	proceedings	for	a	case	that	may	have	been	resolved	in	a	non-litigious	fashion.		

43.      The	scale	of	the	difference	in	scope	between	the	authentic	documents	procedure	and	
the	 order	 for	 payment	 procedure	 can	 be	 illustrated	 with	 an	 example	 of	 Bulgarian	 court	
statistics.	Before	the	introduction	of	the	order	for	payment	procedure,	Bulgarian	law	provided	
only	 for	 issuance	 of	 a	 writ	 based	 on	 authentic	 document	 (a	 procedure	 which	 at	 that	 time	
applied	also	to	utility	providers).	According	to	court	statistics,	the	procedure	for	issuance	of	a	
writ	 based	 on	 an	 authentic	 document	 accounted	 for	 approximately	 20	 percent	 of	 civil	
proceedings	 in	 first-instance	 courts	 in	 2006.17	 The	 introduction	 of	 the	 order	 for	 payment	

14
  	In	most	comparator	countries,	the	authority	issues	the	order	for	payment	and	in	case	of	absence	of	
objection	it	becomes	final.	In	other	comparator	countries	(e.g.	Estonia),	the	authority	issues	a	proposal	for	the	
order	for	payment	and	in	case	of	absence	of	objection	issues	the	order	for	payment	itself.	These	differences	
are	purely	technical	and	do	not	change	the	nature	of	the	procedure.		
15
 	Other	countries	(e.g.	Bulgaria)	also	have	an	expedited	procedure	for	authentic	documents	(Based	on	Art	417	
of	Bulgaria’s	Civil	Procedure	Code);	however,	it	does	not	apply	to	utility	bills.		
16
  	For	example,	in	Slovenia	utility	bills	are	enforced	through	the	authentic	documents	track;	however,	Slovenia	
also	has	a	standard	order	for	payment	procedure	for	other	uncontested	claims,	e.g.	issuance	of	writ	based	on	
authentic	document	is	not	the	only	type	of	expedited	procedure	for	obtaining	an	enforceable	title	for	
uncontested	claims.		
17
 	Detailed	court	statistics	since	2005	are	available	on	the	homepage	of	Bulgaria’s	Supreme	Judicial	Council	at	
http://www.vss.justice.bg/page/view/1082.

procedure,	and	the	consequent	expansion	of	the	categories	of	cases	eligible	for	expedited	
enforceable	title	to	all	pecuniary	claims	under	a	certain	threshold,	led	to	a	significant	increase	
of	the	share	of	such	proceedings.	Currently,	orders	for	payment	account	for	over	50	percent	
of	 all	 civil	 proceedings	 in	 Bulgarian	 first-instance	 courts.	 	 Clearly,	 the	 scope	 of	 order	 for	
payment	 procedures	 vastly	 exceeds	 the	 scope	 of	 authentic	 title	 procedures,	 providing	 an	
inexpensive	fast-track	option	for	a	vast	number	of	cases	that	would	otherwise	be	excluded	
from	such	fast-track	review	and	would	need	to	use	the	standard	and	slower	track	for	litigious	
civil	cases.		

44.      The	fact	that	under	the	authentic	document	procedure	utility	bills	are	given	the	status	
of	 official	 (also	 referred	 to	 as	 authentic	 or	 trustworthy)	 documents	 even	 though	 utility	
companies	are	commercial	entities	(oftentimes	fully	or	partially	privately	owned),	may	create	
the	perception	of	a	preferential	treatment	of	utility	providers	as	opposed	to	other	economic	
operators	in	the	country.	From	this	perspective,	the	order	for	payment	procedure	is	more	
inclusive	 because	 all	 citizens	 and	 businesses	 can	 use	 it	 to	 seek	 enforceable	 titles	 for	 their	
pecuniary	claims.		

45.     As	 illustrated	 in	 Table	 1,	 two	 comparator	 countries,	 Romania	 and	 Slovakia,	 have	
procedures	in	place	that	bear	the	name	“order	for	payment”.	However,	they	lack	the	essential	
feature18	of	the	order	for	payment,	i.e.	they	are	not	necessarily	non-litigious.	Specifically,	in	
Romania,	the	procedure	often	entails	collecting	evidence	and	a	court	hearing,	to	which	the	
parties	are	summoned.	In	Slovakia,	when	approached	with	a	creditor’s	request,	judges	have	
discretion	 to	 decide	 whether	 the	 procedure	 would	 move	 through	 the	 expedited	 track	 or	
would	 represent	 a	 litigious	 civil	 case.	 Due	 to	 the	 possible	 litigious	 nature	 of	 the	 order	 for	
payment	 procedure	 in	 Romania	 and	 Slovakia,	 the	 procedures	 in	 these	 two	 countries	 are	
qualified	as	quasi-order	for	payment	procedures	for	the	purposes	of	this	study.		

46.      Another	exception	to	the	non-litigious	nature	of	requests	for	enforcement	of	utility	
claims	is	 Latvia,	where	utility	bills	are	generally	enforced	via	a	 standard	litigious	civil	case.	
Rules	 may	 be	 simplified	 when	 the	 value	 of	 the	 claim	 is	 below	 a	 certain	 threshold	 but	
proceedings	 are	 still	 much	 more	 complex	 and	 expensive	 than	 the	 generally	 non-litigious	
procedures	used	in	the	other	comparator	countries.	Interestingly,	utility	companies	in	Latvia	
tend	to	choose	the	litigious	procedural	route	despite	the	availability	of	a	“warning”	procedure	
that	 resembles	 the	 order	 for	 payment	 procedure.	 This	 may	 be	 due	 to	 lack	 of	 cost-
effectiveness	 in	 the	 design	 of	 the	 “warning”	 procedure.	 Latvian	 law	 also	 provides	 for	 a	
procedure	for	issuance	of	a	writ	of	execution	based	on	authentic	document.	However,	utility	
bills	are	not	considered	authentic	documents	in	Latvia.	

47.     Bulgaria’s	experience	adds	another	nuance	to	utility	companies’	choice	of	procedural	
route	for	enforcing	unpaid	bills.	Even	though	procedures	for	enforcing	uncontested	claims	
are	designed	to	be	inexpensive	and	quick,	they	may	be	prolonged	due	to	debtors’	objections	
or	to	court	overload	(especially	in	the	capital	city	of	Sofia).	Therefore,	a	few	utility	companies,	
as	well	as	mobile	phone	operators,	used	to	incorporate	arbitration	clauses	in	their	consumer	

18
  	The	view	of	the	non-litigious	nature	of	the	order	for	payment	as	an	essential	feature	of	the	procedure	is	
derived	from	the	characteristics	of	the	order	for	payment	process	per	Regulation	(EC)	No	1896/2006	—	
creating	a	European	order	for	payment	procedure,	which	is	designed	as	a	procedure	for	uncontested	claims	
only.	See	Preamble	of	Regulation	(EC)	No	1896/2006,	as	well	as	Article	1,	1	(a).		




                                                      12	
contracts	 selecting	 obscure	 courts	 of	 arbitration.	 Thus,	 instead	 of	 opting	 for	 the	 order	 for	
payment	procedure	with	the	general	courts,	creditors	would	initiate	a	litigious	case	with	the	
selected	court	of	arbitration.	These	courts’	impartiality	would	often	be	called	into	question.	
As	a	result,	in	January	2017	Bulgarian	legislators	prohibited	arbitration	clauses	in	consumer	
contracts.19		

48.      Overall,	orders	for	payment	organized	as	fully	non-litigious	procedures	are	the	most	
typical	way	of	enforcing	utility	bills	in	comparator	countries.	When	compared	with	procedures	
for	 issuance	 of	 a	 writ	 based	 on	 an	 authentic	 title,	 which	 are	 used	 in	 the	 Western	 Balkan	
countries,	order	for	payment	procedures	are	broader	in	scope	and	display	equal	treatment	
for	all	creditors,	without	assigning	a	special	status	to	utility	providers.		

7.	Authority	Competent	to	Issue	Enforceable	Titles	for	Uncontested	
Claims	
49.     As	discussed	above,	both	the	order	for	payment	and	the	issuance	of	writ	based	on	
authentic	document	procedures	are,	as	a	rule,	non-litigious	and	administrative	in	nature.	This	
poses	 the	 policy	 choice	 of	 selecting	 the	 authority	 which	 would	 be	 competent	 to	 carry	 out	
these	 procedures	 in	 a	 manner	 that	 is	 both	 cost-effective	 and	 protects	 citizens’	 rights.	
Comparator	 countries	 have	 assigned	 this	 responsibility	 either	 to	 first-instance	 courts	 or	 to	
notaries.

50.     As	illustrated	in	Table	2	above,	the	authority	for	issuing	enforceable	title	usually	rests	
with	the	court.	However,	given	the	administrative	nature	of	examining	uncontested	claims,	
some	 countries,	 where	 first-instance	 courts	 are	 the	 authorities	 competent	 to	 issue	 the	
enforceable	title,	have	made	an	effort	to	relieve	judges,	as	much	as	possible,	of	this	work.	
Thus,	the	E-court	in	Poland	issues	orders	for	payment	for	the	entire	country	but	engages	just	
8	judges	and	119	court	clerks	with	legal	education	(referendarz)	who	are	authorized	to	sign	
on	 the	 issuance	 of	 payment	 orders.	 Another	 example	 is	 the	 Central	 Department	 for	 the	
Authentic	 Document	 (hereinafter	 COVL)	 of	 the	 Local	 Court	 of	 Ljubljana,	 Slovenia,	 which	
employs	just	4	judges	and	62	support	personnel	and	issues	the	writs	based	on	authentic	title	
for	the	entire	country.	In	Estonia,	the	specialized	centralized	court	department	issuing	orders	


19
     	Amendment	to	Art.	19	of	Bulgaria’s	Civil	Procedure	Code	of	24	January	2017.		


                                                         13	
for	payment	for	the	entire	country	employs	only	4	assistant	judges	and	29	other	court	officers.	
In	other	words,	when	a	country	chooses	to	have	courts	be	the	competent	authority	to	issue	
enforceable	titles,	it	may	still	unburden	judges	of	this	type	of	work	and	assign	most	of	the	
responsibility	 to	 support	 personnel	 with	 legal	 education.	 All	 of	 these	 specialized	 court	
departments	work	solely	with	orders	for	payment	and	are	therefore	able	to	specialize	and	
streamline	processes.	The	efficiencies	of	these	departments	are	due	to	the	specialization	of	
staff	 and	 the	 ensuing	 streamlining	 of	 processes,	 as	 well	 as	 to	 the	 uniform	 distribution	 of	
workload	between	officials	ensured	by	centralization.		

51.    Notaries	have	been	assigned	responsibility	for	the	issuance	of	an	enforceable	title	in	
three	comparator	countries:	Hungary,	Croatia	and	FYR	Macedonia.	FYR	Macedonia	is	not	an	
EU	Member	state.	However,	with	regard	to	Hungary	and	Croatia,	it	is	important	to	explore	
the	compatibility	of	this	policy	choice	with	Regulation	(EC)	No	805/2004	as	this	analysis	does	
below.		

52.     In	defining	the	situations	in	which	a	claim	may	be	considered	uncontested,	Regulation	
(EC)	No	805/2004	makes	repeated	reference	to	“court”	and	“court	proceedings”.	Additionally,	
Article	4,	para	7	of	the	Regulation	explicitly	notes	that	 “in	 Sweden,	in	summary	proceedings	
concerning	 orders	 to	 pay	 (betalningsföreläggande),	 the	 expression	 ‘court'	 includes	 the	
Swedish	enforcement	service	(kronofogdemyndighet)”.	Regulation	(EU)	No	1215/2012	of	the	
European	 Parliament	 and	 of	 the	 Council	 of	 12	 December	 2012	 on	 jurisdiction	 and	 the	
recognition	 and	 enforcement	 of	 judgments	 in	 civil	 and	 commercial	 matters	 extends	 this	
exception	 by	 adding	 Hungarian	 notaries	 to	 it	 in	 Article	 3:	 “in	 Hungary,	 in	 summary	
proceedings	concerning	orders	to	pay	(fizetési	meghagyásos	eljárás),	the	notary	(közjegyző).”		

53.     Given	the	explicit	exceptions	for	Sweden	and	Hungary,	Croatia	has	enquired	with	the	
Court	of	Justice	of	the	European	Union	whether	its	notaries	could	be	regarded	as	courts	for	
the	purposes	of	issuing	enforceable	writs	of	execution	based	on	authentic	documents.20	The	
case	is	undecided	at	the	time	of	publication	of	this	report.	However,	in	September	2016	the	
Advocate	 General	 issued	 his	 opinion	 on	 the	 matter:	 if	 a	 writ	 of	 execution	 is	 to	 satisfy	 the	
criteria	 for	 certification	 as	 a	 European	 Enforcement	 Order,	 it	 could	 be	 issued	 by	 a	 notary	
provided	 there	 had	 been	 guarantees	 as	 to	 the	 notary’s	 independence	 and	 impartiality.	 It	
remains	 to	 be	 seen	 whether	 the	 Court	 of	 Justice	 of	 the	 European	 Union	 will	 accept	 the	
Advocate	General’s	view	and	recognize	Member	States’	authority	to	decide	which	authorities	
are	independent	and	impartial	or	whether	specific	exclusions	would	be	required,	similar	to	
those	regarding	Sweden	and	Hungary,	in	order	to	allow	authorities	other	than	courts	to	issue	
certifiable	enforceable	titles.		

54.      The	 above	 discussion	 of	 EU	 rules	 raises	 questions	 as	 to	 the	 compatibility	 with	 EU	
legislation	of	the	current	Serbian	and	Montenegrin	procedures,	where	the	enforcement	agent	
both	issues	the	enforceable	title	and	executes	it.	The	assignment	of	both	functions	to	a	single,	
private	professional	calls	into	question	the	independence	and	impartiality	of	the	enforcement	
agent.	 When	 enforcement	 agents	 are	 private	 entities,	 they	 may	 have	 a	 direct	 commercial	
interest	in	issuing	an	enforceable	title	because	they	would	also	be	executing	it.	Currently,	the	
only	EU	member	state	where	these	two	functions	are	performed	by	the	same	authority	is	

20
 	In	a	Request	for	a	preliminary	ruling	from	the	Općinski	sud	u	Novom	Zagrebu	(Croatia)	lodged	on	11	
September	2015	—	Ibrica	Zulfikarpašić	v	Slaven	Gajer	(Case	C-484/15).	See	http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62015CN0484&from=EN.		


                                                     14	
Sweden.	The	Swedish	Enforcement	Authority	is	responsible	both	for	issuing	the	enforceable	
title	and	for	executing	it.	However,	the	Enforcement	Authority	in	Sweden	is	a	governmental	
agency,	 therefore	 it	 is	 quite	 different	 from	 an	 enforcement	 agent	 who	 acts	 as	 a	 private	
entrepreneur,	as	is	the	case	in	Serbia	and	Montenegro.		

55.      Interestingly,	in	2003,	 Croatia	attempted	to	assign	both	the	issuance	of	enforceable	
titles	 and	 the	 execution	 of	 monetary	 claims	 to	 notaries	 through	 legislative	 amendments.	
These	provisions	were	never	implemented	and	were	repealed	in	2004	due	to	concerns	that	
they	contradicted	the	right	to	fair	trial	under	the	European	Convention	on	Human	Rights.		

56.      It	 can	 be	 concluded	 that	 the	 option	 most	 countries	 have	 chosen	 is	 to	 assign	
responsibility	for	issuance	of	enforceable	titles	in	uncontested	claims	to	courts.	Nevertheless,	
countries	 that	 have	 assigned	 this	 responsibility	 to	 notaries	 do	 not	 face	 any	 particular	
difficulties	either.	The	expected	pronouncement	of	the	Court	of	Justice	of	the	European	Union	
in	Case	C-484/15	will	determine	whether	the	issuance	of	enforceable	titles	by	notaries	would	
need	 to	 be	 addressed	 by	 a	 specific	 exception	 in	 the	 EU	 legislation,	 if	 such	 titles	 are	 to	 be	
certifiable	 as	 European	 Enforcement	 Orders	 under	 the	 relevant	 rules	 of	 EU	 law.	 While	
enforceable	titles	for	utility	claims	would	normally	not	need	to	be	enforced	in	countries	other	
than	the	jurisdiction	issuing	the	title,	ensuring	compliance	with	EU	law	is	important	for	two	
reasons.	First,	EU	instruments	set	minimal	standards	for	the	fairness	of	uncontested	claims	
procedures,	which	need	to	be	present	even	if	no	enforcement	abroad	would	be	necessary.	
Secondly,	as	discussed	above,	the	procedures	used	for	utility	bills’	claims	are	never	tailored	
solely	to	these	claims	but	are	applicable	to	a	much	broader	range	of	receivables.	As	such,	the	
enforceability	of	such	titles	on	the	EU	level	is	highly	desirable.		

8.	Territorial	Jurisdiction	
57.    Regarding	 the	 territorial	 jurisdiction	 of	 the	 competent	 authority	 for	 issuing	
enforceable	titles,	few	countries	have	opted	for	a	centralized	process	whereas	most	rely	on	
the	traditional	territorial	limits	of	jurisdiction.		

     Table	3:	Territorial	jurisdiction	                          Figure	4:	Territorial	jurisdiction

     Slovenia	                Centralized	                                                                 	
58.     Countries	where	competent	authorities	have	limited	territorial	jurisdiction	face	a	host	
of	problems,	including	unequal	workload	of	officials	deciding	requests	and,	as	a	consequence,	
significant	 regional	 differences	 in	 the	 timelines	 for	 deciding	 on	 creditors’	 requests.	 For	


                                                     15	
example,	in	Bulgaria,	first-instance	courts	in	small	towns	are	able	to	decide	on	a	request	for	
issuance	of	an	order	for	payment	within	the	three-day	timeline	prescribed	by	law.	In	larger	
urban	areas,	such	decisions	take	approximately	one	week	and	in	the	capital	city	Sofia,	where	
judges	are	overburdened,	up	to	six	months.	Similarly,	in	Slovakia	timelines	differ	significantly,	
with	the	courts	in	the	capital	city	of	Bratislava	considered	the	slowest.	A	centralized	system	
for	reviewing	creditors’	requests,	on	the	other	hand,	ensures	uniform	distribution	of	workload	
across	the	country,	as	well	as	uniform	practices	and	interpretation	of	the	law.	It	also	allows	
for	efficiencies	in	the	organization	of	work,	as	in	the	examples	of	the	E-court	in	Poland,	COVL	
in	Slovenia	and	the	Orders	for	Payment	Department	in	Estonia	where	such	work	is	performed	
predominantly	by	court	staff	with	legal	education.		

59.     In	three	of	the	four	centralized	systems	in	comparator	countries	(Poland,	Slovenia	and	
Estonia),	 the	 competent	 authority	 has	 been	 established	 as	 a	 division	 of	 an	 existing	 first-
instance	court.	Thus,	in	Poland,	the	E-court	is	a	civil	division	of	the	district	court	in	the	city	of	
Lublin;	in	Slovenia,	COVL	was	established	as	a	department	of	the	Local	Court	of	Ljubljana;	and	
in	 Estonia	 the	 payment	 order	 department	 is	 at	 the	 Haapsalu	 courthouse	 of	 Pärnu	 County	
Court.	Even	though	Slovakia’s	system	is	currently	not	centralized,	preparations	are	underway	
for	 the	 introduction	 of	 a	 centralized	 system	 similar	 to	 the	 Polish	 model,	 namely	 the	
introduction	of	a	specialized	electronic	court	(possibly	in	Banska	Bystrica),	which	would	have	
jurisdiction	throughout	the	country.		

60.     All	 centralized	 systems	 operate	 using	 a	 fully	 electronic	 platform	 for	 filing	 and	
processing	 creditors’	 requests,	 therefore	 there	 is	 no	 need	 for	 all	 officials	 who	 decide	 on	
requests	to	be	working	at	the	same	physical	location.	For	example,	the	Polish	E-court	engages	
50	 court	 clerks	 who	 are	 residing	 in	 Lublin	 and	 69	 court	 clerks	 who	 are	 outside	 of	 Lublin.	
Similarly,	 in	 Hungary,	 the	 centralized	 electronic	 system	 for	 filing	 creditors’	 requests	
distributes	them	evenly	to	all	notaries	in	the	country.	Thus,	a	notary	in	one	part	of	the	country	
may	 decide	 on	 a	 request	 from	 another	 part	 of	 the	 country.	 The	 system	 ensures	 uniform	
workload	and	the	location	of	the	official	is	irrelevant.		

61.    Based	 on	 the	 examination	 of	 the	 rules	 on	 the	 territorial	 jurisdiction	 of	 competent	
authorities,	it	can	be	concluded	that	centralized	systems	for	issuance	of	enforceable	titles	for	
uncontested	claims	generally	ensure	more	predictable	timelines,	equal	workload	for	officials	
and	opportunities	for	cost	savings.

9.	ICT	and	Possibilities	for	Electronic	Filing	
62.    To	ensure	quick	and	efficient	processing	of	requests	for	issuance	of	enforceable	titles,	
many	comparator	countries	have	introduced	a	dedicated	IT	system	for	filing	and	processing	
such	requests.

                                                                                    67%

     Slovakia	                Yes		                               Electronic	filing	not	possible
 	
     Slovenia	                Yes		                                                                     	
63.     In	 comparator	 countries	 with	 centralized	 systems,	 the	 use	 of	 electronic	 filing	 is	 a	
mandatory	 requirement	 for	 creditors	 wishing	 to	 use	 this	 expedited	 procedure.	 	 A	 caveat	
needs	 to	 be	 made	 in	 respect	 of	 Hungary	 where	 electronic	 filing	 is	 mandatory	 for	 all	 legal	
entities	 and	 for	 all	 individuals	 represented	 by	 a	 lawyer.	 Private	 individuals	 who	 are	 not	
represented	by	a	lawyer	may	file	a	paper	application	personally	at	a	notary’s	office	but	this	is	
rare.	An	alternative,	paper-based	procedure	may	exist	but	it	is	generally	more	expensive	and	
slower	and	therefore	is	rarely	selected	by	creditors.	For	example,	in	 Poland,	the	fee	for	the	
centralized	and	electronic	procedure	with	the	E-court	is	1.25	percent	of	claim	value	whereas	
for	the	“paper”	procedure	with	regular	courts	it	amounts	to	5	percent	of	claim	value.	

64.      Comparator	 countries	 with	 non-centralized	 systems	 either	 have	 only	 paper-based	
filing	or	provide	creditors	with	a	choice	to	file	electronically.	In	these	cases,	the	procedure	is	
identical	 regardless	 of	 how	 filing	 was	 done,	 but	 there	 might	 be	 economic	 incentives	 for	
electronic	filing	(e.g.	reduced	fees).	For	example,	Lithuania	provides	a	25	percent	discount	for	
electronic	filing	and	charges	no	postal	fees	in	case	of	electronic	service.		

65.    Electronic	filing	facilitates	the	work	of	both	creditors	and	competent	authorities.	If	a	
country	 has	 the	 political	 will	 and	 the	 technical	 preparedness	 to	 make	 the	 electronic	 route	
mandatory	for	those	wishing	to	use	the	expedited	procedure	(e.g.	Poland,	Slovenia,	Hungary,	
Estonia),	these	efficiencies	can	be	multiplied.		

10.	Standardized	Forms	and	Need	to	Attach	Evidence	
66.     The	 duration	 of	 the	 process	 for	 deciding	 on	 a	 creditor’s	 request	 for	 issuance	 of	 an	
enforceable	title	depends	on	numerous	elements.	One	of	them	is	the	complexity	and	volume	
of	the	documents	that	the	competent	authority	would	have	to	examine	in	order	to	make	a	
decision.	To	facilitate	the	process	of	examination,	many	comparator	states	have	introduced,	
in	addition	to	electronic	filing,	standardized	forms.	The	layout	of	the	forms	is	usually	approved	


                                                   17	
by	 the	 Ministry	 of	 Justice.	 The	 use	 of	 such	 forms	 helps	 ensure	 that	 all	 legally	 required	
elements	 of	 the	 request	 will	 be	 present	 in	 order	 to	 be	 easily	 verifiable	 by	 the	 competent	
authority.	Additionally,	the	introduction	of	simple	forms	means	that	creditors	may	be	able	to	
file	such	requests	without	using	lawyers’	services.		

67.      In	addition,	in	many	countries,	filling	out	the	form	in	an	electronic	filing	system	or	on	
paper	is	sufficient	and	there	is	no	need	to	attach	any	evidence	to	the	request.	Evidence	should	
be	available	in	case	the	debtor	objects	and	the	case	proceeds	to	a	full	civil	dispute,	but	at	the	
stage	of	the	initial	request	for	enforceable	title	such	evidence	need	not	be	presented.	This	
feature	 of	 the	 procedure	 significantly	 simplifies	 and	 shortens	 the	 time	 that	 competent	
officials	need	to	give	to	the	request.

     Slovakia	              Yes		                                  Evidence	must	be	attached
 	
     Slovenia	              No		                                                                       	
68.     As	illustrated	in	Table	5,21	in	all	countries	with	centralized	authorities	responsible	for	
issuing	 enforceable	 titles,	 there	 is	 no	 requirement	 to	 attach	 evidence	 to	 the	 request.	 The	
same	 policy	 choice	 has	 been	 made	 also	 by	 some	 comparator	 countries	 that	 have	 de-
centralized	systems,	such	as	Bulgaria	and	Lithuania.		

11.	Court	and	Notary	Fees	
69.       The	fee	collected	by	the	competent	authority	in	the	procedure	for	issuing	enforceable	
title	 is	 an	 important	 instrument	 in	 managing	 creditors’	 and	 debtors’	 behavior.	 The	 first	
purpose	of	the	fee	is	to	cover	the	costs	for	the	operation	of	the	system.	Second,	the	fee	should	
serve	 as	 an	 incentive	 for	 creditors	 to	 choose	 the	 type	 of	 procedure	 that	 is	 the	 most	 cost-
efficient	for	them,	as	well	as	for	the	State.	This	is	why	the	fee	for	electronic	filing	may	be	lower	
than	for	paper	filing.	This	is	also	why	filing	for	an	expedited	procedure	is	usually	cheaper	than	
filing	a	civil	case.	The	fee	for	the	uncontested	claims	procedure	should	be	separate	from	the	
fee	for	the	standard	court	claim	that	would	be	instituted	in	case	of	objection	so	as	not	to	
encourage	frivolous	objections	to	the	enforceable	titles	by	debtors.	Thus,	in	the	example	of	
Romania,	where	the	examination	of	the	debtors’	objections	is	incorporated	in	the	procedure,	
the	debtor	has	no	incentive	to	refrain	from	objecting.	On	the	other	hand,	in	countries	where	

21
  	Most	of	the	data	on	the	need	to	attach	evidence	has	been	obtained	from	the	European	Judicial	Network	in	
Civil	and	commercial	matters	e-portal	at	https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_order_for_payment_procedures-
41-ee-en.do?member=1.		


                                                    18	
objections	 are	 examined	 in	 a	 separate	 court	 case,	 the	 debtor	 is	 generally	 aware	 that	 an	
ungrounded	objection	would	add	the	cost	for	the	civil	case	to	his/her	debt.		

70.      Figure	7	below	illustrates	the	approximate	level	of	fees	for	obtaining	an	enforceable	
title	for	unpaid	utility	bills	in	comparator	countries	for	claims	amounting	to	EUR	100,	EUR	500	
and	EUR	1000,	respectively.22

71.      Some	countries	encourage	creditors	to	use	the	procedure	for	uncontested	claims	by	
ensuring	that	in	the	case	of	objection,	the	total	fee	for	the	continuation	of	the	dispute	does	
not	exceed	the	fee	for	a	standard	civil	case.	This	also	serves	as	a	disincentive	for	frivolous	
objections	from	debtors.	Specifically,	in	such	countries	the	total	fee	due	if	the	creditor	choses	
to	 proceed	 directly	 with	 a	 litigious	 civil	 case	 is	 equal	 to	 the	 sum	 of	 the	 fee	 for	 obtaining	
enforceable	title	for	an	uncontested	claim	and	the	fee	for	the	civil	case	that	would	ensue	from	
a	potential	objection.	When	the	procedure	is	completed,	the	losing	party	bears	the	costs	for	
all	fees	that	have	been	paid	in	the	various	stages	of	the	procedure.	For	example,	in	Hungary	
the	court	fee	for	a	standard	civil	case	is	six	percent	of	the	claim,	while	the	fee	to	obtain	an	
order	for	payment	and	treat	the	pecuniary	claim	as	an	uncontested	one	is	only	three	percent.	
In	case	the	debtor	objects	to	the	order	for	payment	and	a	standard	civil	case	is	initiated,	an	
additional	three	percent	would	have	to	be	paid	in	order	to	reach	the	usual	six	percent	fee.	
Thus,	in	choosing	whether	to	object	to	the	order	for	payment	or	not,	the	debtor	would	be	
aware	that	an	ungrounded	objection	would	increase	his/her	future	expenses	(in	case	of	losing	
the	 case)	 by	 three	 percent	 of	 the	 claim.	 This	 may	 serve	 as	 a	 disincentive	 for	 frivolous	
objections.	Similarly,	Bulgaria	has	set	the	standard	civil	case	fee	to	four	percent	of	the	value	
of	the	claim	and	the	fees	for	a	payment	order	and	a	case	following	an	objection	to	two	percent	

22
  	To	ensure	comparability,	local	currencies	have	been	converted	to	Euro.	In	cases	of	different	fees	for	
electronic	and	paper	filing,	the	chart	reflects	the	fee	for	electronic	filing.	Fee	calculations	are	based	on	the	
assumption	that	the	debtor	would	not	object,	i.e.	only	the	cost	for	obtaining	an	enforceable	title	through	the	
uncontested	claims	procedure	has	been	factored	into	the	calculations,	without	the	cost	of	a	potential	
subsequent	civil	claim.	As	regards	Latvia,	the	graph	reflects	the	court	fee	for	a	standard	civil	claim	since	this	is	
the	avenue	most	frequently	used	for	enforcement	of	utility	bills.

of	claim	value	for	each.	Here,	again,	the	sum	of	the	two	fees	equals	the	fee	for	a	standard	
court	case.	In	Lithuania,	the	court	fee	for	an	order	for	payment	is	one	quarter	of	the	common	
court	fee	and	in	case	of	objection	the	remaining	three-quarters	of	that	fee	must	be	paid.	Such	
a	ratio	could	further	motivate	the	debtor	not	to	object	frivolously.	

12.	Duration	of	the	Procedure	for	Obtaining	Enforceable	Title	
72.    The	 expedited	 procedures	 for	 obtaining	 enforceable	 title	 for	 uncontested	 claims	
should	be	able	to	issue	the	enforceable	title	within	just	a	few	days	from	the	filing	of	a	claim23.		

73.     The	 information	 provided	 by	 national	 rapporteurs	 for	 the	 purposes	 of	 this	 analysis	
indicates	that	centralized	systems	are	able	to	ensure	more	predictability	of	timelines	and	are	
generally	speedier	than	decentralized	ones.	In	 Slovenia	and	Hungary,	where	the	filing	and	
processing	 of	 requests	 is	 centralized	 and	 electronic,	 the	 time	 period	 between	 filing	 and	
issuance	is	up	to	three	days.	In	 Estonia	and	Poland,	which	also	have	centralized	electronic	
systems,	the	time	period	is	approximately	10	days.	Short	processing	times	of	just	a	few	days	
are	also	reported	in	Lithuania	and	FYR	Macedonia	where	the	systems	are	not	centralized.	On	
the	other	hand,	in	other	comparator	countries	timelines	are	less	predictable.	As	discussed	
above,	in	Bulgaria	and	Slovakia	they	vary	largely	between	courts	and	may	stretch	to	several	
months	in	capital	cities.	In	Romania,	if	the	claim	is	uncontested,	the	maximum	timeline	is	45	
days,	 however,	 if	 an	 objection	 is	 filed	 the	 litigious	 nature	 of	 the	 procedure	 may	 lead	 to	
significant	delays.	In	Latvia,	the	civil	claim	procedure	may	take	one-to-two	years.		

13.	Service	of	the	Enforceable	Title	to	the	Debtor	
74.     One	of	the	most	important	elements	of	the	procedures	for	obtaining	enforceable	titles	
for	 uncontested	 claims	 is	 the	 service	 of	 the	 title	 to	 the	 debtor.	 Given	 the	 fact	 that	 the	
procedure	is	usually	document-based	and	non-litigious,	service	of	the	enforceable	title	to	the	
debtor	is	the	first	time	the	debtor	finds	out	about	the	claim	and	can	defend	himself/herself	
against	it.	In	many	jurisdictions,	this	is	also	the	last	moment	when	the	debtor	can	quickly	and	
effectively	carry	out	such	defense.	In	order	to	ensure	the	smooth	operation	of	the	process	for	
enforcing	 uncontested	 claims,	 legislators	 in	 most	 countries	 limit	 debtors’	 possibilities	 for	
defense	 at	 later	 stages	 of	 enforcement.	 Thus,	 if	 the	 debtor,	 after	 being	 served	 with	 the	
enforceable	title,	misses	the	deadline	for	filing	an	objection,	he	or	she	would	have	very	limited	
opportunities	for	defense	later	on.		

75.     Regulation	 (EC)	 No	 805/2004	 sets	 minimum	 standards	 for	 service	 of	 the	 document	
instituting	uncontested	claim	proceedings.	If	member	states	deviate	from	these	standards,	
the	resulting	document	cannot	be	certified	as	a	European	Enforcement	Order.	Naturally,	such	
certification	is	usually	not	needed	in	case	of	enforcing	utility	claims	because	they	are	normally	
enforced	within	the	territory	of	the	state.	Nevertheless,	the	minimum	standards	of	service	
set	an	important	benchmark	for	protecting	the	rights	of	the	debtor	in	such	procedures	and	
could	 be	 applied	 by	 countries	 even	 without	 particular	 concern	 as	 to	 the	 fitness	 of	 the	
document	to	be	certified	as	a	European	Enforcement	Order.	Regulation	(EC)	No	805/2004	


23
  	The	title	would	not	be	final	and	executable	at	that	stage,	it	would	become	executable	only	after	ascertaining	
that	the	debtor	does	not	object	to	it	within	the	specified	timelines.	


                                                      20	
allows	for	service	by	any	type	of	competent	authority,	as	well	as	service	by	postal	service	and	
by	electronic	means,	as	long	as	these	are	verifiable.	

76.      Service	of	legal	documents	in	comparator	countries	is	carried	out	by	different	entities.	
Where	parties	to	a	case	have	given	prior	consent,	e-service	may	be	used.	In	utility	claims,	
though,	 it	 is	 usually	 necessary	 to	 perform	 physical	 service	 of	 the	 legal	 document	 to	 the	
premises	of	the	debtor.	While	such	service	is	always	organized	by	the	authority	issuing	the	
enforceable	title,	its	physical	implementation	need	not	necessarily	be	done	by	that	authority	
(i.e.	by	court	or	notary	officials).	It	is	often	more	cost-efficient	to	assign	physical	service	to	
postal	services	or	couriers.		 Bulgaria	maintains	a	large	body	of	dedicated	court	employees	
who	serve	legal	documents.	In	 FYR	Macedonia,	service	is	carried	out	by	notary	employees.	
On	the	other	hand,	in	most	comparator	countries	(e.g.	Estonia,	Lithuania,	Hungary,	Poland,	
Romania,	Czech	Republic,	Slovakia)	courts	and	notaries	send	legal	notices	via	registered	mail.

     Box	5:	The	Automated	Postal	Dispatch	System	in	Slovenia

     automated	postal	dispatch	system	has	been	created	under	COVL	and	outsourced	to	a	contractor.	
     The	contractor	accepts	documents	from	the	court	in	e-form,	prints,	collects	and	folds	them,	prints	
     data	on	envelopes,	mechanically	inserts	documents	in	the	matching	envelopes	(using	bar	code	for	
     pairing),	controls	the	quality	of	outgoing	mail,	creates	a	post	ledger	for	all	mail	that	is	submitted	to	
     the	Post	Office,	and	delivers	the	post	to	the	Post	Office.24

78.     The	minimum	standards	for	service	to	the	debtor	under	Regulation	(EC)	No	805/2004	
are	quite	broad	and	cover	the	two	principal	methods:	 service	with	proof	of	receipt	by	the	
debtor	and	service	without	proof	of	receipt	by	the	debtor.	Methods	of	service	without	proof	
of	 receipt	 by	 the	 debtor	 are	 particularly	 important	 because	 in	 procedures	 for	 obtaining	
enforceable	 titles	 debtors	 are	 often	 perceived	 to	 be	 actively	 avoiding	 personal	 service.	
Additionally,	 in	 a	 few	 of	 the	 comparator	 states	 the	 methods	 for	 service	 without	 proof	 of	
receipt	 by	 the	 debtor	 were	 one	 of	 the	 most	 frequent	 grounds	 for	 protests	 against	
enforcement	 of	 utility	 bills.	 Therefore,	 it	 is	 important	 for	 these	 types	 of	 methods	 to	 meet	
certain	minimum	standards	so	as	to	have	wider	acceptance	by	society.		

 Box	6:	EU	Rules	on	Service	without	Proof	of	Receipt	
 	
 According	to	Regulation	(EC)	No	805/2004,	for	service	without	proof	of	receipt	to	be	admissible,	
 the	debtor’s	address	needs	to	be	known	with	certainty,	and	a	wide	array	of	methods	is	admissible	
 under	Article	14	of	the	Regulation:		
 	
 (a)	 personal	 service	 at	 the	 debtor's	 personal	 address	 on	 persons	 who	 are	 living	 in	 the	 same	
 household	as	the	debtor	or	are	employed	there;	
 (b)	 in	 the	 case	 of	 a	 self-employed	 debtor	 or	 a	 legal	 person,	 personal	 service	 at	 the	 debtor's				
 business	premises	on	persons	who	are	employed	by	the	debtor;	
 (c)	deposit	of	the	document	in	the	debtor's	mailbox;	
 (d)	deposit	of	the	document	at	a	post	office	or	with	competent	public	authorities	and	the	placing	
 in	 the	 debtor's	 mailbox	 of	 written	 notification	 of	 that	 deposit,	 provided	 that	 the	 	 	 written	
 notification	clearly	states	the	character	of	the	document	as	a	court	document	or	the	legal	effect	of	
 the	notification	as	effecting	service	and	setting	in	motion	the	running	of	time	for	the	purposes	of	
 time	limits;	
 (e)	postal	service	without	proof	pursuant	to	paragraph	3	where	the	debtor	has	his	address	in	the	
 Member	State	of	origin;	
 (f)	electronic	means	attested	by	an	automatic	confirmation	of	delivery,	provided	that	the			debtor	
 has	expressly	accepted	this	method	of	service	in	advance.	
 	
 Service	pursuant	to	(a)	to	(d)	above	shall	be	attested	by:	
 (a)	a	document	signed	by	the	competent	person	who	effected	the	service,	indicating:	
 (i)	the	method	of	service	used;	and	
 (ii)	the	date	of	service;	and	
 (iii)	where	the	document	has	been	served	on	a	person	other	than	the	debtor,	the	name	of	that	
 person	and	his	relation	to	the	debtor,	or	
 b)	an	acknowledgement	of	receipt	by	the	person	served,	for	the	purposes	of	paragraphs	1(a)	and	
 (b).	


79.     Comparator	 countries	 have	 opted	 for	 a	 number	 of	 different	 solutions	 for	 service	
without	proof	of	receipt.	For	example,	in	Hungary	the	Order	for	Payment	is	sent	to	the	debtor	
via	registered	mail	and	in	case	the	debtor	is	not	found	at	the	address,	the	postal	service	leaves	
a	notice	inviting	him/her	to	collect	the	registered	mail.	If	the	debtor	does	not	respond	to	the	
notice,	the	documents	are	presumed	to	have	been	delivered	on	the	fifth	day	following	the	
second	attempt	to	deliver	the	document	by	the	Hungarian	mail	service	(typically	after	10-14	
business	days).	In	 Bulgaria,	service	is	carried	out	by	a	category	of	court	clerks.	If	the	debtor	
cannot	be	found	at	the	address,	the	court	notice	can	be	glued	on	the	entrance	door.	In	case	
the	debtor	does	not	obtain	the	documents	personally	from	the	authority	within	two	weeks	


                                                      22	
of	gluing	the	notice,	the	documents	are	considered	served.	In	 FYR	Macedonia,	notices	that	
cannot	be	delivered	are	published	on	the	court	bulletin.	In	Poland,	there	is	no	verification	of	
whether	the	letter	actually	reached	the	debtor	as	there	is	a	presumption	that	it	did.	The	E-
court	usually	issues	a	writ	if	it	has	not	received	an	objection	within	a	month	of	sending	the	
Order	for	Payment	to	the	debtor.		

80.     Estonia	is	an	exception	because	it	does	not	allow	service	without	proof	of	receipt	in	
the	case	of	Orders	for	Payment.	If	service	to	the	debtor	has	proven	impossible,	the	payment	
order	procedure	is	terminated	and	a	litigious	civil	case	must	be	initiated	in	order	to	enforce	
the	claim.		

81.      In	some	comparator	countries	service	is	viewed	as	problematic	both	for	creditors	and	
for	debtors.	Creditors	complain	that	debtors	actively	avoid	service;	meanwhile,	debtors	argue	
that	service	without	proof	of	receipt	means	that	execution	could	start	without	the	debtor’s	
knowledge.	 One	 way	 to	 minimize	 such	 controversies	 is	 by	 introducing	 clear	 rules	 that	
determine	 the	 address	 for	 legal	 notices	 as	 regards	 natural	 persons.	 For	 example,	 in	 some	
comparator	countries,	addresses	where	natural	persons	have	their	registration	are	obsolete	
or	the	rules	of	service	are	not	unequivocal	as	regards	address	for	service.	As	a	result,	service	
to	 various	 addresses	 is	 attempted,	 time-periods	 for	 service	 are	 lengthy	 and	 objections	 for	
improper	service	are	frequent.	Other	comparator	countries	appear	to	have	clearer	rules	and	
less	 problematic	 service.	 For	 example,	 the	 2003	 Declaration	 of	 Place	 of	 Residence	 Law	 of	
Latvia	obligated	every	citizen	to	register	an	address	where	he	or	she	would	be	reachable	in	
terms	of	legal	relations	with	the	state	or	local	government.25	When	such	an	address	is	not	
registered,	the	law	puts	into	place	certain	assumptions	that	facilitate	service.		In	 Hungary,	
there	are	similar	rules	in	place.			

82.    Service	of	enforceable	titles	to	debtors	is	critical	both	for	the	efficiency	of	the	entire	
procedure	 and	 for	 its	 acceptance	 by	 society.	 Therefore,	 service	 should	 be	 organized	 in	 a	
manner	that	is	both	effective	and	cognizant	of	citizens’	right	to	fair	trial.	Special	attention	
should	be	given	to	the	methods	of	service	without	proof	of	receipt	by	the	debtor	since	those	
methods	 most	 frequently	 give	 rise	 to	 public	 discontent	 and	 perceptions	 of	 violations	 of	
debtors’	rights.		

14.	Objections	to	Enforceable	Titles	
83.    An	important	element	of	the	enforcement	of	uncontested	claims	is	the	rule	that	the	
enforceable	title	enters	into	force	 if	the	debtor	does	not	object.	In	case	the	debtor	objects,	
most	systems	institute	a	new,	litigious	civil	case	to	solve	the	dispute	between	the	parties.		

14.1.	Forms	of	Absence	of	Objection		

84.    The	 absence	 of	 objection	 is	 an	 important	 precondition	 for	 entry	 into	 force	 of	
enforceable	 titles	 in	 procedures	 for	 uncontested	 claims.	 Paragraph	 (6)	 of	 the	 Preamble	 of	
Regulation	(EC)	No	805/2004	outlines	the	two	most	typical	forms	of	absence	of	objection:	(1)	
“default	of	appearance	at	a	court	hearing”	or	(2)	“failure	to	comply	with	an	invitation	by	the	


25
 	Declaration	of	Place	of	Residence	Law,	2003	at	
http://www.vvc.gov.lv/export/sites/default/docs/LRTA/Likumi/Declaration_of_Place_of_Residence_Law.pdf.		


                                                   23	
court	to	give	written	notice	of	an	intention	to	defend	the	case”.	In	most	comparator	countries,	
the	absence	of	objection	takes	the	form	of	failure	to	comply	with	an	invitation	by	the	court	
(or	the	notary,	where	applicable)	to	give	written	notice	of	an	intention	to	defend	the	case.	In	
other	 words,	 if	 the	 debtor	 is	 served	 with	 the	 enforceable	 title	 and	 he/she	 does	 not	 react	
within	 a	 legally	 stipulated	 time-period,	 the	 enforceable	 title	 becomes	 effective.	 Very	 few	
comparator	 countries	 provide	 for	 a	 court	 hearing	 as	 part	 of	 the	 procedure	 for	 enforcing	
uncontested	claims.	One	such	country	is	Romania,	which	provides	for	a	possibility	of	a	court	
hearing	and	collection	of	evidence	in	the	framework	of	the	order	for	payment	case.		

85.     Another	 interesting	 example	 is	 Latvia,	 where	 the	 “warning”	 procedure	 for	
uncontested	 claims	 deviates	 from	 the	 two	 forms	 of	 absence	 of	 objection	 as	 described	 in	
Regulation	(EC)	No	805/2004.	Specifically,	in	the	framework	of	the	“warning”	procedure	in	
Latvia,	the	lack	of	reaction	by	the	debtor	means	that	the	enforceable	title	cannot	become	
effective	(i.e.	unlike	other	countries	Latvia	treats	silence	as	an	objection).	The	only	manner	in	
which	an	enforceable	title	issued	in	the	framework	of	this	procedure	could	become	effective	
is	upon	the	explicit	acceptance	by	the	debtor	of	the	claim.	This	is	probably	one	of	the	reasons	
why	the	warning	procedure	in	Latvia	is	used	very	rarely	and	is	not	the	procedure	of	choice	for	
enforcing	utility	bills.		

14.2.	Forms	of	Objection	

86.      Given	the	simplified	and	non-litigious	procedure	through	which	creditors	can	obtain	
enforceable	titles,	it	is	important	to	provide	debtors	with	equally	easy	avenues	for	objection.	
In	 most	 comparator	 countries	 objection	 does	 not	 require	 the	 debtor	 to	 provide	 any	
justification.	A	simple	“I	object”	is	usually	sufficient	grounds	for	preventing	the	title’s	entry	
into	force.	It	is	also	possible	to	provide	the	debtor	with	a	form	for	filing	the	objection	together	
with	the	service	of	the	enforceable	title	(e.g.	in	Bulgaria).		

87.      An	 important	 detail	 of	 the	 procedure	 for	 objection	 to	 the	 enforceable	 title	 is	 the	
possibility	for	 partial	objection.	The	debtor	may	accept	part	of	the	claim	and	disagree	with	
another	part	of	it	(e.g.	the	debtor	may	consider	that	interest	is	not	due	or	is	not	calculated	
correctly	or	that	the	statute	of	limitations	has	expired	for	part	of	the	amount	under	the	claim).	
In	such	circumstances,	it	is	useful	for	the	debtor	to	be	able	to	make	a	partial	objection.	If	
partial	objection	is	admissible,	the	creditor	and/or	the	debtor	would	be	able	to	reduce	the	
court	fee	for	a	potential	future	civil	claim	because	it	would	not	be	on	the	full	amount	of	the	
initial	enforceable	title	but	just	on	the	contested	part.	Additionally,	the	creditor	may	accept	a	
partial	objection	and	choose	not	to	sue	for	the	remainder	of	the	amount.	Most	comparator	
countries	allow	partial	objections.		

88.    On	 the	 other	 hand,	 partial	 objections	 require	 higher	 processing	 times	 than	 full	
objections.	Therefore,	some	countries	do	not	allow	such	objections.	For	example,	in	 Poland	
and	Bulgaria,	debtors	can	either	accept	the	claim	as	a	whole	or	be	ready	to	be	sued	and	pay	
additional	expenses	for	the	entire	amount.			

                                 	




                                                  24	
14.3.	Frivolous	Objections	

89.      Given	 the	 simplicity	 of	 objecting	 to	 an	 enforceable	 title,	 some	 debtors	 may	 do	 so	
mechanically	even	though	they	may	not	have	any	arguments	to	present	in	a	future	litigious	
case.	If	such	frivolous	objections	are	frequent,	they	would	burden	the	court	system	with	the	
ensuing	civil	cases.	Additionally,	frivolous	objections	would	add	to	the	debt	court	and	lawyer’s	
fees	for	a	full-blown	civil	case	thus	causing	costs	to	increase	exponentially.	By	the	time	such	
debts	go	through	all	the	stages	of	their	enforcement	(uncontested	claims	procedure,	litigious	
civil	case,	execution),	they	usually	exceed	many	times	their	initial	amount.	This	may	create	
financial	hardships	and	a	sense	of	social	injustice	among	debtors	that	do	not	understand	why	
the	debt	has	increased.	For	these	reasons,	frivolous	objections	are	undesirable	and	countries	
should	design	policy	responses	to	discourage	them.		

90.    In	 order	 to	 design	 a	 policy	 response	 to	 frivolous	 objections,	 countries	 should	 first	
quantify	 the	 scale	 of	 objections	 to	 enforceable	 titles	 obtained	 through	 procedures	 for	
uncontested	claims.	Even	though	it	is	not	particularly	challenging	to	statistically	measure	the	
number	 of	 civil	 cases	 that	 were	 launched	 as	 a	 consequence	 of	 an	 objection,	 few	 of	 the	
comparator	countries	have	such	statistics.	 Slovenia,	for	example,	collects	such	information	
and	 reports	 that	 debtors	 object	 in	 approximately	 11	 percent	 of	 cases.26	 In	 Hungary,	 the	
percentage	of	objections	is	a	little	under	7	percent	(e.g.	in	2013,	6.81	percent	of	claims	were	
objected	against.)27	In	Estonia,	debtors	object	in	approximately	10	percent	of	cases28.		

91.      Knowledge	 of	 the	 percentage	 of	 enforceable	 titles	 that	 are	 objected	 to	 each	 year	
allows	to	evaluate	the	efficiency	of	the	uncontested	claims	procedure	and	its	contribution	to	
the	 reduction	 in	 the	 number	 of	 litigious	 civil	 cases	 in	 the	 country.	 Also,	 if	 such	 statistics	
establish	that	a	large	percentage	of	enforceable	titles	are	objected	to,	certain	measures	could	
be	taken	to	discourage	frivolous	objections.	Extensive	information	on	the	risks	of	increasing	
the	value	of	the	claim	in	case	of	frivolous	objections	should	be	made	available	to	debtors	so	
that	they	can	make	an	informed	decision	whether	to	object	or	not.	Allowing	partial	objections	
could	 also	 be	 an	 option	 for	 countries	 that	 currently	 prohibit	 them.	 Another	 option	 is	
introducing	a	fee	for	filing	the	objection.	For	example,	in	 Slovenia,	there	is	a	EUR	40	fee	for	
filing	an	objection.	In	Croatia,	filing	an	objection	launches	a	litigious	case	(i.e.	unlike	in	other	
jurisdictions,	the	creditor	does	not	need	to	make	a	decision	whether	to	defend	the	claim	that	
has	 been	 objected	 against;	 a	 debtor’s	 objection	 automatically	 launches	 the	 litigious	 case).		
Hence,	the	fee	for	filing	an	objection	in	Croatia	is	equivalent	to	the	fee	the	party	would	be	
obliged	to	pay	for	filing	any	litigious	case	and	is	dependent	on	the	value	of	the	dispute.	Fees	
for	filing	an	objection	may	be	required	in	systems	that	have	a	procedure	for	issuance	of	writ

   	Based	on	statistics	from	2013	and	2014	and	concerning	cases	where	the	debtor	is	a	natural	person.

of	 execution	 based	 on	 an	 authentic	 document	 because	 these	 procedures	 rest	 on	 the	
assumption	 that	 there	 is	 a	 high	 degree	 of	 certainty	 as	 regards	 the	 enforceability	 of	 the	
document.	 Countries	 with	 order	 for	 payment	 procedures	 (e.g.	 Bulgaria,	 Hungary,	 Poland)	
generally	do	not	charge	a	fee	to	file	an	objection.		

92.     In	 sum,	 any	 system	 for	 enforcing	 uncontested	 claims	 needs	 to	 provide	 easy	
mechanisms	for	debtor’s	objections	but	at	the	same	time	discourage	frivolous	ones.	In	order	
to	do	that,	policy	makers	have	to	be	able	to	track	the	percentage	of	objections	and	design	
policy	 responses	 in	 situations	 of	 increasingly	 frequent,	 unjustified	 objections	 that	 both	
burden	the	court	system	and	aggravate	debtors’	position.		

15.	Small	Claims	
93.     Given	the	fact	that	most	utility	bills	are	for	relatively	small	amounts,	in	the	cases	where	
a	claim	proceeds	to	a	civil	case	it	becomes	important	whether	the	respective	country	has	a	
dedicated	small	claims	procedure	that	fast-tracks	minor	disputes.	All	comparator	countries,	
with	 the	 exception	 of	 the	 Czech	 Republic	 and	 Bulgaria,	 have	 a	 dedicated	 small	 claims	
procedure	providing	faster	and	more	economic	case	resolution.	In	Hungary,	the	small	claims	
procedure	applies	specifically	to	disputes	involving	a	statement	of	opposition	to	an	order	for	
payment.		

94.    Small	 claims	 procedures	 incorporate	 numerous	 elements	 that	 make	 the	 process	
quicker	and	cheaper.	Simplifications	of	the	procedure	include	fully	written	process,	without	
oral	hearings;	waiving	or	easing	of	evidentiary	rules,	legal	representation,	and	rules	regarding	
the	form	of	judgments;	introducing	shorter	deadlines;	and	reducing	court	fees	as	compared	
to	regular	procedures.	Introducing	special	small	claims	procedures	may	contribute	to	clearing	
backlogs	related	to	litigious	utility	claims	cases.29		

16.	Competent	Authority	Carrying	out	Execution	over	Debtor’s	
Assets	
95.       Execution	over	debtor’s	assets	is	the	second	stage	of	the	process	for	enforcing	utility	
bills.	 As	 discussed	 above,	 in	 all	 comparator	 countries	 this	 procedure	 is	 separate	 from	 the	
procedure	for	obtaining	an	enforceable	title	and	is	carried	out	by	authorities	that	are	tasked

public	authorities	or	a	mix	of	the	two.

96.     As	 illustrated	 in	 Table	 7	 above,	 in	 most	 comparator	 countries	 (Estonia,	 Hungary,	
Lithuania,	FYR	Macedonia,	Poland30,	Romania,	Slovakia,	Slovenia)	execution	is	carried	out	by	
private	professionals.	They	generally	operate	under	highly	regulated	conditions	and	are	often	
appointed	following	an	exam	conducted	by	a	state	authority	(e.g.	the	Ministry	of	Justice).	At	
the	same	time,	these	professionals	operate	at	their	own	business	risk	and	fund	their	offices	
and	practice	from	the	fees	they	collect.		

97.     Two	comparator	countries,	 Czech	Republic	and	Bulgaria	have	a	dual	system,	which	
means	that	execution	is	carried	out	by	both	private	and	public	enforcement	agents.	However,	
in	both	countries,	the	share	of	cases	that	go	to	public	agents	is	negligible	due	to	the	higher	
efficiency	 of	 private	 ones.	 Even	 though	 private	 enforcement	 agents	 in	 Bulgaria	 are	 more	
efficient	than	public	ones,	their	efficiency	has	seen	a	decline	recently	due	to	the	continual	
increase	 in	 caseload.	 Currently	 Bulgaria	 has	 set	 a	 restriction	 on	 the	 number	 of	 private	
enforcement	agents	(1	agent	per	30,000	inhabitants),	which	may	be	leading	to	overload	of	
agents	and	decline	in	the	quality	of	customer	service.		

98.     Two	 comparator	 countries,	 Latvia	 and	 Croatia,	 rely	 on	 public	 authorities	 for	 the	
execution	of	enforceable	titles.	In	this	regard,	Croatia	is	an	unusual	example.	In	Croatia,	final	
writs	of	execution	based	on	authentic	documents	for	enforcement	on	monetary	assets	(on	
bank	accounts)	are	executed	by	the	Financial	Agency	(FINA).	FINA	is	a	state-owned	company	
specialized	 in	 processing	 payments	 and	 providing	 other	 financial	 services.	 In	 practice,	 this	
means	that	the	creditor	can	submit	a	final	writ	of	execution	to	FINA	and	carry	out	execution	
on	all	debtors’	accounts	in	all	banks	in	Croatia.		




30
  	Due	to	certain	peculiarities	of	the	Polish	system,	the	status	of	its	enforcement	agents	is	sometimes	referred	
to	as	mixed.	Nevertheless,	they	act	on	their	own	business	risk	and	therefore	for	the	purposes	of	this	analysis,	
they	are	classified	as	private.	The	Report	on	"European	judicial	systems	–	Edition	2014	(2012	data):	efficiency	
and	quality	of	justice"	of	the	European	Commission	for	the	Efficiency	of	Justice	(CEPEJ)	also	classifies	Polish	
enforcement	agents	as	having	a	private	status,	p.	406,	at

17.	ICT	and	Execution	on	Debtor’s	Assets	
99.    Effective	execution	usually	entails	various	degrees	of	 digitalization,	which	facilitate	
case	management,	disciplinary	proceedings,	identification	and	freezing	of	debtors’	assets,	or	
obtaining	information	on	companies’	and	citizens’	indebtedness.		

100. The	 first	 area	 that	 could	 benefit	 greatly	 from	 the	 introduction	 of	 information	
technologies	 is	 case	 management.	 Ideally,	 a	 case	 management	 system	 for	 enforcement	
agents	 would	 enable	 electronic	 filing	 and	 processing	 of	 documents,	 reference	 tools	 for	
debtors	and	creditors,	as	well	as	authorized	access	to	enforcement	agents’	case	files	for	the	
purpose	of	conducting	disciplinary	proceedings	in	cases	of	alleged	abuse	of	powers	or	court	
appeals	of	their	actions.	In	some	comparator	countries,	there	is	no	unified	case	management	
system	 for	 all	 enforcement	 agents	 and	 they	 have	 come	 up	 with	 different	 individual	 ICT	
solutions	(e.g.	 Bulgaria,	Estonia31).	In	others,	there	is	a	single	system	that	allows	for	unified	
case	management	of	all	enforcement	agents’	offices	(e.g.	Hungary,	FYR	Macedonia,	Poland,	
Croatia).		

101. Enforcement	 agents	 in	 comparator	 countries	 have	 different	 levels	 of	 access	 to	
information	 about	 debtors.	 They	 often	 have	 direct	 access	 to	 civil	 registries,	 property	
registries,	 vehicle	 registries,	 and	 tax	 authorities’	 databases.	 Access	 may	 be	 automatic	 and	
unlimited	 or	 may	 require	 a	 specific	 request	 to	 the	 respective	 authority.	 Additionally,	
enforcement	 agents’	 access	 to	 such	 registries	 may	 be	 free	 or	 may	 be	 granted	 upon	 the	
payment	 of	 a	 fee.	 The	 level	 of	 access	 that	 enforcement	 agents	 have	 to	 such	 information,	
related	costs	and	the	ease	of	accessing	information	and	paying	for	it,	all	have	an	effect	on	the	
speed	and	cost	of	enforcement.		

102. Thus,	in	 Estonia,	following	a	one-time	application	process,	enforcement	agents	have	
direct	access	to	most	registries	(e.g.	Business	Register,	Land	Register,	Tax	and	Customs	Board	
registers,	Population	Register).		

103. In	Bulgaria,	enforcement	agents	have	direct	access	to	the	civil	registration	database,	
the	social	security	and	property	registries.	Access	to	the	registries	of	the	National	Revenue	
Agency	and	the	Motor	Vehicles	Registry	maintained	by	the	Ministry	of	Interior	is	provided	
based	on	individual	requests.	Private	enforcement	agents	in	Bulgaria	pay	individual	fees	every	
time	 they	 access	 these	 registries.	 The	 administration	 of	 these	 fees	 slows	 down	 execution;	
therefore,	 the	 Bulgarian	 Chamber	 of	 Private	 Enforcement	 Agents	 is	 currently	 working	 on	
introducing	a	credit-based	system	for	automatic	payment	of	these	fees.		

104. In	 Hungary,	 enforcement	 agents	 do	 not	 have	 automatic	 access	 to	 such	 databases.		
However,	 they	 can	 approach	 the	 administrators	 of	 these	 databases	 (including	 banks	 and	
other	financial	institutions,	etc.)	in	order	to	obtain	such	data.		The	administrators	are	required	
to	disclose	any	information	related	to	the	debtor’s	assets	within	eight	days	of	receiving	the	
enforcement	 agent’s	 request.	 	 Most	 communication	 is	 carried	 out	 by	 means	 of	 a	 secure,	
electronic	 communication	 system	 maintained	 by	 the	 Hungarian	 Chamber	 of	 Enforcement	
Agents.	The	obtained	information	must	be	handled	so	as	to	ensure	the	confidentiality	of	any	
data	and	must	be	deleted	ten	years	after	the	enforcement	procedure	ceased.	

31
 	Even	though	currently	Estonian	enforcement	agents	use	a	variety	of	ICT	systems,	the	country	is	in	the	
process	of	introducing	a	unified	system	for	all	enforcement	agents.		


                                                      28	
105. In	 FYR	Macedonia,	enforcement	agents	do	not	have	automatic	access	to	any	public	
information.	They	can	obtain	information	regarding	a	debtor	-	whether	it	is	a	natural	person	
or	a	legal	entity	-	from	the	public	registry	for	a	fee.	The	only	information,	to	which	they	have	
free	 access	 is	 on	 the	 employment	 status	 of	 the	 debtor.	 This	 can	 be	 obtained	 from	 the	
Employment	Agency	upon	a	written	request.	

106. Enforcement	 agents	 in	 Croatia	 can	 only	 access	 public	 registries	 (land,	 company)	 or	
information	in	the	court	case	management	system.	All	other	types	of	information	should	be	
specifically	requested.	

107. Another	important	element	of	the	digitalization	of	enforcement	is	the	availability	of	a	
technical	tool	for	electronic	freezing	of	debtors’	bank	accounts	in	the	respective	country.	In	
some	countries,	such	electronic	freeze	of	accounts	may	need	to	be	done	individually	for	every	
bank	(e.g.	Hungary32)	while	in	others,	the	system	may	be	designed	in	a	manner	that	allows	
for	 simultaneous	 electronic	 freezing	 of	 accounts	 in	 all	 banks	 in	 the	 country	 (e.g.	 FYR	
Macedonia,	 Estonia).	 Electronic	 freezing	 of	 bank	 accounts	 happens	 in	 real	 time	 and	 may	
prevent	hiding	of	debtors’	assets.	In	countries	where	electronic	freezing	of	accounts	is	not	
available	(e.g.	 Romania,	Bulgaria33),	enforcement	agents	may	charge	separately	for	sending	
a	paper	notice	of	the	freeze	to	every	bank	in	the	country,	which	raises	the	cost	of	enforcement	
and	slows	it	down	thus	creating	some	potential	for	hiding	debtors’	assets.		

108. Finally,	 an	 important	 tool	 both	 for	 effective	 enforcement	 and	 potentially	 for	
prevention	of	indebtedness	are	various	types	of	debtors’	registries.	Such	registries	are	usually	
maintained	 by	 enforcement	 agents.	 They	 may	 provide	 access	 to	 information	 on	 whether	
enforcement	has	been	undertaken	with	respect	to	companies	and/or	individuals.	 Bulgaria,	
Poland,	Hungary,	Slovakia,	and	the	Czech	Republic	maintain	debtors’	registries.	In	Bulgaria,	
only	 information	 on	 legal	 persons	 that	 are	 debtors	 is	 accessible	 to	 anybody	 for	 a	 fee.	
Information	on	individuals	can	be	obtained	only	by	the	individual	concerned,	by	enforcement	
agents	and	by	certain	types	of	institutional	creditors	having	verified	data	protection	policies.	
In	Lithuania	and	Estonia,	there	are	several	private	registers	of	debtors.	Usually,	their	function	
is	to	publicize	debtors	and	the	service	is	financially	supported	by	creditors. In	Estonia,	there	
is	also	a	public	register	of	debtors	of	child	support	and	a	draft	law	is	on	the	way	that	would	
give	 the	 Estonian	 Chamber	 of	 Bailiffs	 and	 Trustees	 in	 Bankruptcy	 the	 right	 to	 give	 out	
information	about	debtors	and	the	amount	of	debt.			

18.	Protecting	Debtors	
109. National	enforcement	policies	should	be	cognizant	of	the	rights	of	the	debtor	and	the	
traumatizing	effect	aggressive	enforcement	measures	may	have	on	vulnerable	debtors.	This	
is	especially	important	in	the	enforcement	of	utility	claims	since	utility	services	represent	a	
basic	necessity	in	the	modern	world.	Recognizing	this,	national	legislations	frequently	put	in	
place	safeguards	to	prevent	disproportionate	measures	or	harm	to	individuals.	


32
  	The	fact	that	electronic	freezing	of	assets	in	Hungary	should	be	done	individually	for	each	bank	does	not	
slow	down	the	process	in	any	significant	manner	because	automation	leads	to	instantaneous	freezing,	
regardless	of	the	protocol.		
33
     	Bulgarian	law	provides	for	electronic	freezing	of	accounts	but	the	system	is	not	introduced	yet.		




                                                          29	
     Box	7:	Slovenia	Ordered	to	Pay	EUR	80,000	for	Disproportionate	Measures		

     On	25	April	2017,	the	European	Court	of	Human	Rights	(ECHR)	made	a	pronouncement	in	the	case	
     Vaskrsić	v.	Slovenia34	in	which	the	court	examined	the	lawfulness	of	the	sale	of	the	applicant’s	
     house	in	the	course	of	judicial	proceedings	aimed	at	enforcing	a	utility	debt.	The	initial	value	of	
     the	 debt	 was	 EUR	 124,	 which	 increased	 to	 around	 EUR	 500	 when	 interest	 and	 enforcement	
     expenses	were	added	to	it.	The	debtor	had	received	numerous	notifications	of	the	debt	but	had	
     failed	to	act,	which	led	to	the	institution	of	enforcement	proceedings.	The	recovery	of	the	sum	
     through	the	sale	of	the	debtor’s	movable	property	proved	impossible,	therefore	court	allowed	the	
     sale	 of	 his	 house,	 evaluated	 at	 EUR	 140,000.	 The	 first	 public	 auction	 was	 not	 successful	 and	
     ultimately	the	house	was	sold	at	a	second	public	auction	for	EUR	70,000.		

     In	its	decision,	ECHR	noted	the	“manifest	disproportion	between	this	measure	and	the	amount	of	
     debt	it	aimed	to	enforce”	and	held	that	the	Slovenian	court	had	violated	the	applicant’s	right	to	
     property.	Having	regard	for	the	“low	value	of	the	debt	that	was	enforced	through	the	judicial	sale	
     of	the	applicant’s	house	and	the	lack	of	consideration	of	other	suitable	and	less	onerous	measures	
     by	the	domestic	authorities”,	the	Court	concluded	that	Slovenia	had	failed	to	strike	a	fair	balance	
     between	the	aim	sought	and	the	measure	employed	in	the	enforcement	proceedings	against	the	
     applicant	and	ordered	the	defendant	state	to	pay	EUR	80,000	in	damages.	


110. Legislators	 have	 introduced	 numerous	 measures	 to	 protect	 vulnerable	 debtors	 and	
make	sure	that	enforcement	would	not	deprive	them	of	subsistence.	The	two	main	groups	of	
measures	for	protecting	debtors	are:	

                a. the	prohibitions	or	restrictions	on	directing	enforcement	at	some	categories	
                   of	debtors’	assets,	and;	

                b. the	adoption	of	laws	on	insolvency	of	natural	persons/households.	These	will	
                   be	reviewed	separately	below.	

18.1.	Restrictions	on	directing	enforcement	at	some	categories	of	debtors’	assets	

111. In	order	to	ensure	that	enforcement	does	not	endanger	the	livelihood	of	the	debtor,	
most	 national	 laws	 in	 the	 region	 prohibit	 or	 restrict	 enforcement	 against	 certain	 types	 of	
assets.	These	protected	assets	can	roughly	be	divided	into	four	categories.	

112. First,	the	law	may	entirely	prohibit	the	recovery	of	the	debt	against	 certain	types	of	
income,	 e.g.	 social	 security	 payments,	 child	 allowances,	 scholarships,	 payments	 made	 in	
connection	with	the	death	of	a	relative,	unemployment	benefits,	maternity	benefits,	disability	
benefits,	etc.	Such	payments	are	usually	targeted	and	made	by	the	state	in	order	to	alleviate	
the	situation	of	an	already	vulnerable	person.	The	prohibition	to	seize	such	types	of	income	
in	the	context	of	enforcement	serves	an	important	social	function.	Among	the	comparator	
countries,	 Bulgaria,	 Croatia,	 Estonia,	 FYR	 Macedonia,	 Hungary,	 Lithuania,	 Romania	 and	
Slovakia	exclude	entire	categories	of	income.	When	such	protection	is	available	for	certain	
categories	 of	 payments,	 it	 may	 be	 necessary	 that	 the	 debtor	 withdraws	 these	 assets	
immediately	 upon	 receiving	 them	 because	 if	 they	 are	 re-directed	 to	 a	 savings	 account,	
protection	 may	 be	 lost.	 In	 Croatia,	 if	 debtors	 wish	 to	 save	 protected	 income	 from	

34
     	See	Decision	in	Vaskrsić	v.	Slovenia	at	http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2017/375.html.	


                                                         30	
enforcement,	they	need	to	open	a	“protected	account”.	If	the	debtor	fails	to	do	so,	all	income	
–	even	the	protected	one,	will	be	enforced	automatically.	This	procedure	is	criticized	because	
the	 debtors	 are	 often	 unaware	 that	 their	 action	 is	 needed	 to	 prevent	 enforcement	 on	
protected	income	and	react	only	when	the	protected	income	has	already	been	seized.	

113. Secondly,	for	certain	categories	of	payments	the	law	may	allow	enforcement	only	of	
certain	portions	of	the	income.	Such	protection	measures	usually	stipulate	that	the	salary	of	
the	debtor	cannot	be	frozen	in	its	entirety	and	that	certain	portions	of	it	should	be	available	
to	the	debtor.	Some	countries	provide	protection	both	to	entire	types	of	income	(e.g.	social	
benefits)	and	to	portions	of	other	types	of	income	(e.g.	salaries).	In	other	jurisdictions,	there	
are	no	types	of	income	that	enjoy	absolute	protection	and	only	portions	of	the	social	benefits	
are	protected.	Thus,	Poland	protects	only	portions	of	some	types	of	social	benefits,	whereas	
Bulgaria,	Croatia,	Estonia,	FYR	Macedonia,	Hungary,	Lithuania	and	Romania	exclude	both	
certain	types	of	income	and	protect	portions	of	other	types	of	income.	

114. Thirdly,	 most	 countries	 do	 not	 allow	 enforcement	 directed	 against	 some	 types	 of	
movable	 items	 that	 may	 either	 be	 necessary	 for	 the	 debtor’s	 subsistence	 or	 have	 an	
emotional	value.	Types	of	such	movable	assets	may	include	clothes,	pets,	kitchen	appliances,	
medical	 appliances,	 study	 materials,	 certain	 quantity	 of	 food,	 fuel	 and	 other	 consumables	
necessary	for	heating,	cooking	or	lighting	for	a	certain	period	of	time,	machines,	tools,	books,	
with	which	the	debtor	exercises	his/her	profession,	cattle,	bees	and	other	farm	animals	up	to	
a	certain	limit,	as	well	as	the	food	to	feed	them,	accounting	records,	family	records,	marriage	
rings,	etc.	These	lists	of	protected	movable	assets	are	usually	quite	extensive	and	may	reflect	
cultural	or	moral	values	of	the	society.	

115. Fourthly,	 few	 countries	 pose	 restrictions	 on	 the	 right	 to	 sell	 debtors’	 immovable	
property.	For	example,	 Bulgaria	does	not	allow	enforcement	against	the	only	home	of	the	
debtor	and	the	members	of	his	family,	and	if	it	is	too	large	for	the	household	(as	per	a	size	
chart	determined	by	the	Council	of	Ministers),	part	of	it.	Additionally,	enforcement	cannot	
deprive	 farmers	 in	 Bulgaria	 of	 agricultural	 land,	 up	 to	 a	 certain	 size.	 In	 Romania,	 the	 real	
estate	having	the	destination	of	home,	which	was	acquired	by	credit,	cannot	be	foreclosed	
until	 the	 credit	 is	 paid	 up.	 In	 Croatia,	 the	 debtor	 is	 entitled	 to	 seek	 adjournment	 of	
enforcement	 against	 real	 estate,	 if	 it	 is	 the	 only	 immovable	 necessary	 for	 fulfillment	 of	
his/hers	basic	housing	needs.	This	adjournment	would	be	granted	if	the	debtor	proves	that	in	
all	likelihood	the	debt	can	be	paid	in	some	other	way	(e.g.	by	collection	of	some	of	his/hers	
claims).	 In	 Lithuania,	 if	 the	 only	 residential	 estate	 of	 the	 debtor	 has	 been	 attached	 when	
recovering	amounts	outstanding	for	utility	debt,	the	court	may,	on	request	from	the	debtor	
or	his/her	family	members,	prohibit	the	sale	of	the	property	taking	into	consideration	the	
material	situation	and	interests	of	the	children,	disabled	persons,	and	welfare	beneficiaries.	
In	 Slovakia,	 enforcement	 to	 recover	 a	 receivable	 not	 in	 excess	 of	 EUR	 2,000	 (“low-value	
enforcement”),	 cannot	 be	 conducted	 by	 selling	 the	 real	 estate	 in	 which	 the	 debtor	 has	
permanent	 or	 temporary	 residence.	 Overall,	 such	 restrictions	 on	 the	 sale	 of	 immovable	
property	are	rare	as	they	severely	limit	creditors’	avenues	for	successful	enforcement.		

116. In	addition	to	introducing	specific	categories	of	assets	that	may	not	be	seized,	national	
laws	may	allow	debtors	to	object	when	the	enforcement	method	selected	by	authorities	is	
disproportionate	to	the	size	of	the	debt.	If	applied	effectively,	such	provisions	go	a	long	way	
towards	ensuring	societal	acceptance	of	enforcement	legislation.

18.2.	Insolvency	of	Natural	Persons	

117. In	some	extreme	examples,	the	financial	position	of	debtors	may	be	so	dire	that	debts	
cannot	be	collected	within	foreseeable	timelines.	This	situation,	coupled	with	active	attempts	
at	enforcement,	may	create	“constant	debtors”	whose	debts	may	accompany	them	for	the	
rest	of	their	lives	thus	preventing	any	meaningful	participation	of	these	individuals	and/or	
households	in	economic	activities.	Moreover,	the	prolongation	of	a	situation	of	unpaid	debt	
generates	undesirable	legal	uncertainty.	

118. The	primary	targets	of	household/natural	persons’	insolvency	regimes	are	described	
succinctly	in	a	2011	report	of	the	World	Bank’s	Insolvency	and	Creditor/Debtor	Regimes	Task	
Force:	 “Insolvency	 regimes	 are	 designed	 primarily	 and	 work	 best	 for	 individuals	 who	 are	
capable	 of	 producing	 sufficient	 income	 to	 support	 themselves	 and	 their	 families,	 but	 an	
overwhelming	 debt	 burden	 saps	 their	 initiative	 and	 depresses	 their	 productive	 capacity.”35	
Thus,	the	legislation	of	the	insolvency	of	natural	persons	is	aimed	at	giving	such	individuals	
the	chance	of	a	fresh	start.	Depending	on	the	type	of	rules	it	incorporates,	it	could	also	create	
positive	incentives	for	the	debtor	to	work	towards	repaying	as	much	of	the	debt	as	possible.	
While	the	reasons	for	the	introduction	of	such	legislation	are	usually	economic,	such	laws	also	
serve	important	humanitarian	and	cultural	aspects	insofar	as	household	insolvency	may	be	
perceived	as	a	form	of	forgiveness.

119. In	recent	years,	an	increasing	number	of	European	states	are	regulating	the	insolvency	
of	natural	persons.	Comparator	countries	are	no	exception.

120. As	 Table	 8	 above	 illustrates,	 most	 comparator	 countries	 have	 either	 regulated	 the	
insolvency	of	natural	persons	or	are	considering	such	reform.	These	laws	are	still	rather	new	
and	an	examination	of	their	effect	would	be	premature.	Nevertheless,	insolvency	of	natural	
persons	increases	in	importance	as	means	to	ensuring	that	citizens	and	households	are	not	
permanently	marginalized	as	a	result	of	debt.	

19.	Reform	Management	
121. In	comparator	countries,	facilitating	enforcement	of	monetary	claims,	including	utility	
bills,	 usually	 entailed	 reforms	 to	 both	 stages	 of	 obtaining	 enforceable	 title	 and	 execution.	
These	reforms	were	varied	and	depended	on	the	previously	applicable	regimes	and	on	the	
legal	 traditions	 of	 the	 respective	 jurisdiction.	 The	 main	 drivers	 for	 reform	 were	 the	 EU	
accession	 process,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 need	 to	 optimize	 the	 use	 of	 court	 resources	 and	 clear	
backlogs.	 The	 publication	 of	 EU	 Commission	 pre-accession	 reports	 criticizing	 enforcement	
processes	 and	 exchange	 of	 experience	 in	 the	 framework	 of	 international	 cooperation	 and	
various	 EU	 Twinning	 projects	 also	 played	 a	 role	 as	 catalysts	 of	 change,	 as	 well	 as	 the	
complaints	 of	 business	 associations	 regarding	 efficiency	 of	 enforcement.	 Reform	
management	in	comparator	countries	is	examined	separately	for	each	of	the	two	stages	of	
enforcement.		

19.1.	Reform	Management	of	the	Process	of	Obtaining	Enforceable	Title	

122. Comparator	countries	carried	out	various	types	of	reforms	of	the	process	for	obtaining	
enforceable	title	for	uncontested	claims.	One	such	reform	entailed	the	 introduction	of	an	
order	 for	 payment	 procedure.	 This	 reform	 is	 typically	 extended	 to	 all	 monetary	 claims	
(sometimes	 below	 a	 certain	 threshold)	 in	 the	 respective	 jurisdiction	 and	 provides	 an	
expedited	procedure	for	obtaining	enforceable	titles	for	uncontested	claims	to	a	broad	array	
of	creditors.	For	example,	before	2007,	Bulgaria	enforced	utility	bills	using	a	procedure	for	
obtaining	writ	of	execution	based	on	authentic	title,	similar	to	the	one	used	by	the	countries	



                                                  33	
of	the	former	Yugoslavia.	In	2007,	following	a	twinning	project	bringing	together	Bulgaria’s	
Ministry	of	Justice	and	the	Austrian	Center	of	Legal	Competence,	Bulgaria	adopted	its	new	
Civil	Procedure	Code	introducing	the	order	for	payment	procedure.	This	reform	moved	utility	
bills	out	of	the	category	of	authentic	documents	and	equated	them	to	all	other	monetary	
claims	 up	 to	 a	 certain	 threshold.	 As	 discussed	 above,	 the	 use	 of	 the	 order	 for	 payment	
procedure	in	Bulgaria	is	so	extensive	that	it	currently	makes	up	more	than	fifty	percent	of	all	
first-instance	 civil	 cases.	 At	 the	 same	 time,	 the	 differences	 in	 caseload	 between	 judges	 in	
different	regions	of	the	country	led	to	large	regional	differences	in	the	processing	times	of	
such	requests	by	the	various	first-instance	courts.		

123. Another	type	of	reform	entails	assigning	the	function	of	issuing	an	enforceable	title	
to	notaries.	Such	reforms	were	carried	out	in	Hungary,	Croatia	and	FYR	Macedonia.	They	have	
the	 effect	 of	 quickly	 relieving	 courts	 of	 large	 caseloads	 especially	 when	 notaries	 issue	
enforceable	titles	for	all	types	of	monetary	claims	(Hungary),	as	opposed	to	just	claims	based	
on	authentic	title	(Croatia	and	FYR	Macedonia).	These	measures,	however,	could	move	the	
excessive	caseload	from	courts	to	notaries	if	the	number	of	notaries	is	insufficient	or	if	there	
are	 no	 systems	 in	 place	 to	 better	 organize	 the	 performance	 of	 this	 function.	 As	 discussed	
above,	it	remains	to	be	seen	whether	enforceable	titles	issued	by	notaries	could	be	certified	
as	European	Enforcement	Orders	directly	or	whether	exceptions	must	be	specifically	provided	
in	EU	legal	instruments,	as	in	the	case	of	Sweden	and	Hungary.		

124. A	large	number	of	comparator	countries	sought	to	address	excessive	caseload	through	
digitalization	of	this	process.	Electronic	filing	and	processing	of	requests	for	enforceable	titles	
is	 currently	 possible	 in	 Estonia,	 Czech	 Republic,	 Hungary,	 Lithuania,	 Poland,	 Slovakia	 and	
Slovenia.	 The	 ICT	 systems	 are	 sometimes	 part	 of	 the	 overall	 E-justice	 framework	 of	 the	
respective	jurisdiction,	while	in	other	cases	there	is	a	dedicated	IT	infrastructure	specifically	
for	uncontested	claims	(e.g.	the	E-court	in	Poland,	the	system	of	notaries	in	Hungary,	COVL	in	
Slovenia).	E-filing	is	often	encouraged	through	financial	incentives	such	as	reduction	of	fees.	
In	 countries	 that	 have	 introduced	 a	 centralized	 system	 for	 issuing	 enforceable	 titles	 on	
uncontested	claims,	e-filing	is	the	only	available	option	if	a	creditor	wishes	to	use	the	fast-
track	procedure.		

125. Finally,	wide-reaching	and	successful	reforms	were	achieved	through	 simultaneous	
centralization	 and	 digitalization	 of	 the	 function	 of	 issuance	 of	 enforceable	 titles,	 as	 in	
Poland,	Estonia,	Slovenia	and	Hungary.	This	type	of	reform	builds	on	the	experiences	of	the	
United	Kingdom	(Money	Claim	Online)38	and	Germany.39	In	both	the	UK	and	Germany,	the	
electronic	platform	and	filing	are	centralized	while	competent	authorities	continue	to	apply	
their	limited	territorial	jurisdiction	(i.e.	the	unified	electronic	platform	directs	filed	requests	
to	 the	 territorially	 competent	 court).	 In	 comparator	 states	 with	 centralized	 systems,	 the	
competent	 authorities	 have	 jurisdiction	 over	 the	 territory	 of	 the	 entire	 country.	 Such	
centralized	systems	were	introduced	by	assigning	the	function	to	a	single	court	division.	At	
the	same	time,	given	the	digitalization	of	the	process,	in	centralized	systems	it	is	not	necessary	
to	have	all	officials	working	on	the	subject	residing	in	the	same	place.	The	ICT	system	would	
distribute	 workload	 evenly	 regardless	 of	 the	 whereabouts	 of	 the	 official	 examining	 the	
request,	 thus	 ensuring	 uniform	 deadlines	 throughout	 the	 country,	 as	 in	 the	 examples	 of

Poland	and	Hungary.		If	such	functions	are	assigned	to	a	court,	a	large	part	of	the	work	could	
be	carried	out	by	officials	who	are	not	judges,	as	in	the	examples	of	Poland	(8	judges	and	119	
court	clerks),	 Slovenia	(4	judges	and	62	support	personnel)	and	 Estonia	(4	assistant	judges	
and	29	other	court	officers).	

     Box	9:	Slovenia’s	Automated	System	for	Enforcement	of	Authentic	Documents	

     In	 2010,	 the	 Crystal	 Scales	 of	 Justice	 Prize	 of	 CEPEJ	 was	 awarded	 to	 Slovenia	 for	 its	 Automated	
     system	 for	 enforcement	 of	 authentic	 documents	 and	 the	 country	 reported	 the	 following	
     efficiencies	of	the	system40:		
          § The	introduction	of	COVL,	at	the	start	of	2008,	lowered	the	number	of	pending	cases	by	
              6.6	percent	in	2008	(to	284	302)	and	by	5.94	percent	in	2009	(to	267	410).	
          § Decision	making	time	has	been	lowered	from	an	average	of	6	months	to	less	than	5	working	
              days	for	over	90	percent	of	the	requests.		
          § The	work,	previously	done	by	around	350	court	employees	and	judges	at	44	courts,	now	
              involves	just	4	judges	and	62	support	personnel.		
          § Introduction	 of	 an	 automated	 postal	 system,	 which	 has	 processed	 more	 than	 1	 million	
              postal	parcels	in	2009,	reduced	the	number	of	necessary	staff	by	60-70	over	a	year.	


126. Data	on	the	 cost	of	reforms	has	proven	scarce.	Most	costs	of	reforming	the	process	
of	obtaining	enforceable	title	are	associated	with	building	a	dedicated	information	system	for	
this	process,	such	as	the	systems	of	the	E-court	in	Poland,	the	notaries	in	Hungary	or	COVL	in	
Slovenia.	 Where	 such	 systems	 employ	 additional	 legal	 personnel,	 e.g.	 the	 referendarz	 in	
Poland,	the	reform	may	also	entail	personnel	costs.	Additionally,	when	a	large	new	entity	is	
set	up	in	connection	with	centralized	processing	of	requests	(e.g.	the	E-court	in	Poland),	there	
may	be	housing	costs.	OECD	estimates	that	the	setting	up	of	the	E-court	in	Poland	entailed	a	
one-time	investment	of	EUR	5.2	million.41	System	development	for	the	introduction	of	COVL	
in	 Slovenia	 cost	 EUR	 3.2	 million.42	 Additionally,	 as	 of	 2012,	 operational	 costs	 of	 the	 COVL	
system	were	approximately	6	million	EUR	per	year	and	it	generated	around	11	million	EUR	in	
court	fees.43

    Box	10:	Poland’s	E-court	
    In	Poland,	the	most	frequently	used	avenue	for	obtaining	enforceable	title	for	utility	claims	is	the	
    electronic	 order	 for	 payment	 procedure.	 It	 is	 carried	 out	 by	 the	 so-called	 E-court,	 which	 is	
    established	 as	 a	 division	 of	 the	 Lublin-West	 Regional	 Court.	 The	 E-court	 functions	 since	 January	
    2010.	It	has	jurisdiction	over	the	entire	territory	of	Poland	regardless	of	the	defendant’s	domicile	
    or	seat.	The	E-court	works	exclusively	with	electronic	orders	for	payment	and	employs	8	judges	and	
    119	 court	 clerks	 with	 legal	 education	 (referendarz).	 69	 of	 the	 referendarz	 are	 based	 outside	 of	
    Lublin	 and	 work	 from	 a	 distance.	 Between	 2010	 and	 2015,	 the	 E-Court	 had	 11,8	 million	 claims	
    lodged	(in	2015,	around	2,4	million)	with	10,3	million	writs	of	execution	issued	(in	2015,	around	2	
    million).	According	to	OECD	estimates,	the	setting	up	of	the	E-court	in	Poland	entailed	a	one-time	
    investment	of	EUR	5.2	million.	
    Claimants	can	choose	whether	to	use	the	procedure	with	the	E-court	or	the	traditional	paper-based	
    procedure	with	regular	courts;	the	latter	however,	is	more	expensive	and	slower.	The	court	fee	for	
    the	electronic	procedure	is	1.25	percent	of	claim	value	whereas	the	fee	for	the	“paper”	procedure	
    with	 regular	 courts	 amounts	 to	 5	 percent	 of	 claim	 value.	 Creditors	 can	 file	 applications	 for	 the	
    issuance	of	orders	for	payment	with	the	E-court	for	pecuniary	civil	claims	irrespective	of	the	amount	
    of	the	claim.	To	do	that,	they	need	to	register	with	http://www.e-sad.gov.pl.	There	is	no	need	to	
    attach	evidence	to	the	electronic	form.	If	the	claim	is	well-grounded,	the	electronic	system	prepares	
    a	draft	order	for	payment,	which	is	subsequently	signed	by	the	court	official	using	an	electronic	
    signature.	If	the	claim	appears	groundless,	no	payment	order	follows	and	the	case	is	transferred	to	
    the	competent	regular	court	for	further	consideration.		
    The	order	for	payment	is	automatically	served	on	the	claimant	through	the	electronic	system	while	
    service	to	the	defendant	is	carried	out	in	the	standard	manner	–	by	regular	mail.	The	defendant	can	
    submit	a	written	objection	to	the	payment	order	within	2	weeks	from	the	date	of	service.	A	peculiar	
    element	of	the	Polish	system	is	the	presumption	of	service	-	there	is	no	verification	whether	the	
    notice	 actually	 reached	 the	 debtor	 as	 there	 is	 a	 presumption	 that	 it	 did.	 If	 the	 E-court	 has	 not	
    received	 an	 objection	 within	 a	 month	 of	 sending	 the	 Order	 for	 Payment,	 it	 issues	 a	 writ.	 The	
    submission	of	an	objection	by	the	defendant	annuls	the	payment	order	and	results	in	the	case	being	
    transferred	for	consideration	to	the	competent	court.	If	the	defendant	refrains	from	objecting,	the	
    order	for	payment	becomes	final	and	a	writ	of	execution	is	issued.	


127. Comparator	 countries	 reformed	 the	 process	 of	 obtaining	 an	 enforceable	 title	 in	
several	 ways:	 introducing	 the	 order	 for	 payment	 procedure;	 assigning	 the	 function	 to	
notaries;	digitalization	of	the	function;	and	simultaneous	centralization	and	digitalization	of	
the	function.	It	appears	that	the	simultaneous	centralization	and	digitalization	of	the	function	
leads	to	the	most	efficiencies	across	the	board.

 Box	11:	Good	practice	in	Estonia	
 On	 1	 September	 2009,	 Estonia	 introduced	 centralized	 and	 electronic	 processing	 of	 orders	 for	
 payment.	All	of	them	are	reviewed	by	the	Centre	of	Payment	Orders	located	in	the	Haapsalu	court	
 house	of	the	Pärnu	County	Court.	This	specialized	court	division	works	exclusively	with	electronic	
 orders	for	payment	and	employs	only	4	assistant	judges	and	29	other	court	officers.	In	2014,	the	
 court	 division	 reviewed	 37,542	 applications	 for	 the	 issuance	 of	 expedited	 orders	 for	 payment.	
 During	the	same	year,	county	courts	adjudicated	on	a	total	of	28,094	civil	cases,	which	is	illustrative	
 of	the	scale	of	utilization	of	the	expedited	orders	for	payment	procedure.	
 Creditors	 can	 file	 with	 the	 Centre	 of	 Payment	 Orders	 applications	 with	 regard	 to	 pecuniary	 civil	
 claims	with	a	value	of	up	to	EUR	6,400.	Applications	can	be	filed	only	electronically	via	a	centralized	
 e-File	portal	or	via	the	X-road	data	exchange	layer	of	information	systems.	The	court	fee	for	the	
 procedure	is	EUR	45	irrespective	of	the	amount	of	the	claim.	The	system	checks	if	the	applications	
 meet	the	formal	requirements	and	if	they	do,	automatically	creates	a	proposal	for	payment.	If	there	
 are	any	shortcomings,	the	Centre	of	Payment	Orders	either	approaches	the	creditor	or	rejects	the	
 application	 with	 a	 court	 ruling.	 No	 proof	 of	 actual	 debt	 needs	 to	 be	 submitted	 to	 the	 court;	
 however,	there	needs	to	be	a	description	of	the	case	and	a	list	of	documents	proving	the	claim.		
 The	proposal	for	payment	is	then	served	to	the	debtor.	Unlike	other	comparator	countries,	Estonia	
 does	not	allow	service	without	proof	of	receipt	regarding	Orders	for	Payment.	If	personal	service	
 to	the	debtor	proves	impossible,	the	payment	order	procedure	is	terminated	and	the	creditor	is	
 left	 with	 the	 option	 to	 initiate	 a	 litigious	 civil	 case.	 	 The	 debtor	 has	 15	 days	 after	 receiving	 the	
 proposal	 for	 payment	 to	 file	 an	 objection.	 There	 is	 no	 need	 to	 provide	 any	 justification	 of	 the	
 objection.	If	the	debtor	doesn’t	object,	the	department	of	payment	order	will	issue	the	order	for	
 payment,	 which	 is	 directly	 enforceable.	 If	 the	 debtor	 objects,	 it’s	 up	 to	 the	 creditor	 to	 decide	
 whether	to	proceed	to	county	court	or	close	the	case.		



19.2.	Reform	Management	of	the	Process	of	Execution	

128. Most	comparator	countries	reformed	execution	of	enforceable	titles	by	 introducing	
private	enforcement	agents.	This	type	of	reform	is	not	costly	for	the	public	sector	because	
private	 professionals	 are	 responsible	 for	 covering	 the	 costs	 of	 equipping	 their	 offices	 and	
funding	their	operations.	The	reform	creates	performance	incentives	as	the	income	of	the	
agents	depends	on	the	collected	amounts.	At	the	same	time,	in	all	jurisdictions	this	is	a	highly-
regulated	profession	because	the	state	delegates	to	private	professionals	a	part	of	its	coercive	
power	 and	 needs	 to	 ensure	 it	 is	 not	 abused.	 The	 success	 of	 such	 reforms	 depends	 on	 the	
extent	to	which	the	state	and	the	private	professionals	are	able	to	ensure	strict	compliance	
with	 rules	 of	 enforcement,	 including	 through	 effective	 self-regulation	 and	 disciplinary	
measures.		

129. All	 comparator	 countries	 except	 Latvia	 and	 Croatia	 have	 introduced	 private	
enforcement	agents.	This	type	of	reform	entails	a	number	of	policy	choices.	First,	countries	
need	to	choose	whether	to	completely	replace	state	enforcement	agents	with	private	ones	
or	let	both	systems	operate	in	parallel.	For	example,	Bulgaria	and	the	Czech	Republic	have	
opted	for	a	dual	system	while	Estonia,	Hungary,	Lithuania,	FYR	Macedonia,	Poland,	Romania,	
Slovakia	 and	 Slovenia	 currently	 have	 only	 private	 enforcement	 agents.	 Opting	 for	 a	 dual	
system	may	reduce	opposition	toward	the	reform	and	may	create	a	safety	valve	in	case	it	
proves	 unsuccessful.	 However,	 the	 preservation	 of	 the	 parallel	 public	 system	 engages	
budgetary	 resources	 that	 in	 the	 presence	 of	 private	 enforcement	 agents	 may	 well	 be	


                                                          37	
ineffectively	 spent.	 In	 addition,	 both	 in	 Bulgaria	 and	 in	 the	 Czech	 Republic,	 creditors	
overwhelmingly	 choose	 private	 as	 opposed	 to	 public	 enforcement	 agents,	 which	 suggests	
that	they	are	seen	as	more	efficient	and	effective.		

130. The	 second	 policy	 choice	 relates	 to	 the	 number	 of	 enforcement	 agents.	 It	 may	 be	
limited	by	law	or	may	depend	on	the	market	and	the	selection	process	(qualification	exam)	
for	entering	the	profession.	For	example,	Lithuania,	Romania,	Slovakia,	Poland	do	not	set	a	
limitation	on	the	number	of	enforcement	agents	who	would	serve	in	the	country,	whereas	in	
Bulgaria,	Estonia,	FYR	Macedonia,	Czech	Republic	and	Slovenia	this	number	is	strictly	limited.	
The	liberalization	of	the	number	of	enforcement	agents	allows	for	higher	competition	and	
flexibility	in	providing	quality	services	to	creditors.	On	the	other	hand,	it	creates	difficulties	in	
controlling	the	quality	and	performance	of	enforcement	agents.		

131. The	third	policy	choice	as	regards	setting	up	a	system	of	private	enforcement	agents	
relates	 to	 their	 territorial	 competence.	 In	 some	 countries,	 enforcement	 agents	 have	
jurisdiction	 over	 the	 territory	 of	 the	 entire	 country	 while	 in	 others,	 they	 have	 limited	
territorial	jurisdiction	over	a	certain	region.	In	Slovakia	and	FYR	Macedonia44	enforcement	
agents	 can	 carry	 out	 enforcement	 actions	 on	 the	 territory	 of	 the	 entire	 country,	 while	 in	
Bulgaria,	 Estonia,	 Lithuania,	 Hungary	 and	 Poland,	 agents	 have	 jurisdiction	 only	 over	 the	
territory	of	their	districts.	Generally,	unlimited	territorial	jurisdiction	increases	competition	
between	enforcement	agents	and	may	result	in	better	service	to	creditors.	On	the	other	hand,	
it	 may	 increase	 the	 costs	 of	 enforcement	 and	 decrease	 incentives	 for	 setting	 up	 of	
enforcement	agents’	offices	in	less	economically	active	parts	of	the	country,	thus	reducing	
access	to	justice	for	economically	disadvantaged	creditors.			

132. In	sum,	the	majority	of	comparator	countries	have	reformed	execution	of	enforceable	
titles	 by	 assigning	 this	 function	 to	 a	 highly-regulated	 profession	 of	 private	 enforcement	
agents.	In	introducing	this	profession,	different	countries	have	opted	for	varying	degrees	of	
liberalization	of	the	profession	around	policy	choices	such	as:	whether	to	completely	replace	
state	enforcement	agents	with	private	ones	or	let	both	system	operate	in	parallel;	whether	
to	limit	the	number	of	agents	or	not;	and	whether	to	limit	agents’	territorial	competence.	All	
of	 these	 choices	 shape	 the	 system	 and	 have	 a	 direct	 effect	 of	 competition	 and	 quality	 of	
services	in	the	sector.		

20.	Reducing	Backlogs	
133. While	reforms	based	on	the	policy	options	described	above	may	accelerate	processing	
of	incoming	cases	and	limit	the	accumulation	of	backlogs,	old	cases	that	stay	open	indefinitely	
may	 still	 burden	 the	 system.	 When	 discussing	 backlogs,	 it	 is	 again	 useful	 to	 separate	
enforcement	of	utility	cases	into	two	stages,	obtaining	enforceable	title	and	execution	of	the	
title.	By	design,	expedited	procedures	for	issuing	enforceable	title	on	uncontested	claims	do	
not	stay	open	indefinitely.	The	case	is	closed	relatively	quickly	because	one	of	the	following	
scenarios	 materializes:	 	 (1)	 the	 competent	 authority	 refuses	 to	 issue	 the	 enforceable	 title	
when	the	request	does	not	meet	legal	requirements;	or	(2)	the	court	issues	the	enforceable	
title,	it	is	served	to	the	debtor,	the	debtor	doesn’t	object	and	the	title	enters	into	force;	or	(3)	


44
  	In	FYR	Macedonia,	enforcement	agents	have	the	competence	to	carry	out	enforcement	actions	on	the	
territory	of	the	entire	country	but	only	for	enforceable	titles	issued	in	their	respective	district.		


                                                    38	
the	court	issues	the	enforceable	title,	it	is	served	to	the	debtor,	the	debtor	objects	and	the	
procedure	 for	 uncontested	 claims	 is	 closed	 leaving	 the	 creditor	 to	 defend	 the	 claim	 in	 a	
litigious	case.	Therefore,	in	essence,	the	procedures	for	issuance	of	enforceable	titles	based	
on	uncontested	claims	do	not	have	the	potential	to	generate	a	backlog.		

134. Matters	are	quite	different	as	regards	the	execution	of	enforceable	titles.	Execution	
cases	 may	 stay	 open	 for	 a	 very	 long	 time,	 especially	 if	 the	 debtor	 has	 no	 assets,	 thus	
generating	a	backlog.	In	Serbia	and	Montenegro,	where	both	stages	are	united	in	a	single	
procedure,	the	possibility	for	a	prolongation	of	the	case	and	hence	the	potential	for	backlogs	
affect	the	entire	procedure.		

135. Two	types	of	rules	have	the	potential	to	significantly	affect	backlogs	in	the	area	of	
enforcement:	 first,	 the	 interruption	 of	 the	 period	 of	 limitations	 for	 a	 claim	 in	 a	 pending	
execution	case	for	the	same	claim;	and	second,	the	possibility	for	execution	cases	to	stay	open	
indefinitely	even	if	no	enforcement	action	is	undertaken	(e.g.	in	cases	where	the	debtor	has	
no	sufficient	assets).		

136. The	statute	of	limitations	in	the	course	of	pending	execution	may	significantly	affect	a	
backlog.	Thus,	jurisdictions	where	the	limitation	period	is	suspended	for	the	entire	duration	
of	 an	 open	 execution	 case	 may	 favor	 prolongation	 of	 such	 cases	 and	 the	 accompanying	
uncertainty	 regarding	 the	 debtor’s	 financial	 situation.	 Examples	 of	 such	 jurisdictions	 are	
Poland	and	FYR	Macedonia.	In	other	countries,	the	presence	of	a	pending	enforcement	case	
is	not	in	itself	sufficient	to	suspend	the	limitation	period.	Thus,	in	Bulgaria	and	Hungary	each	
action	in	a	pending	execution	case	interrupts	the	limitation	period,	but	if	a	case	is	dormant	
and	 there	 are	 no	 actions	 whatsoever	 in	 its	 framework,	 the	 limitation	 period	 for	 the	 claim	
would	not	be	suspended.	This	would	allow	the	period	of	limitation	to	expire	for	claims	for	
which	execution	has	been	initiated	but	no	further	actions	have	been	undertaken	(e.g.	due	to	
lack	of	debtor’s	assets,	lack	of	sufficient	level	of	interest	by	the	creditor,	etc.)		

137. The	possibility	for	execution	cases	to	stay	open	indefinitely	even	if	no	enforcement	
action	is	being	undertaken	may	also	contribute	to	a	backlog.	Therefore,	it	is	advisable	to	have	
rules	regulating	the	fate	of	dormant	cases.	For	example,	in	Hungary	such	cases	are	suspended	
with	a	document	drawn	up	by	the	enforcement	agents.	In	Croatia,	if	the	enforcement	agent	
has	not	been	able	to	collect	the	case	is	closed.	In	Poland,	the	case	shall	be	closed	if	the	creditor	
has	not	acted	within	six	months.	

138. A	rule	on	closing	cases	where	no	enforcement	actions	have	been	carried	out	in	the	
course	 of	 two	 years	 exists	 in	 Bulgaria;	 however,	 in	 practice	 enforcement	 agents	 were	 not	
suspending	or	closing	such	cases.	In	order	to	remedy	this	situation	and	introduce	more	clarity,	
an	 Interpretative	 Decision45	 of	 Bulgaria’s	 Supreme	 Court	 of	 Cassation	 pronounced	 that	
execution	cases	on	which	there	has	been	no	activity	for	two	years	shall	be	considered	closed	
ex	 officio.	 While	 it	 is	 sometimes	 argued	 that	 such	 rules	 should	 be	 introduced	 by	 the	
legislature,	as	opposed	to	through	case	law,	the	decision	brought	certainty	and	closed	a	large	


45
 	Interpretative	Decision,	Case	No.	2/2013,	issued	on	26	June	2015,	of	Joint	Assembly	of	the	Civil	and	
Commercial	Division	of	the	Supreme	Court	of	Cassation	of	the	Republic	of	Bulgaria	at

number	of	dormant	cases	thus	reducing	the	backlog.	In	this	situation,	 ex	officio	closure	of	
dormant	cases	proved	an	effective	tool	for	addressing	backlogs	of	inactive	execution	cases.	

139. Both	the	rules	on	the	limitation	period	and	the	rules	on	the	fate	of	dormant	execution	
cases	can	affect	backlogs.	Situations	where	the	limitation	periods	are	suspended	for	the	entire	
duration	of	a	pending	enforcement,	regardless	if	any	actions	are	being	carried	out	or	not,	
combined	 with	 an	 absence	 of	 rules	 on	 closing	 dormant	 enforcement	 cases	 are	 the	 most	
conducive	to	generating	backlogs.		

     Box	12:	Utility	Providers	Taking	the	Lead	in	Backlog	Reduction	

     Significant	 backlog	 reduction	 could	 be	 achieved	 on	 the	 initiative	 of	 utility	 providers.	 In	 2011,	
     Infostan,	 the	 largest	 utility	 company	 in	 Belgrade,	 invited	 their	 long-time	 debtors	 to	 reach	 an	
     agreement	and	pay	their	accumulated	debts	in	installments	without	interest.	For	those	who	agreed,	
     Infostan	withdrew	the	pending	enforcement	cases	before	the	Belgrade	First	Basic	Court,	leading	to	
     a	 significant	 decrease	 in	 the	 pending	 stock.	 In	 2014,	 Infostan	 replicated	 the	 offer	 and	 again	
     numerous	 debts	 were	 settled.	 Initiatives	 combining	 debt	 restructuring	 for	 larger	 bills	 and	 debt	
     write-off	for	small-value	cases	can	go	a	long	way	towards	reducing	backlog.	In	this	manner,	both	
     enforcement	systems	and	companies	can	be	relieved	of	futile	efforts.46	


21.	Opposition	to	Reforms	
140. Having	 in	 mind	 that	 reforms	 aimed	 at	 improving	 the	 efficiency	 of	 enforcement	 are	
bound	 to	 adversely	 affect	 a	 great	 number	 of	 persons	 who	 are	 often	 socially	 vulnerable,	
legislators	 usually	 approach	 such	 reforms	 with	 a	 certain	 degree	 of	 apprehension	 and	 an	
expectation	 of	 significant	 opposition.	 This	 report	 examines	 the	 actual	 opposition	 that	 was	
observed	 in	 comparator	 states	 with	 regard	 to	 these	 reforms,	 including	 the	 timing	 and	 the	
nature	of	such	opposition.	Again,	reforms	of	the	procedure	for	obtaining	an	enforceable	title	
and	reforms	of	the	process	of	execution	are	examined	separately	since	public	reactions	to	
them	differ	greatly.		

21.1.	Opposition	to	Reforming	the	Process	for	Obtaining	Enforceable	Title	

141. None	of	the	comparator	countries	reported	opposition	to	reforming	the	process	of	
obtaining	enforceable	title	at	the	time	of	introduction	of	the	new	system.	In	a	few	countries,	
criticism	arose	following	several	years	of	implementation	of	the	new	system	and	was	related	
primarily	to	two	groups	of	issues:	1)	problems	with	 service	of	the	enforceable	title	to	the	
debtor	without	proof,	and	2)	excessive	increase	of	the	debt	as	a	result	of	adding	the	costs	of	
enforcement.		

142. As	discussed	above,	the	possibility	of	 service	of	the	enforceable	title	to	the	debtor	
without	proof	is	critically	important	to	the	effectiveness	of	enforcement	since	in	the	absence	
of	 such	 an	 option,	 the	 debtor	 may	 easily	 prevent	 enforcement	 by	 avoiding	 service.	 At	 the	
same	time,	this	type	of	service	can	lead	to	real	or	perceived	limitation	of	debtors’	right	to	fair	
trial.	 Several	 countries	 report	 criticism	 to	 reform	 related	 to	 this	 issue.	 In	 Poland,	 the	
presumption	of	service	to	the	debtor	within	a	certain	time	period	after	the	sending	of	the	

46
     	Ibid.,	footnote	2,	p.	100.		


                                                          40	
enforceable	title	is	an	object	of	criticism.	In	Bulgaria,	the	procedure	of	sticking	a	notice	on	the	
debtor’s	 door	 in	 case	 of	 his/her	 absence	 is	 viewed	 as	 rather	 uncertain	 as	 such	 notes	 are	
frequently	 reported	 to	 “disappear”.	 In	 Romania,	 there	 has	 also	 been	 criticism	 of	 the	
procedure	with	regard	to	service.		

143. Costs	of	enforcement	are	another	reason	for	discontent.	When	court/notary	fees	for	
the	 issuance	 of	 an	 enforceable	 title	 are	 combined	 with	 enforcement	 agents’	 fees	 and	
attorneys’	fees,	the	total	sum	may	well	exceed	the	principal	of	the	debt,	especially	in	the	case	
of	small	claims	such	as	those	based	on	utility	bills.	Croatia,	Bulgaria	and	the	Czech	Republic	
report	discontent	linked	to	the	overall	costs	of	enforcement.		

144. Bulgaria	provides	an	interesting	example.	Even	though	utility	companies	use	in-house	
lawyers	working	for	a	flat	salary	to	initiate	enforcement	of	unpaid	utility	bills,	at	the	phase	of	
enforcement,	 the	 expenses	 for	 this	 labor	 were	 being	 calculated	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 attorneys’	
expenses	 and	 were	 added	 to	 the	 debt.	 This	 used	 to	 increase	 the	 burden	 on	 debtors.	 This	
prompted	 Bulgaria’s	 Ombudsman	 to	 challenge	 before	 the	 Constitutional	 Court	 the	 legal	
provisions	allowing	judges	to	award	expenses	to	companies	represented	by	in-house	lawyers	
on	the	basis	of	attorney	fees.	The	Constitutional	Court	did	not	find	this	unconstitutional,47	but	
due	to	escalating	public	discontent	in	January	2017	Bulgarian	legislators	introduced	a	special	
provision	in	the	law	significantly	limiting	the	fees	that	companies	could	claim	for	the	work	of	
their	in-house	lawyers.		

21.2.	Opposition	to	Reforming	Execution		

145. Reforms	 introducing	 private	 enforcement	 agents	 have	 prompted	 more	 opposition	
than	 reforms	 of	 the	 process	 for	 obtaining	 enforceable	 title	 and	 have	 at	 times	 been	 an	
important	part	of	the	political	debate	in	some	comparator	countries.	Given	the	fact	that	the	
institution	 of	 private	 enforcement	 agents	 represents	 a	 delegation	 of	 important	 coercive	
powers	 of	 the	 state	 to	 private	 professionals,	 in	 some	 comparator	 countries	 (particularly	
Croatia	and	Bulgaria)	this	reform	has	been	met	with	fear	and	distrust.		

146. Croatia	has	witnessed	particularly	strong	opposition.	The	country	introduced	private	
enforcement	agents	in	2010,	in	the	Private	Bailiffs	Act.	The	system	was	supposed	to	be	in	
place	and	operating	by	January	1,	2012.	By	December	2011,	private	bailiffs	were	appointed,	
their	offices	were	set	up	and	the	system	was	ready	to	start	operating.	However,	due	to	great	
public	 concern	 over	 this	 reform,	 it	 became	 one	 of	 the	 main	 political	 campaign	 topics.	 The	
political	party	that	had	incorporated	opposition	to	this	reform	in	its	political	platform	won	the	
elections	and	the	act	was	repealed	in	late	December	2011,	only	a	few	days	before	the	start	
date	of	its	implementation.		

147. Public	protests	were	quite	significant	in	 Bulgaria	as	well.	As	a	result	of	opposition	at	
the	time	private	bailiffs	were	introduced,	Bulgaria	made	the	policy	decision	to	keep	the	public	
system	 functioning	 in	 parallel.	 Ten	 years	 after	 the	 introduction	 of	 the	 reform,	 there	 are	
several	 non-governmental	 organizations	 for	 the	 protection	 of	 debtors’	 rights	 that	 have	

47
  	Constitutional	Court	Decision	No.	10	of	29	September	2016	on	Constitutional	Case	3/2-16,	promulgated	in	
State	Gazette	79	of	7	October	2016.		
	
	


                                                     41	
participated	in	strategic	litigation	against	aspects	of	the	enforcement	system,	have	attended	
parliamentary	hearings	on	the	topic	and	have	organized	small	street	protests.	Aspects	of	the	
activities	of	private	enforcement	agents	are	frequently	scrutinized	by	Bulgaria’s	Ombudsman.		

148. In	 Hungary,	 too,	 there	 have	 been	 complaints	 against	 the	 modus	 operandi	 of	
enforcement	agents.	Whilst	their	actions	are	strictly	regulated	by	law,	the	legal	framework	is	
in	certain	cases	perceived	as	not	restrictive	enough	to	prevent	abuses:	the	costs	and	expenses	
in	connection	with	enforcement	actions	often	gave	rise	to	criticism	as	enforcement	agents	
can	 claim	 expenses	 which	 were	 not	 necessarily	 justified.	 Additionally,	 the	 mechanisms	 for	
handling	 complaints	 against	 actions	 of	 the	 enforcement	 agents	 are	 perceived	 as	 not	
sufficiently	quick.	A	new	legislative	package	will	aim	at	rectifying	these	deficiencies.	

149. Overall,	 the	 most	 important	 risk	 associated	 with	 the	 introduction	 of	 private	
enforcement	 agents	 is	 the	 potential	 for	 abuse	 of	 their	 powers.	 Since	 private	 enforcement	
agents	 have	 the	 authority	 to	 severely	 affect	 the	 property	 sphere	 of	 individuals	 and	
companies,	there	should	be	solid	guarantees	against	the	abuse	of	their	powers,	such	as:	strict	
disciplinary	 liability	 imposed	 by	 both	 enforcement	 agents’	 professional	 chamber	 and	 by	 a	
governmental	authority;	procedural	venues	for	timely	court	actions	to	prevent	those	types	of	
violations	 that	 would	 inflict	 irreparable	 damage	 on	 debtors	 or	 creditors;	 obligatory	
professional	 liability	 insurance;	 and	 consistent	 imposition	 of	 civil	 liability	 for	 damages	 that	
private	enforcement	agents	may	have	caused	as	a	result	of	overstepping	their	powers.		

150. Opposition	to	the	introduction	of	private	enforcement	agents,	where	it	occurred,	was	
usually	 overcome	 by	 strong	 public	 information	 campaigns	 on	 the	 extensive	 and	 positive	
foreign	 experience	 with	 this	 system.	 	 Such	 opposition	 was	 easier	 to	 overcome	 where	 the	
previous	system	was	functioning	very	poorly.	In	some	countries	opposition	was	overcome	by	
modifying	or	softening	reform	proposals	to	make	them	more	acceptable.	Finally,	even	though	
opposition	to	reforms	at	the	time	of	their	introduction	may	be	significant,	such	opposition	
does	not	end	with	adopting	the	new	piece	of	legislation.	It	is	necessary	to	carry	out	periodic	
reviews	of	the	implementation	of	such	reforms	and	adjust	them	to	address	any	problems	in	
implementation.		

22.	Conclusions	
151. Experience	 from	 the	 comparator	 countries	 examined	 above	 demonstrates	 that	
enforcement	of	utility	bills	can	take	various	routes.	Different	systems	can	yield	comparably	
satisfactory	results.	Nevertheless,	some	systems	display	more	efficiencies.	The	conclusions	
are	summarized	below:		

    a) The	 limitation	 period	 for	 utility	 claims	 is	 particularly	 short	 in	 the	 countries	 of	 the	
       former	Yugoslavia.	Short	statutes	of	limitation	for	enforcement	of	utility	bills	may	lead	
       to	 non-joining	 and	 thus	 proliferation	 of	 small	 claims	 and	 burden	 debtors	 with	
       excessive	costs	for	enforcement.	Most	comparator	countries	have	opted	for	a	3-year	
       statute	of	limitations.		
    b) Possibilities	for	cutting	off	access	to	utility	services	may	be	effective	in	reducing	non-
       payment	of	utility	bills	and	may	affect	the	volume	of	such	cases.	However,	due	to	the	
       social	 significance	 of	 utility	 services	 as	 well	 as	 a	 number	 of	 technical	 limitations,	



                                                   42	
    providing	extended	possibilities	for	self-help	on	the	part	of	utility	companies	cannot	
    be	considered	an	acceptable	policy	tool	for	reducing	the	volume	of	utility	cases.	
c) Usually,	 enforceable	 titles	 for	 unpaid	 utility	 bills	 are	 obtained	 via	 procedures	 for	
   enforcing	uncontested	claims.		
d) Issuance	 of	 enforceable	 titles	 and	 execution	 over	 debtors’	 assets	 are	 two	 distinct	
   procedures	implemented	by	two	different	authorities	in	all	comparator	countries.	
   Uniting	 these	 procedures	 and	 assigning	 them	 to	 the	 same	 authority,	 as	 Serbia	 and	
   Montenegro	have	done,	is	not	the	preferred	solution.		
e) Obtaining	 enforceable	 title	 for	 unpaid	 utility	 bills	 through	 an	 order	 for	 payment	
   procedure,	which	is	also	applicable	to	a	broad	range	of	other	monetary	claims,	is	the	
   more	widely	accepted	policy	choice.	When	compared	to	procedures	for	issuance	of	a	
   writ	based	on	an	authentic	title,	which	are	used	in	the	Western	Balkan	countries,	order	
   for	 payment	 procedures	 are	 broader	 in	 scope	 and	 display	 equal	 treatment	 for	 all	
   creditors	in	the	country,	without	assigning	a	special	status	to	utility	providers.	
f) Issuance	 of	 enforceable	 titles	 for	 uncontested	 claims	 is	 usually	 assigned	 to	 courts.	
   Nevertheless,	countries	that	have	chosen	to	assign	this	responsibility	on	notaries,	do	
   not	face	any	particular	difficulties	either.	The	expected	pronouncement	of	the	Court	
   of	 Justice	 of	 the	 European	 Union	 in	 Case	 C-484/15	 will	 determine	 whether	 the	
   issuance	of	enforceable	titles	by	notaries	would	need	to	be	addressed	by	a	specific	
   exception	in	the	EU	legislation,	if	such	titles	are	to	qualify	as	European	Enforcement	
   Orders.	
g) Centralized	 and	 fully	 electronic	 systems	 for	 issuance	 of	 enforceable	 titles	 for	
   uncontested	claims	generally	ensure	more	predictable	timelines	and	are	more	cost-
   efficient.		
h) One	 way	 to	 ensure	 quick	 and	 efficient	 processing	 of	 requests	 for	 issuance	 of	
   enforceable	 titles	 is	 the	 use	 of	 information	 technologies.	 In	 comparator	 countries	
   with	centralized	systems,	electronic	filing	is	mandatory	for	creditors	wishing	to	use	
   the	expedited	procedure.	Comparator	countries	with	non-centralized	systems	either	
   have	 only	 paper-based	 filing	 or	 provide	 creditors	 with	 a	 choice	 whether	 to	 file	
   electronically	or	not.	In	these	cases,	there	might	be	economic	incentives	for	electronic	
   filing.		
i) In	order	to	facilitate	examination	of	requests,	many	comparator	states	have	abolished	
   the	requirement	to	attach	evidence	to	the	request	for	issuance	of	enforceable	title.	
j) Fee	structures	of	procedures	for	obtaining	enforceable	titles	on	uncontested	claims	
   are	generally	used	as	a	 policy	tool	that	would	encourage	creditors	to	use	the	most	
   cost-efficient	procedural	route.		
k) Service	of	enforceable	titles	to	debtors	is	critical	both	to	the	efficiency	of	the	entire	
   procedure	and	to	its	acceptance	by	society.	Therefore,	service	should	be	organized	in	
   a	manner	that	is	both	effective	and	cognizant	of	citizens’	right	to	fair	trial.		
l) Policy	makers	should	track	the	frequency	of	objections	to	enforceable	titles	and	work	
   to	 introduce	 mechanisms	 that	 would	 facilitate	 legitimate	 objections	 while	
   discouraging	frivolous	ones.		



                                             43	
m) Efficient	execution	over	debtors’	assets	requires	a	high	level	of	digitalization	of	this	
   function,	including	automated	access	to	various	types	of	information	about	debtors.	
n) In	order	to	ensure	that	enforcement	does	not	endanger	the	livelihood	of	the	debtor,	
   laws	 in	 the	 region	 introduce	 restrictions	 on	 enforcement	 against	 certain	 types	 of	
   assets.	Restrictions	may	be	introduced	in	respect	of	entire	categories	of	income	(such	
   as	social	assistance	payments),	portions	of	income	(such	as	a	minimum	amount	of	the	
   salary),	 movable	 items	 that	 are	 necessary	 for	 debtors’	 subsistence	 or	 have	 an	
   emotional	value	or	immovable	properties.	Restrictions	on	enforcement	on	immovable	
   are	quite	rare.	
o) In	 order	 to	 prevent	 the	 permanent	 exclusion	 of	 debtors	 from	 economic	 activities,	
   most	 countries	 in	 the	 region	 have	 enacted	 personal	 insolvency	 laws.	 They	 are	
   designed	to	give	debtors	and	their	households	the	chance	of	a	fresh	start.	
p) Comparator	countries	have	reformed	the	process	of	obtaining	an	enforceable	title	in	
   several	principal	ways:	introducing	the	order	for	payment	procedure;	assigning	the	
   function	 to	 notaries;	 digitalization	 of	 the	 function;	 and	 simultaneous	 centralization	
   and	digitalization	of	the	function.	It	appears	that	the	simultaneous	centralization	and	
   digitalization	of	the	function	leads	to	most	efficiencies	across	the	board.	
q) The	majority	of	comparator	countries	have	reformed	execution	of	enforceable	titles	
   by	 assigning	 this	 function	 to	 a	 highly-regulated	 profession	 of	 private	 enforcement	
   agents.	 In	 introducing	 this	 profession,	 different	 countries	 have	 opted	 for	 varying	
   degrees	of	liberalization	of	the	profession	around	policy	choices	such	as:	whether	to	
   completely	 replace	 state	 enforcement	 agents	 with	 private	 ones	 or	 let	 both	 system	
   operate	in	parallel;	whether	to	limit	the	number	of	agents	or	not;	and	whether	to	limit	
   agents’	territorial	competence.	All	of	these	choices	shape	the	system	and	have	a	direct	
   effect	on	competition	and	quality	of	services	in	the	sector.	Poor	supervision	of	private	
   agents	could,	however,	lead	to	abuse	of	their	powers	and	public	discontent.		
r) The	rules	on	the	limitation	periods	in	the	course	of	execution	and	the	rules	on	the	fate	
   of	 dormant	 execution	 cases	 can	 affect	 backlogs.	 Situations	 where	 the	 limitation	
   periods	are	suspended	for	the	entire	duration	of	a	pending	enforcement,	regardless	if	
   any	actions	are	being	carried	out	or	not,	combined	with	an	absence	of	rules	on	closing	
   dormant	enforcement	cases	are	the	most	likely	to	generate	backlogs.	
s) Reforms	of	the	process	of	obtaining	enforceable	titles	for	uncontested	claims	do	not	
   tend	 to	 generate	 public	 outcry	 at	 the	 time	 of	 their	 adoption.	 However,	 special	
   attention	should	be	given	to	service	of	process	and	costs,	if	the	public	is	to	perceive	
   these	reforms	as	fair	in	the	long	run.		
t) In	some	comparator	countries,	introduction	of	private	enforcement	agents	was	met	
   with	serious	concerns	and	public	opposition.	The	most	important	risk	associated	with	
   the	introduction	of	private	enforcement	agents	is	the	potential	for	abuse	of	powers.	
   There	 should	 be	 solid	 guarantees	 against	 the	 abuse	 of	 powers,	 such	 as:	 strict	
   disciplinary	liability	imposed	by	both	enforcement	agents’	professional	chamber	and	
   by	a	governmental	authority;	procedural	venues	for	timely	court	actions	to	prevent	
   those	types	of	violations	that	would	inflict	irreparable	damage	on	debtors	or	creditors;	
   obligatory	professional	liability	insurance;	and	consistent	imposition	of	civil	liability	for	




                                             44	
       damages	that	private	enforcement	agents	may	have	caused	as	a	result	of	overstepping	
       their	powers.	

152. The	rich	experience	of	EU-11	countries	in	improving	enforcement	through	targeted	
reforms	 offers	 good	 models	 for	 countries	 that	 experience	 similar	 problems	 and	 share	
common	cultural	and	legal	traditions.
