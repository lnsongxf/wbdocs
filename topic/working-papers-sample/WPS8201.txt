I. INTRODUCTION


Rural access is among the most important infrastructure elements to stimulate economic
growth in rural and remote areas. According to the Rural Access Index developed by Roberts
et al. (2006), in Africa only 34 percent of the rural populations have access to an all-season
road within an approximate 2-km walking distance. Many farmers and local businesses are
still not well connected to the road network and do not have good access to markets. Rural
access is particularly important from the poverty reduction point of view. The majority of the
rural populations are living below the poverty lines, simply engaging in subsistence farming
with few advanced inputs used. Rural access is also critical for people’s access to social
facilities, such as schools and hospitals.


The literature is generally supportive of the impacts of rural accessibility. In the short term,
transport costs and travel time can be reduced by improved road conditions (e.g., Lokshin
and Yemtsov 2005; Danida 2010). Over the longer term, agricultural productivity would
likely be increased (Khandker et al. 2009; Bell and Van Dillen, 2012), and firms would
become more profitable with more jobs created (Mu and van de Walle, 2011). Poverty could
then be alleviated (Dercon et al., 2008; Khandker and Koolwal, 2011).


Road financing is a matter of particular concern in many developing countries. Despite the
fact that there are significant unmet needs for road infrastructure, available resources are
limited. In Africa, it is estimated that about US$12.7 billion would be needed to rehabilitate,
upgrade and maintain the road network to meet minimum connectivity standards (AICD,
2009). Maintenance of rural roads, of which the traffic level is low at less than 200 vehicles
per day, tends to be neglected under fiscal pressure. On the other hand, many rural roads in
Africa are gravel or earth roads, which require frequent maintenance. The current shortfall in
road maintenance spending is estimated to cost Africa US$1.9 billion a year (World Bank,
2010).
                                                    -3-




Performance-based contracting is a useful instrument to ensure sustainability of road
maintenance. The literature has long been discussing an incentive problem in transport
projects: About 90 percent of transport projects experienced significant cost overruns
(Flyvbjerg et al., 2002). Africa’s road projects were delayed by 10 months on average
(Alexeeva et al., 2008). And each year of delay would likely cost on average US$4.6 million
for a US$100 million transport infrastructure project (Flyvbjerg et al., 2004). In theory,
output- and performance-based road contracts (OPRC) can tighten contractors’ incentives to
avoid cost overruns, while delivering outputs as agreed.1 Under the OPRC framework,
contractors are responsible for initial rehabilitation works and following maintenance works
for an agreed period of time. Their performance is normally not measured by used inputs,
such as bitumen and concrete, but by certain performance criteria, such as surface
degradation and road user comfort.


Despite the fact that OPRC are being used widely, there is little evidence showing their
effectiveness. On the cost implication side of OPRC, Lancelot (2010) shows that
performance-based contracts were 20-35 percent cheaper than traditionally procured projects
in Brazil. In Europe, it is found that the cost of public-private partnerships, which is relevant
to but more advanced than OPRC, is 24 percent higher in the road sector. This is possible
because of the risk premium of anticipated cost overruns (Blanc-Brude et al., 2009).


To the best of our knowledge, the current paper is one of the first attempts to examine the
impacts of OPRC on the user side. Using data from a rural road project in Zambia, it will
examine the possible impacts of OPRC on agricultural production. The following sections
are organized as follows: Section II provides an overview of the road sector in Zambia.
Section III develops our empirical strategy, and Section IV describes our data. Section V
presents main results and discusses policy implications. And Section VI concludes.

  Theoretically, Bajari and Tadelis (2001) show that the incentive mechanism can be strengthened to improve
the performance of contractors, while minimizing public procurement costs.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OF THE ZAMBIAN ROAD SECTOR


Over the last decade, Zambia has been experiencing steady growth with an average growth of
7.7 percent. The mining sector, such as copper, is traditionally strong in the country, although
it may be affected by the recent contraction of the commodity market. Agriculture is another
important sector, employing about 65 percent of the total labor force and generating about
10-15 percent of GDP (LCMS 2010). Agricultural productivity remains low despite some
emerging large-scale commercial production. The Zambian agriculture sector is dominated
by smallholder farming based on a few hectares of land per household, with few advanced
inputs and little machinery (e.g., Fink and Masiye, 2015; Sipangule and Lay, 2015).


From an agro-ecological point of view, Zambia has significant potential of agricultural
production. The country currently produces about US$1.9 billion in crops (Figure 1). Purely
from an agro-ecological point of view, the country is estimated to have US$291 billion in
agricultural production potential, when evaluated at regional crop prices (Figure 2). Clearly,
this has not been exploited yet. Importantly, Zambia imports more than US$200 million of
crops and food products every year (c.f., fuel imports of US$1 billion and copper exports of
US$6 billion). Agriculture can be an export, not import, industry if a variety of constraints
are removed in the sector.

Among others, an important constraint is rural accessibility. According the Living Conditions
Monitoring Survey, rural people do not have good access to markets, social facilities or
public transportation services. In rural areas, only about half of the population lives within
20-minute distance of the nearest public transportation (Figure 3). The average distance is
estimated at 6.1 km in rural areas, which is unfavorably compared to 0.7 km in urban areas.
Similarly, many rural farmers lack access to markets. It takes more than one hour to go to the
nearest input market (e.g., fertilizer and improved seeds) in the majority of rural areas in
Zambia (Figure 4). The average distance to market is estimated at 20.9 km and 3.4 km in rural
and urban areas, respectively.

According to the recently updated rural access index (RAI), it is estimated that only 17
percent of the rural population lives within 2km of a road in good condition. About 7 million
people are still left unconnected to the road network (Figure 5).2 The previous RAI, estimated
by Roberts et al. (2006), was 64 percent, which was predicted by calibrating a statistical
model based on data from other countries. It seems to have been upward biased given the
country’s low population density in rural areas and the poor condition of the rural road
network, as shown below. The new estimate, which uses detailed population and road data, is
considered more accurate and consistent.

 Zambia is among the most urbanized countries in Africa. The total population in Zambia is about 15.7 million,
of which about 40 percent of the total population live in urban areas, which are excluded from the RAI
calculation. See World Bank (2016) for more details.

Zambia has a road network comprised of 40,454 km of classified roads, called Core Road
Network (CRN), of which about half are Trunk, Main and District (TMD) roads, and another
half are urban and primary feeder roads. This translates into a low road density of 5.4 km per
100 km2 of land, which is unfavorably compared to its neighboring countries (e.g., 9.8 km in
Tanzania, 14 km in Malawi, and 28.4 km in Kenya). About 10,100 km of trunk, main and
district roads are paved and well maintained, however, the majority of feeder roads are
generally in poor condition, crucially undermining the connectivity of the rural population.
Both low population density and poor, limited road network are attributed to the country’s
low rural accessibility.

To improve transport connectivity and support agricultural growth, the Government of
Zambia has made significant efforts to improve the main road network and extend feeder
roads with the assistance of the international community. For instance, the Danish
International Development Agency, DANIDA, supported the Small Scale Community
Access (SSCA) component under its Road Sector Programme Support (RSPS) in 2002-2007.
The program aimed at spot improvements on non-core roads to improve community access in
rural areas, focused on six districts along the Lusaka-Mongu corridor.

In 2006-2014 the World Bank also supported the Agricultural Development Support Project
(ADSP) to improve smallholder farmers’ access to agricultural inputs and output markets in
5 districts: Choma, Chipata, Katete, Chongwe and Lundazi. The ADSP rehabilitated and
maintained a total of 1,131 kilometers of feeder roads at a cost of US$27 million. Under the
project, the OPRC scheme was adopted for the first time in Zambia. The following analysis
relies on household surveys carried out in two districts: Chipata and Katete before and after
the project (Figure 6).3 These two districts adjoin each other in Eastern Province, bordering
Malawi and Mozambique. This region is generally fertile and has relatively high rural
accessibility at about 30 percent (see the above figures).

  The household surveys were actually carried out in three districts, including Choma District. However, the
Choma data cannot be matched unambiguously with project implementation data because of missing
identification data. In addition, many sampled households could not be covered by the follow-up survey, due to
the changes in the designation of Standard Enumeration Areas (SEAs) after the 2010 National Population
census. In Choma District, only 52 percent of the Treatment sample and 74 percent of the Control sample could
be revisited under the follow-up survey (RDA, 2013).

III. EMPIRICAL STRATEGY


The current analysis relies on two household surveys carried out in Chipata and Katete before
and after the ADSP. The project areas were selected based on local agricultural potential.
Eastern Province is among the most important agricultural areas in Zambia, producing
cotton, soybean, groundnuts and tobacco as well as maize. Chipata and Katete produce more
than 20 percent of the nation’s total groundnuts. Based on agricultural productivity, about
200 km of feeder roads were selected in each of the districts (Table 1). These account for
about 24 percent of total feeder roads in Chipata, and 38 percent in Katete. Before the
project, almost all feeder roads were in poor condition in these two districts.


Under the project, 5-year OPRCs were made from March 2009 to March 2014. The awarded
contractors were required to rehabilitate selected road links in the first year and maintain
them by spot improvements as well as emergency works in the following 4 years. In the five
years, a total of 385 km of roads were improved with gravel surface, box culverts and stone
patching. Note that the OPRCs were targeted at a specific set of roads, but they did not
prevent other road works elsewhere in the districts. Regardless of the OPRCs, the local
governments actually implemented some other traditional road improvement and
maintenance works wherever needed.

To assess the impacts of road works under OPRC on agricultural production, the following
agricultural production function is considered:


ln Vit   j ln  p j qijt 
                                                                                                            (1)
         0  1OPRC it   2 t   3OPRC it  t   4 ln POTit   k  k ln xikt   m  m z imt  u it



where V is the total value of crops produced by household i at time t. The analysis only takes
into account 7 major crops that are grown in the survey area: j={maize, cotton, cassava,
vegetable, soybean, tobacco, groundnuts}. The vast majority of farmers in the area grow
maize, and the second most popular crop is groundnuts. Some farmers also produce other
crops, such as cotton. To aggregate different types of crops, regional producer prices (pj) are
used from FAOSTAT.4




4
 Average producer prices are used from three countries: Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa, where
comprehensive data are available. The prices of maize, cotton, cassava, tobacco, vegetable, soybean and
groundnuts are assumed to be $0.22 per kg, $1.34, $0.25, $2.66, $0.16, $0.47 and $0.97, respectively.
                                                    - 10 -




Our identification strategy is based on the difference-in-differences (DID) method with other
covariates taken into account. OPRC is a dummy variable for the adoption of OPRC. There
are two periods of time: before (t=0) and after (t=1) the project. The impact of OPRC is
expected to be captured by β3 in the equation. An advantage of the DID estimator is that it
allows to control unobserved heterogeneity between the treatment and control groups and
mitigate the self-selection bias, as long as they are time-invariant. However, as often
discussed, it is a strong assumption that no time-variant factor affects the outcome indicators.
To mitigate this risk, time-variant household characteristics are included on the right-hand
side of the regression equation (e.g., Jalan and Ravallion 1998).


Following the agricultural economics literature (e.g., see Gyimah-Brempong (1987) and
Bravo-Ortega and Lederman (2004)), six inputs are considered for xk: k  L , H , S , F , P , TR ,
where L and H denote labor and land, respectively. Three advanced inputs are included:
improved seeds (S), fertilizer (F), and pesticides (P). TR is the amount of spending on
transportation services to take outputs to market.


Agricultural production must depend on underlying agro-climatic conditions. POT is an
estimate of potential crop production based on agro-ecological and soil conditions. It is
defined by      j
                     p j H ijt Y j where Hijt is household i’s land area used for production of crop j at

time t. Yj is a yield estimate (kg/ha) of crop j at this location under the rainfed high inputs
assumption. This comes from a global spatial data set, Global Agro-Ecological Zones
(GAEZ).


Other observable household characteristics, such as access to utility services and household
assets, are also included in zm, and u is an error term.


One empirical challenge is that many input variables are likely to be zero, when analyzing
data from developing countries. As will be seen below, only half of the farmers actually use
fertilizer (both basal and surface dressing included) in Zambia. About 15 percent and less
                                                        - 11 -




than 10 percent use pesticides and transport services, respectively. The market participation
rate is only 35 percent in our sample data.


One traditional approach to deal with this problem is to add a small positive number to avoid
taking the logarithm of zeros. However, this may cause significant bias in estimation results
(Battese, 1997). To remove that bias, the following analysis uses the Battese’s specification,
which introduces dummy variables, D, for the incidence of zero inputs:


ln Vit   0  1OPRC it   2 t   3OPRC it  t   4 ln POTit
                                                                             (2)
          k  k ln xikt
                      *
                            k  k Dikt   m  m z imt  u it



where


       1 if xikt  0
Dikt                     *
                      and xikt  max( xikt , Dikt )                  (3)
       0 if xikt  0


Another empirical challenge is endogeneity: By construction, OPRC is endogenously
determined because the OPRC scheme was applied to places where agricultural potential is
presumably high. Thus, regardless of the actual road works, agricultural production may be
greater along the OPRC roads. This is a general endogeneity problem of infrastructure
placement. Some areas are more productive than others because of better infrastructure, but
at the same time, governments often invest more where productivity is inherently high no
matter for what reason.


To address this issue, the instrumental variable technique is used. Three instrumental
variables are constructed: ELEV, SLOP and KMT4. The first two variables represent
geographic conditions of each road location: ELEV is the level of elevation in meters, and
SLOP is the slope angle of the terrain. These are likely to be relevant to the necessity of road
works (but less relevant to agricultural production), because the main challenge in rural areas
of Eastern Province is accessibility during the rainy season. Many rural roads tend to be
                                                     - 12 -




inundated and inaccessible because of the poor condition of roads. Thus, ELEV and SLOP
are expected to explain potential needs for road works to a certain extent. The data come
from a global spatial data set, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which
provides 90m resolution elevation data of the world. Under the ADSP, about 340 pipe
culverts and 20 box culverts were installed. Still, five clusters of emergency works were
carried out to repair washed away embankments in 2010, 2012 and 2013 (RDA 2014).


In addition, remoteness from a main trunk road, which is T4 in Eastern Province, is also
considered important to predict project areas. On one hand, roads are generally supposed to
form an integrated network. Since the primary road network has already been well
maintained in Zambia, feeder roads close to it are more likely to be improved as well. On the
other hand, the project aimed at providing transport connectivity to remote areas. If this is the
case, more remote areas would receive more road works. To capture this effect, the straight-
line distance from each project site to T4 is calculated (denoted by KMT4). Note that as
discussed above, agricultural potential is also an important instrument to determine the
OPRC roads. Our model has already included POT as an independent variable. The validity
of the instruments will be ex post examined by conventional tests, such as exogeneity and
overidentifying restriction tests.


An important policy question is why the OPRC intervention could increase agricultural
production. It is obvious that nothing would happen unless significant road improvement
works are actually carried out, even though a performance-based contract is made. When the
follow-up survey was carried out, some rehabilitation works do not seem to have been
completed.5 Then, no impact would have materialized even though roads were under the
OPRC.

  Although the RDA status reports show that all the rehabilitation works were completed when the follow-up
survey was carried out, the perception of road users was sometimes different. Some respondents along the
treatment roads indicated that roads were still under rehabilitation, for example, D128 in Chipata District and
U29 in Katete District (RDA, 2031).
                                                      - 13 -




On the other hand, agricultural production could be increased by any road improvement
work, even though it is implemented under the traditional input-based contracts. For instance,
RD585 and D60 in Katete were selected as paired roads in the control group but improved
outside of the ADSP OPRC. Based on the users’ perspective, in total, about 62 percent of the
roads received significant rehabilitation works in both treatment and control groups (RDA
2013).


To examine this impact, the following equation is considered:


ln Vit   0  1WORK it   2 t   3WORK it  t   4 ln POT it
                                                                                    (4)
        k  k ln xikt
                    *
                          k  k Dikt   m  m z imt  u it



where WORK is equal to one if actual road work is carried out. To deal with the endogeneity
issue, the same instruments are used. In addition, OPRC is also included as another
instrument. It is believed that the existence of OPRCs could affect the likelihood of receiving
road improvement and maintenance works, because the contractors were obliged to keep the
roads in good condition.


IV. DATA


Micro data were collected though two household surveys carried out before the project in
2009 and after the project in August to November 2012. The follow-up data were collected
before the full completion of the OPRCs, which started in March 2009 and ended in March
2014. Thus, the impacts measured by the surveys are presumably associated with the initial
rehabilitation works in the first year of the contracts. However, some emergency and
maintenance works were also implemented in not only treatment but also control areas before
the follow-up survey. Hence, the measured impacts may also reflect these effects.

The OPRC roads were not selected randomly but chosen based on existing agricultural
potential. For each of the OPRC roads, a comparable road was selected in the same and
adjoining districts, based on socioeconomic characteristics, proximity to social facilities,
such as schools and health clinics, as well as access to the main trunk road (Figure 7). For
each road (both treatment and control), at least 20 households were surveyed in each of the
standard enumeration areas (SEAs) that the road passes. In total, the baseline survey covers
about 650 households in Chipata (Table 2) and about 780 households in Katete (Table 3).

As expected, the OPRC and control households are broadly comparable according to their
basic characteristics. There is no statistical difference in demographics, such as household
size and age of household head (Table 4). Living conditions are also broadly similar, however,
availability of certain infrastructure services, such as water supply, is slightly different. But
the differences are numerically very small. To ensure statistical comparability between the
two groups, a conventional matching technique is used: Only 2 observations are found
outside the common support, and thus, excluded from the following empirical analysis.

The summary statistics are shown in Table 5. The average value of crop production is US$801
or about ZKW4,000 per household. Recall that in Zambia about 78 percent of the rural
population lives below the national poverty line.6 In Chipata and Katete District, the poverty
rates are estimated at 72.6 percent and 82.9 percent, respectively (World Bank 2015). The
agro-climatic potential exceeds US$4,300, which is five times more than currently produced.
The currently dominant production system is clearly subsistence farming, with little fertilizer
and few pesticides. Average land cultivated is about 1.6 ha. Only about one-third of the
households participated in market transactions.

  In Zambia, the income distribution is highly skewed. According to the Government of Zambia, the threshold
of poverty is defined by the nation’s 2010 food basket to meet minimal nutritional requirements, which is
ZKW96,366 per household (6 household members). This is significantly higher than many households’
incomes. ZIPAR (2013), analyzing the income distribution in the country, indicates that the threshold of
household income for the lower income group is ZKW510 in 2012. This group is estimated to account for about
24 percent of the total population.

V. MAIN RESULTS


The instrumental variable (IV) regression is performed to estimate Equation (2). First of all,
the IV approach is found to be appropriate with our data. The exogeneity test statistics are
estimated at 30.51 and 50.98 with the Battese specification and the small-positive number
specification (Table 6). Both are well above the conventional significance value. Thus, it is
confirmed that the selection of OPRC roads is not exogenous. On the other hand, the
overidentifying restriction tests indicate that our selected instruments are valid. The estimated
                                               - 18 -




test statistics are well below the critical value: The hypothesis that the instruments are not
correlated with V cannot be rejected.


Second, from the empirical specification point of view, the Battese model fits the data better
than the conventional small-positive number model. According to the Wald statistics, the
overall goodness of fit is much greater at 845.3 in the Battese model. In addition, the
hypothesis that all coefficients of d(S), d(F), d(P) and d(TR) are zero can be rejected easily
with a test statistic of 22.41. Therefore, the Battese specification can be accepted. As
discussed above, the small-positive-number model generated the possibly underestimated
impacts of production factors that have a number of zero observations. See Battese (1998) for
more discussion.


For the impact of OPRC, it is found that the impact is statistically significant. The coefficient
of OPRC*t is positive at 4.57 under the Battese specification. The marginal effect is
estimated at 1.30. Thus, it can be concluded that the OPRC increases agricultural production.
The estimation result also indicates that everything else assumed constant, total agricultural
production declined significantly between 2009 and 2012. The coefficient of t is estimated at
-2.59, which is also significant. This may have been attributed to the relatively poor rainfall
in 2012.


Regarding other variables in the estimated production function, land (H), seeds (S) and
fertilizer (F) are found productive. The coefficients of lnH, lnS and lnF are all significantly
positive. Particularly, the result indicates that the elasticity of land is particularly high: This
must reflect the current production system in Zambia, which is highly land-intensive. On the
other hand, labor (L) does not seem to be an important production factor. The coefficient is
still positive but not significant, possibly indicating the fact that labor is abundant. There is
little use of pesticides and transportation services for market sales. These impacts are not
significant.

Overall, the estimated production function exhibits constant returns to scale: The sum of the
coefficients of the six production factors is estimated at 1.081 with a standard error of 0.155.
The null hypothesis of constant return cannot be rejected.

One might be concerned about the magnitude of the estimated marginal effect of OPRC. One
possible reason is that the estimated coefficient may include the effect of agro-climatic
potential. Recall that the OPRC roads were selected based on agricultural potential. In
addition, the underlying crop production patterns may have changed significantly during the
project implementation period.


To investigate this, the simple average DID estimator is considered. Note that our data are
cross-sectional at two periods of time, not panel data. The double difference statistics need to
be adjusted with the weight, w, given by kernel matching (Heckman, Ichimura and Todd,
1997):

While maize production in the sample area increased between 2009 and 2012, other crops,
including groundnuts, which is another important crop produced in the survey area, were
harvested much less (Table 7). This is consistent with the national agriculture statistics:
Zambia experienced a significant drop in agriculture production in 2012/2013. Particularly,
cotton production in 2012/13 decreased by nearly 50 percent because of unfavorable market
prices in the Southern African region. In our data, no cotton production was recorded in the
follow-up survey.


Together with these drastic changes in production patterns, the significant increase in maize
production is likely to explain the measured large impact of OPRC on the total production
value. Maize production in the OPRC areas increased from 1,385 kg to 2,208 kg, which is
more than 50 percent growth. Although production in the control group also increased, the
net impact is significant at 209 kg per household. The net impact on groundnuts production is
also significant at 40 kg per household, a more than 10 percent increase.

To answer the question of why OPRC has a positive impact on agriculture production,
Equation (4) is estimated using the same set of independent variables as above. This also
addresses a likely question of whether this is because of OPRC or road maintenance works in
general regardless of contractual arrangements. The results are broadly unchanged: The
selected instruments are valid, and the impact of WORK is positive and significant (Table 8).
This is the main reason for the observed OPRC impact. Not surprisingly, the statistical
significance of WORK is much higher than that of OPRC. Holding everything else constant,
crop production was increased where road improvement works were actually implemented
regardless of contractual arrangements. This is obvious: Without actual works, people’s
connectivity would not be improved. The marginal effect is estimated at 0.95. Notably,
however, this does not mean that OPRC has no effect on connectivity. It has an important
indirect impact (see further discussion below).


Technically, the measured impact can be associated with all kinds of works implemented,
such as rehabilitation, gravel roads, emergency works, installation of culverts and road signs.
Given the timeline of the project implementation and follow-up survey, it is likely to be the
impact of initial rehabilitation works under OPRC. But other possibilities cannot be
excluded.7

  To answer this question, more detailed and frequent data would be needed on both project implementation and
farmers’ behavior (i.e., household surveys).

One difference from the previous estimation result is that the production function with
WORK exhibits increasing returns to scale. The degree of returns to scale is estimated at
1.236 with a standard error of 0.122. However, the production system, again, looks highly
land-intensive: The coefficient of land, H, is the largest at 0.55 among production factors.
Labor is positive and weakly significant, but its elasticity is much smaller than land.

The first stage regression can provide more insight into the relationship among the OPRC,
actual road works and the resultant agricultural production growth. From the IV estimation
with OPRC, it is found that the coefficient of SLOP is negative and significant (Table 9). This
can be interpreted to mean that more road improvement and maintenance works are needed
where the slope of the terrain is less steep, and therefore, more drainage capacity is needed.
The coefficient of KMT4 is also found to be significant. It is consistent to the view that the
project was focused on remote and isolated areas.


The second column model of the table shows that the use of OPRC contributed to more
frequent road works. Recall that regardless of the project, local governments and
communities can implement some other road maintenance or emergency works, whenever
needed. But since the government has already been committed to the 5-year maintenance
under the OPRC, the treatment roads were more likely to receive necessary road works in a
timely manner. The coefficient of OPRC is significantly positive at 0.18, meaning that the
OPRC roads have an 18 percentage point higher probability of receiving road works than
other non-OPRC roads. There seems to be a systematic difference in share of households
with actual work between OPRC and non-OPRC areas (Figure 8). As discussed above, this is
the most important indirect effect of OPRCs.


This result is consistent with another model to test the placebo effect. No significant impact
of OPRC is found when the data are limited to cases where no road improvement works were
carried out. The sub-sample size is 828, and the estimated coefficient of OPRC*t is -14.28
with a standard error of 14.72 (Table 10). Thus, the OPRC can have an impact only if actual
work is implemented. This is considered as the same effect as the placebo effect.

Finally, the impact of OPRC on market sales is examined: The total value of crops sold in the
market is regressed on the same independent and instrumental variables as above. No
significant impact of OPRC is found. The coefficient of OPRC*t is not significant.

On the other hand, the impact of actual road improvement is found to be positive, but the
observed impact seems to be relatively weak: The marginal impact is 0.273, and it is only
significant at the 10 percent level. All the indications are that although OPRCs or road
improvements in general are conducive to increasing crop production, people still may not
benefit from possible market opportunities. Their market participation is limited. This is
generally consistent with a view that transport services may not be available or too
expensive, even though roads are improved. The coefficient of transport spending, of which
the available data are limited to less than 90 households at each round of the surveys, is
negative and significant, meaning that high transport service prices are constraining farmers’
market sales.


In addition, feeder roads should form one road network, but there are still many roads that are
in poor condition in the study area. Finally, other complementary facilities and services, such
as warehouses and processing mills, may also be needed to facilitate people’s market
participation.

VI. CONCLUSION


Rural access is among the most important infrastructure elements to stimulate economic
growth in rural and remote areas. Many rural farmers and local businesses are still likely
faced with a crucial constraint to have access to input and output markets. The literature is
generally supportive of the importance of feeder road connectivity in rural areas. Without the
feeder road network maintained in good condition, it is difficult to improve agricultural
productivity and encourage farmers to particulate in market transactions.


One of the most important challenges lies in maintenance of feeder roads. It is often
neglected under budget pressure given limited available resources. Particularly, unpaved
feeder roads require more frequent maintenance. Output- and performance-based road
contracting (OPRC) is considered as an important policy instrument to ensure sustainability
of road maintenance after the road rehabilitation. It normally requires contractors to not only
improve roads but also maintain them through routine and emergency works.


Using the instrumental variable technique, the paper examined the impact of the recent
OPRC experience in Chipata and Katete Districts, Zambia. By comparing the two areas: one
                                             - 28 -




area along the feeder roads under the OPRCs, and another area where socio-economic
characteristics are broadly similar and there are comparable feeder roads but there are no
OPRCs, it is found that the OPRC has a significant impact on agricultural production. This is
mainly attributed to the positive impact on production of maize and groundnuts, two major
crops grown in the study region.


Most of the measured OPRC impacts are associated with actual road improvement works
regardless of contractual arrangements. This is obvious: Without actual works, people’s
connectivity would not be improved. On the other hand, any road work can improve people’s
connectivity if it is not OPRC. The most important effect of the OPRCs is that the OPRC can
increase the probability of receiving necessary road works whenever needed. The
government has already been committed to the 5-year maintenance under the OPRCs, and the
contractors are explicitly obliged to maintain those roads to meet the agreed performance
criteria. Regardless of OPRCs, the government will carry out road improvement and
maintenance works, whenever necessary, and it actually did. However, road works on non-
OPRC roads seem to be more vulnerable to budget pressure. Without OPRCs, the probability
of receiving road works is 18 percentage points lower than OPRC roads.


Road improvement works can also contribute to facilitating farmers’ market participation.
The impact of actual road improvement is found to be positive and significant, though
relatively weak. People’s market participation is generally limited because of a number of
constraints. Of particular note, the impact of transport service costs is found negative on
farmers’ market sales. It is consistent with the view that transport services may not be
available or too expensive, even though roads are improved.
