    I.        Introduction
Global poverty, as measured by the international extreme poverty line of US$1.90 a day, is becoming
increasingly concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is also increasingly concentrated among
households engaged in subsistence agriculture in environments characterized by uncertainty from
conflict, vagaries of the weather and international food price fluctuations (World Bank 2016).
Understanding how to achieve sustainable increases in household incomes in this context is key to
ending extreme poverty.

Uganda offers important lessons in this regard. Uganda experienced conflict, drought and price
volatility in its most important agricultural commodities in the decade from 2003 to 2013. This was
also a decade in which Uganda recorded impressive rates of poverty reduction. Uganda saw the second
fastest percentage point reduction in extreme poverty per year in Sub-Saharan Africa.2 The proportion
of the Ugandan population living beneath US$1.90 a day fell from 62.2 percent in 2003 to 32.2 percent
in 2013. Understanding the drivers of this reduction is important both for offering lessons on how to
end extreme poverty in Uganda, but also for other countries in the region that have not experienced
such a remarkable reduction in poverty.

Understanding the drivers of poverty reduction is a complex task, and an analysis of observational
data does not always allow the causes of this progress to be uncovered. Nevertheless, careful analysis
of a nationally representative panel data set collected from 2006 to 2012 in combination with data on
conflict events, weather and prices allows us to describe the type of income growth households
experienced and to assess the importance of these external events in determining progress.

Uganda’s progress in reducing poverty in earlier years from 1993 to 2006 is a remarkable story of
success that has been well told. Annual reductions in the national poverty rate of 1.9 percentage points
resulted from the restoration of peace and stability to much of the country after Yoweri Museveni
came in to power in 1986, the series of economic liberalization reforms that were implemented in the
1990s (such as coffee marketing reforms), and the investments by households and firms that these
encouraged (see for example, Collier and Reinika 2003, Appleton 2004, Deininger and Okidi 2004).
The narrative of Uganda’s continued, albeit slightly slower, progress in reducing poverty since 2006 is
less familiar. This was a period in which growth started to slow as the gains from the reforms were
fully realized, and weak infrastructure and corruption increasingly constrained private sector
competitiveness (World Bank 2015).

In this paper we use a nationally representative panel data set of 2,356 Ugandan households visited
four times between 2006 and 2012 to document the type of income growth they experienced. We take
advantage of the panel nature of the data to control for unobserved, time-invariant, household
characteristics and analyze the degree to which income growth was driven by exogenous changes in
prices, weather and the cessation of conflict during the period considered. We utilize the methods
outlined in Dell et al. (2014) in which the impact of weather shocks is identified by using panel data
and including household fixed effects to disentangle the impact of the shock from the impact of
omitted variables which could be causing bias. This framework has been used to analyze the
relationship between weather and household welfare outcomes in Munshi (2003), Dercon (2004),
Yang and Choi (2007), Thomas et al. (2012), Anttila-Hughes and Hsiang (2013) and Hill and Porter
                                                            
2 Uganda reduced the extreme poverty rate by 2.9 percentage points a year, second only to Chad, which reduced the
extreme poverty rate by 3.1 percentage points per year. This is using poverty numbers reported in Povcalnet as of January
2016, and using the surveys deemed comparable by World Bank 2016.

                                                                                                                       2 
 
(2016). We extend this analytical framework to also examine the impact of external price shocks and
conflict events on income and consumption.

We find substantial income growth, particularly in crop incomes, for both the average household and
households in the bottom 40 percent of the consumption distribution. Growth in crop income was
accompanied by increasing commercialization with 72 percent of farmers in the bottom 40 percent
selling their crops in 2012 compared to 60 percent in 2006. We find that much crop income growth
during this period is explained by good weather, peace and improved efficiency in food markets, rather
than technological change in the nature of agricultural production. Rainfall and prices together can
account for 51 percent of the improvement in crop income for all households, and 66 percent of the
improvement in crop income for the bottom 40 percent respectively. Although the overall progress
during this period was good, there were years in which the prices of agricultural products fell and
rainfall conditions were not good, resulting in negative average crop income growth for some
households. This was particularly the case in the poorer and more vulnerable Northern and Eastern
regions, and as a result their overall income growth and progress in reducing poverty was slower.

Diversification of income offered households the ability to protect consumption from weather shocks,
but it was less effective in mitigating price income shocks. Education is essential to enabling
households to diversify and, as a result, to insure consumption from weather shocks. However,
diversification alone was not enough to fully protect consumption from shocks. As a result, a decrease
of 10 percent in the price of maize and beans results in a 5.1 percent reduction in consumption for
the average household, and a 10.5 percent reduction in consumption among the bottom 40 percent.
A decrease in rainfall of 10 percent results in a decline of 4.8 percent in per capita consumption for
the average household.

The significance of external forces in driving income and consumption growth among the poorest
households during this period of poverty reduction underscores the role that macro conditions and
stability play in determining the fortunes of households. The government’s success in securing peace
in the north of the country and in allowing the development of agricultural markets for farmers to
take advantage of new regional trade opportunities ensured widespread welfare gains. However, it also
underscores that these gains are vulnerable and can be easily reversed by events beyond a
government’s control such as bad weather or price drops.

We also document that despite seemingly favorable conditions for agricultural investment during this
period, there were very few changes in the way agricultural households produce. Specifically, few
households increased adoption of improved inputs. Although it is not possible to calculate the returns
to the use of inputs from the observational data available, we do observe that increased household
input use is correlated with crop income growth. It is possible that these findings can be explained by
the fact that the expected returns from input use remained negative for many farmers that chose not
to use inputs (such as found in Ghana in Rosenzweig and Udry 2016). Indeed, the widespread presence
of low-quality inputs reduces the returns to many inputs available on the market (Bold et al. 2015).

It is also possible that barriers to the adoption of inputs reduce their uptake. Bandiera et al. (2015)
document that providing extension and access to credit to households increases their adoption of
improved inputs, which suggests that lack of knowledge and credit constraints limit the degree to
which households can take advantage of a favorable environment for investment. Regardless of the
cause, the limited modernization of agricultural production observed during this period highlights that


                                                                                                     3 
 
better investment opportunities need to be available to farmers in Uganda, and further research on
the interventions needed to ensure this is warranted.

This paper fits into the literature that uses household panel data to understand the drivers of income
growth and welfare improvements (as in Deininger and Okidi 2003, Dercon 2004, Gunning et al.
2000, Jalan and Ravallion 1998, 2004). The focus of the analysis is on the exogenously determined
factors. These are both the factors we can better identify the impact of, and, as it turns out, the factors
that seem to explain much of the income changes observed. The findings are consistent with the
results of Dercon (2004) and Gunning et al. (2000), in which weather shocks are found to be important
determinants of household income growth.


II.           Data
The analysis in this paper uses data from 2,356 households across Uganda, present in all the waves of
the nationally representative Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS) from 2005/6 to 2011/12. This
survey is one of the LSMS-ISA surveys and has data on household characteristics, household
consumption and income from a variety of sources. It also contains a rich agricultural module, a
module on shocks, and is accompanied by a community survey. Many of the modules in the survey
are comparable to the modules used in the nationally representative Uganda National Household
Survey (UNHS), which is a cross-section survey and is used to compute the official poverty numbers.
The consumption module is identical across the two surveys.

Four rounds of the UNPS are used in this analysis comprising data collected in 2005/6, 2009/10,
2010/11 and 2011/12 (henceforth 2006, 2010, 2011 and 2012). Households can be matched across
rounds using a unique household identifier, and, in addition, a sample of households that split from
the original household during this period are also followed. The attrition in the UNPS was quite
substantial between 2006 and 2010, but it has been moderate in the latter three rounds (see Table 1).
For the purposes of this analysis we focus on households that were present in all four rounds of the
UNPS and that are engaged in agricultural production: a total of 2,356 households. This is done to
ensure the panel is balanced, but it does result in the exclusion of households that have split from
original households. Given the majority of this analysis is on agricultural income growth, and given
many split-offs represent households that have moved out of the agricultural sector, this is not too
much of a concern. Nonetheless, our findings are unchanged when the split-off households are
included in the regressions.3

The analysis uses both consumption and income aggregates (crop income, livestock income, wage
income -agricultural and non-agricultural-, and income from non-farm self-employment) calculated
from the UNPS data. The consumption aggregate used is the aggregate constructed by the Uganda
Bureau of Statistics to generate the official poverty statistics. The majority of the income aggregates
come from the Rural Income Generating Activities (RIGA) database, which uses standardized
protocols to generate gross income aggregates across waves. Where inconsistencies were noticed, they
were communicated to the RIGA team and corrected in the protocols we used. The RIGA aggregates
calculate crop and livestock income using information on the amount of goods produced by the
household in the last 12 months and the price of these goods reported by the household. Prices are
imputed from other sampled households when they are not collected. The measures of crop and
livestock income calculated are gross income not netting out costs of land, labor or purchased inputs.
Wage income is generated from data collected on wages earned in the last 12 months. The self-
employment income aggregate calculated all self-employment income earned in the last 12 months
and nets out the cost of purchased inputs. Purchased inputs can be quite a large share of the income
from self-employment activities such as petty trading or handicrafts and netting out the cost of these
inputs is important. For more details on how these aggregates are constructed, see Carletto et al.
(2007).

In order to assess real changes in incomes and consumption across time the analysis converts the
nominal consumption and income aggregates into real aggregates. The national Consumer Price Index
(CPI) is used to convert the consumption aggregate across years. Differences in the cost of living
across space in Uganda are also accounted for by using a combination of the consumption aggregate
provided by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics and the regional poverty lines. The regional poverty lines
reflect differences in the cost of non-food requirements across regions and urban and rural locations
in Uganda. Differences in the cost of food items are already incorporated in the consumption
aggregate provided. For this analysis, the ratio of the poverty line across regions is used in order to
correct for price differences across regions.4 The consumption aggregate and the income aggregates
are divided by this ratio in order to bring all aggregates to one national price. Descriptive statistics on
the consumption and income aggregates are presented in the next section.

In addition to documenting changes in consumption and income aggregates, the paper explores the
drivers of changes in these aggregates. It relies on data collected in the household survey on household
demographic characteristics, distance to market, extension visits, and the type and quantity of inputs
used in agricultural production. Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the key household
characteristics used in the analysis.

As Table 2 highlights, on average, there has been surprisingly little change in the use of agricultural
inputs in Uganda; which is perhaps unexpected given that this was a time in which crop prices—and
thus presumably the returns to using inputs— changed considerably. In general, input use is very low
in Uganda in comparison to other countries in the region with data collected using a similar survey
instrument (Sheehan and Barrett 2014, Binswanger and Savastano 2014).



                                                            
4 This may be an imperfect measure of regional price differences if regional food price differences are quite different from

regional non-food price differences. Ideally the income aggregates would also correct for food price differences across
regions, however in the absence of having these data, using non-food price differences appears to be a reasonable
approximation.

                                                                                                                          5 
 
In addition, the analysis incorporates data from other sources on market prices of agricultural
products, weather and conflict. These data provide objective measures of shocks that households
experienced during this time. Objective measures are preferred to subjective measures, in which the
households themselves report whether they face one type of shock or another (Thomas et al. 2013,
Anttila-Hughes and Hsiang 2014, Hill and Porter 2016). Households are more likely to recall shocks
that resulted in large losses of income and not report those that did not. As such, there is likely to be
significant reporting bias in the occurrence of shocks, which will bias the estimate of the impact of
shocks on income and welfare. However, the cost of using objective measures of shocks is that our
analysis is restricted to covariate shocks. That is, shocks experienced by everyone in a given area
(weather, prices, conflict) that can be observed in data other than the household survey. This means
that we are unable to say much about the idiosyncratic shocks that affect welfare in Uganda. In
particular, we are unable to look at the impact of health shocks on welfare despite a literature that
suggests un-insured health shocks have a substantial impact on welfare in Uganda (Bridges and
Lawson 2008, Helbert et al. 2013, Aliga 2013).

More specifically, the following sources of secondary data were included:
   Monthly price data collected at eight wholesale markets across Uganda as part of the Uganda
       Bureau of Statistic’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data collection exercise. A 12-month moving
       average was assigned to each household according to the date in which they were interviewed.
       All prices are deflated by the national CPI before being used in the analysis such that the prices
       used capture relative price changes, i.e. the degree to which the maize price increased or
       decreased more than the price of the basket of consumption goods represented in the CPI.
       Each household is assigned the prices of the closest market, measured by geographical
       distance.
   Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI) calculated from satellite rainfall data for each
       pixel using a maize crop model calibrated to the growing seasons across Uganda. Specifically,
       the geoWRSI v 3.0 was used with the global PET and RFE5 v2 (2001-2014) time series. The
       WRSI is an indicator of crop performance based on the availability of water for the crop during
       the growing season. The index ranges from 0 to 100, where 100 means there was no deficit in
       the water needed, and each household was assigned the average between the main and short
       seasons for the period for which crop income data were collected. 6 These data have been
       merged into the UNPS using the Geographical Information System (GIS) coordinates of
       households.
   As a proxy of the incidence of violence and conflict, we use the number of fatalities per year
       in a 25-kilometer vicinity of each household, obtained from the Armed Conflict Location
       Event Dataset (ACLED).


Table 3 provides a description of the type of crops grown by the households for the latter two years
of the analysis. Maize, beans, matooke and cassava are the four most important crops as a share of
total crop income. Maize and beans are universally important—comprising 10 percent or more of
crop incomes in all regions in all years. Matooke is important in all regions except the Northern region,
                                                            
5Potential evapotranspiration (PTE) and satellite gauge rainfall estimate (RFE).
6 For those households in Uganda living below the equator, the main season runs from February to July and the short
season runs from August to January. For households living in bimodal areas above the equator, the main season runs from
August to January and the short season from February to July. For households in the north of the country, one season is
present. The static soil WHC and average LGP inputs for Uganda that come with geoWRSI were used.

                                                                                                                     6 
 
and cassava is important in all regions except the Western region. Given their importance, the analysis
presented focuses on the prices for maize and beans, but other prices were also used in preliminary
analyses.7

For the most part, it is crops that are produced for household, domestic and regional consumption
that dominate crop income. Coffee is important for some households, but does not comprise more
than 10 percent of crop income in any region in either 2011 or 2012. Given that coffee plays a relatively
small role, and given the difficulty of examining the impact of coffee prices on coffee income with
only four data points (all households in Uganda face farm-gate prices driven by the same international
coffee price as documented by Fafchamps and Hill (2008)) the role of coffee prices is not considered
in the analysis. Sunflowers produced for commercial production has increased in importance in recent
years, particularly in the north, but it is still a relatively small share of crop income and is also not
considered further. The growth of sugarcane, particularly in the Eastern region has been reported, but
by 2012 it was not comprising more than 1 percent of crop income in that region.

Even though food crops dominate crop income, crop sales are important and increasingly so. The
share of household income coming from crop sales has increased from 2006 to 2012. Figure 1 shows
that the share of crop income marketed has increased over time for the bottom 40 percent. The share
of households in the bottom 40 percent selling crops has increased from 60 percent in 2006 to 72
percent in 2012.

Figure 2 presents data on weather, price and conflict by region across the years considered in the
study. Weather conditions were in general good, with rainfall deficits less than 20 percent in most
cases. However, 2010 was a more challenging year for households and higher losses were observed
(although no higher than 30 percent). The four years of data presented suggest that rainfall is more
volatile in the north and east than in the center and west. The data also suggest larger losses on average
in the west across the four years, but this may be on account of the fact that a maize model has been
used to calculate the losses while this is not a crop grown in the west. The inclusion of regional
dummies or household fixed effects controls for this persistent difference in the analysis.

       Prices have exhibited more volatility during this period than weather. Real prices for maize appear
       well-integrated across Uganda during this period, in that they move together quite strongly in all
       regions. Bean prices appear less well integrated. Maize and bean prices increased from 2006 to 2010.
       The real price of beans continued to rise in most markets in 2011, but maize prices crashed in that
       year.

       Conflict with the Lord’s Resistance Army affected the Northern region of Uganda during the early
       part of this period, and also impacted some households in the northern part of the Central region.
       The conflict was stabilized in 2008 and the impact of this is seen clearly in the reduction of conflict
       related fatalities reported in ACLED from 2006 to 2010. There was an increase in the number of
       fatalities reported in 2010 but this fell again by 2011.

III.   Trends in income growth and poverty reduction
Information on real income per capita for households in Uganda across time is presented in Figure .
The data represent weighted averages of income from crop farming, livestock production, wage
employment (in agriculture and non-agriculture sectors) and non-farm self-employment. All values
are in 2011 prices. Figure 4 provides the same information, but for households that were in the bottom
40 percent of the consumption distribution during at least one of the survey rounds. Figure 3 and
Figure 4 show that agricultural income is the main source of income for households, particularly for
those in the bottom 40 percent. Together, crop and livestock income comprised 57.5 percent of the
income of Ugandan households in 2012 and 70 .2 percent of the income of the bottom 40 percent.
Within agricultural income, crop income dominates livestock income.

Income from non-farm self-employment is the second most important source of income when
considering all households and it is followed by non-agricultural wage income. Finding a measure of
non-agricultural self-employment income that compares well to the measures of gross agricultural
income used in this analysis is not straightforward. Much self-employment income comes from trade
and taking only gross sales does not give an idea of how much was earned. We use net self-employment
income in the analysis, which is gross self-employment income net of raw materials, operating
expenses and wages paid to others. Raw materials account for 81 percent of these expenditures.
Operating expenses and wages paid to others account for 12-13 percent of gross income, suggesting
that self-employment income would be a marginally more important source of income were these
expenses not netted out. Non-farm self-employment income is also the second most important
income source for poor households, but only just. For poor households non-agricultural wage income
is also a very important source of income.

Figure 3 and Figure 4 indicate substantial growth in real per capita agricultural incomes from 2006 to
2012 based on household survey data. On average, real per capita crop income grew by 9 percent per
year, and by 8 percent for the poorest 40 percent. This reflects an increase in crop income between
2011 and 2012, but even when the period prior to 2011 is considered, growth in per capita crop income
was robust: 4 percent on average across all households and for the bottom 40 percent. Growth in real
per capita livestock income was quite constant at 5 percent annual growth (




                                                                                                   10

The national picture points to a pattern of sustained crop income growth across the years of the panel
survey: 2006 to 2012. However, when crop income is disaggregated across regions, a slightly different
picture emerges. First, from Figure 5 it is clear that the level of agricultural income varies substantially
across regions, with much higher levels of crop income recorded in the Western region. The lowest
levels of crop income are seen in the Northern region. Although crop income in the Central region is
not particularly high, this reflects the fact that a much lower share of total income in the Central region
comes from agriculture. In the Northern and Eastern regions agricultural income is the dominant
source of income, as in the Western region, but overall levels of income are much lower.

Secondly, Figure indicates that agricultural income growth was negative between 2010 and 2011 in
the Eastern and Northern regions. Although growth recovered between 2011 and 2012, the negative
growth rate in the north and east resulted in both regions falling behind the center and west. In the
following section we examine what drove these patterns.

8 It is worth noting that the panel analysis may overestimate national average per capita agricultural growth (and under-

estimate national average per capita non-agricultural growth) as households that attritted over time are probably more
likely to be those that have moved out of agriculture. However, the nationally representative cross-sections undertaken
during this time show that many households have stayed in agriculture, so this is unlikely to be a large source of bias.

To assess the role of different types of income growth in reducing poverty in Uganda we correlate the
real per capita income aggregates with household consumption. This way, it is possible to ascertain
whether growth in one of the income sources has been more important for increasing consumption
than other income sources, particularly among the bottom 40 percent. Specifically, a fixed effects
model was estimated using the log of per capita consumption and the log of per capita income (for
each source of income), allowing an analysis of the relationship between changes in income and
changes in consumption. Interview year and month fixed effects were also included. The analysis was
conducted only for 2006 and 2010 as there is a marked reduction in the consumption aggregate after
2010 that is hard to explain and is inconsistent with the national poverty trends.9
                                                            
9One possible explanation is the methodological differences in the collection of consumption data in the 2011 and 2012
survey rounds. Computer Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI) was introduced in the UNPS for the 2011 and 2012 rounds

                                                                                                                   13 
 
The results are presented in Table 5 and indicate that increases in all income sources are positively
correlated with increases in consumption, as expected, with the exception of agricultural wage income.
Agricultural income growth is more strongly correlated with consumption growth than the other
sources of income growth, and the correlation is larger for the bottom 40 percent (column 2). These
results suggest that agricultural income growth has been more important for poverty reduction during
this period than other types of income growth.

This confirms the finding of other work undertaken on this period in Uganda. Christiaensen and
Kaminski (2014) undertake decomposition analysis using the same panel data set and find that
agricultural income growth contributed to 18 percent of consumption growth from 2006 to 2010.
They also estimate that agricultural growth contributed to 70 percent of the poverty reduction
observed from 2006 to 2010, confirming the greater importance of agricultural income growth among
the poorest households. Decomposition analysis undertaken using the Uganda National Household
Survey10 for the Uganda Poverty Assessment also indicates that it was poverty reduction among those
households that cited agriculture as their main source of income that accounted for most of the
poverty reduction in Uganda throughout the period 2006 to 2013 (World Bank 2016). These findings
are also consistent with a literature that points to agricultural income growth as a major source of
poverty reduction in the country (Kassie et al. 2011, Dorosh and Thurlow 2012, Government of
Uganda 2014).

IV.           Analytical approach
Given the relevance of agricultural income, we now turn to examine the drivers of crop income and
consumption growth in Uganda for the period 2006-2012.11 More specifically, we examine the
correlation between crop income growth and changes in production practices, access to markets and
services. We also examine the degree to which changes in the external environment affected crop
income.

To capture the impact of changes in production practices on crop income growth, data on the area
and ownership of the plot being harvested; the use of fertilizer, improved seeds and pesticides and
household labor inputs (both hired labor and family labor) are used. Data on changes in market access
and extension services are also considered.

Changes in the external environment that may have impacted crop income are analyzed by looking at
the effect of prices, weather shocks and conflict fatalities. Changes in the external environment can
have an impact on crop income directly and/or indirectly through the way that households produce.
For example, good weather has a direct impact on crop income by determining production quantities
but it can also impact crop income indirectly through the household’s decision to apply inputs as a
response to weather. Good prices for crops increase crop income but they also increase the incentives
to produce and may encourage increased input or labor use. As a result, when production practices
are included in the regression along with variables that reflect the external environment, they are likely
to capture some of the impact of the external environment on incomes.

For this reason, we run two regressions. The first regression includes variables on production
practices, market access, extension services and the external environment. The panel nature of the
data allows the inclusion of household fixed effects to control for time-invariant household
characteristics. However, it is possible that omitted time-invariant characteristics influence both
production practices and market access, and agriculture income. For example, it is possible that
changes in distance to market and provision of extension services in the community are not fully
exogenous, with investments in infrastructure and services being targeted to communities that are
more (or less) agriculturally productive. For this reason, the coefficients on these variables cannot be
considered causal. The results of this regression provide an indication of the correlation between
changes in income and changes in production practices, markets access and services. Although the
variables describing external shocks are exogenous to household behavior, the coefficients from this
regression only pick up their direct impact on income (not its indirect impact through household
behavior) and do not represent the full impact.

In a second regression, only those variables that considered to represent the external environment are
included along with household fixed effects. This captures the full impact of the external environment
on income. As Dell et al. (2014) discuss, the inclusion of fixed effects ensures that time-invariant
aspects of the environment (such as the propensity for weather shocks to occur) are captured. This
allows the coefficient to properly identify the impact of the change in external factors on agricultural
income.

The two models estimated are given by equations (1) and (2) below:
                                                            
11 Crop income has represented 65 percent or more of the total agricultural income (not including wages) at the household

level for the period studied.

set of variables representing production practices, containing the average plot area harvested by
household12 i at time t, and an indicator variable if the household owns or owns and rents plots (only

seeds/seedlings and hired labor, and the amount of family labor spent on the farm.13 , includes the
distance in kilometers of household to the nearest market selling agricultural inputs at time t and

urban market to household at time , the WRSI weather measure experienced by household at time
 , and the number of fatalities in proximity to household at time . 14 Household fixed effects are
denoted by .

Equation (2) is also applied to other sources of income and consumption in order to assess the
importance of drivers of crop income in affecting total income and household consumption.

Finally, the following specification is used:
                                             ,                         ,   ∗   ,                   (3)

in which household characteristics,       , are interacted with    order to identify which households
were better able to take advantage of (or protect themselves from) changes in the external environment
during this time. This sheds some light on what factors may help to further reduce poverty and
vulnerability in Uganda.


V.            Drivers of agricultural income growth
The results from the first model are presented in Table 6. As expected, per capita crop income is
significantly higher among those who farm more land and apply more labor, fertilizer and pesticides.
Households that used fertilizer and pesticides had crop incomes that were 12 and 19 percent higher
than households that did not. The correlation between the use of these inputs and crop income is
higher for the households that were in the bottom 40 percent: for these households crop incomes
were 22 percent higher for those that used fertilizer and 14 percent higher for those that used
pesticides. Crop income is not significantly higher among those using improved seeds. Although there
was some increase in input use (at the extensive margin) among panel households during this period,
the increase was relatively marginal. The proportion of households using fertilizer increased from 17

                                                            
12 Self-reported by the household.
13 An alternate specification was also run using the value of purchased inputs rather than a series of indicator variables in
an attempt to capture the quantity of inputs used. The results are qualitatively unchanged.
14 A variation of specification (1) and (2) where a measure of whether the household was affected (i.e. was within a 5 km

radius) by a flood episode identified between November and December 2011, and between August and September 2012
was also included in E, but results are not statistically significant from zero. Flood episodes were calculated by digitizing
flood imagery downloaded for flood events recorded in the Emergency Database (EM-DAT). These data are available
from 2011 onwards, so they only cover the last wave of the UNPS used in our analysis (2012), which might explain the
insignificant results obtained.

                                                                                                                         16 
 
percent in 2006 to 24 percent in 2012 while pesticide use hovered around 12-13 percent. As a result,
technology adoption did not contribute to large increases in crop incomes on average.

Households that farmed more land received higher per capita crop income, but per capita income did
not increase by much for each additional hectare of land cultivated. The coefficient estimates suggest
that an increase in the area of land farmed by 1 hectare increased crop income by around only 2
percent. In addition, very little change in the area of land cultivated was recorded during this time.
Detailed analysis on area of land cultivated in Uganda and other Sub-Saharan Africa countries shows
that relying on self-reported land areas results in considerable (and systematic) measurement error
(Kilic et al. 2014 and Carletto et al. 2015). Indeed, we see the self-reported area of land cultivated
fluctuating over the four rounds perhaps more than the true area of land cultivated. However, there
is very little growth in the land cultivated over the period and, as result, expansion of land cultivated
by these households did not contribute much to the increases in average per capita income growth
observed.

Households that apply more labor—both family labor and hired labor—also have higher crop
incomes, as expected. A 10 percent increase in the number of days of family labor provided by the
household is correlated with crop income increasing by 2 percent. The amount of household labor
reportedly spent on agricultural production increased substantially between 2006 and 2011, falling
again in 2012. This may not reflect a true change in household labor applied during this time. However,
even if this does represent a real increase, the increase of 50 percent reported would only account for
10 percent of the increase in crop income. Regression results indicate that households that hire labor
have indeed agricultural production that is higher by 15-25 percent, but the use of hired labor actually
fell during this time.

There is no direct income effect of extension provision in the village or changes in the distance to the
local market.

In summary, although production practices are, as expected, significantly correlated with crop incomes
in Uganda, the evidence does not suggest that changes in production practices contributed much to
crop income growth during this time. For households that did change production practices, large
changes in income were observed but few households changed production practices during this time,
with the exception of increasing the amount of family labor applied to crop production (until 2011).

The little change in production practices among farmers in itself is a puzzle. This was a period in
which the return to changing production practices was relatively good: the weather was favorable and
prices were high. It could be that even with favorable conditions the perceived or actual return to new
technologies is still low (as suggested in Bold et al. 2015), or that farmers had difficulties in accessing
inputs, in utilizing properly (lack of knowledge) or the financing needed to make input purchases (as
suggested in Bandiera et al 2015). Further analysis of why so few households adopted modern
production practices is needed to better understand input adoption and utilization.

The results in Table 6 suggest that it was the external environment, rather than changes in production
practices, that can explain crop income growth during the period, particularly for the poorest. The
strongest correlates of changes in crop incomes presented in columns (1) and (2) are changes in rainfall
and prices. The estimates in columns (3) and (4) show that better rainfall and higher prices contributed
substantially to higher income. A 10 percent increase in water sufficiency (rainfall) increases crop
income by 9.9 percent. A 10 percent increase in the price of maize or beans increases crop income
                                                                                                        17 
 
by 4.5 and 9.2 percent respectively. The point estimates are higher for poorer households, given that
they are even more dependent on climate and prices. For these households, a 10 percent increase in
rainfall and a 10 percent increase in maize and bean prices, results in a 13.4 percent and 13.0 percent
increase in crop income respectively. Rainfall and prices improved over 2006-2012, and together they
can account for 51 percent of the improvement in crop income for all households and 66 percent of
the improvement in crop income for the bottom 40 percent respectively.

Changes in prices may reflect the beneficial effects of improved infrastructure investments, increased
efficiency in domestic markets, and development of new export markets. Markets in the north and
east of Uganda have been improving since 2006 thanks to infrastructure investments, new export
markets opening up in South Sudan and in Kenya, and growth in trade services, which improved
efficiency in markets. However, markets are subject to changes in supply and demand conditions
within and outside Uganda. Sustained growth in the incomes and welfare of rural households will also
require growth in agricultural productivity—possibly through the use of improved seeds, fertilizer,
pesticides and irrigation—and diversification to other more remunerative forms of employment.

The results in Table 6 also indicate that peace had a strong impact on income as a result of its impact
on changing production practices. In columns (1) and (2) when production practices are included in
the specification, conflict does not impact income. However, when production practices are not
included we see that crop income grew by 1.5-1.8 percent for every 1 percent reduction in the number
of fatalities in a 25 kilometer radius of the village. This means that the establishment of peace observed
between 2006 and 2010 resulted in more than a doubling of crop income.

The regression results presented thus far do not include year fixed effects given the objective of the
analysis is to explain changes in crop income across years. However, it is possible that other differences
across years, correlated with changes in the external environment, are driving the results. In order to
test this possibility a regression model including year fixed effects is presented in Table 7. The
significant results of weather, prices and peace are robust to this addition and the magnitude of the
coefficients remains unchanged. However, maize prices become insignificant. This is not surprising
given how integrated maize markets appear in Figure 2 resulting in very little within year variation. As
a final robustness check, a specification in which prices of regional crops—matooke in the center and
west, and cassava in the north and east—were included instead of bean prices is run (results are not
shown). These checks also produced the same findings: production practices played a role, but changes
in the external environment were the main drivers of changes in crop income in Uganda.

As Figure 2 shows, the external environment was changing in different ways across the four regions
during the period 2006-2012. The Northern region in Uganda is the most drought prone and although
rainfall was in general good during 2006 to 2012, the rainfall shortfall in 2010 was much larger in the
north than elsewhere in the country. The Eastern region also experienced substantial variability in
rainfall. The north is also the part of the country that experienced conflict until the cessation of
hostilities in the late 2000s, and thus it is this north that saw the largest decline in the number of
fatalities as the result of peace. Maize prices are expected to be particularly important in the north and
east, both on account of its predominance in production in the east, but also because a lot of maize
trade into Kenya and South Sudan comes from these regions. There are also large and increasing
regional variations in welfare across Uganda. The Western and Central regions are more economically
developed, and households in these regions exhibit more diversified incomes as a result. They have
had many more years of stability than the Northern region and these regions have seen substantial
development during this time. More stable climatic conditions and rapid urban growth in and around
Kampala has also helped.

Given these divergent starting points and experiences, regressions are run separately for each of the
four regions and presented in Table 8. Weather is a strong driver of crop income growth in the north
and east, but not in other regions. And particularly in the north: a 10 percent rainfall shortfall results
in a reduction in crop income of 38.3 percent in the north. Prices have been important in all regions,
but maize prices are only important in the north and east. A 10 percent reduction in the maize price
results in a 6.6 percent and 11.1 percent reduction in the east and north respectively, while it had no
impact in the center and west. Bean prices are important in all regions, with a 10 percent increase in
the bean prices increasing income by 6.3 to 13.5 percent across regions. The results also indicate that
the cessation of violence in the late 2000s only impacted crop income growth in the north.

VI.    The impact of weather, prices and peace on non-agricultural
       income and welfare
In light of the importance of prices and weather in driving crop income growth and to determine how
well households are able to compensate these changes through the diversification of income, the
impact of prices and weather on other sources of income is explored further in this section. We also
examine whether positive trends in prices, weather and peace contributed to household consumption
growth, and also the degree to which consumption growth is vulnerable to price falls or rainfall
shortfalls, using the fixed effects specification set out in equation (2). Table 9 presents the results.
Column 1 reports the results for crop income that were discussed in section IV. Columns 2 to 5 detail
results for livestock income, agricultural wage income, non-agricultural income and non-farm self-
employment income. Column 6 examines the impact on household consumption using consumption
data for 2006 and 2010 but not 2011 and 2012 given concerns over the consumption data collected in
later years. Table 10 presents results for the bottom 40 percent.

Rainfall shocks do not impact income from livestock; perhaps because for livestock the rainfall over
multiple seasons is important. However, wage employment and self-employment out of agriculture
are inversely and significantly correlated with rainfall. The results suggest that diversification of
productive activities can be an important risk hedging strategy for households in Uganda, particularly
the poorest. If agricultural income is affected by climate shocks, households can offset this with
increased non-farm income. It is not clear whether household labor is pulled into own-farm
agricultural production as a result of the increased demand for agricultural labor when the rainfall is
good or whether household labor is pushed out of agriculture as a result of a desperate need to smooth
consumption when rainfall is bad.

Although some of the weather shocks can be insured through diversification, households are not able
to fully insure their consumption from the impact of weather. A decrease in rainfall of 10 percent
results in decline of 4.8 percent in per capita consumption (4.1 percent when considering households
in the bottom 40 percent in 2006).

In contrast to rainfall, price increases impact all sources of income positively. This means that when
prices are good total income is positively impacted, but conversely when prices are bad households
are not able to mitigate crop income shortfalls by increasing income from other sources. The exception
to this is agricultural wage income, which is surprising given findings in other countries that
agricultural wage labor is positively impacted by crop price increases and our expectation that higher
prices would result in increased demand for agricultural wage labor. It is not clear why a negative
relationship is observed in this context.

The impact of prices on consumption is, however, smaller than the impact of prices on crop income,
indicating that even though households are not able to diversify to manage price risk, they are able to
reduce the impact of prices on consumption by other means. A decrease of 10 percent in the price of
maize and beans results in a 5.1 percent reduction in consumption. The impact is almost doubled for
the bottom 40 percent—a 10 percent price decrease results in a 10.5 percent reduction in
consumption—consistent with the fact they are less able to insure consumption from income
shortfalls.

Although the cessation of violence had a positive impact on crop income, a significant impact on
consumption is not observed. The results suggest that this may be because households switched out
                                                                                                     22 
 
   of wage labor activities into self-employment activities in agriculture as peace was restored. Similarly,
   since the consumption data for 2011 and 2012 are not reliable and it is then when conflict declined
   the most, it is not possible to capture the effect on this welfare measure.

   Thus far, all of the regression results presented have relied on a monetary dependent variable and so
   prices have both been part of the construction of the dependent variable and the explanatory variable
   included in the analysis. As a robustness check on the findings, we conduct a similar exercise using
   non-monetary measures of welfare that are correlated with consumption: z-scores (standard scores)
   of weight for age and weight for height among children less than 5 years of age in the household. The
   results are presented in Table 11. These data were only collected from 2010 onwards and only collected
   for children, making the sample size available for these regressions much smaller. For this reason only
   one price—the price of beans—is considered. Although the results are not consistently significant
   across specifications, they do show that weight for height is positively impacted by rainfall, and that
   weight for age is positively affected by higher prices, as suggested by the regressions on income and
   consumption.

   Overall the results show that while income diversification is an effective strategy to manage some
   sources of risk—such as weather—the amount of diversification undertaken by Ugandan households
   is not able to fully insure total income and consumption from fluctuations in the external environment.
   These findings suggest that it is desirable for households to be more fully insured against shocks than
   they currently are.

   Using equation 3, we explore if households with a higher level of human capital and access to financial
   instruments-such as having a savings account or a loan- are better equipped to smooth the impact of
   climate shocks and price declines. We also test the effectiveness of some the economic institutions,

                                                                                                                24 
    
such as better access to markets and the use of technical assistance, at mitigating these shocks. The
only factor that helped households to alleviate the adverse effect of shocks was the level of education
of the household head. Households with a savings account or a loan from a financial institution are
not more resilient to these shocks. Similarly, enhanced access to markets where agricultural inputs are
bought and where agricultural products are sold, as well as technical assistance do not make a
difference in the way households cope with climate shocks and variation in prices.

Figure 6 depicts the results for education and shows that higher levels of education of the household
head reduce the negative effect of rainfall shocks (measured by the WRSI index) on both crop income
and per capita consumption. Having a head with some e primary education reduces the negative effect
of rainfall by 2.8 percent compared to those with no education while for those with complete
secondary education, the reduction increases to 4.9 percent. Something similar occurs if we look at
the effect on per capita consumption, albeit the magnitude is smaller and only the results for some
secondary education among the bottom 40 percent remain significant.

More education facilitates diversification by enabling increased participation in the labor market,
particularly in the non-agricultural sector. In addition, more educated individuals may assess and
respond to risk more successfully. For both crop income and per capita consumption, the mitigation
effects of higher education level are larger for households belonging to the bottom 40 percent of the
distribution.

Finally, we examine whether consumption in the Northern and Eastern regions is just as reliant on
the external environment as crop income in these regions proved to be. Given the limited sample size,
households in the north and east are pooled together as are households in the center and west. We
also just consider bean prices. The results confirm that the consumption of households in the north
and east is more reliant on changes in the external environment than the wealthier households in the
center and west (Table 12). The difference is largest when considering prices: a 10 percent increase in
the bean price is associated with a 6.7 percent increase in consumption in the north and east, and a
2.5 percent increase in consumption in the center and west. As discussed, the reliance on the external
environment has both been a source of welfare improvements and vulnerability for Northern and

 Eastern households. Ultimately, increasing the resilience of these households to protect consumption
 from the downside of risk is essential to secure the gains in welfare for these regions.

VII.    Conclusion
 Over the last 15 years Uganda has been an African success story, reducing extreme poverty faster than
 most other countries in the continent. However, Uganda remains a very poor country. In 2013, a third
 of its citizens still lived below the international extreme poverty line of US$1.90 (2011 PPP) a day.
 Understanding the drivers of past success provides important lessons for those interested in seeing
 further poverty reduction both in Uganda and elsewhere. This paper contributes to this endeavor by
 focusing on the drivers of an important source poverty reduction for households in Uganda—
 agricultural income growth—and assessing how these drivers impacted welfare dynamics during the
 period 2006-2012.

 The results show that Uganda was able to get many of the fundamentals right. The government
 secured stability in the north and enabled the development of private agricultural markets across the
 country, resulting in real relative prices increases for agricultural commodities that poor farmers grow
 and sell. However, the results also highlight areas where less progress was made. Extension services
 and input use were associated with crop income growth, but overall production practices did not
 change much in agriculture. As a result, modernization of agricultural practices contributed very little
 to crop income growth.

 Our findings also underscore that luck was on Uganda’s side: good weather benefited many
 households and the positive price trends in international food and commodity markets during this
 period contributed to price increases for maize, beans and other commodities that benefited farmers.
 As a result, a favorable external environment (some of it facilitated by policy and some of it not),

                                                                                                      26 
  
rather than modernization of production practices accounted for much of the change in agricultural
income, contributing to higher household consumption and lower poverty.

The importance of the external environment in bringing about agricultural income growth offers
important lessons for future poverty reduction in Uganda and elsewhere. Ensuring stability in the
region and further promoting efficient crop markets and regional exports will be important for crop
income growth in Uganda. However, the importance of the external environment to deliver poverty
reduction also offers some cause for concern. When prices are poor or when the rains do fail, crop
income growth falters and consumption falls, with adverse consequences for poverty reduction. This
is indeed what happened in the Northern and Eastern regions in 2011.

Households need to be able to both benefit from good prices and weather and have access to coping
mechanisms to be protected from low prices and poor weather. The results presented here also some
lessons in this regard. Diversification of income offers households the ability to protect consumption
from weather shocks, although it appears to be less effective in mitigating price income shocks.
Education is essential to enable households to diversify income, insuring themselves from weather
shocks as a result. However, diversification alone is not enough to fully protect income from shocks.
The inability of Uganda to implement a functioning public safety net system has resulted in households
relying on informal networks and own savings to cope with shocks. These are imperfect insurance
mechanisms, with potential negative long term effects, and as a consequence vulnerability remains
high.

Finally, encouraging further agricultural income growth as a result of improvements in production
practices offers sustainable gains that are not dependent solely on prices and weather. Understanding
why farmers did not adopt agricultural technologies during this time of high prices needs to be a key
area of analysis going forward.
