    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
    This Regional Partnership Framework (RPF) outlines the World Bank Group (WBG) stra-
    tegic program for nine Pacific island countries (PIC9): Kiribati, the Republic of the Mar-
    shall Islands (RMI), Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Republic of Nauru, Republic of
    Palau, Independent State of Samoa, Kingdom of Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Seven of
    these countries are IDA-eligible and have seen a substantial increase in WBG presence and
    engagement in recent years. The RPF builds upon the deepening engagement with Samoa,
    Tonga, and Kiribati, and the ability to channel significantly more resources to FSM, RMI,
    Vanuatu and Tuvalu following their recent reclassification as IDA eligible. The RPF also
    outlines options for engagement with Nauru and Palau, which are IBRD countries.

    This RPF (FY17–21) comes at a time when IDA support to the Pacific Island Countries
    (PICs) is rising to unprecedented levels. In IDA15, the annual minimum base IDA allocation
    per country was SDR1.5 million, rising to SDR 3 million in IDA16 and SDR4 million in IDA17.
    IDA18 will see an increase of the base allocation to SDR15 million, which will have a poten-
    tially transformative impact on the IDA-eligible PIC9, including the most fragile. In Kiribati,
    Tuvalu, RMI and FSM, all on the WBG harmonized list of fragile and conflict-affected situ-
    ations, the resources available will almost quadruple. The development of regional initia-
    tives has provided additional scope to leverage substantial regional IDA resources, which
    now constitute almost one-third of the portfolio. The mobilization of significant trust fund
    resources from large bilateral development partners in the Pacific, notably Australia and
    New Zealand, has also been instrumental in expanding support.

    The unique features that define the PIC9—and which consequently have a direct bearing
    on their development agenda—are their small size (they are among the 25 smallest inde-
    pendent states on earth), remoteness, geographic dispersion and environmental fragil-
    ity, and high degree of exposure to a volatile mix of economic shocks, climate change,
    and natural disasters. Largely owing to their economic geography, growth in almost all
    PICs is lagging behind growth in other developing countries. Although extreme poverty is
    relatively uncommon in the PIC9, poverty and hardship are fairly widespread in six of the
    nine countries, and access to cash incomes, basic infrastructure, social services, and nu-
    tritious food is uneven. Because the population is widely dispersed, often across archipela-
    gos, the costs of public administration and service delivery are high, limiting the quantity
    and quality of services available. Even those PICs with significant development assistance
    have persistent gaps in service provision.

    This RPF reflects the results of a significant body of analytical work, including a System-
    atic Country Diagnostic (SCD) undertaken for all the RPF countries, except Nauru (which
    was not a member of the World Bank at the time of its completion). The SCD identified the
    critical constraints and opportunities facing these countries in sustainably attaining the
    WBG’s twin goals. An important conclusion of the SCD analysis is that advancing toward
    those goals requires both regional and country-specific approaches. The RPF also draws
    on the emerging findings of the Pacific Possible report, currently being completed, which
    assesses the long term growth impact of more fully exploiting a few available opportuni-
    ties and more effectively addressing major threats such as the impact of climate change
    and the epidemic in non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
                                                          Regional Partnership Framework         7




This RPF is also informed by the lessons from implementing programs across the Pa-
cific over the past decade. It takes into account the WBG’s comparative advantage and
the activities of key development partners in the Pacific. The resulting framework sup-
ports the PICs in maximizing their potential by drawing on regional lessons and solutions,
while providing flexibility at the individual country level to tailor the Bank’s engagement in
alignment with national strategies.

Using the SCD and Pacific Possible as the key analytical foundation, the RPF defines the
following four focus areas:

   •	 Focus Area 1: Fully exploiting the available economic opportunities. The thrust of
      the WBG program in this area is improved management of fisheries, increased in-
      comes from agriculture, expanded tourism opportunities.
   •	 Focus Area 2: Enhancing access to employment opportunities. The key interven-
      tions outlined in this area focus on broadening opportunities for labor mobility and
      improving education outcomes. Together with constraints placed on development
      by gender-based violence, the PIC9 countries experience gender inequality. This will
      be addressed in a cross cutting manner, while entry points to address Gender-Based
      Violence will be identified.	
   •	 Focus Area 3: Protecting incomes and livelihoods. A key focus will be on strength-
      ened preparedness and resilience to natural disasters and climate change. Interven-
      tions will also help countries strengthen health systems and address NCDs.
   •	 Focus Area 4 (Cross-cutting): Strengthening the enablers of growth and opportu-
      nities (macro-economic management, infrastructure and addressing knowledge
      gaps). The WBG interventions in this area will support the efforts of the PIC9 to
      strengthen macroeconomic management, improving access to basic services and
      connective infrastructure and addressing the prevailing knowledge gaps.

The IDA18 scale up will enable a more substantive WBG engagement to help address the
unique challenges faced by the PICs. Notably, it will enable scaled up support to help ad-
dress drivers of fragility (e.g., climate change and natural disasters, youth unemployment,
NCDs), and also exploit opportunities in the maritime and tourism sectors that will help
create longer term growth. The focus areas under the RPF are closely aligned to the IDA18
themes of jobs and economic transformation; climate change; gender and development;
fragility, conflict and violence; and governance and institutions. IDA18 will allow the WBG
to embark on a far more ambitious program of support, both in terms of investments as
well as through increased capacity building. IFC will seek to capitalize on the IDA18 scale
up to enhance its engagement by developing a pipeline of potential investments that could
draw on the IDA18 Private Sector Window. Ensuring that projects are ready to be imple-
mented, even if it requires longer project preparation time, will be an important considera-
tion in the management of the portfolio going forward. The WBG will increase the scope
of its support for preparation and implementation of activities, providing more hands-on
implementation support from WBG staff, particularly in fragile situations. Greater WBG
presence in the field will be facilitated through a progressive rebalancing of operational
and technical positions to a new hub in Fiji and to other field offices where possible.
8   Regional Partnership Framework




    The WBG will explore opportunities to further regional approaches that benefit the
    Pacific region. Regional approaches are critical in the Pacific because solutions to many
    of the development challenges are regional in nature, e.g. connectivity through aviation,
    maritime or internet, climate change, fisheries and labor mobility. By using regional ap-
    proaches, the PIC 9 can also benefit from economies of scale through bulk procurement,
    centralized implementation arrangements, and WBG resources can effectively be de-
    ployed to support multiple countries.

    The WBG will continue to work closely with development partners to coordinate its en-
    gagement across the Pacific. The WBG will continue to make use of critical trust fund
    resources from Australia and New Zealand. In Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu, the
    WBG shares Liaison Offices with the Asian Development Bank, and a new joint Liaison
    Office is being opened in Tuvalu. Regional organizations across the Pacific also constitute
    critical partners for the WBG.

    The Results Framework in this RPF identifies key results on the basis of the existing pro-
    gram and key planned activities and will be adjusted during the Program and Learning
    Review to take changing country realities into account. Risks to the implementation of
    the RPF in the PIC9 are assessed as Substantial and include: (i) exogenous macroeconomic
    shocks; (ii) political and governance risks; (iii) natural disasters and climate risk; and (iv)
    implementation and capacity constraints.

    In summary, this RPF will guide a WBG engagement in the Pacific which will build on
    what has been achieved so far but also seek to achieve further impacts in three main
    ways. First, increased IDA18 allocations will provide opportunities to finance projects that
    are larger in size and scope. Second, building on the results of the SCD and other recent
    analytical work, the WBG program will be highly selective and focused on helping the PICs
    make the most of a few key opportunities and effectively mitigate the main risks to in-
    comes and livelihoods which they are facing. Third, the WBG program will put special
    emphasis on addressing the drivers of fragility in the Pacific (issues related to institutional
    capacity, growth in youth population and urbanization, climate change and natural dis-
    asters, as well as gender) to enhance the sustainability of the activities being carried out
    and of the progress being achieved.

16   Regional Partnership Framework




     This Regional Partnership Framework (RPF) outlines the World Bank Group (WBG) stra-
     tegic program for nine Pacific island countries (PIC9): Kiribati, the Republic of the Mar-
     shall Islands (RMI), Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Republic of Nauru, Republic
     of Palau, Independent State of Samoa, Kingdom of Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.1 The RPF
     comes at a time when the WBG presence and engagement across the Pacific is larger than
     ever before, reflecting a concerted effort to increase its presence in some of the world’s
     most remote and fragile countries. While the RPF outlines and consolidates the WBG
     strategy for engagement in each of the PIC9, which in many cases requires regional solu-
     tions, the RPF primarily focuses on avenues to support each of the countries rather than
     presenting a consolidated regional strategy.

     The RPF builds upon the deepening engagement with more established clients, such as
     Samoa and Tonga, and the strengthened partnership and increase in resources chan-
     neled to FSM, RMI, Vanuatu and Tuvalu made possible by their relatively recent reclas-
     sification as IDA eligible. These are IDA-eligible countries, having benefited from favora-
     ble financing trems under IDA’s small states island exception (40 years maturity with 10
     years grace period) during IDA17, which will be extended to IDA18.

     Nauru and Palau are classified as IBRD countries ineligible for IDA18 resources. Access
     to IBRD financing for these two countries is possible only through guarantee schemes or
     engagements that would provide the appropriate credit enhancement. WBG engagement
     with Nauru is in its infancy due to its recent membership (April 2016). Similarly, the WBG
     has had limited engagement with Palau since its membership in 1997. WBG engagement
     in these countries, which have a significant higher per capita income than the remaining
     countries in the PIC9, will therefore be different from the other countries included in the
     RPF. The WBG will first and foremost seek to increase its knowledge base of the two coun-
     tries and explore innovative entry points that build on the WBG’s comparative advantage
     and for which resources, such as Trust Funds, may be available to support both Nauru and
     Palau in their development objectives. Moreover, the World Bank will continue to work with
     other partners to support regional projects that may directly or indirectly support Nauru
     and Palau.

     In recent years the WBG engagement of the WBG has increased markedly across the
     Pacific. World Bank commitments in the IDA eligible countries among the PIC9 totaled
     US$48.56 million in 2010 and have since risen more than tenfold to US$ 553.48 in 2016
     (Pacific-wide, totaled US$235 million in 2010 and have since risen fourfold, to US$1.06
     billion in 2016). Up to US$500 million in new private sector investment has been mobi-
     lized through IFC interventions, including US$30m in additional direct or co-investment
     by IFC. IFC’s Advisory program since 2010 has been valued at US$25m. An increase in the
     annual minimum base IDA allocation (from SDR1.5 million in IDA15 to SDR3 million in IDA16
     and SDR4 million in IDA17) was central to this growth, which will continue as the IDA18
     minimum base allocation increases to SDR15 million. The resulting scale up in financing will
     enable a more substantive engagement in the IDA-eligible PICs to help address their unique
     challenges (Box 1.1).

 BOX 1.1: IDA18 SCALE UP
 The increase in the base allocation for IDA18 will provide significantly more resources for IDA-eligible coun-
 tries among the PIC9. This will allow the WBG to embark on a far more ambitious program of support,
 both in terms of investments as well as through increased support for capacity building. Implementation
 support will be increased with a view to ensuring enhanced project readiness, additional regional programs
 will be embarked upon in new areas such as maritime engagements, partnerships with regional actors and
 development partners will be expanded as will be support for climate change and disaster preparedness
 The wide ranging body of analytical work undertaken in preparation of the RPF, including the Pacific Pos-
 sible study, allows the WBG to target especially transformative opportunities for the PIC9. The support in
 the RPF period will therefore allow an increased focus on supporting the PICs more fully exploiting select
 economic opportunities (Tourism, Fisheries, ICT, Labor mobility), addressing the drivers of fragility (cli-
 mate change and natural disasters, youth unemployment and the NCD crisis) with gender and strengthen-
 ing of institutional capacity, as cross-cutting issues.

 IFC will seek to capitalize on the IDA18 scale up to enhance its own support, particularly of FCV countries
 (those grappling with fragility and sometimes conflict and violence). IFC will seek to increase the total
 volume of financing and number of investment projects by catalyzing support, resources and thought
 leadership from across the WBG, other multilaterals, NGOs, IFC clients and other stakeholders to meet
 the challenges of fragility. A dedicated lead for FCV and IDA investment will make technical resources
 available and identify opportunities for cooperation across WBG to help transaction teams, advisory and
 country staff deliver more meaningful projects in these most difficult markets. To develop a pipeline of
 potential investments, teams will draw on the Private Sector Window using blended finance, project risk
 guarantees and currency risk management products.


The development of regional initiatives in information and communication technology
(ICT), aviation, fisheries, and climate change resilience across the Pacific has provided
scope for the World Bank to leverage substantial resources from the IDA regional pro-
gram, which now constitute almost one-third of the portfolio. The mobilization of signifi-
cant trust fund resources from large bilateral development partners in the Pacific, notably
Australia and New Zealand, was also highly instrumental in expanding support. Box 1.1
describes the regional and country strategies that defined the WBG’s program of engage-
ment during this period of expansion.

18   Regional Partnership Framework




     The period covered by this RPF—Fiscal Years (FY) 2017–21—will see the completion of a
     range of activities initiated during IDA17, followed by an increase of WBG support to the
     IDA-eligible PICs to historically unprecedented levels during IDA18. The increase in the
     IDA18 base allocation will significantly benefit most Pacific countries and in some of the
     PIC9 it will almost quadruple the national IDA resources available.

     The program of support envisioned in this RPF will build on a significant body of recent
     analytical work exploring options to harness regional synergies, while recognizing the
     unique characteristics of each of the PIC9 to tailor country-specific solutions. This RPF
     defines a broad program of engagement that will benefit from the strengths and opportu-
     nities of Pacific institutions, traditions, and customs and draw upon the combined capac-
     ity of the World Bank and IFC to facilitate increased collaboration across the region and
     respond to the priorities of individual countries.

     The proposed framework for WBG engagement in the Pacific is also well aligned with
     the IDA17 and IDA18 themes. During IDA17, in countries with active programs, there was
     increased focus on inclusive growth, climate change and fragile and conflict-affected
     states. IDA18 presents a set of policy and financing commitments to match the global
     ambition of fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, and the engagement
     in the Pacific will reflect this goal. The focus on climate change, gender, fragility, labor
     mobility/employment, and economic governance in this RPF is fully aligned with the IDA18
     themes.

      BOX 1.2: THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S EXPANDING ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PACIFIC

      From 2000 to 2005, the WBG program was defined in a Pacific Regional Strategy (May 2000) covering
      nine PICs (diverging slightly from the group covered in this proposed RPF)† It reflected the findings of a
      combined Commonwealth Secretariat–World Bank Joint Task Force on Small States, which assessed the
      development challenges specific to small states and the best ways to meet those challenges.

      Between 2005 and 2009, the WBG program was governed by the Regional Engagement Framework for
      Pacific Islands FY2006-2009 (May 3, 2005). That framework maintained the focus on the nine PICs
      targeted in the Pacific Regional Strategy. It aimed to strengthen government capabilities for delivering
      services and sought to improve the incentives for private sector-led growth and employment. The WBG
      goal was to deliver its assistance primarily through strategic economic and sector work and targeted
      technical assistance; selective lending was envisioned for activities that would leverage donor resources
      to maximize their policy impact. Toward the end of the period covered by the Regional Engagement Frame-
      work, to support its deepening engagement in the Pacific, the WBG initiated country-specific strategies.

      Between 2010 and 2014, the WBG initiated the first-ever country strategies in six of the PIC9: King-
      dom of Tonga (2010), Kiribati (2011), Tuvalu (2011), RMI (2013), FSM (2014), and the Independent State of
      Samoa (2012). Undertaking country-specific strategies afforded the WBG the opportunity to establish a
      well-informed relationship, dialogue, and operational program with each of the countries and take a “deep
      dive” into the specific development challenges and opportunities in each of the countries.

         2.1	 Country Context
         The PIC9 have substantial resource endowments, especially in fisheries, and also ben-
         efit from natural and cultural riches but face common development challenges. These
         include small size and remoteness, geographic dispersion and environmental fragility, and
         high exposure to a volatile mix of economic shocks, climate change, and natural disas-
         ters. The PIC9 are among the 25 smallest independent states on earth. They range from
         Tuvalu, with a population of around 10,000, to Vanuatu, with 250,000 (Table 2.1). Most of
         these countries are archipelagos, and range from 1 inhabited island (Nauru) to more than 70
         (Vanuatu), with most islands separated by large tracts of ocean. Most of the PIC9 have an
         average population per inhabited island of less than 5,000 individuals. Kiribati’s popula-
         tion of 110,000 extends across an area as large as India—yet the combined land mass of
         its islands is less than the area of New Delhi.

The Pacific islands fall broadly into three cultural areas, each covering a subset of in-
dependent states: Melanesia (Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea), Mi-
cronesia (FSM, Kiribati, RMI, Nauru, Palau), and Polynesia (Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, New
Zealand). Cultural traditions vary across the PICs, yet in most countries indigenous cul-
tures are a strong presence in national life, policies, and decisions. All of the PIC9 are de-
mocracies (some more stable than others) and experience varying degrees of influence by
traditional leaders.

The PIC9 tend to retain close ties to countries with which they have had significant his-
toric relationships. RMI, FSM, and Palau have entered into “Compacts of Free Association”2
with the United States of America (USA). Under the Compact, the three countries receive
yearly financial transfers as well as access to other United States services and programs.
The USA has full authority and responsibility for the defense and security of the Compact
countries, whose citizens can live, work, and study in the USA without a visa. In the South
Pacific, many Tongans and Samoans possess dual nationality with New Zealand, reflect-
ing their close historical relationship with that country. Twenty-nine percent of Australia’s
development assistance is channeled to the Pacific. For New Zealand, the figure is 59 per-
cent.

2.2	 Recent Economic Developments and Outlook for
	    the Regional Partnership Framework Period

The extreme smallness and remoteness of PIC9 economies powerfully affect local op-
portunities for business and economic expansion (Figure 2.1 highlights their remote na-
ture). A telling comparative statistic is distance to markets, weighted by the size of those
markets. According to that metric, the Pacific islands are 12,000 km from centers of eco-
nomic activity, versus 8,000 km for the Caribbean islands and 10,000 km for some of the
most remote Indian Ocean islands. Constraints inherent in the small domestic markets
of the PIC9—low purchasing power and challenges in capturing economies of scale—are
compounded by excessive distance from foreign suppliers, which increases the unit cost
of inputs while pushing up the costs of exports. These factors drive up the costs of private
production and reduce returns for private firms, while narrowing the set of feasible eco-
nomic opportunities. The high frequency and intensity of natural disasters adds another
substantial layer of risk to starting or expanding a business.

Smallness, remoteness, internal dispersion, and vulnerability to natural disasters trans-
late into specific macroeconomic outcomes. They include low and volatile economic growth,
structural budget deficits (excluding grants), structural trade deficits, vulnerability to
external shocks (such as shocks to commodity prices), and elevated risks of debt distress.

     Following World War II, in 1947 RMI, FSM, and Palau passed from Japan’s control to the U.S. under United Na-
     tions auspices as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. In 1986, RMI, FSM, and Palau entered into
     Compacts of Free Association with the US.
22   Regional Partnership Framework




     Growth in almost all PICs is lagging behind growth in other developing countries. Over
     the last ten years, none of the PICs (except for Nauru) has been able to generate per capita
     income growth of more than two percent, and several of the PICs are experiencing almost
     no growth in real GDP per capita (Figure 2.2).3 As a result, few new jobs are being created
     and in most of these countries, less than half of the working-age population is employed.
     Given low growth and limited employment opportunities, labor migration to neighboring
     countries and remittances are critical drivers of increased living standards in the PIC9.
     Remittance flows to Tonga and Samoa are among the highest worldwide in relation to the
     countries’ GDPs, at 26 percent and 18 percent, respectively. The already relatively high
     cost of transferring money to Pacific countries could further increase due to reduction in
     correspondent banking services by global banks in recent years. The withdrawal of cor-
     respondent banking relationships, as well as the limited number of Banks generally oper-
     ating in Pacific island countries is affecting the ease and cost of remittance transactions.
     The increase in the cost of sending remittances combined with closures of Money or Value
     Transfer Services’ bank accounts including in Samoa, Tonga, RMI among others, remains
     a source of concern.

          It is important to bear in mind that the occurrence of natural disasters frequently distorts the growth picture
          in these economies.

These countries specialize in a few economic activities in which they are globally compet-
itive, notably fisheries, to some extent agriculture, and tourism. Revenues from fisheries
as a share of GDP have risen rapidly since 2007, with Kiribati and FSM seeing the biggest
increases in absolute terms (Figure 2.3). The importance of tourism is highlighted by the very
considerable share of GDP coming from the services sector—often exceeding two-thirds
of GDP (as seen in Table 2.1). The fastest-growing economies, Vanuatu and Samoa, have
seen a rapid expansion in their trade, transport, and hospitality sectors with rising tourist
arrivals from Australia and New Zealand. Tourism-related services have sustained growth
in Palau in the absence of other sustained drivers of growth, and they have supported
some growth in Tonga (Figure 2.4).

In most of the PIC9, public expenditure and investment funded through domestic taxes,
natural resource revenues, and especially development assistance, is a significant con-
tributor to GDP. While Nauru experienced a sharp, temporary boost in growth from 2011
to 2014 after the resumption of phosphate mining, the reopening of Australia’s Regional
Processing Centre for asylum-seekers, and an increase in revenues from fishing licenses,
growth is projected to revert to more modest rates in coming years.

In addition, growth in the PICs tends to be highly volatile. Short-run volatility is typically
the result of external economic shocks and natural disasters, with their characteristic
cycles of decline and recovery, as well as the funding of infrastructure projects through
foreign aid, which can lead to a temporary acceleration in growth.

Of the PIC9, only Tonga, Samoa, and Vanuatu have their own currencies (pegged to cur-
rency baskets). Palau, RMI, and FSM use the US dollar, while Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu
use the Australian dollar. The scope for independent monetary policy in the PIC9 is thus
very limited, with the exchange rate serving as the nominal anchor for these economies.
Inflation has been moderate in recent years, with volatility typically being a result of
changes in import prices or supply shortages in the wake of natural disasters.

The financial sectors of the PIC9 tend to be small and weak financial sector regulation
and supervision puts them at heightened risk of being cut off from the international
financial system in the context of global de-risking. After 9/11 there has been a tighten-
ing of international anti-money laundering/counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) rules
that impose significantly heightened compliance requirements on the PICs. This affects
incoming remittances, donor funding, imports and outgoing transactions as well as some
niche activities that are important for some of the PICs such as offshore financial cent-
ers (Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Vanuatu) and registration of ships (the Marshall Islands). While
all of the PIC9 are affected by global de-risking, Vanuatu, RMI, Nauru and Tuvalu already
have lost correspondence bank relationships or are under threat of losing access.

While average revenues as a percentage of GDP in the PICs are at a similar level to those
in other small states and comparator countries, public expenditures are systematically
higher, even though in most cases only a minimum level of public services is delivered
(Figure 2.5). This outcome is largely explained by the inability of the PICs to achieve econo-
mies of scale, given their size and the scattered distribution of their populations, as well
as by the high cost of imported inputs. At the same time, however, government expendi-
ture has a dual role in many of the PICs, which is not only to provide public services to the
population but to directly create employment and distribute aid flows. The result in some
cases may be inefficient levels of recurrent expenditure (particularly on the public sector
wage bill).
26   Regional Partnership Framework




     Development assistance plays a critical role in funding public expenditure in most of the
     PIC9, and on a per capita basis, is among the highest in the world (largely due to their
     small populations). Development assistance helps to support economic activity by pro-
     viding the public goods and services—including key infrastructure—that sustain private
     sector production, business development, and trade. It also supports economic growth by
     facilitating government procurement of goods and services from the private sector. Such
     procurement, when correctly mobilized and deployed, prevents aid funds from crowding
     out private sector participation in the economic development agenda and opens greater
     opportunities for the private sector in areas such as energy generation and other infra-
     structure services.

     Even with significant development assistance, the PIC9 have persistent gaps in the pro-
     vision of services. Development assistance has helped raise living standards, particularly
     by supporting public sector provision of critical health and education services. However,
     because the population is so widely dispersed across the islands in many of the PIC9, the
     cost of public administration and service delivery is high, affecting both the quantity and
     quality of services available. Some services are not performed at all, or not provided to an
     adequate standard.

While for most countries structural budget deficits are likely to persist over the RPF
period, increased revenue from fisheries has generated significant fiscal surpluses in a
few countries, including Kiribati, Tuvalu, and FSM. For these countries, the critical chal-
lenge over the RPF period will be to devise a strategy that creates an appropriate balance
between using some of the increased revenue to address current development challenges,
building fiscal buffers to be able to deal with volatility, and saving for the future. The Com-
pact countries in the North Pacific face the additional challenge of adjusting revenue and
expenditure to avoid a potential “fiscal cliff” in 2024 (RMI,FSM)/ 2025 (Palau), when USA
Compact grants are scheduled to expire and income from the Trust Funds of these coun-
tries is unlikely to fully replace the grants.

Six of the eight PICs (Nauru, Palau, FSM, RMI, Kiribati, and Tuvalu) have sizeable trust
funds, which have in some cases also played an important role in financing public expen-
ditures, given a shortfall of revenues from other sources. The trust funds in FSM, RMI, and
Palau were established as part of the Compact of Free Association with the USA, and their
main purpose is to fully replace Compact grants upon their expiration at the end of the
compact period. Kiribati has a trust fund that was built with phosphate tax revenues, while
Tuvalu has a donor-funded trust fund. The objective is that the investment income from
these funds—which are invested in foreign financial assets—will eventually help the PICs to
achieve a measure of budgetary self-reliance, in recognition of the reality that the PICs will
not be able to generate sufficient revenues on their own to meet long-term development
financing needs. Nauru also had a large sovereign wealth fund built from the country’s phos-
phate resources. However, following the exhaustion of primary phosphate reserves, poor
investment decisions led to a rapid loss in value of the country’s sovereign wealth fund,
which is now being dissolved. With the support of development partners, Nauru estab-
lished a new Trust Fund in 2016 funded from government as well as development partner
resources. The objective of the Trust Fund is to provide Nauru with a sustainable source of
income in the event that income from the Australian Regional Processing Center and the
exploitation of secondary phosphate resources declines.

Structural trade deficits are also the norm in the PICs. The import bill in the PICs tends
to be relatively high compared with that of other small states due to their narrow and un-
diversified domestic production bases, which can meet only a small proportion of the de-
mand of the domestic population (Figure 2.6). On the other hand, high trade costs coupled
with dispersion of population and low economic density mean that it is also difficult for
firms to achieve economies of scale in the production of traded goods, so export receipts
tend to be relatively low compared with those of other small states (Figure 2.7).

Debt sustainability is another clear challenge for the PIC9, owing to their susceptibility to
external shocks, small economic bases, low levels of exports, limited budgetary resources,
and modest growth perspectives. Levels of public debt vary significantly across the PIC9
(Figure 2.8) Four of the PIC9 (FSM, RMI, Kiribati, and Tuvalu) are currently classified as
having a high risk of debt distress, and three (Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu) are classified as
having a moderate risk. To take advantage of productive investment opportunities while
maintaining aggregate debt sustainability, it is important that the PICs have robust rules
around the contracting of new debt.

2.3	 Regional Efforts to Address Development Challenges
To overcome the challenges inherent in their economic geography, the PICs rely on various
kinds of regional collaboration. A number of organizations promote political and technical
collaboration in the region, notably the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) and the Pacific Commu-
nity (SPC, an abbreviation that stems from its original name—South Pacific Commission).
PIF—the principal political grouping—is an intergovernmental organization established in
1971 to enhance cooperation between the independent countries of the Pacific Ocean. The
Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) implements PIF decisions, harmonizes regional
positions on political and policy issues, and operates technical programs in economic de-
velopment, transport, and trade. SPC is the principal scientific and technical intergov-
ernmental organization in the Pacific region. Established in 1947, it promotes effective,
innovative applications of science and knowledge across the Pacific.
30   Regional Partnership Framework




     To prevent duplication in the aims of these organizations, the Council of Regional Or-
     ganisations in the Pacific (CROP) was created in 1988. It is chaired by the PIFS Secretary
     General and aims to improve cooperation and collaboration among key regional bodies
     such as the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), the Pacific Islands Development Programme
     (PIDP), the SPC, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP),
     the South Pacific Tourism Organisation (SPTO), the University of the South Pacific (USP),
     the Pacific Power Association (PPA), and the Pacific Aviation Safety Office (PASO). Outside
     the CROP agencies, the Pacific Islands Private Sector Organization (PIPSO) is focused on
     supporting private sector development and the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF),
     established in August 2014 through an initiative by the Government of Fiji, is focused on
     establishing a South–South platform for collaborative action on green economic policies.

     In 2014, PIFS began to develop a new strategic framework to streamline the develop-
     ment agenda and prioritize the key challenges for the region. The resulting Framework
     for Pacific Regionalism articulates an overarching vision for the region and streamlines
     the regional agenda by focusing on key priorities, including areas key to WBG support,
     such as fisheries, climate change and ICT. It builds upon, and integrates with, the Small
     Island Developing States (SIDS) Accelerated Modalities of Action [S.A.M.O.A.] Pathway,
     a blueprint for achieving sustainable development in SIDS that was adopted by 115 SIDS
     leaders at the Third UN Small Island Developing States conference in September 2014 in
     Apia, Samoa.

     The Pacific region was a strong supporter of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s)
     in the UN deliberations. Advocacy by the Pacific, and other small islands states, was
     instrumental in the inclusion of a separate oceans goal. Many Pacific governments are
     integrating implementation of the SDGs at the national level as national development
     plans are reviewed and updated. Capacity to deliver on, and monitor, the SDGs is limited in
     the Pacific, as it was with the Millennium Development Goals. With oversight by the CROP
     Sustainable Development Working Group, the National Sustainable Development Strate-
     gies (NSDS) Partnership Group, is providing technical support to member countries in tai-
     loring and integrating the SDGs in their national plans, budgets, and monitoring and evalu-
     ation frameworks. At the regional level, there is also effort in tailoring the global indicators
     to better reflect the Pacific context and to use these regional indicators to monitor the
     region’s progress on the SDGs.

     Joining together to form regional and international cooperative solutions continues to
     hold promise for offsetting challenges stemming from the small size, limited financial
     and human resources, and other constraints besetting the PIC9. Among other achieve-
     ments, regional approaches have delivered gains in fisheries (as seen from the rapid growth
     in revenues depicted in Figure 2.3), education (through the University of the South Pacif-
     ic, for example), ICT, and shared governance and resource management services. Yet the
     results of these strategies and efforts have been mixed and building sustainable coopera-

2.4	 Poverty Profile
Extreme poverty is relatively uncommon in the PIC9. Based on internationally comparable
estimates using the 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) poverty line of US$1.90 per day,
extreme poverty is estimated to surpass 10 percent in only three countries: Kiribati,
Vanuatu, and FSM (Figure 2.9). No data are available for RMI, but proxies indicate that
its poverty levels are similar to those in FSM. The prevalence of extreme poverty is
negligible in Samoa, Tonga, and very likely Palau, and it is just above 3 percent in Tuvalu. No
estimates of the incidence of extreme poverty are available for Nauru, but most segments
of the population will likely have benefited to some extent from the rapid economic growth
in recent years. Relatively high per capita incomes in the PIC9, reasonably widespread
access to land for subsistence agriculture, and the existence of informal, community-based
social safety nets have generally kept the incidence of extreme poverty low. The extreme
poor often live outside traditional social networks. Many of the individuals who are socially
excluded live in urban areas, without jobs, and may be homeless and suffer from physical
or mental disabilities.

Extreme poverty may be limited, but poverty and hardship are fairly widespread in six
of the nine countries. Internationally comparable estimates based on the less austere
2011 PPP poverty line of US$3.10 per day suggest that poverty is relatively widespread
in the PIC9, except for Tonga, Samoa, and probably Palau. It appears likely that about
90 percent of the poor are concentrated in FSM, Vanuatu, Kiribati, and possibly RMI. In
the Pacific, many of the poor inhabit the outer islands, where poverty is structural and
persistent. As in Kiribati, some inhabited islands are coral atolls where very little subsistence
agriculture is possible and more extreme deprivation is likely, particularly compared to
32   Regional Partnership Framework




     typical levels in rural areas. Across the Pacific more generally, a broad sense of hardship
     prevails, experienced as a lack of access to even basic services (including quality education),
     economic opportunities, cash for meeting basic needs (sometimes including customary
     obligations to traditional support networks). Hardship is also increasing owing to the
     impacts of NCDs.

     Across the region, a significant share of the population remains on the edge of poverty.
     Many paths lead households into poverty—the loss of a job, a crop failure, illness, an
     economic crisis that reduces tourism, a natural disaster that deprives them of housing
     and land—. Even relatively minor events can push a poor household into extreme poverty,
     and drive the extremely poor into destitution. Often the poor come from groups that have
     specific social disadvantages and economic vulnerabilities, such as the elderly, individuals
     living with disabilities, children, or female household members.

     Robust evidence is not yet available, but converging trends in related indicators
     suggest that poverty has stagnated or increased in most of the PIC9 since the last data
     were collected. The household surveys used to estimate incomes and poverty levels are
     administered infrequently in the PIC9, and much of the data is not recent. To some extent,
     poverty is likely to have been exacerbated by the 2008–10 global economic crisis,
     the surge in food and fuel prices around the same time (which markedly depleted real
     purchasing power in the Pacific), and the effects of major natural disasters in the PIC9
     countries in recent years.

     The limited data available suggest that incomes have grown more slowly among the
     bottom 40 percent in the PIC9 than in other countries in East Asia and the Pacific (EAP),
     while the gap between those who can meet modern basic needs and those who cannot
     is growing. Data on income trends among the bottom 40 percent (B40) are scant and
     unreliable-a fundamental limitation that is addressed in detail later. Given that overall
     growth in per capita income across the PIC9 has been so low in the past two decades,
     however, incomes of the B40 have almost certainly grown very little. Time-series data for
     estimating changes in the income/expenditure share ofthe B40 are available only forVanuatu,
     Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu. Over multi-year periods in the early 2000s, only in Vanuatu
     did average incomes of the lowest four income deciles increase more rapidly than average
     incomes of the population as a whole. In Tonga, B40 incomes grew at roughly the same
     pace as average incomes; in Samoa, growth in B40 incomes was only slightly lower than
     for the wider population; and in Tuvalu, the differential was more pronounced, consistent
     with the loss of job opportunities for Tuvaluan seafarers (the majority of whom were
     recruited from the outer islands). The PIC9 experience contrasts sharply with the median
     experience in EAP over the 2000s, when incomes of the B40 grew modestly faster than
     overall economic growth. While the traditional social structures in the PIC9 are mostly
     effective in ensuring that people have basic food and housing, the disparity between the
     “haves” and “have nots” is increasing with regard to modern basic needs such as cash
     incomes, basic infrastructure, social services, and nutritious food. Only some members of
     society are able to meet those modern basic needs. Progress in extending access to all has
     been uneven.

2.5	 The Drivers of Poverty and Development Challenges

The SCD provides the major analytical foundation for this RPF. Undertaken for eight
of the PIC9 countries4 and completed in December 2015, the SCD identifies the critical
constraints and opportunities facing the PIC8 in sustainably attaining the WBG’s twin
global goals of ending absolute poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The diagnostic
benefitted from the experience of the WBG in the region since 2000, particularly the learning
gained from implementing country-specific strategies over the past five years.


2.5.1	 Three Fundamental Constraints to Ending Absolute Poverty and
Increasing Shared Prosperity
The SCD identified three fundamental constraints to ending absolute poverty and
boosting shared prosperity in the PIC95. All three are correlated with the unique economic
geography of the PIC9.

The first constraint is the small size and remoteness of the PIC9, which limits economic
opportunities. As discussed, the islands’ long distance from markets and major shipping
routes increases the cost of trade and limits integration in global value chains.

The second constraint relates to the geographic dispersion of the PIC9. A particularly
important consideration is that people living on outer islands have even more limited
access to employment and public services than their counterparts on the major islands.
In these circumstances, employment is often literally out of reach. The lack of economies
of scale in administration and service delivery drives up the cost for the government to
perform its essential public service functions in education, health, and other sectors.
Tuvalu’s experience with its overseas medical treatment scheme is a case in point (Box 2.1).

     BOX 2.1: GEOGRAPHY AND CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS CREATE HARD CHOICES BETWEEN
     	        ADVANCED MEDICAL TREATMENT AND BASIC HEALTHCARE IN TUVALU

     The Government of Tuvalu is committed to providing Tuvaluans the highest attainable standards of health.
     Given the economic geography of the country, as well as its small population, the country instituted the
     Tuvalu Medical Treatment Scheme (TMTS) in 2005 with the aim of funding tertiary health treatment for
     patients who needed advanced surgical procedures overseas that could not be provided at Tuvalu’s only
     hospital. By 2013, spending under the scheme consumed 45 percent of the national health budget, leaving
     fewer resources for providing basic health services, including prevention. This expenditure hobbled the
     government’s efforts to achieve its key policy objective of providing balanced, cost-effective, equitable
     healthcare, particularly basic healthcare, to all Tuvaluans.




4	
     The SCD covered Kiribati, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, Independent
     State of Samoa, Kingdom of Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Nauru became a member of the World Bank only
     on April 12, 2016; therefore it was not included in the SCD but is covered in this RPF. Due to Nauru’s recent
     membership and the lack of statistics about its economy, the knowledge gaps with regard to the country’s
     poverty and shared prosperity profile are significant. They will be addressed during the RPF period.
5	
     Although the SCD covered 8 of the PIC9 countries, for overall consistency, the discussion herein refers to the
     PIC 9.
34   Regional Partnership Framework




     The third constraint is high exposure to economic crises and natural disasters. While
     economic openness is an essential response for small economies to grow and function,
     itleaves them exposed to the volatility of global markets. With their narrow economic bas-
     es, the PIC9 are hampered in building sufficient reserves against catastrophic economic
     and natural events. Their vulnerability is worsened by poor development planning and the
     countries’ limited ability to respond to and manage the risks of economic and natural
     threats. Tropical storms, earthquakes, volcanic activity, floods, droughts, and landslides
     are frequent events in these countries, and their frequency and intensity continue to in-
     crease. Recent estimates show that the expected losses (as a share of GDP) on an annual-
     ized basis far exceed those in almost all other countries in the world. The highest eleva-
     tions in the atoll nations of Kiribati, RMI, and Tuvalu are only a few meters above sea level,
     and these countries may become submerged by 2100 (Box 2.2). The average annual direct
     losses caused by natural disasters in the South Pacific region are estimated at US$88
     million.

          BOX 2.2: PLANNING FOR RISING SEA LEVELS IN KIRIBATI

          Some Pacific countries believe it may already be too late to save themselves from the effects of climate
          change, including rising sea levels and the increased frequency of king tides. The Government of Kiribati
          has purchased 20 square kilometers of land on Vanua Levu, one of the Fiji islands, located about 2,000 km
          from Kiribati’s capital, Tarawa.


     An important conclusion of the SCD analysis is that an appropriate balance of regional
     and country-specific approaches is required across the PICs. The analysis affirmed the
     reality—recognized throughout these countries—that similar, overarching development
     opportunities and challenges can benefit from regional approaches, especially to expand
     tourism, increase revenue from fisheries, broaden opportunities for labor mobility, and
     strengthen disaster risk preparedness. The RPF takes into account the WBG’s compara-
     tive advantage and the activities of key development partners in the Pacific. The resulting
     framework supports the PIC9 in maximizing their potential by drawing on regional lessons
     and solutions, while providing flexibility at the individual country level to tailor the Bank’s
     engagement to the local reality.

     2.5.2	 Fragility in the Pacific 9
     Fragility in the PIC9 has multiple facets but is not characterized by widespread civil or
     political conflicts (which are largely absent). In FY17, the WBG classifies four of the PIC9
     as “fragile situations”—FSM, RMI, Tuvalu, and Kiribati6. These countries have limited state
     capacity and remain extremely vulnerable to external shocks. The risk and resilience as-
     sessment of the PIC9 conducted for this RPF concludes that fragility in these countries
     stems from their extreme geography and limited economic viability, thin institutional ca-
     pacity, urbanization and youth unemployment, poor land governance, and gender-based
     violence. In some cases, elite capture and weak state legitimacy constitute additional
     challenges. Climate change and natural disasters pose an existential threat to the atoll
     nations of the PIC9.

     6	
          Fragile Situations” have: either a) a harmonized average CPIA country rating of 3.2 or less, or b) the presence
          of a UN and/or regional peace-keeping or peace-building mission during the past three years. See http://pub-
          docs.worldbank.org/en/154851467143896227/FY17HLFS-Final-6272016.pdf.

2.5.2.1	 Thin institutional capacity and lack of state legitimacy

A key development challenge for these countries is to ensure adequate capacity to sup-
port effective public service delivery and regulation. With a limited pool of human re-
sources and weaknesses in providing secondary and tertiary education, the PICs often
cannot rely on local labor markets to supply the skills required for some public sector
functions. Often they lack staff to perform all of the functions of a particular department
or ministry, requiring individuals to cover a range of functions. The public sector also faces
competition for human resources from the local private sector and development partners.
Capacity-building efforts are undermined when individuals with newly acquired skills and
qualifications move to new roles within or outside the public sector or move overseas.

Elite capture, lack of state legitimacy, and corruption further reduce prospects for eco-
nomic development. In some PICs, political coalitions are frequently built around a pyra-
mid of patronage, with politicians competing for key posts that provide opportunities for
distribution to coalition supporters down to the constituency level. Entrenched patronage
threatens the delivery of national policy by encouraging frequent policy shifts, leading to
inconsistency and a lack of commitment to policy analysis, formulation, and application.
A common outcome is that the government cannot equitably deliver essential services to
the public. Communities, especially in outer islands, often express high levels of frustra-
tion about the distance they feel from government. Moreover, anti-corruption systems in
some PIC9 experience deficiencies and institutional challenges.

2.5.2.2	Rapid growth in the youth population and urbanization

Demographic data for the PIC9 point to a rapidly growing population of young people
that will ultimately demand employment. On average, 57 percent of the population in the
PICs is below the age of 25—a higher proportion than the average for the developing world
and more similar to rates in least-developed countries. The number of people aged 0–14
substantially exceeds those aged 14–25, so the number of working-age youth will grow
quickly over the next decade. This youth bulge will place increasing pressure on policy
makers to generate employment opportunities in a context where jobs are already few
and far between.

Migration from the outer islands to urban spaces entails a variety of risks that increase
fragility. Urban spaces offer a range of social and economic opportunities for social mobil-
ity, particularly for women and young people, yet migrants from the outer islands cannot
rely on making a smooth transition to urban life. Urban settings, though exhibiting better
economic indicators and service provision rates, are beleaguered by overcrowding, defi-
cient sanitation, lack of jobs, unsafe water sources, and substance abuse, which in some
(although not all) of these countries provokes a general sense of hopelessness, especially
among marginalized youths.
36   Regional Partnership Framework




     Many of the PIC9 lack the institutional capacity to deal effectively with the challenges
     generated by rapid urbanization. Overcrowding is becoming a major concern in several
     PIC9 countries, and it is not clear that all capital cities are economically or environmental-
     ly prepared to support the population growth they will experience. Very little detailed data
     is available to pinpoint, understand, and address these problems; for example, statistics
     on the numbers of people living in squatter areas or inadequate housing are limited and in-
     consistent. Left unaddressed, urban drift may speed the decline of public services, increase
     insecurity and crime, and reduce investment and productivity in cities with high youth
     unemployment.

     2.5.2.3	Inequitable management of land and natural resources

     Poor governance of land and natural resources is another complex, enduring problem
     that threatens the resilience of PIC9 communities. In addition to the pressure exerted by
     climate change and urbanization, customary land is also threatened by the lack of robust
     frameworks for equitably managing land transactions (Box 2.3). The pressure to release
     communally held land for foreign investment, large-scale infrastructure development, and
     commercial agriculture exacerbates competing claims over land and weakens the ability
     of traditional governance systems to resolve them effectively. Deep sea mining is now
     emerging as a concern for some countries, given the associated environmental and social
     risks.

      BOX 2.3: LAND IN THE PACIFIC

      Customary ownership, the dominant form of land tenure in the Pacific, is being subjected to a range of
      new and rapidly changing forces. The pressure to commercialize land for development is testing the abil-
      ity of old systems to adapt and provide adequate tenure security for both members of customary groups
      and people outside the groups. In some of the PICs, acceleration of investment in tourism, agriculture,
      infrastructure and natural resources, and associated land development will increase, which could heighten
      social tension. In addition to climate change and urbanization pressure, customary land is threatened by
      the lack of robust legal frameworks and institutional supervision of customary land transactions. Lack of
      appropriate land records similarly pose significant challenges.



     2.5.2.4	Climate change and natural disasters

     The Pacific region is one of the most prone to natural disasters in the world. The region
     combines high exposure to frequent and damaging natural hazards with low capacity to
     manage the resulting risks. Moreover, the PIC9 have limited macroeconomic tools at their
     disposal to counter external crises that destabilize the larger economy and undermine
     household welfare. Poorer households and individuals are even less equipped to rebound
     from the negative effects of climate change, natural disasters, and externally driven price
     fluctuations. Food production systems can be particularly affected by extreme variability
     in weather, which can in turn exacerbate disputes over arable land and sea resources.
                                                                           Regional Partnership Framework                  37




2.5.2.5	Gender-based violence

Gender-based violence (GBV) is extremely high in a number of countries in the region.
The statistics available indicate that women in more than half of the PIC9 suffer either
partner or non-partner violence to a greater extent than elsewhere in the world; all but
one of the PIC9 is above the global average (Figure 2.10). In Kiribati, among women aged
15–49 who have ever been married, 68 percent have been subject to GBV; in Vanuatu, the
figure is 60 percent. Violence against women has major traumatic and disempowering ef-
fects. It negatively affects women’s health, well-being, and the development, education,
and nutrition of their children.

port Study (http://countryoffice.unfpa.org/pacific/drive/NauruFHSSReportweb.pdf).



Beyond the human costs, violence imposes major costs throughout the economy, including
expenditures on service provision, income forgone by women and their families, decreased
productivity, and negative effects on human capital.

2.5.3	 Gender Inequality as a Barrier to Development
Alongside the constraints placed on development by gender-based violence, the PIC9
countries experience gender inequality. Gender inequality is reflected in uneven access
to economic opportunities and resource endowments, limitations on women’s voice and
agency, and women’s vulnerability to emerging risks.7




7	
     The Consolidated Gender Action Plan (CGAP) for the PIC9 includes detailed analysis and data on the key ine-
     qualities between men and women in these areas, as well as policies and innovative interventions undertaken
     by PIC9 governments and donors to address them. The action plan was developed in line with the framework
     laid out in the EAP Region’s Companion Report to the World Development Report 2012 (World Bank 2011).
38   Regional Partnership Framework




     Women in the PIC9 do not have equal access to productive and economic resources.
     Female participation in the labor force is consistently lower than that of men – ranging
     from 23% in Samoa, compared to 58% of men (2015 data) to 61% in Vanuatu compared to
     81% of men (2009 data). Women work predominantly in the informal sector and are fre-
     quently home-based, focusing on subsistence agriculture, marketing agricultural products,
     and petty trading. Within the limited set of economic opportunities available, women’s
     employment is concentrated in agriculture, tourism, and selected parts of the fisheries
     sector. Women in the PIC9 also face constraints on their control of assets. They are less
     likely to have land titles and can be disadvantaged by family, marriage, and inheritance
     law and practices.8

     Women’s voice and agency are limited in the PIC9 countries. Women are underrepre-
     sented in the PIC9 parliaments (Figure 2.11); on average women hold only around 1 in 30
     seats, compared to an average of about 1 in 5 across developing nations.

Emerging trends in the Pacific present risks and opportunities for women and for pro-
gress toward gender equality. Women are disproportionately vulnerable to the effects of
natural disasters and climate change where their socio-economic status is not equal to
those of men, and where they have less voice and influence than men in shaping policies.9
Urbanization presents risks and opportunities; it can transform women’s lives with bet-
ter access to infrastructure, education and health services, and a wider range of eco-
nomic opportunities, but taking advantage of these opportunities depends on whether
gender-sensitive policies and service delivery have been considered. Migration has poten-
tial gender-specific benefits, but seasonal worker programs also carry social costs and
impacts for migrants, their families, and their communities. Moreover, risks associated
with globalized resource extraction industries in the Pacific, such as mining and fisher-
ies, may potentially have socially destabilizing impacts on women. Finally, the increasing
availability of ICTs has the potential to increase access to services and markets for men
and women in the PIC9.

The PIC9 governments, in partnership with the development community, are working
to reduce gender inequalities. They are pursuing policies to reduce gender inequalities in
education and health, increase women’s role in politics, and are investing in interventions
that promote women’s skills and to provide access to jobs and services for victims of GBV.
However, overall analysis and policy making to address gender inequality is severely con-
strained by the paucity and low quality of data. Gender-disaggregated data are even more
difficult to come by.

A Consolidated Gender Action Plan (CGAP) for FY17–21 was developed to support im-
plementation of the RPF. The action plan is the product of consultations with the Pacific
country teams and a portfolio review of active projects. It supports actions to address the
following five priority areas of gender inequality: (i) low female labor force participation
and limited access to markets (focus area 1); (ii) high prevalence of gender-based violence
(focus area 2); (iii) low participation in public decision making (focus area 2); (iv) dispropor-
tionately high degree of women affected by NCDs (focus area 2); and (v) women’s vulner-
ability to emerging risks (focus area 3).10

Given the prevalence of GBV in the PIC9, the WBG commissioned a review of promising
approaches in those countries and identified how the WBG could engage more effec-
tively. The review identified five high-priority interventions and innovative approaches,
and suggested that the WBG seek entry points to address them where appropriate.11 The
five priorities are to: (i) strengthen the response to GBV through advocacy and policy; (ii)
create safe and inclusive workplaces; (iii) establish and support knowledge-sharing; (iv)

10	
    The portfolio review was undertaken as of November 2015. The CGAP serves as a practical tool for teams to (i)
    track gender-related commitments and the contribution of the PIC9 portfolio in aligning with WBG guidelines
    and goals on gender, and (ii) identify priorities for influencing gender inequality, as well as human resources,
    working processes, budget, knowledge work, and training that can help to ensure that WBG targets related to
    gender are reached. The priority actions for the CGAP also align with the three pathways of the RPF and with
    the framework of the EAP Region’s Companion Report to the World Development Report 2012.
11	
    The review included an analysis of GBV in each of the nine countries. It identified country-level needs, as-
    sessed evidence from international best practice in GBV prevention and response, and considered prevention
    and response specifically in the context of the PIC9.
40   Regional Partnership Framework




     2.5.4	 Persistent Knowledge Gaps Limit the Development of Solutions
     Lack of data and information across the PIC9 is a major challenge. The SCD emphasized
     that efforts to pursue poverty reduction and shared prosperity in the Pacific are consid-
     erably hampered by the lack of concrete information on the prevalence and severity of
     poverty and the specific nature of constraints faced by the poor in improving their liveli-
     hoods. While Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIESs) have been carried out
     in most countries, these have been sporadic and of uneven quality. Further, variations in
     methodological approaches and welfare standards used in poverty assessments make it
     difficult to monitor progress over time, to make inter-country comparisons, and to estab-
     lish regional benchmarks of results and progress. In addition, in some countries, there are
     additional problems arising out of restricted and delayed access to survey data. The Bank
     is undertaking a regional program in collaboration with regional agencies and PIC develop-
     ment partners to help improve the capacity of national statistical agencies to undertake
     reliable and regular household surveys, and to analyze the resulting data needed to inform
     policy decisions.

     The key priority areas of the PIC9 National Development Strategies are outlined in the
     country summaries (Annex 9). Common priorities include good governance, ensuring
     macroeconomic stability, building climate resilience, safeguarding the environment and
     natural resources, investing in human development, improving infrastructure, and foster-
     ing private sector growth. There is no disconnect between the findings of the SCD, the
     thrust of the RPF, and the national priorities set out by the PIC9. The WBG program in
     each country will be adjusted to the local context to ensure alignment with national priori-
     ties.


     3.2	 Proposed WBG Regional Partnership Framework
     This section describes the foundations and content of the proposed regional partner-
     ship framework. It begins by summarizing recommendations and lessons emerging from
     a series of country-level reviews and from consultations with a wide range of national,
     regional, and international stakeholders. An overview of the strategy follows.

     3.2.1	 Lessons from the Country Partnership Framework Completion
     	      Reports, Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluation, and
     	      stakeholder consultations
     A consolidated Completion and Learning Review (CLR) was undertaken for the six coun-
     tries (Kiribati, RMI, FSM, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu) in the PIC9 for which an independ-
     ent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) or Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) had been
     developed (Annex 10). The CLR found that the WBG program in the Pacific has mostly been
     well-aligned with the respective country development frameworks and visions and that
     the strategies were selective and well-structured. Overall, the strategies are well aligned
     with the twin corporate goals of reduced poverty and shared prosperity. The choice of
     instruments was appropriate with a mix of Development Policy Operations (DPOs) (Box
     3.1), investment projects, additional financing, repeater and phased projects, multi-coun-
     try regional programs, Technical Assistance (TA), and other Advisory Services and Analyt-
     ics (ASA). The IFC has made good progress against goals set out in the IFC Pacific Partner-
     ship Agreement with Australia and New Zealand.


      BOX 3.1: DEVELOPMENT POLICY OPERATIONS IN THE PACIFIC

      An internal review of DPOs in the Pacific, which have all been rated moderately satisfactory or better by
      the Independent Evaluation Group and have constituted less than 10 percent of the portfolio, found that
      they have contributed to significant reform programs. With regard to reforms in macro-fiscal manage-
      ment, DPOs have supported stronger revenue mobilization in Samoa and Tonga, and better oversight of
      fisheries revenue in Kiribati and Tuvalu. They have also helped strengthen procurement and debt manage-
      ment in several PICs and improve the management of Kiribati’s Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund. In the
      area of structural reform, DPOs have helped advance the reform of state-owned enterprises in Kiribati (in
      telecommunications) and Tonga (hotel privatization). DPOs have also had an impact on human develop-
      ment and social protection and have supported free primary schooling in Samoa, measures to address
      NCDs in Tonga, and the expansion of vocational training opportunities in Tuvalu.

The CLR concluded that country risks were well identified; many actually materialized,
posing challenges for implementing the programs. They included risks related to the coun-
tries’ thin capacity and limited Bank staff in-country; exogenous shocks; weaknesses in
public financial management (PFM); difficulties in securing political consensus for reforms;
lack of familiarity with WBG procedures; extreme remoteness, imposing high transport
costs and logistical challenges; weak economies of scale for most development activities;
and severe skill and technical constraints. These risks, as they materialized to various
degrees, contributed to the slower-than-expected pace at which many activities could be
implemented. Despite accurately identifying the risks, the CLR found that the Bank still
underestimated the challenges of implementing activities in countries new to its proce-
dures. Many of the CASs/CPSs were overly ambitious and complex in terms of the results
that could be achieved within the various timeframes, given the limited experiences of sev-
eral clients with the WBG. The overall performance of the CAS/CPS programs in contribut-
ing toward the achievement of selected country goals was assessed to be satisfactory for
Samoa and Tonga, moderately satisfactory for FSM and Tuvalu, moderately unsatisfac-
tory for Kiribati, and unsatisfactory for RMI. The fact that some CASs and CPSs are not
yet complete poses difficulties for accurately measuring the results of those programs.

The CLR identified a range of lessons that are reflected in this RPF. The lessons include
avoiding complex and overly ambitious results frameworks, adequately estimating com-
plexity and time required to develop projects, as well as the challenges of implementing
projects in countries new to WBG. The CLR also founds that the mix of instruments were
appropriate. The results framework in this RPF has been streamlined and made more re-
alistic and will be adjusted during the Performance and Learning Review to take changing
country realities into account. The Bank will continue to make use of a mix of investment
projects, development policy lending, repeater projects, and additional financing for initia-
tives that perform well, along with regional engagements and phased projects. Options
to explore options to further consolidate project management functions in several of the
PIC9, support the targeting of training activities, and maintain know-how in the imple-
mentation of Bank-financed projects. Ensuring that projects are ready to be implemented,
even if it requires longer project preparation time, will be an important consideration. This
will necessitate careful assessment of capacity constraints and especially of contrac-
tors’ willingness to engage in operations in remote countries. The Bank will continue to
support macroeconomic and fiscal resilience through coordinated budget support with
other development partners. It will also continue working to improve face-time between
clients and staff to ensure a sustained and open working relationship. IFC, learning from
its experience in the small PICs, will endeavor to mobilize donor funding to implement an
integrated advisory and investment program in the PIC9 that would focus on building
bankable opportunities for private sector investment. The approach would be to replicate
successful regional models used in the telecoms and banking sectors to expand into other
sectors such as tourism and renewable energy.

     In June 2016, the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) completed a “clustered” Country
     Program Evaluation (CCPE) to assess the relevance and effectiveness of WBG support
     during FY05-FY15 in helping selected small states improve their resilience and their com-
     petitiveness. The CCPE in the Pacific examined the WBG engagement in FSM, Fiji, Kiri-
     bati, Palau, RMI, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, with a particular focus on Tonga and
     Samoa. The CCPE considered the WBG program in the Pacific to be highly relevant and
     rated the effectiveness of the WBG contribution to the development of the PICs as satis-
     factory. The program was found to be strategically selective and a good reflection of the
     Bank’s comparative advantages in raising difficult policy issues, undertaking key analytic
     studies, supporting regional approaches, and promoting effective donor coordination.

     The CCPE concluded that the WBG program supported a number of genuinely transfor-
     mational institutional outcomes in the Pacific. Those outcomes included directly sup-
     porting the development and enhancement of New Zealand’s and Australia’s temporary
     migration programs; improving connectivity throughout the region by introducing compe-
     tition in the provision of telecommunications services and supporting underwater cables to
     promote quality and faster access; building awareness among governments and donors of
     the need to build environmental resilience into investments in infrastructure; and persuad-
     ing governments in some PICs to outsource road maintenance contracts to promote more
     efficient use of public resources, better road management, and development of the private
     sector.

     The CCPE identified some shortcomings in implementation arrangements that persist
     in the context of very limited capacity. Despite the Bank’s considerable efforts to simplify
     various processes, many PICs still find a range of Bank operational procedures challeng-
     ing, including procurement and management of consultants. The evaluation also deter-
     mined that some issues such as land management could benefit from a more systemic
     ex ante approach from the Bank when engaging in different areas. There was broad ap-
     preciation for the speed with which the Bank responds to concerns from clients and other
     donors, and for its willingness to listen. The effective partnerships built with key bilateral
     partners, Australia and New Zealand, through the Pacific Facility and the Pacific Partner-
     ship have been particularly important in growing and enhancing the WBG’s engagement
     in the region.

     The CCPE identified five broad areas for enhancing WBG engagement in the Pacific,
     going forward, and they are all being factored into the RPF. The CCPE recommendations
     encourage the WBG to: (1) address systemic issues such as land acquisition, governance,
     education policy, domestic violence, and the role of local government as priority areas for
     analytical work; (2) ensure that sufficient staff and resources are directed toward Kiribati
     and Vanuatu to address relatively high poverty levels; (3) examine the costs and benefits
     of increased regional integration in the Pacific and the role that regional institutions are
     (and could be) playing; (4) develop a more explicit joint World Bank–IFC approach for PSD
     support, starting with analytical work to identify areas of strong potential; and (5) con-
     tinue to shift positions from Sydney to the Suva office for both efficiency and effective-
     ness objectives, and expand the liaison offices with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to
     other countries.

The design of the RPF has benefited from consultations with many levels of government,
the private sector, academia, civil society, regional organizations, and international de-
velopment partners. The consultations concurred with the overall findings of the SCD
and the proposed RPF framework. There was broad agreement on the key impediments to
growth in the PICs and a view that to stimulate drivers of growth, investments in public in-
frastructure, especially connective infrastructure (for aviation, maritime operations, and
ICT, for example), would be essential for the wider economy. Stakeholders also found that
climate change and recurring disasters constituted an existential threat, and investments
in coastal protection would be critical for the continued survival of several of the nine
countries (such as Tuvalu, RMI, and Kiribati). WBG support was also encouraged in such
areas as agriculture and fisheries, transport and maritime infrastructure, ICT, education
and skills development, and private sector development.

     3.2.2	 Overview of World Bank Group strategy
     Informed by the opportunities and constraints identified in the SCD as well as the lessons
     from implementing programs across the Pacific over the past decade, this RPF outlines
     the WBG support program for the PIC9, while specifying a separate approach for Nauru
     and Palau (where the engagement will remain relatively limited). The program of engage-
     ment also benefits from the long-term analyses conducted through the Pacific Possible
     initiative (Box 3.2).

      BOX 3.2: PACIFIC POSSIBLE

      Complementing the SCD, the WBG launched Pacific Possible, which looks ahead 25 years to quantify the
      increases in incomes, government revenue, and employment that would be possible if economic oppor-
      tunities are fully exploited and risks appropriately managed. Pacific Possible balances the analysis of
      potentially transformative economic opportunities (tourism, labor mobility, tuna fisheries, deep-sea min-
      ing) with an assessment of major threats to the economic outlook in PICs (NCDs and climate and disaster
      resilience), as well as ICT-enabled opportunities and financing governments for Pacific development. For
      stakeholders in Pacific development—the PICs themselves, development partners, and the broader in-
      ternational community—the findings provide specific insights into the scope of the opportunities as well
      as the tasks that must be undertaken to realize them. Key messages emerging from the ongoing study
      include:

      •	 Tourism: The potential exists for an additional one million tourists to visit the Pacific by 2040. Careful
         and sustainable planning around emerging tourism markets could potentially deliver US$1.8 billion per
         year in additional tourist spending and up to 130,000 additional jobs.

      •	 Labor mobility: Continuous expansion of labor mobility opportunities could generate a triple-win for
         labor-sending and labor-receiving countries as well as for migrants. Proposed reforms could generate
         US$13 billion in income for about 240,000 migrants from the Pacific as well as an increase in remit-
         tances by up to US$800 million and 80,000 additional jobs by 2040 for Pacific Islanders.

      •	 Tuna fisheries: Maintaining firm and shared catch limits, and increasing economic value through col-
         laborative access regimes, could help countries gain as much as US$345 million per year in additional
         sustainable revenues, and create an additional 15,000 jobs by 2040.

      •	 Deep-sea mining: Governments are encouraged to take a precautionary approach to this nascent form
         of mining. There is the need to take stock of known and unknown costs, impacts, and potential revenue
         to develop a more thorough understanding of each before an informed decision can be made.

      •	 ICT enabled economic opportunities: Improved connectivity and ICT penetration could enhance pro-
         ductivity in a number of ways (for example, in public service delivery, improved monitoring of fisheries,
         and other activities), improve the quality and attractiveness of existing activities (tourism, education,
         health), and create new market opportunities, leading to additional national income of US$1.5 billion
         and 147,000 jobs.

      •	 Health and NCDs: The “NCD epidemic” facing the Pacific region will have potentially costly impacts,
         including impacts on the quality and quantity of labor force participation. The analysis presents posi-
         tive interventions to address NCDs and mitigate their costs to Pacific countries. In the absence of such
         interventions, the annual economic NCD burden could range from 3 to 10 percent of GDP.

      •	 Climate and disaster resilience: Pacific Island countries need to better incorporate climate and dis-
         aster risk management into planning and development across all sectors, while considering the cost
         of priority investments and policies to boost resilience to the year 2040. Annual costs range from
         US$400 million to US$1.2 billion for coastal protection and adaptation of infrastructure to changes in
         rainfall and temperature are a possible outcome by 2040.

      Realizing the opportunities and managing the threats highlighted in the Pacific Possible series will require
      collaboration between Pacific Island governments, development partners, and countries on the Pacific
      Rim.
                                                           Regional Partnership Framework         47




Taking into account all the factors that constrain efforts to reduce poverty and boost
shared prosperity, the SCD identified three broad pathways to reduced poverty and
shared prosperity, as well as key enablers of progress along those pathways. The SCD
also pinpointed 12 very high priority solution areas as being most important to achieve the
twin goals.

The pathways and enablers identified in the SCD form the foundation of the Focus Are-
as-the four broad areas of WBG engagement-for this RPF. Within the framework of the
Focus Areas, the specific elements of the WBG program in the nine countries (individually,
and collectively if appropriate) will be drawn from the very high priority solution areas
identified in the SCD.

The Focus Areas are:

1.	 Fully exploiting the available economic opportunities. The unique economic geography
    of these countries calls for a sharp focus on those few avenues to growth that are avail-
    able, with an emphasis on opportunities that improve livelihoods and provide subsist-
    ence goods (such as agriculture and coastal fishing), generate income (such as tourism,
    overseas employment, and remittances), or increase government revenue (such as oce-
    anic fisheries).

2.	Enhancing access to employment opportunities. The highly dispersed people of the
   PICs, particularly those living on the outer islands, need better access to public services
   and broadened opportunities for labor mobility. Targeted efforts are required to reduce
   the significant skill and education gap between the poor and non-poor and to reduce
   gender inequality and address gender based violence.

3.	Protecting incomes and livelihoods. The PICs are already among the most disaster-
   prone countries in the world, and the incidence of natural disasters is set to increase
   as climate change intensifies. By mainstreaming disaster risk management into pol-
   icy-making and development efforts, the PICs can better protect incomes and liveli-
   hoods from the depredations of natural disasters. Strengthening health systems and
   addressing the causes of the growing prevalence of NCDs are other essential measures
   to protect livelihoods in the Pacific and maintain countries’ abilities to take advantage
   of the economic opportunities available to them.

4.	 Strengthening the enablers of growth opportunities (macroeconomic management,
    infrastructure and addressing knowledge gaps). These cross-cutting areas are a criti-
    cal element of the RPF. They build the foundation for improving access to economic
    opportunities and services, building resilience, and ultimately fostering shared pros-
    perity and reducing poverty across the region.

To determine the specific set of activities that will constitute the WBG program in a
given country, the RPF uses three selectivity criteria. In aggregate, the WBG will sup-
port interventions in most of the high-priority areas identified in the SCD. In each indi-
vidual country, the selectivity criteria will be applied to define priorities and corresponding
activities, based on the specific country context:
48   Regional Partnership Framework




     1.	 Alignment with government priorities and demand for WBG support. The activities
         pursued by the WBG will be determined by the priorities and strategic directions set
         forth by the individual countries. The activities will be demand-driven, undertaken in
         response to specific requests by the client, although the scope for undertaking activi-
         ties on a regional basis will also be explored.

     2.	 Alignment with the SCD. As noted, the 12 very high priority solution areas are the basis
         for specifying the elements of the WBG program. Table 3.1 shows how the SCD solution
         areas relate to ongoing and planned RPF priorities for individual countries as well as
         regionally.

     3.	 Scope for successfully addressing the drivers of fragility in the Pacific and ensuring
         sustainability. The WBG will prioritize activities that can help address or mitigate is-
         sues related to institutional capacity, growth in youth population and urbanization,
         land, climate change and natural disasters, as well as gender, which have been identi-
         fied as the main drivers of fragility in the region so as to ensure that WBG-supported
         activities and the benefits which they yield can be sustained over time.

     4.	 The comparative advantage and experience of the WBG in the Pacific, and comple-
         mentarity with programs of engagement supported by other development partners.
         Based on a careful examination of the proposed activities, the WBG will determine its
         comparative advantage in relation to other actors, including development partners,
         non-governmental and civil society organizations, and the private sector. Past experi-
         ence of what is feasible in different situations will be a key basis for selectivity given
         the other criteria. The WBG will also carefully consider activities that require regional
         solutions, promote regional collaboration, and build on its global experience in other
         regions.



     3.3	 Objectives and Focus Areas Supported by the WBG
     	Program

     This section takes a closer look at how the program of WBG support will be structured
     around the four Focus Areas. The sections that follow highlight the key challenges faced
     and objectives to be achieved in each area.

     3.3.1	 Focus Area 1: Fully exploiting the available economic opportunities
     Under this focus area, the WBG will contribute to addressing 3 very high priority areas
     identified in the SCD: (a) improve management of oceanic and coastal fisheries, (b) in-
     crease incomes from agriculture, (c) and expand tourism.
     	       Objective 1.1: Improved management of oceanic and coastal fisheries
                                                                        Regional Partnership Framework                                49




The region’s oceanic fisheries supply much of the world’s tuna, and global demand is
steadily increasing. The wider Western Central Pacific Ocean area produced 2.6 million
tons of tuna in 2013, representing over half of the world’s tuna catch and yielding revenues
at first sale on the order of over US$6.3 billion. Roughly 60 percent of this tuna catch was
taken from PIC waters, or some 35 percent of the world’s tuna catch. The total first sale
value of the tuna caught in PIC waters was estimated to be some US$3.4 billion in 2013,
of which PICs received roughly seven percent through access fees paid by (mostly) for-
eign fleets. Coastal fisheries throughout the region do not generate significant amounts of
national revenue, but they support local livelihoods, food security, and dietary health in
all PICs. Fish and seafood are a primary source of animal protein in PIC diets, and in some
countries per capita consumption exceeds 100 kg per year (compared to a global aver-
age of 16 kg per year). PIC coastal fisheries are relatively small and localized and support
only a few viable (although extremely valuable) export fisheries. Women are particularly
dependent on coastal fisheries for informal economic opportunities, including from handi-
crafts.

 	 The WBG program will support strengthened management of fisheries through the
   Pacific Islands Regional Oceanscape Program (PROP). PROP aims to strengthen the
   management of oceanic and coastal fisheries and the conservation of the natural
   habitats upon which the fisheries depend. Strengthened and more sustainable man-
   agement of the tuna fisheries would increase their size and value and raise additional
   public revenue for PICs. Better-managed coastal fisheries will enhance rural livelihoods
   and food security, particularly for the B40. Among the PIC9, currently FSM, RMI, and
   Tuvalu participate in PROP, together with Solomon Islands and the FFA. It is expected
   that during the period covered by this RPF (FY17–FY21), PROP will expand to additional
   countries. IFC, through its efforts to expand market opportunities, will seek to help
   countries retain a greater share of the revenue from tuna sales and to increase trans-
   parency in fisheries management.

     Objective 1.2: Increased incomes from agriculture

     Agriculture (generally subsistence agriculture) is the cornerstone of food security in
     PIC9 such as Vanuatu and Samoa. Given the growing impact of climate change, farm-
     ers need to adopt climate-smart agricultural practices and crop varieties, drawing on the
     extensive research of Pacific regional organizations in this field. Opportunities to increase
     crop and animal productivity, encourage diversification, and enable agriculture to adapt
     to a changing climate could have a direct impact on household food security, reducing
     hardship. More productive agriculture that supports small-scale local trade and food pro-
     cessing, substitutes for imports, supplies the tourism sector, and even contributes to ex-
     ports of selected niche and cash crops could potentially benefit many individuals. Improv-
     ing infrastructure to expand access to markets and strengthening food safety practices
     will help small-scale farmers tap into the growing demand from the tourism industry for
     fresh local produce.

      	 The WBG program will build on the current agriculture activities in Samoa, where the
        Samoa Agriculture Competitiveness Enhancement Project (SACEP) works with small-
        scale fruit and vegetable growers and livestock producers to improve productivity and
        take greater advantage of market opportunities. Drawing on lessons from earlier sup-
        port to restore lost production capacity following Tropical Cyclone Evan (2012), the
        WBG will continue to enhance disaster preparedness in the agricultural sector. In Ton-
        ga, the WBG will support the country’s efforts to gain access to resources from the
        Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP).

     Objective 1.3: Expanded tourism opportunities

     Tourism is the mainstay of private sector economic activity in many of the PICs. Many
     PICs offer a pristine environment, a variety of recreational opportunities, and a cultural
     diversity that differentiates the region from other destinations. Tourism brings an export
     market to the PICs, promoting tourism-related businesses and stimulating demand for
     the domestic supply of fresh produce and local artwork and handicrafts. As a labor-inten-
     sive service sector with relatively low barriers to entry, tourism could potentially create
     a significant number of local jobs. It is one of the few industries in the Pacific in which
     women and young people form a high percentage of job holders. Although the atoll nations
     of Kiribati, RMI, and Tuvalu have a more limited prospect to develop tourism, some oppor-
     tunities may exist to develop the visitor economy. Building a viable, sustainable tourism
     destination demands significant investment in infrastructure, destination management,
     marketing, upgraded hotel stock, and capacity building for the sector.

      	 To develop tourism, the Bank and IFC will explore opportunities for a joint program
        to support tourism initiatives on a regional basis. IFC will provide advisory services to
        those PIC governments and private sectors where tourism is a key driver of growth (Va-
        nuatu, Samoa, and Tonga) to ensure the industry’s sustainable development through
        the generation of investment and jobs, and by strengthening linkages between the in-
        dustry and communities.
                                                         Regional Partnership Framework        51




 	 Improving air and telecommunications connectivity, as outlined in further detail in ob-
   jective 4.2 on providing connective infrastructure will also provide critical foundations
   to achieving this objective.

3.3.2	 Focus Area 2: Enhancing access to employment opportunities
Objective 2.1: Broadened opportunities for access to labor markets

Under this objective, the WBG will seek to address 3 very high priority areas identified
in the SCD: (a) expand labor market opportunities and (b) close education and skills gap
between the poor and non-poor and (c) address gender inequality and gender based vio-
lence.

In many of the PIC9, domestic labor markets are not growing fast enough to absorb
all new entrants, especially the unskilled who are most likely to be poor or in the B40.
Migration channels follow three country groupings. RMI, FSM, and Palau—countries that
have Compacts of Free Association with the USA—enjoy open labor market access and
have relatively high rates of migration. Tonga and Samoa have the highest outward mi-
gration rates of the PIC9, mainly through historical ties as well as bilateral agreements
providing access to New Zealand. Kiribati, Nauru, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu have some of the
lowest rates of outward migration in the region, despite having preferential access to
Australia and New Zealand through the Seasonal Worker Program (SWP) and Recognized
Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme. Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu also have access to a new
multi-year visa in Australia, as well as the Pacific Access Category in New Zealand. Travel
costs and skill level determine the opportunities for the poor and B40 to participate in mi-
gration schemes. The institutional capacity of the labor-sending countries is an additional
determinant. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that improved labor mobility for
the PIC9 provides benefits to migrants as well as to their households, communities, and
sending countries, by increasing remittances, building human capital, and transferring
knowledge.

 	 Continuing analytical work on labor mobility occurs under the comprehensive pro-
   grammatic ASA program to deepen the understanding of the constraints, benefits, and
   opportunities of increased access to regional labor markets by Pacific countries. The
   program focuses on regional knowledge sharing, maximizing the development impact
   of existing schemes, and developing new opportunities for labor mobility. It includes
   several specific activities including preparing a development impact evaluation to as-
   sess the gains of the SWP for labor-sending households and communities and learn how
   they may be enhanced, as well as conducting a study to assess the productivity gains
   of Pacific seasonal workers, which will help build the business case for hiring them over
   other categories of workers. A case study will examine the likely impacts and potential
   benefits of open labor market access for the atoll nations most severely impacted by
   climate change (Kiribati and Tuvalu), and a market assessment will examine the poten-
   tial of the aged care sectors in Australia and New Zealand to provide employments for
   PIC nationals.
52   Regional Partnership Framework




     Objective 2.2: Addressing education and skills gap

     Education is widely recognized as a key driver of employment and opportunity in the
     Pacific. While governments across the Pacific are making good progress in ensuring broad
     access to education, an increasing body of evidence finds that serious problems with qual-
     ity undermine the value of the education received. Many children have not attained cogni-
     tive, socio-emotional, and physical development milestones when they reach school age.
     The limited quality of teachers and remaining inequalities in access to education are major
     impediments to delivering learning. Many of the PIC9 face public policy challenges, includ-
     ing inadequate and inequitable service delivery.

     Many of the PICs face a youth bulge. On average 57 percent of the population in the PICs
     is below the age of 25—a higher proportion than the average for the developing world and
     more similar to rates seen in the least-developed countries. The number of people aged
     0–14 substantially exceeds those aged 14–25, so the number of working-age youth will
     grow quickly over the next decade. With high rates of youth unemployment, a range of
     social problems are emerging among the new urban generation presenting challenges,
     which many public institutions in the PIC9 have little experience in addressing.

      	 The WBG will contribute to achieving this objective by continuing and, where possible,
        expanding programs such as the Pacific Early Age Readiness and Learning (PEARL)
        and Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA). In addition, the WBG will continue to use
        DPOs to support education sector dialogue and reform
      	 The Bank will prepare a regional ASA on skills to help PIC9 countries develop the mix
        of skills required by their workforces to take advantage of domestic and international
        job opportunities.
      	 Building on previous analytical work, as well as experience gained elsewhere in the
        Pacific, the Bank will support the development of a skills development and youth
        employment project in Tonga. It is intended for the project to provide critical lessons
        for a possible expansion to other countries in the Pacific.
      	 The Bank will also support investments in education infrastructure by rebuilding
        schools damaged by Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu and renovating primary schools in Tonga.

     Objective 2.3: Addressing gender inequality and gender-based violence

     Unequal gender roles, lack of voice and political participation, and violence against wom-
     en in the PIC9 perpetuate poverty and exacerbate women’s hardship. Evidence shows
     that the twin goals can be achieved only when the private and public sectors include women
     in the economy and eliminate barriers to their full participation. IFC recognizes the poten-
     tial of women—as entrepreneurs, employees, and leaders—to drive economic growth and
     enhance business performance.
                                                          Regional Partnership Framework         53




 	 The WBG will continue to mainstream gender into WBG projects and will determine
   the scope for undertaking specific activities to reduce the incidence of GBV. In the Pa-
   cific, 100 percent of operations will systematically consider gender inequalities in the
   underlying analysis, actions, and/or monitoring and evaluation arrangements. On the
   basis of a detailed mapping of measures that have been successfully adopted across
   the Pacific to reduce gender based violence, undertaken as part of the RPF, avenues
   will be identified through which these can be promoted by the WBG in its operations.
   For example, in line with IDA 18 commitments, the Vanuatu Aviation Investment Project
   is planning to pilot test a GBV training program and code of conduct for construction
   workers in early 2017 which will form the basis of a program to be rolled out on future
   major civil works projects in the transport sector across the Pacific.
 	 To promote female participation in the private sector, IFC aims to improve employment
   and income-earning opportunities for women through demonstrating the business case
   that can mobilize the private sector to implement gender programs that benefit their
   bottom line, as well as women as employees and producers. IFC intends to implement a
   Pacific-wide initiative to catalyze positive change for women by the private sector. The
   proposed program on women’s employment acknowledges the considerably smaller size
   of the private sector in the Pacific Islands without existing dedicated bilateral programs,
   seeking to maximize the reach and impact of the road-tested tools and approaches
   already developed. This will be done through knowledge sharing among the business
   community across the Pacific, e.g. by establishing a website/portal to disseminate evi-
   dence on the business case for investing in women along with tools to help business
   take proactive steps to promote women’s economic empowerment, and through offer-
   ing webinars and regional events focused on women’s role in the private sector.

3.3.3	 Focus Area 3: Protecting incomes and livelihoods
Under this focus area, the WBG will seek to address 2 very high priority areas identified
in the SCD: (a) strengthening resilience to natural disasters and climate change, and (b)
strengthening health systems and addressing NCDs.
	
Objective 3.1: Strengthened resilience to natural disasters and climate change

The WBG will continue to support regional and single-country activities that help the
PIC9 strengthen their resilience against natural disasters and climate change. PICs com-
bine high exposure to frequent and damaging natural hazards with low capacity to man-
age the resulting risks. Vulnerability is exacerbated by poor planning, which has increased
losses and exposure to natural disasters, and by climate change, which is predicted to am-
plify the magnitude of cyclones, droughts, and flooding. Sea level rise will worsen coastal
erosion and salinization of freshwater resources and increase the severity of storm surges,
which will be particularly damaging in atoll islands and low lying areas. All these impacts
adversely affect agriculture, fisheries, coastal zones, water resources, health and ecosys-
tems and the communities that rely upon them. The cost of inaction is substantial. Invest-
ments in disaster proofing and climate resilience cost substantially less than rebuilding
after a disaster. The WBG will ensure that at least 35 percent of the total portfolio will
directly or indirectly support climate-related co-benefits.
54   Regional Partnership Framework




      	 At the regional level, the WBG will contribute to this objective by further institution-
        alizing the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI),
        through the establishment of a permanent facility to be based in the Cook Islands.
        The program helps reduce the financial vulnerability of participating countries (RMI,
        Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu) to natural disasters. It employs parametric insurance as
        a mechanism to inject a limited supply of cash immediately following a major tropical
        cyclone, earthquake, or tsunami to help the affected government launch early recovery
        efforts. Building on PCRAFI, the Pacific Islands Resilience Program (PREP) aims to help
        participating PICs (Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu and RMI) to strengthen early warning and
        preparedness; create a framework for stronger, prioritized investments in resilience,
        including investments to retrofit key public buildings to international standards; and
        improve the financial capacity of countries to respond after a natural disaster strikes.
        Countries now use the IDA allocation under the PREP to finance the PCRAFI premium
        and will make an increasing contribution from their own budgets.
      	 A Climate Vulnerability assessment, recently undertaken in the transport sector in
        Samoa, will be scaled up to other islands. It will identify where priority should be given
        to integrating climate and disaster risk planning into the road sector. Technical as-
        sistance will be provided for post disaster needs assessment, improved spatial plan-
        ning and vulnerability assessment related to coastal zones, schools infrastructure, and
        flood risks and urban areas as well as innovation in a multi-hazard impact forecasting
        and use of drones for disaster risk management.
      	 Country-specific operations (in Kiribati, Samoa, RMI, and Vanuatu, for example) aim
        to help communities increase their resilience amid climate change by mitigating the
        effects on crops and water supplies and strengthening coastal infrastructure. During
        the RPF period, the WBG will discuss options with the new government in Kiribati for
        a successor to the ongoing Kiribati Adaptation Program (KAP) Phase III and prepare
        a climate resilient water and sanitation project jointly with ADB. Climate adaptation
        investments would include the protection of groundwater lenses vulnerable to surface
        contamination and long term salinization as well as the development of new water sup-
        ply, likely from desalinization. In RMI, a second phase of PREP will be prepared with
        additional investments in early warning preparedness, coastal resilience and financial
        protection.

     Objective 3.2: Strengthening health systems and addressing NCDs

     The general improvement in life expectancy and some other key health indicators across
     the PIC9 masks uneven progress and increasing pressures on health expenditure. Per
     capita health expenditure in real terms has increased over recent years and, with the
     exception of Vanuatu and Kiribati, is consistently higher in the PIC9 than the average for
     Lower Middle Income Countries. While these investments have enabled the PIC9 to suc-
     cessfully address some communicable diseases and most basic maternal and child health
     services, challenges remain. Among them, rapidly increasing non-communicable diseas-
     es (NCDs), and their related impact on acquired disability and reduced productivity, are
     increasing budgetary pressures for the PIC9. Inequities are also evident between under-
     served rural populations and those living near urban centers.
                                                          Regional Partnership Framework         55




Health systems in the Pacific have struggled to reorient themselves away from acute
communicable disease responses and towards more effective long term chronic health
care services that NCDs require. Except for Vanuatu, in the PIC9 over 40 percent of adults
are obese, and 80 percent are overweight, leading to a higher occurrence of NCDs such as
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. It is estimated that up to half of all prema-
ture deaths are linked to weak health systems unable to cope adequately with the needs
of people with NCDs. Yet some estimates claim that 40-60 percent of government health
spending is for addressing NCDs (notably for the higher cost curative and palliative care
services, including expensive overseas medical referrals). The current situation is already
unsustainable for some countries.

 	 The WBG will continue its ASA program in Vanuatu and Kiribati to strengthen govern-
   ment-led analysis, operational planning, budgeting, management, and monitoring for
   better use of finite resources and improved health service delivery.
 	 The WBG will identify opportunities to help countries implement the Regional NCD
   Roadmap adopted by a joint meeting of Pacific Finance and Health Ministers in Honiara
   in June, 2014. In Kiribati, the WBG will assist the Ministry of Health to adapt the Pack-
   age of Essential NCD Interventions to its local context, to improve both the efficiency
   and quality of expenditure in this priority area. Lessons learned from this activity may
   help inform NCD response plans in other PICs. Addressing NCDs and improving health
   outcomes requires a multi-sectoral approach that includes support for increased fruit
   and vegetable production (as in Samoa) and improved access to drinkable water and
   sanitation, which would have a significant impact on improving health outcomes. In
   recent years, the WBG has also supported tax measures to reduce the consumption of
   tobacco and unhealthy food and drinks (e.g., Tonga and Tuvalu). During the RPF period,
   the WBG will continue to support such reforms through DPOs.
 	 The WBG will opportunistically explore options for greater engagement in health ac-
   tivities in Kiribati, building on lessons from a joint multi-donor effort to improve re-
   source management in the health sector. An engagement in the health sector in IDA18
   is also expected in Samoa.

3.3.4	 Focus Area 4 (Cross-cutting): Strengthening the enablers of growth
       opportunities (macroeconomic management, infrastructure and
      addressing knowledge gaps)
Objective 4.1: Frameworks to improve fiscal management developed and maintained

Under this objective, the WBG will seek to address 2 very high priority areas identified
in the SCD: (a) improve public expenditure management and, (b) ensure macro-economic
stability and sustainability. Given the important role and large size (in relation to the size
of the economy) of the public sector in the PIC9, sound public expenditure management is
essential to the achievement of most of the PIC9 objectives. Frequent external shocks
pose a significant challenge to macro-economic management and sustainability. In addi-
tion, over the RPF period several countries will have to adjust fiscal and macro-economic
management to ensure that the increases in revenue from fisheries access fees are well
used. FSM and RMI face the additional challenge of adjusting revenue and expenditures in
anticipation of a more constrained fiscal environment after the scheduled termination of
Compact grants in 2023.
56   Regional Partnership Framework




     Over the past several years, the Bank has worked with key development partners in the
     Pacific (European Union, Australia, New Zealand, ADB) to prepare DPOs in four of the PIC9
     countries (Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Kiribati; see Box 3.1). Those operations have sup-
     ported public financial management reforms, greater private sector participation, im-
     proved governance, and macroeconomic resilience, and they benefited from TA to prepare
     policy actions in priority areas.

      	 During the period covered by this RPF, the Bank expects to continue budget support
        in Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Kiribati and possibly expand to others to foster economic
        growth, improved governance (including public financial management), and progress in
        selected sectoral priorities. The Bank will also support strengthening PFM systems in
        RMI and FSM.
      	 A programmatic, multiyear, regional Public Expenditure, Financial Management, and
        Public Sector ASA will be conducted in parallel with the DPOs to provide analytical in-
        put.
     	
     Objective 4.2: Increased access to basic services and improved connective infrastructure

     The growth opportunities identified under Focus Area 1, as well as protecting livelihoods
     emphasized in Focus Area 3, depend heavily on the availability of basic water, sanitation,
     and electricity and financial services in addition to connective infrastructure, including
     infrastructure for ICT as well as road, air, and maritime transport. As emphasized in the
     discussion in Section 2.5 of the economic geography constraints to ending absolute pov-
     erty and increasing shared prosperity, the challenge of service delivery and connectivity
     in PIC9 countries is fundamentally about their internal dispersion and remoteness. Most
     PIC9 countries have succeeded in providing basic water, sanitation, and electricity services
     in urban areas, but many peri-urban areas as well as remote islands remain underserved.
     The exception is Kiribati, where even dense urban settlements on the main island of South
     Tarawa receive only intermittent supplies of water and very limited sanitation services.
     In terms of energy, only about half of the PIC9 have near-universal access to electric-
     ity and high costs remain a significant barrier. Mobile phone coverage is critical to help
     remote communities remain connected. Harnessing the power of technology is also key for
     developing tourism, ensuring effective early warning of natural disasters, and facilitating
     access to e-services. Based on provisional data, road coverage per capita is very low in some
     of the PIC9, and maintenance is often inadequate to keep even these limited networks in
     reasonable condition. The costs of sea freight are high. Airport infrastructure in many PICs
     requires upgrading to ensure passenger safety, maintain regional connectivity, and pro-
     mote tourism. Access to finance is limited in most of the PIC9 and global de-risking poses
     the real threat for many countries to be cut off from global financial markets Given the
     common economic geography underpinnings of this focus on key areas of essential service
     delivery and connective infrastructure, the two areas of service delivery and connectivity
     are kept together under this objective.

      	 The WBG will contribute to improving access to basic infrastructure services through
        the development of a water and sanitation initiative in Kiribati, rural electrification and
        peri-urban electricity supply in Vanuatu, installation of solar photo-voltaic systems in
        Tuvalu, and upgrades to electricity generation and increased access to renewable en-
        ergy in the four states of FSM and in RMI.
                                                          Regional Partnership Framework        57




 	 To improve air connectivity, building on the Pacific Aviation Investment Program (PAIP)
   which currently covers Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, the Bank will con-
   tinue to work with the PIC9 to improve operational safety and oversight of interna-
   tional air transport infrastructure, which would directly support the development of
   tourism in the participating PICs.
 	 In ICT, the WBG will support legal and regulatory reform to improve the enabling en-
   vironment for private investment in ICT infrastructure. It will also provide catalytic
   financing for “backbone” infrastructure—such as submarine cables or satellite con-
   nections that provide international connectivity (for example, in FSM, Kiribati, Samoa,
   Tonga, Tuvalu)—as well as applications that use the new ICT infrastructure particularly
   for the expansion of the tourism industry, fisheries management, labor mobility and
   disaster risk management. The WBG will look for opportunities to mobilize ICT for ser-
   vice delivery and e-government in Tonga, Vanuatu and FSM.
 	 The WBG will continue its support for financial market development in the PIC9
   through the ongoing Pacific Payment Systems and Remittances program as well as
   IFC investments in and advisory services for financial sector institutions.
 	 The WBG will consolidate its support to the transport sector and launch a regional
   maritime program. Over the RPF period, the WBG will continue to develop transport in-
   frastructure through PAIP (described earlier). It will also support operations in the road
   subsector to strengthen planning and maintenance (in Kiribati and Tonga, for example)
   and help countries respond to and prepare for the effects of severe weather on critical
   transport infrastructure (in Samoa). The regional maritime program will cover Tonga
   and Tuvalu in a first phase and consider RMI for the second phase.
 	 Additional analytical work will study the influence of port and hinterland connectiv-
   ity (including infrastructure and services) on domestic supply chains in PICs, measur-
   ing the effects of connectivity on the availability and affordability of essential goods
   and their impact on household incomes, using Tonga as an initial pilot.

Objective 4.3: Address knowledge gaps

The substantial knowledge gaps and data issues across the PIC9 are increasingly ur-
gent to resolve as the WBG scales up its engagement. To support the poverty reduction
and shared prosperity agenda, the SCD identified a number of knowledge gaps to address
through analysis and data collection. An important activity is to improve the availability
of data to understand not only the drivers of fragility, but also poverty and inequality in
countries for which such information is inadequate. The WBG will seek to fully exploit op-
portunities for data collection, sharing, and analysis created by the improved ICT infra-
structure in several of the PIC9.

 	 To contribute to this objective, and specifically to enable PICs to craft and implement
   poverty alleviation policies that are anchored in effective poverty monitoring systems,
   the Pacific Poverty Programmatic Analytical and Advisory Assistance (AAA) will sup-
   port the provision of quality analytic and advisory services in the Pacific region. The
   program will focus on activities that address gaps and constraints by: (i) providing
   technical assistance to national statistical offices as well as the Statistics Unit of the
   SPC to enhance capabilities in data collection and analysis; (ii) generating evidence-
58   Regional Partnership Framework




        based knowledge to support poverty reduction policies; and (iii) engaging in policy dia-
        logues with national governments, regional organizations and development partners.
        The initiative will also seek to develop and pilot low-cost survey approaches that are
        financially sustainable and permit poverty monitoring at higher frequency to provide
        more timely feedback on results and policy outcomes. Another example of an activity
        supported through the program is the development of household surveys (HIES) in RMI
        and Kiribati.
      	 Analytical work will also be conducted to better understand the drivers of urbanization
        in some PICs as well as the best approaches to address the needs of urban migrants as
        well as of those who remain in rural areas and in particular on outer islands. Accelerat-
        ing urbanization in some PICs is altering the demographic composition of urban and
        rural areas. The SCD analysis revealed large gaps in access to economic opportunities
        and public services between the major islands and outer islands, which result in signifi-
        cant differences in progress toward the twin goals and encourage internal migration,
        especially by young people. Further data gathering and analysis is needed to better
        understand how intra-country geography and remoteness affect livelihoods, assess the
        costs of “spatially blind” service delivery policies, and estimate the additional costs
        linked to remoteness (including implications for the WBG’s own ability to prepare and
        supervise work).

     3.3.5	 WBG program in Nauru and Palau
     WBG support to Nauru and Palau requires a different engagement strategy from the rest
     of the member countries in the Pacific. The WBG partnership with Nauru is at an early
     stage as it only became a member of IBRD in April 2016. Given the challenges associated
     with providing the country with financing, WBG engagement with Palau has been relative-
     ly limited since its membership in 1997. Nauru is a high-income country and Palau is an up-
     per-MIC, with per capita income levels significantly above that of the other PIC9 countries,
     and are not eligible for IDA. In light of current creditworthiness assessments, they can only
     access IBRD with significant credit enhancements. To date, neither country has pursued
     this option.

     During the RPF period, WBG will pursue all opportunities for providing support to Nauru
     and Palau. As members of IBRD, they are able to benefit from WBG administered trust
     funds, including those which support increasing resilience to climate change and natural
     disasters. The WBG is also able to promote the inclusion of Nauru and Palau in regional
     projects, as with the ongoing submarine fiber optic cable linking Kiribati, Kosrae (FSM),
     Nauru and Pohnpei, where the WBG is financing the Kiribati and FSM share of the project.
     A second cable is linking FSM and Palau, with WBG financing the FSM share of the initia-
     tive. In both cases, financing Palau and Nauru’s share of the projects has been secured
     from ADB. In the course of the RPF period, the WBG will also explore avenues for collabo-
     rating with other donors to secure IBRD financing through guarantee schemes, or engage-
     ments that would provide the appropriate credit enhancement. In the case of Palau, the
     Bank’s will continue to support three important areas, including technical assistance to
     address challenges with national payment systems, technical assistance for the ICT sec-
     tor specifically to support the regulatory reforms and allow Palau to maximize the benefit

from the upcoming cable project. Opportunities for assistance in the area of public private
partnerships with a focus on strengthening the enabling environment will also be explored.
For Nauru, a country where labor mobility will be critical in the future, the WBG engage-
ment will initially start by including the country in an evaluation of the Seasonal Workers’
Program Development Evaluation.


3.4	 Implementing the FY17-21 Regional Partnership
	Framework

There are significant differences in the nature of the relationship between the WBG and
the individual PICs that will have an impact upon implementation modalities, however
common themes will be explored. The WBG has a mature relationship with Samoa, Tonga,
Kiribati, and Tuvalu, a younger relationship in Vanuatu, FSM, and RMI, and a limited rela-
tionship with Palau and Nauru. Lessons learned in the existing engagements will be critical
to chart the path forward and inform how to effectively support newer clients. The WBG
will also ensure its engagement modality with those PIC9 countries that are fragile states,
is tailored to address some of the underlying drivers of fragility including the challenges
of urbanization and youth employment and the institutional capacities around manag-
ing climate change impacts. The WBG will also ensure that implementation support is
particularly strengthened for the fragile PIC9 countries. Overall, the WBG program will
be designed to enhance impacts by taking advantage of the increased IDA18 allocation to
finance more sizeable operations, by enhancing selectivity and focusing on the core ob-
jectives discussed under section 3.3, and by paying particular attention to the drivers of
fragility in the Pacific in order to improve sustainability.

3.4.1	 Financial Envelope and Key Instruments
The timeline for this RPF comprises the remaining period of IDA17, the IDA18 period and
the beginning of IDA19. During the RPF period, IDA18 will see a major increase to the base
allocation to SDR15 m per year per country, which will have a potentially transformative
impact on the PIC9. The indicative IDA18 allocation compared to the IDA17 resource enve-
lope for the PIC9 is outlined in Table 3.2.

The eligibility to access financial resources from the WBG differs across the PIC9, and
the engagement will be tailored accordingly. The terms of the resources that countries
receive from IDA are based on the risk of debt distress in a given year. In FY17, FSM, Kiri-
bati, RMI, and Tuvalu were eligible for IDA grants, whereas Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu
receive 50 percent of IDA on grant terms and 50 percent on credit terms. This may well in-
fluence how countries wish to allocate IDA resources to different sectors. Palau and Nauru
are IBRD countries. At the same time, given current IBRD creditworthiness assessments,
they would only have access to resources from IBRD with significant credit enhancements.

     WBG instruments to implement the RPF are expected to include investment and policy
     based financing, IFC resources, and trust funds administered by the WBG. The WBG will
     take advantage of innovative instruments that could benefit the PIC9 and, to the extent
     possible, leverage private sources of capital and knowledge. Development policy lend-
     ing is expected to continue in Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu based on the positive
     experience during IDA17, provided the countries maintain an adequate macro-economic
     framework. In FSM and RMI, the new engagement in PFM may create an opportunity to
     explore the use of this instrument toward the end of the RPF period. Under IPF, the WBG
     will assess the early lessons in using Disbursement Linked Indicators in the Pacific, and
     also consider introducing a Program-for-Results Financing arrangement. The WBG will
     continue to look for financing opportunities in both Palau and Nauru. The WBG will use
     its global expertise to support these efforts, in close coordination with other development
     partners in the region.

     A feature of the IDA18 scale up in most PIC9 will be a greater emphasis on agreed reform
     benchmarks in key areas, continued policy dialogue with government and development
     partners on priorities and on monitoring results. The special themes in IDA18 on Climate
     Change, Gender and Development, and Fragility, Conflict and Violence, together with the
     new proposed themes on Jobs and Economic Transformation, and Governance and Insti-
     tutions all have resonance for the PIC9, though with varying emphasis across countries.
     Together with the proposed scaling up of IDA, the proposed IDA18 IFC-MIGA Private Sector
     Window (PSW) and the scaled up regional window in IDA18, the PIC9 should be in a strong
     position to explore opportunities for addressing these proposed new global commitments.

Of particular importance to the PIC9, in the context of IDA18 special themes, is the rec-
ognition that climate change and the rising incidence of natural disasters represent a
serious threat for all of the PIC9 and an existential threat for the atoll nations. The WBG
will seek to use the full range of instruments available to support the anticipated increase
in frequency and severity of natural disasters in the PIC9. The applicability of new financ-
ing instruments such as a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT DDO), which will
be available for IDA countries under IDA18, will be fully assessed. In the Pacific, DPOs have
been used to rapidly provide access to resources, but they are not designed for post-dis-
aster situations. In addition, the PIC9 that are IDA eligible will continue having access to
the Crisis Response Window (CRW), which is especially important in light of the prevailing
fragility aspects in the region. The CRW therefore will remain an important source of re-
sources for post-disaster reconstruction and recovery. The Bank will also explore ways to
assist PICs in accessing global climate funds.

62   Regional Partnership Framework




     IFC will proactively seek to help the PIC9 exploit the full gamut of private sector develop-
     ment opportunities, primarily through its Advisory Services activities. On the investment
     front, PIC9 challenges of small scale and remoteness will likely restrict direct investment
     volumes. However, IFC has a track-record of small, highly developmental investments in
     the region, which should allow IFC to invest up to US$25 million over the RPF period to help
     drive sustainable economic growth across the Pacific region, further supporting the IDA 18
     theme on jobs and economic transformation. It will achieve this result by financing private
     investment, mobilizing capital, and advising businesses and governments on improving
     the enabling environment for private sector investment and trade and projects that gen-
     erate returns for investors and provide societal value to communities. Strategic areas of
     focus will be accelerating access to infrastructure, including potential opportunities for
     public-private partnerships (PPPs) for delivery of key services, new renewable off-grid and
     small grid solutions, increasing access to finance for micro, small and medium enterprises,
     the fisheries sector, and seeking to attract a higher volume long haul tourist arrivals to
     the Pacific. IFC will aim to make investments where there is the potential to bring scal-
     ability and replicability, and making investments where technology and supply chains can
     be harnessed to accelerate access, spanning new delivery channels and markets to de-
     liver services. These efforts will build on IFC’s comparative advantage in the Pacific, which
     encompasses a track record of financing transactions and long-established reputation for
     delivering private sector solutions. IFC will take a solutions approach to its client engage-
     ment, leveraging Advisory and Investment Services to respond to client needs. IFC will
     also seek opportunities to leverage the Private Sector Window (PSW) from the IDA18 Re-
     plenishment in an effort to enhance the scale and scope of the WBG support to crowd in
     private sector investment in eligible IDA and FCS markets among the PIC-9: Kiribati, RMI,
     FSM, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu. The PSW will enable IFC to explore select opportunities,
     where suitable sponsors with scalable models can help IFC reach markets where they are
     currently unable to go, or create new markets where these are currently unavailable. Nei-
     ther Tuvalu nor Nauru are IFC members. MIGA has no current engagement in the PIC9, but
     will continue to opportunistically pursue opportunities as they arise.

     3.4.2	 Use of Regional Approaches
     The WBG will continue to promote regional and platform-based approaches and col-
     laboration with regional organizations to address common issues and exploit efficien-
     cies. This will be especially relevant in cases where regional solutions will be deemed to
     have greater impact than country specific engagements. Examples of this include existing
     regional programs (such as the Pacific Aviation Investment Program, the Pacific Regional
     Connectivity Program, the Pacific Regional Oceanscape Program and Pacific Resilience
     Program) which have been designed as platform-based approaches offering a menu of in-
     vestment and technical assistance options which support a common objective and are tai-
     lored to country contexts. Regional approaches allow economies of scale and the WBG has
     gained valuable experience working with a range of regional organizations during IDA17.
     This includes SPC, PIF, FFA, the Pacific Aviation Safety Office, Pacific Power Association
     and SPREP. During the RPF period, the WBG will build on, and strengthen, these partner-
     ships. The Framework for Pacific Regionalism provides an opportunity for WBG to align its
     work with the regional priorities, including ICT connectivity, climate change and fisheries.
                                                           Regional Partnership Framework         63




Where possible, the WBG will explore opportunities to use regional IDA resources across
to supplement their regular IDA allocations and implement programs that benefit the
Pacific region. An IDA project may be eligible to receive additional regional IDA when (a) it
involves three or more countries, all of which needs to participate for the project’s objec-
tives to be attainable (two countries if at least one is classified by IDA as fragile), (b) the
benefits spill over country boundaries, (c) there is clear evidence of country or regional
ownership which demonstrates commitment of the majority of the participating coun-
tries, and (d) provides a platform for high level of policy harmonization between countries
and is part of a well-developed and broadly supported regional strategy. Currently region-
al programs in fisheries, ICT, aviation infrastructure, and disaster risk management have
such spillover effects and benefit from financing from the regional IDA allocation.

3.4.3	 Addressing Capacity and Implementation Challenges
Programming of new initiatives in IDA18 will require adjustments to the WBG operational
model to ensure appropriate support for the PIC9 in implementing a substantially larger
program of IDA support. To ensure that the transaction cost on the part of the PIC9 does
not overwhelm institutions already affected by limited capacity, the WBG will increase the
scope of its support for preparation and implementation of activities. The Procurement
Framework for Investment Project Financing that became effective on July 1, 2016 will
enable the WBG to create more tailored, country-specific approaches and allow hands-on
implementation support from WBG staff when necessary. With Governance and Institu-
tions a key theme of IDA18, opportunities will be explored to strengthen government’s own
oversight of the use of funds, by factoring institutional fiduciary capacity building into
project design.

Similarly, the new Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), adopted in August 2016,
has been designed to meet the varied needs of countries. The ESF will help borrowers
manage their environmental and social risks more effectively and efficiently and will be
implemented during the RPF period. Among other things, the ESF will be accompanied by
capacity strengthening activities and stronger strategic partnerships with development
partners.

Reflecting differences in the WBG’s engagement with individual countries and the les-
sons from the past, projects will be designed to reflect country capacity. The Bank’s
portfolio will focus upon a limited set of priorities and avoid fragmentation within and
across countries as much as possible. This may mean building first upon existing plat-
forms for delivery and expanding outside these only as capacity increases. Given the thin
capacity in many domains in this region, including financial management and procure-
ment, complex project design poses a higher-than-average risk to implementing projects
successfully and will be avoided. Projects will also anticipate the attrition of capacity due
to outward migration and plan to mitigate that risk through enhanced training efforts.
Greater collaboration with regional organizations that the Bank has previously worked
less with, will be fostered (such as the Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions)
and the Confederation of Asian & Pacific Accountants, and implementation modalities of
a regional nature, along the lines of those currently in place to manage regional programs,
will be considered where relevant.
64   Regional Partnership Framework




     The WBG will continue to look for ways to support government implementing agencies.
     For example, as appropriate the WBG will undertake frequent implementation support
     missions, take advantage of simplified procedures, integrating to the extent possible with
     government fiduciary systems, pilot various regional implementation schemes (one ex-
     ample is the TFSU, which supports implementation of aviation projects in five PICs), and
     explore a consolidated/centralized approach to support the fiduciary aspects of project
     management, such as the approach taken Kiribati through the Kiribati Fiduciary Support
     Unit (KFSU) and in FSM and RMI coordinated by the Finance Ministry/Department.

     To maintain a strong engagement in the Pacific, the WBG will continue to have a sub-
     stantial presence across the region. This will be essential to provide stepped up imple-
     mentation support to countries. The WBG will gradually move some staff from the Sydney
     office to Suva, Fiji to have a greater presence in the South Pacific. In Samoa and Vanuatu,
     separate liaison officers have been recruited in anticipation of a significantly larger port-
     folio and a new joint WB/ADB liaison office will be established in Tuvalu. In addition to
     the increase in staffing in Fiji, there will continue to be an in-country presence in Kiribati,
     Samoa, Tonga Tuvalu and Vanuatu (in addition to Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea, and
     Solomon Islands, which are not covered by this RPF9). In order to manage the regular de-
     mands upon staff time and resources of supporting disaster responses, a pool of qualified
     consultants who can be on call for engagement in Post Disaster Needs Assessments will
     be progressively built up so that these events do not take away from the regular resilience
     and preparedness work program.

     3.4.4	 Coordination and Partnerships
     The WBG enjoys strong collaboration and coordination with its development partners in
     the Pacific. In support of the PIC9, the Bank has received significant trust fund resources
     from Australia and New Zealand, including (i) the Pacific Facility IV, a Multi Donor Trust
     Fund (MDTF) managed by the Bank that provides core funding for such Bank-executed
     activities as lending, supervision, and ASA; (ii) the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility
     (PRIF), an MDTF established in 2009 to support infrastructure development in the Pacific;
     and (iii) the Australia Pacific Islands Strategic Partnership Trust Fund, a single-donor trust
     fund established in FY16 that supports recipient-executed activities and associated Bank
     supervision and preparation costs. These resources provide a robust framework for con-
     tinued collaboration.

     The Bank will continue to work closely with development partners to coordinate its en-
     gagement across the Pacific. In Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu, the WBG shares
     Liaison Offices with ADB, and a new joint Liaison Office is being opened in Tuvalu. The new
     WBG office in Fiji is co-located with ADB’s Pacific Sub-regional Office, which will further
     enhance coordination across the PIC9. Opportunities for joint programming will be sought,
     continuing the successful efforts in IDA17 to co-finance critical pieces of infrastructure
     (such as ICT in Tonga, Palau, and Samoa, the roads project in Kiribati as well as in Fiji,
     where a waiver was obtained for the first time ever for the World Bank to adopt ADB’s
     procurement rules). Other important partners in the Pacific include the United Nations,
     European Union, France, Japan, the USA, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
                                                          Regional Partnership Framework         65




The Bank has initiated the development of a “Common Approach” to safeguards in
association with other donor partners and SPREP. The purpose of the Common Approach
is to facilitate effective integration of environmental and social considerations into pro-
ject design and implementation by having a generally agreed approach for safeguard ap-
plication across the major development partners. In addition to increasing efficiency and
effectiveness of safeguard application, the Common Approach will support improved ca-
pacity development.

The development of policy matrices in budget support operations provide an additional
framework through which participating development partners collaborate on the key
development priorities in recipient countries. New opportunities for collaboration with
other development partners will be identified during the RPF period, particularly in in-
frastructure, climate resilience (including water and sanitation), and development policy
lending. Good coordination across the array of development partners, together with adop-
tion of harmonized procedures, will remain critical in reducing the transaction costs for
governments challenged with capacity constraints.

IFC is recognized as a key delivery partner for regional donors. Australia, New Zealand,
and IFC work together under the Pacific Partnership to promote inclusive growth and
support global integration in the Pacific region. Since December 2012, this US$32 mil-
lion Partnership has funded 31 projects across financial markets, corporate governance,
gender, tourism, PPPs, extractives and fisheries sectors across the region. It has also fa-
cilitated a committed investment portfolio of US$183 million and helped build a pipeline in
excess of US$115 million in investments across the banking, mining, clean energy, trans-
port, private equity and agribusiness sectors. Since inception, the Pacific Partnership has
also facilitated: over US$145 million in direct IFC investment in the Pacific; helped increase
incremental lending of US$106m to over 725 SMEs; helped 1.1 million people by providing
improved access to infrastructure; delivered over $US45 million per annum in private sec-
tor cost savings from improved ease of doing business; and helped 1.2 million people gain
improved access to basic financial services. Discussions have already commenced with
Australia and New Zealand around the development of a successor arrangement to the
highly successful Pacific Partnership. While still under development, a new 5-year US$25
million partnership to commence in 2017 is expected to help strengthen the Pacific’s busi-
ness enabling environment, strengthen financial infrastructure, improve access to energy,
grow the tourism and fisheries sectors and strengthen infrastructure and service delivery.

Risk to the implementation of the RPF in the PIC9 is assessed as Substantial. The Bank
has been operating in some countries for several decades, while in others the relationship
is relatively new and institutions are not broadly familiar with Bank modalities. A range
of risks could significantly affect the implementation of WBG programs in the PIC9 (Table
4.1). The risks include: (i) exogenous macroeconomic shocks, (ii) political and governance
risk, (iii) the risk of recurring natural disasters of increased frequency and intensity; and,
(iv) implementation and capacity constraints.

•	 Macroeconomic risks. The PIC9 are highly vulnerable to economic shocks, a risk that
   is particularly pronounced due to the small size and openness of their economies. Com-
   monly occurring price shocks to commodity imports and exports increase hardship
   substantially and the costs of doing business. This vulnerability is most pronounced in
   the coral atoll countries where there is little arable land. Households are consequently
   dependent on imports of basic foods and vulnerable to volatile prices. The prospects for
   increased economic growth and domestic revenue generation are challenged as a result
   of limited opportunities, and structural rigidities, that leave little room to maneuver
   through economic policies. Like many other small states, debt sustainability is a chal-
   lenge, although varies significantly across the PIC9, and as a result part of the WBG
   program will continue to be provided as grants, with the remainder on concessional
   terms. The WBG program aims to address these risks through sustained and stepped
   up macroeconomic policy dialogue, including through its DPO series, addressing effec-
   tive public expenditure management and revenue generation, as well as close partner-
   ships with key partners to help sustain long term donor financing in the region.

•	 Political and governance risks. Risks of political insecurity and weak governance vary
   across the countries. Where most significant, constant changes in governments or po-
   litical alliances may disrupt or delay decisions with regard priorities and programs as
   well as undermine commitment to policy reforms. Successive governments may have
   differing priorities that in the short term lead to changes in programmatic directions.
   On the whole, however, it is not envisaged that political changes will fundamentally
   alter the strategic priorities laid down in the existing national development strategies,
   and the most significant challenges facing the countries are unlikely to change sub-
   stantially. In addition, the WBG would plan to maintain a broad dialogue across the
   political spectrum in countries, working where there is broad bipartisan support for
   policy reforms and program activities.

•   Natural disaster and climate risks. The PIC9 are among the countries most prone to
    natural disasters in the world. Extreme weather related events can be catastrophic and
    eliminate years of development progress. Climate change will continue to add pressure
    on fragile island systems by increasing average ocean and land temperatures and in-
    ducing changes in seasonality, duration of rainfall and increasing sea levels. In addition
    to the threat to human lives, natural disasters pose a significant threat to infrastruc-
    ture and agriculture, affect fiscal balances, and limit tourist arrivals, which are integral
    to the economies of several of the PIC9. The RPF program is designed to help mitigate
    many of the core disaster and climate risks to development through regional and coun-
    try specific initiatives to support climate resilience and disaster management. Extreme
68   Regional Partnership Framework




       weather events may nevertheless impact implementation across sectors. This risk
       would be addressed by rapid response, including the WBG’s engagement in support-
       ing Post Disaster Needs Assessments (PDNA), mobilizing resources through the Crisis
       Response Window when possible and through the reallocation of resources to facilitate
       disaster recovery where needed. In addition, the WBG is planning to scale up support
       for environmental and social safeguard in the region – not only through scaling up its
       own capacity in the field, but also through establishing safeguard learning centers and
       adopting a common safeguards framework with other donors.

     •	 Implementation and capacity constraints. Thin capacity in the Pacific poses a con-
        siderable risk to the implementation of the program as well as its sustainability. Thin
        capacity can contribute to a lack of decision making on the part of governments and
        delays implementation of key actions. Small and stretched public administrations have
        generally led to reliance upon project/program management units for Bank financed
        activities. Limited familiarity with Bank operational procedures in a number of the
        countries, and limited capacity in core areas such as auditing and accounting, add to
        implementation delays. In response, the Bank is planning to scale up capacity build-
        ing of staff working on Bank-financed projects and will look for opportunities to con-
        solidate fiduciary capacity where feasible to limit the demand for scarce skills in small
        countries. Project fiduciary risks will continue to be subject to ongoing assessment,
        forming the basis for implementation of relevant mitigation and (risk-based) monitor-
        ing measures. Similar management capacity constraints among local businesses and
        very limited opportunities for scalability in the domestic market impact the growth of
        the private sector and limit the number of bankable deals that the IFC can consider for
        investment on commercial terms. Regional expansion has helped the telecommunica-
        tions sector and the banking industry in the Pacific to gain scalability, which IFC will
        pursue more rigorously, supported by a closely aligned advisory services program.

The implementation risks identified here cannot be fully mitigated and it is therefore
essential to prepare for the possibility that some of these risks will materialize in at least
one or more of the PIC9. The WBG will need to be able to navigate and manage these risks
and adapt accordingly. It may need to place greater emphasis on the sequencing of WBG
support and on the capacity to make adjustments to the program as it is implemented.
Any changes to the lending program and results framework will be articulated during the
Performance and Learning Review, as well as during regular portfolio discussions.

Recognizing the capacity constraints, the WBG has also put into place a series of meas-
ures to mitigate to the extent possible the adverse impact that these constraints could
generate for the portfolio. These mitigation measures include (i) a focus of the program on
a few key priorities, (ii) deployment of staff on the ground and enhanced implementation
and hands-on support through dedicated implementation support staff across sectors;
(iii) structured collaboration between key government counterparts and development
partners aimed at building sustainable fiduciary capacity, (iv) deliberate adaptation of
Bank policies to fit the operating environment to the maximum extent possible; (v) the
use of regional approaches to support implementation, such as PROP, PREP, and PAIP; (vi)
the use of DPOs that focus on strengthening PFM and governance, transparency and ac-
countability; and (vii) a focus on managing financial risk for disaster-related events.

     ANNEX 5: PIC9 Regional Partnership Framework-
     Results Framework
                             FOCUS AREA 1: Fully exploiting available economic opportunities
       The combined challenge of small size, remoteness from major markets and internal dispersion increase the
       costs of private production and public administration, lower the return to market activities and narrow the
       feasible set of economic opportunities. Given low growth and limited employment opportunities, the PICs
       need to fully exploit the limited set of available economic opportunities.
       Objective 1.1 Improved management of oceanic and coastal fisheries
       Intervention Logic
       Fisheries are essential to the economies and development of the PIC9, and are of significant value to the
       international community. The Pacific islands ocean region covers 11 percent of the world’s oceans and
       their shared fisheries resources include: (i) oceanic fisheries (largely tuna) that provide public revenues; (ii)
       coastal fisheries that directly sustain rural livelihoods and contribute to food security and sometimes ex-
       ports; and (iii) the natural habitats and biodiversity that sustain them. Women are particularly dependent
       on coastal fisheries for informal economic opportunities including handicrafts.

Objective 1.2 Increased incomes from agriculture
Intervention Logic
Agriculture and coastal fishing play an important role in meeting the subsistence needs of the poor. Low-
cost and low quality food imports crowd out domestic production and contribute to non-communicable
diseases. Opportunities for exports of agricultural products are likely to remain limited, but opportunities
for small scale local trade, import substitution to supply the tourism sector and selected niche and cash
crop exports offer possible gains for many.

Tourism is central to private sector economic activity in several of the PIC9 countries. Tourism, as a service
sector with relatively low entry barriers and its supply chain stimulates demand for domestic produce, lo-
cal artwork and handicrafts. It is labor-intensive and supports significant domestic job creation and is one
of the few industries in the Pacific in which women and young people form a high percentage of job holders.
For young people, especially those who are unskilled, tourism is a potential pathway to productive employ-
ment. It is the cause of significant infrastructure demand, providing a rationale for increased investment
into airport, port and road infrastructure without which the industry cannot flourish. Regional approaches
would help enhance air access and the marketing of Pacific island destinations in new markets such as
Asia. Cruise shipping has the potential to offer benefits through greater local linkages, especially in the
South Pacific.

      Improving access to employment opportunities and basic social and infrastructure services, with a par-
      ticular emphasis on enhancing educational attainment and skills of the poor is key to improving the well-
      being of PIC9 populations.
      Objective 2.1 Broadened Opportunities for Access to Labor Markets
      Intervention Logic
      International labor mobility has already delivered significant and generally pro-poor benefits for some of
      the PIC9; evidence suggests improved labor mobility for some of these island countries provides benefits
      to not only to migrants, but also their households, communities and sending countries; remittances are
      an important income source that helps to bring many households out of poverty. Pursuing agreements to
      scale up existing seasonal migration schemes would offer critical opportunities for low-skilled workers.
      Expanding quotas for permanent migration, better targeting opportunities towards the poor and towards
      countries that have only limited participation, and creating new opportunities for higher skilled workers,
      such as nurses, are priorities and require joint action by labor sending and labor receiving countries.

Objective 2.2 Addressing education and skills gap
Intervention Logic
Closing gaps with regard to access and quality of education is vital because of the correlation this gap
has to hardship. The absence of access to quality education translates into unequal access to economic
opportunities, especially with respect to overseas employment opportunities and public sector jobs. Edu-
cational attainment is shown to contribute to higher rates of economic growth by increasing the avail-
ability of skilled labor, and increasing opportunities for the most marginal and most vulnerable to escape
poverty. Enhanced skill development and training opportunities, especially related to the tourism sector,
is important to allow the poor to take advantage of employment opportunities and for the development of
the sector. Educating girls is particularly important for gender equality.

Objective 2.3 Addressing gender inequality and Gender Based Violence
Intervention Logic
The PIC-9 countries suffer from gender inequalities in terms of access to economic opportunities, access
to endowments, women’s voice and agency, especially gender-based violence and vulnerability to emerging
risks. In addition, the PIC-9 are plagued with some of the highest levels of gender-based violence (GBV) in
the world. Violence against women significantly and negatively affects their health, well-being, and agen-
cy, and beyond the human costs, violence incurs major economy-wide costs such as expenditures on ser-
vice provision, forgone income for women and their families, decreased productivity and negative effects
on human capital. The overwhelming majority of abused women in the Pacific report they have not sought
help from formal services or from people in positions of authority such as police, non-government organi-
zations, religious or local leaders.

                                    Focus Area 3: Protecting incomes and livelihoods
      Protecting incomes and livelihoods of the poor and the bottom 40 percent is particularly important in the
      context of climate change, frequent natural disasters and economic shocks. The low-lying atolls of the
      Pacific are vulnerable to sea level rise. Though the timeframe and severity of the impacts of climate change
      are uncertain, concern for the lives and livelihoods of the people of the Pacific is paramount given that cli-
      mate change outcomes encompass the displacement of human settlements by sea-level rise, reduced food
      production, water scarcity and increased disease.
      Objective 3.1 Strengthened resilience to natural disasters and climate change
      Intervention Logic
      There is a need to mainstream disaster risk reduction policy among the PIC9 into many areas of policy
      making and development efforts. This includes strengthening policy, institutional and evidence-based de-
      cision making capacity including via easy-to-access and relevant data and inclusive, participatory ap-
      proaches, as well as strengthening disaster early warning, preparedness, and response. Mainstreaming
      disaster risk and climate change considerations into development planning and investments (including
      infrastructure plans, land use plans, building codes and environmental impact assessments, as well as sec-
      tors such as agriculture, health, education, fisheries, is along important, together with strengthening the
      financial resilience of countries to climate and disaster shocks. The need for a long-term strategy for the
      atoll islands, as they have their own unique resilience needs, is also apparent.

Objective 3.2 Strengthening health systems and addressing NCDs
Intervention Logic
The Pacific faces an urgent health challenge in the form of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The top
seven most overweight countries in the world are PICs; the prevalence of obesity in adults is high among
adults. The transition away from traditional foods and towards high sugar, fat, salt and highly processed
imported foodstuffs is a major factor contributing to the increase of NCDs. Diabetes rates are far above
those seen in other low and middle income countries. The proportion of premature deaths from NCDs
among men and women in the Pacific are far higher than the lower-middle-income country average. In ad-
dition to reducing life expectancy and quality of life, NCDs also limit peoples’ capacity to lead productive
lives and the cost of treatment threatens to overwhelm the budgetary resources.

         FOCUS AREA 4: Strengthening the enablers of growth opportunities (macroeconomic management,
                                     infrastructure and addressing knowledge gaps)
      Analysis and policy making with respect to poverty reduction and shared prosperity in the PIC9 are se-
      verely constrained by the paucity and low quality of data. In particular, none of the PIC9 fields regular
      household surveys that would allow policy choices to be informed by a good understanding of the poor and
      the key drivers of poverty. It also constrains the evaluation of which policies have the most impact on pov-
      erty reduction. Investment in improved information on the situation of the vulnerable and poor would also
      be essential to design social protection programs in the PIC9.
      Objective 4.1 Frameworks to improve fiscal management developed and maintained
      Intervention Logic
      Macroeconomic management affects the welfare of the poorest and most vulnerable through a number
      of channels. By providing a stable and low-inflationary macroeconomic environment, improved macro-
      economic policy can provide a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for sustained growth in aggre-
      gate economic activity, which in turn is generally linked to the income growth of the bottom 40 percent.
      Strengthened public financial management systems are key to improving the management and efficiency
      of public expenditure. There are important weaknesses in accountability and efficiency in the management
      of public resources across the PIC9. Establishing systems that build accountability, improve technical and
      allocative efficiency, and ensure a dependable flow of resources to service delivery units is vital. Improved
      macroeconomic management would also provide insulation against the effects of exogenous shocks, which
      tend to hit the B40 hardest, while ensuring that adequate public resources are allocated to welfare-en-
      hancing expenditures on social sectors at all points in the economic cycle. Frequent external shocks pose a
      significant challenge to macro-economic management and sustainability. In addition, over the RPF period
      several countries will have to adjust fiscal and macro-economic management to ensure that the increases
      in revenue from fisheries access fees are well used. FSM and RMI face the additional challenge of adjust-
      ing revenue and expenditures in anticipation of a more constrained fiscal environment after the scheduled
      termination of Compact grants in 2023.

Objective 4.2 Increased access to basic services and improved connective infrastructure
Intervention Logic
Disparities in basic services-spanning access to water and sanitation to electricity and information and
communication technologies-are particularly pronounced among the PICs. In some PICs in particular, ser-
vices are often limited to the main islands, while the outer islands, where most of the poor reside, have very
limited access. Given the high cost of providing services to populations in remote islands, it is important to
close gaps in service provision wherever this is feasible and economical.

In order to support progress against both of the twin goals, infrastructure coverage gaps need to be ad-
dressed; much of the population in countries such as Vanuatu, Kiribati, and FSM lack access to basic ser-
vices like sanitation facilities and electricity. Land transport infrastructure on larger outer islands and
outer-island shipping services also need to meet a basic standard. The efficacy of domestic shipping ser-
vices is quite variable around the region, and it is a priority to address market failures which result in rural
areas being cut off by high-cost, infrequent or sporadic shipping services. Improved connectivity and better
infrastructure will be critical to help advance the well-being of the people of the Pacific and their access
to growth. The most important connectivity improvement for the air tourism sector is to create more con-
venient flight connections from key markets.

Objective 4.3 Address knowledge gaps
Intervention Logic
Analysis and policy making with respect to poverty reduction and shared prosperity in the Pacific are
severely constrained by the paucity and low quality of data. In particular, none of the PIC9 fields regular
household surveys that would allow policy choices to be informed by a good understanding of the poor and
the key drivers of poverty. It also constrains the evaluation of which policies have the most impact on pov-
erty reduction. Investment in improved information on the situation of the vulnerable and poor would also
be essential to design social protection programs in the PIC9.

manage its domestic affairs. Most public services are delivered at the state level. The loose
federation structure presents challenges for decision making, building consensus, and im-
plementing national reforms or programs. FSM maintains deep ties and a cooperative re-
lationship with the USA, with which it has a Compact of Free Association that provides
yearly financial transfers to FSM and permits open migration to the USA, among other
arrangements. Compact financing includes “Compact sector grants” (which help sustain
the delivery of public services) and contributions to the Compact Trust Fund (CTF), which
was established to replace the Compact sector grants when they terminate at the end
of FY2023. Fiscal adjustments are required over the next seven years as Compact sector
grants come to a close. It will be a major challenge to carry out those adjustments without
reducing the quality of public service delivery or limiting access to services—especially to
the poorest 40 percent of the population. The open migration allowed under the Compact
provides opportunities for overseas employment, which can generate remittances to sup-
port households in FSM. The drawbacks of migration is that it depopulates poorer parts of
the country, increases the dependency ratios among those who remain, and reduces the
economy’s long-run productive potential.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

Economic activity in FSM consists primarily of subsistence farming and fishing and de-
pends heavily on external assistance. Real GDP declined by 3.6 percent in FY2014 (ending
September 30) following a 3.4 percent contraction in FY2013. GDP declined in each of the
four states in both fiscal years for the first time since GDP was recorded. This contrac-
tion is largely explained by the decline in domestic fisheries and construction. Domestic
fisheries declined during the period because much of the fishing fleet underwent mainte-
nance. Employment dropped by 4.1 percent, with private sector employment falling by 7.7
percent and public employment by 2.1 percent. Construction declined because of delays in
implementing some infrastructure projects, and the completion of the majority of airport
improvement projects funded by the USA. Inflation continued to decline from the recent
peak in FY2011 to around to -0.2 in FY2015, as food and fuel prices decreased.

FSM achieved an estimated fiscal surplus of US$35.6 million (or 11.2 percent of GDP) in
FY2014. The surplus was largely explained by the rising fishing license fees) and a one-
time payment associated with the captive insurance market. A portion of the surplus
was invested into the FSMs own Trust Fund to support the 2023 transition. Tax receipts,
excluding one-off revenue, remain low compared to regional peers, at around 12percent
of GDP. Legislation supporting the tax reform initiative (including the proposed introduc-
tion of a value-added tax) failed to pass. The fiscal outturns also differed significantly
100   Regional Partnership Framework




      between the FSM national and state governments. The national government ran a surplus
      of US$42.9 million, while all states recorded small deficits, amounting to US$7.3 million.
      The FSM state governments, where service delivery occurs, have been constrained by the
      declining real value of Compact grants, while the national government has benefited from
      booming revenues from fishing fees and, to a lesser extent, the one-time payment from
      the captive insurance market, both of which are mostly kept at the national level. Should
      this level of surplus persist in the medium term, its accumulation in the FSM Trust Fund,
      the Compact Trust Fund or an alternative fund could buffer against volatilities in the fi-
      nancial markets and reduce the pending fiscal shortfall after FY2024, when the Compact
      of Free Association grants are scheduled to end.

      The current account reached an estimated surplus equivalent to 6.8 percent of GDP in
      FY2014 (from a deficit of 9.9 percent in FY2013), mainly due to the income associated with
      the one-time captive insurance industry payment. Excluding that payment, the current
      account deficit would have narrowed to 7.7 percent of GDP in FY2014. The weakness in
      the economy and falling fuel prices are reflected in weak imports, which fell by 11 percent
      compared to FY2013. On the other hand, strong fishing license fees continued to sup-
      port the decline in the trade deficit in FY2013 and FY2014. The current account deficit is
      expected to remain at around 10 percent of GDP in the medium term, largely financed by
      the inflow of official transfers. The 2015 Debt Sustainability Analysis also found FSM to
      be at a high risk of debt distress, although tax- and growth-enhancing reforms could help
      contain debt risks while ensuring the country’s development needs are met.

      Poverty and Shared Prosperity

      FSM has the highest estimated rates of poverty among the PIC9. Estimates from the
      2013/14 HIES suggest that 17 percent of the population lives below the internationally
      comparable Extreme Poverty consumption benchmark of US$1.90 per person per day (in
      2011 PPP terms). The situation appears to have deteriorated since 2005, when Extreme
      Poverty was estimated at 11 percent (although the comparability of consumption aggre-
      gates is limited by changes in the methodology over time). The national basic-needs poverty
      line derived from the 2013/14 HIES sets a higher welfare benchmark than the international
      Extreme Poverty standard, implying 41 percent of the FSM population struggles to meet
      basic needs (with 10 percent living on consumption levels below the food poverty line).

      Multidimensional indicators suggest a more positive long-term trend in well-being, how-
      ever. Between 2005 and 2013, the proportion of households with no access to electricity
      fell from 32 percent to 24 percent and the proportion of dwellings without sanitary facili-
      ties fell from 46 percent to 21 percent.

      There is stark regional variation in poverty across the Federation. Basic-needs poverty is
      both most common and most severe in Chuuk (with a national basic-needs poverty rate
      of 46 percent), followed by Pohnpei and Yap (each with a headcount rate of 39 percent),
      while it is somewhat lower in Kosrae (21 percent). Poverty in Pohnpei and Yap reflects a
      particularly high cost of living, while the cost of living is relatively low in Chuuk, suggest-
      ing poverty there (as measured by real consumption levels) reflects lower incomes, or more
      modest subsistence production levels.
                                                           Regional Partnership Framework         101




Multidimensional indicators on access to electricity, improved water sources, schools, and
assets in general suggest deprivation is most widespread in Chuuk (though Yap has a much
higher proportion of households with poor-quality housing, and also a higher proportion
with no improved sanitation). In general, the incidence of basic-needs poverty is higher for
larger households; it is lower for households headed by a male, for households with a more
highly educated household head, and for households where the head is employed in the
public sector. The national Gini coefficient on nominal per capita consumption across the
population is estimated at 0.43, but no estimates currently exist on the changing income
share of the B40 over time.

Development Agenda

FSM faces challenges in securing economic growth and sustainability in the medium to
long term. Growth is expected to remain below 1 percent in the medium term, and the
expiration of Compact sector grants poses a major challenge to the economy. In the short
to medium term, declining public sector demand from the reduction in Compact sector
grants is expected to act as a drag on economic growth. Limited private sector growth
is not expected to fully offset this effect. Remoteness from major markets and the small
scale of the economy make it costly to operate, difficult to attract foreign investors, and
challenging to retain skilled workers. These circumstances could limit the government’s
ability to provide services to its citizens, with negative effects on living standards. The
current trajectory of the Compact Trust Fund is not on track to fully offset expiring U.S.
grants after FY2023, although the FSM Trust Fund will partially offset the shortfall. In this
context, the risk of lower than anticipated trust fund returns underscores the importance
of strengthening fiscal buffers.

Pursuing the goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity in FSM—in line with the
government’s own objectives—will require the government to find new opportunities to
generate revenue and growth to create jobs and provide equitable benefits to society. Pur-
suing those goals will also require expenditures to be managed effectively to ensure that
essential services reach a wide share of the population, with a focus upon the poor and un-
derserved. To support that approach, FSM must build a stronger evidence base on poverty
to target resources to address particular needs.

Strengthening economic infrastructure and improving the investment climate are cen-
tral to fostering economic growth and protecting service delivery as FSM prepares for
the 2023 transition. The upgrading of airports supported by the USA will be completed
in 2017. A slowdown in the implementation of infrastructure projects affects the living
standards of the population and medium-term economic outlook. Investments and policy
reforms to enhance ICT, energy, and transport infrastructure are important government
priorities. With the support of IFC, in 2013 FSM developed an action plan to facilitate in-
vestment. The plan focuses on fostering economic growth and sustainable development
by improving the business climate and enhancing the financial literacy of the private sec-
tor, which should in turn build the confidence of financial institutions to lend to the private
sector. Implementation has remained stagnant.
102   Regional Partnership Framework




      On the other hand, FSM has significant opportunities to increase the economic return on
      its natural resources. The country’s substantial endowment of natural resources includes
      its natural beauty (an asset for tourism) and fisheries. Despite having the world’s best div-
      ing site (situated in Chuuk), poor infrastructure, land tenure issues, the weak investment
      climate, and vested interests impede development of the tourism sector. The Exclusive
      Economic Zone (EEZ) also happens to be situated in one of the world’s last viable tuna fish-
      eries. Efforts to extract a higher economic return from this fishery has increased revenues
      and savings in recent years, but more could be done.

      The open access of FSM citizens to the USA under the Compact is another economic
      opportunity that could be better utilized to benefit both nations. The key to facilitating
      migration, however, is to provide an adequate education to produce a qualified and ap-
      propriately skilled labor force.

      National Strategy and Its Key Pillars/Focus

      The government’s vision for achieving economic growth is detailed in the FSM Strategic
      Development Plan (SDP) 2004–2023, completed in 2004. This plan, an output of the Third
      FSM Economic Summit held in 2003, reflected the input of more than 400 participants
      with a wide range of perspectives from the government, traditional leaders, industry, and
      civil society. The growth strategy focuses on six key areas: (i) macroeconomic stability;
      (ii) good governance; (iii) developing an outward-oriented, private sector-led economy; (iv)
      investing in human resources (improved health and education services); (v) investing in
      infrastructure; and (vi) long-term environmental sustainability. Recognizing the impor-
      tance of women’s contributions to the future of FSM, the SDP devotes an entire chapter
      to gender.

      The national government have recently developed updated strategy documents collabo-
      ratively with the four states that draw from align and in some cases replace sections
      of the SDP and also provide an updated focus reflecting changes in the country’s envi-
      ronment since 2003. These include the Overseas Development Assistance (ODA - 2015)
      policy; the Infrastructure Development Plan (IDP 2016-2023) which replaces volume III of
      the SDP and the 2023 Action Plan (2015) – a three year plan focusing on the economic
      sectors and the enabling environment; other strategy documents include State level stra-
      tegic plans and the Joint National/State Action Plans (JNAP). The ODA has six nationwide
      priority areas (i) Food and water security; (2) Health – diagnostic facilities; (3) Renewable
      Energy; (4) Private Sector Support Facility; (5) Infrastructure 2016- 2023; (6) Health and
      Education - (to be endorsed by congress in early 2017).

      World Bank Group Program

      The World Bank program has been developed through consultations with national and
      state governments and key stakeholders, it is aligned with the strategic documents of the
      FSM to support their development needs and provides a balance of working at the national
      and state level.

During the CPF period, the indicative areas of engagement in FSM include:

•	 Improving electricity supply and efficiency while setting the stage to increase the use
   of renewable energy;
•	 Improving connectivity through enhancing telecommunications access and affordabil-
   ity and improving the safety and sustainability of maritime services;
•	 Supporting the government prepare for the 2013 Transition for Compact Sector Grants
   to funding from the CTF through strengthened PFM systems; improving the targeting
   of service delivery; and increasing sustainably the revenue from fisheries;
•	 Enhancing food security and livelihoods for communities through coastal fisheries and
   improved connectivity.

      Development Partners

      The Bank will work collaboratively with other partners during the implementation of the
      program. For PFM, the Bank will focus on strengthening the financial management and
      reporting systems and associated business processes which will complement the broader
      PFM reform efforts underway by the IMF and the EU. The current Energy project will provide
      government with a framework to coordinate and prioritize investments by the government
      and development partners such as the EU, NZ and ADB and the follow on Bank project.
      Financial support provided by the USG is programmed through the FSM government’s
      budget and planning process or directly provided by US federal agencies. It is primarily
      focused on the sectors of education, health and infrastructure. There may be opportuni-
      ties during the CPF period for collaboration particularly in the area of ICT demand side
      applications such as e-health/telemedicine for example.


      KIRIBATI
      Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

      Growth in Kiribati has been strong and is expected to remain above-trend this year. Real
      GDP growth reached an estimated 3.7 percent in 2014 and around 3.4 percent in 2015,
      driven by donor-financed infrastructure projects (in the road, port, and aviation sectors)
      and an increase in credit to households. Inflation has remained below 2 percent as lower
      food and commodity prices offset the pressures from the higher domestic demand and
      weaker Australian dollar. Despite large trade deficits (40–47 percent of GDP over the last
      five years), the current account balance has remained in a large surplus thanks to record
      fishing license fee revenue paid by foreign companies to fish in Kiribati’s vast Exclusive
      Economic Zone and, to the lesser degrees, steady remittances and investment incomes
      from the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF), Kiribati’s sovereign wealth fund. The
      fishing license fee revenue recorded AUD 198 million in 2015, about 90 percent of GDP and
      more than double the level seen in 2013, driven by the favorable El Nino effect, the imple-
      mentation of the Vessel Day Scheme (a regional agreement that establishes the minimum
      price of a vessel day and limits the total number of vessel and fishing days sold) and the
      appreciation of the US dollar against the Australian dollar. Reversing the decades’ trend of
      continual drawdowns, the government made a net transfer of AUD 50 million to the RERF
      in 2015. The new government which came in power in March 2016 made the decision to
      transfer additional AUD 70 million to the RERF to safeguard intergenerational equity.

      The outlook remains positive, although the fishing license fee revenue is expected to come
      down from recent peaks with changing climate cycle and migration patterns of tuna.
      Growth is expected to gradually moderate toward the potential growth, averaging around
      2-3 percent per year, but commencement of new major infrastructure projects with de-
      velopment partners, if materializes, will shift upward the medium term growth forecast.
      Risks to the outlook includes disorderly slowdown in China, which could result in growth
      in Asia Pacific Region and could negatively affect fishing license fees and seamen’s re-
                                                          Regional Partnership Framework        105




mittances. A heightened volatility in global financial markets—in response to an interest
rate hike by the United States government, for example—could have a negative impact
on returns to RERF assets. Making the RERF sustainable to protect the country’s overall
economic stability remains a key policy challenge, given Kiribati’s large structural trade
deficits, highly volatile fishing license revenues, and large spending needs to address wide-
spread poverty and the severe infrastructure backlog.

Kiribati remains at high risk of debt distress, according to the latest IMF/ World Bank Debt
Sustainability Analysis. As of end-2015, public domestic debt was estimated at 2.4 per-
cent of GDP, while gross public external debt was estimated at about 22 percent of GDP.
The assessment of high risk of debt distress reflects Kiribati’s limited capacity to take on
debt, given its low potential growth and narrow export base. Containing the risk requires
securing grants rather than concessional loans to finance the country’s large development
needs, invest in physical and human capital to raise productivity, diversify exports, and
raise long-term growth.

Poverty and Shared Prosperity

Poverty estimates for Kiribati are among the highest in the region, although they are
based on results of the HIES, last conducted more than 10 years ago. A new HIES is slated
for 2017, and the World Bank is engaged in a coordinated dialogue to support this effort. In
2006, 14 percent of the population lived in extreme poverty, according to the international
benchmark of per capita consumption of 2011 PPP US$1.90 per day. The national welfare
benchmark is implicitly somewhat more generous; 22 percent of i-Kiribati were estimated
to be living below the national basic-needs poverty line in 2006 (with 5 percent below the
food poverty line).

Estimates in the SCD (from the 2006 HIES) indicate a nationwide Gini coefficient on per
capita nominal consumption expenditure across the population of 0.38, which is relatively
low by Pacific standards. Estimates of the incidence of national basic-needs poverty are
comparable across South Tarawa and the rest of the Gilbert Islands (24 and 22 percent,
respectively, in 2006), but considerably lower (9 percent) in the far flung Phoenix and Line
Islands, home to roughly 10 percent of the population. Drawing on the 2006 HIES data,
2010 census data, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions with i Kiribati, a
recent analysis by Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)15 highlights
differences in the nature of hardship in the capital compared to the islands. Residents of
South Tarawa tend to have limited access to land and are more likely to have health is-
sues from poor water, sanitation, and overcrowding. At the same time, they derive greater
benefit from remittances from seafaring and salary incomes (which contribute 71 per-
cent of their household income, compared with 35 percent for households on the islands).
Households on the islands tend to have a larger share of young and old members, as well
as poorer access to education, health, and communication services. While food security is
relatively robust for people living outside the capital, natural resources (including potable
water) are increasingly under strain.

      Development Agenda
      Strengthening assets and capabilities of the bottom 40 percent. The most important
      asset of the poor is human capital, and education and health are its main determinants.
      Apart from nearly achieving universal primary education, Kiribati has not achieved any
      of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Progress toward the health MDGs is par-
      ticularly poor; Kiribati has the region’s highest under-five, infant, and maternal mortality
      rates. Better access to water and sanitation is necessary to achieve the health MDG out-
      comes. With donor support, the government is investing in infrastructure.

      Improving public sector effectiveness. Kiribati’s economy is dominated by the public sec-
      tor, which accounts for as much as 50 percent of GDP and nearly 80 percent of jobs in
      the formal sector. The private sector remains small, mostly consisting of small firms in
      the wholesale, retail, and transport sectors. The country has 24 state-owned enterprises
      (SOEs) operating in sectors where private firms would normally be expected in other coun-
      tries—including hotels, shipping, inter-island transport, and retailing. The private sector
      has struggled to make inroads in many of these areas in part because of inherent disecon-
      omies of scale, high costs, and severe infrastructure deficits (roads, ports, and airports).
      The public provision of goods and services through SOEs has resulted in limited supply or
      coverage and high costs, despite huge fiscal costs.

      Creating jobs and economic opportunities. Public sector employment and traditional sea-
      faring cannot be the solution to high and rising unemployment, with an estimated 2,000
      young people entering the labor market each year. While expectations about the viability
      of the private sector need to be realistic, Kiribati’s potential for private sector growth has
      not been fully exploited because of the difficult investment climate. In the near term, ex-
      panding employment opportunities through seasonal work in other countries provides the
      best opportunity for many i-Kiribati, most of whom rely on the government’s expensive
      copra subsidy scheme. Given the country’s unique disadvantages—distance, high costs
      of air transport, and lack of the colonial ties that give other PIC9 countries some level of
      migration or trade with Australia, New Zealand, and the USA—special windows may need
      to be negotiated bilaterally with the host countries.

      National Strategy and Its Key Pillars/Focus
      Kiribati has recently launched its 5-year National Development Plan (2016–19). The plan
      focuses on 6 key priority areas-human resource development, economic growth and pov-
      erty reduction, health, environment, governance and infrastructure.

      World Bank Group Program
      The World Bank program has been developed through wide consultations with government
      and key stakeholders, it is fully aligned with the Kiribati Development Plan and builds
      on recommendations from the SCD. MoF will continue to be instrumental in ensuring the
      program is aligned with government priorities and is endorsed by the leadership and the
      Kiribati Fiduciary Services Unit will be further strengthened in the RPF period to assume

Development Partners

The Bank will continue to work collaboratively with other partners during the implementa-
tion of the program, seek synergies where applicable and avoid overlaps in sectors where
others have a comparative advantage. In the ICT sector, the World Bank will work closely
with ADB to bring a high speed fiber optic cable to the country (linking Nauru and FSM as
well). A water and sanitation investment for Tarawa and potentially the outer islands will
similarly be undertaken in partnership with ADB. Cooperation will continue with Australia,
especially in the area of climate resilience and synergies will be sought to complement
planned efforts with New Zealand in support of the fisheries sector. Building on the ongo-
ing renewable energy project, the World Bank will collaborate with partners to prioritize
investments by the government and development partners. There may be opportunities
during the RPF period for collaboration particularly in the area of maritime investments in
the outer islands, where any engagement will be closely coordinated with the EU, which is
channeling significant support to Christmas Island.

      REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS (RMI)
      Sociopolitical and Institutional Factors

      Along with other North Pacific Islands, the RMI was consolidated into the Trust Territory
      of the Pacific Islands governed by the USA during the Second World War. The Marshall
      Islands became self-governing in 1979 and achieved formal independence in 1986. Upon
      independence, it entered into the original Compact of Free Association with the USA; the
      Compact provides regular financial transfers to the RMI.

      The RMI is governed as a mixed parliamentary-presidential system. General elections are
      held every four years with each of 24 constituencies electing one or more representatives
      (Senators) to the lower house of the bicameral legislature (Nitijela). The President, and
      Head of State, is subsequently elected by the 33 senators. The upper house (Council of
      Iroij) is an advisory body comprising 12 tribal chiefs.

      The RMI maintains deep ties with the USA, and although it is gradually reducing its reli-
      ance on the USAwith the tapering off of Compact sector grants, capacity remains thin.
      In FY2004, the amended Compact came into effect. Under this agreement, the RMI re-
      ceives yearly financial transfers in the form of Compact sector grants, which have greater
      accountability requirements. RMI initially struggled to adjust to the new requirements,
      partly due to capacity issues. The amended Compact also comes with financing in the
      form of contributions to the Compact Trust Fund (CTF), which will replace the Compact
      sector grants when they terminate at the end of FY2023. Unlike many other countries
      that rely on development assistance, the RMI experiences higher certainty with respect to
      the flow of resources under the Compact arrangements. Capacity is gradually being built,
      as the country transitions from Compact dependency, although it remains thin. The RMI
      also enjoys an open migration policy for citizens to go to the USA, although this has also
      contributed to depopulation, reducing the productive potential of the economy.

      Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

      The public sector dominates the Marshallese economy, accounting for approximately half
      of GDP, and transfers to SOEs have been a significant drain on public resources. The size
      of the public sector partly reflects the inability of a very small country to exploit econo-
      mies of scale in public administration and service provision. Agriculture and fisheries are
      the main economic activities, contributing a little over one-fifth of GDP, with small-scale
      service industry such as wholesale and retail trade constituting the remainder of the
      economy. With private sector development limited by remoteness, small market size, SOE
      dominance in some sectors and a weak business climate, growth is highly dependent on
      government spending and fiscal policy overall. Because RMI has no central bank and uses
      the US dollar as its national currency, fiscal policy is the only tool for macroeconomic
      management. Government revenues are dominated by foreign grants (generally Compact
      related) and characterized by a narrow tax base. With Compact sector grants scheduled
      to expire in FY2023, the RMI needs to capitalize its trust fund adequately to sustainably
      support government spending at reasonable levels in the long term.
                                                            Regional Partnership Framework                     109




Economic growth recorded a positive, but lackluster performance in FY2015 (ending
September 30) with a 0.6 percent increase in GDP, an improvement over the previous
year’s decline of 0.9 percent. However, the economy was largely flat; fisheries output was
unchanged on the prior year as well as construction activity, which remained at low levels
reflecting the continuing absence of Compact infrastructure grant usage. While activity in
the wholesale and retail trade fell, financial intermediation and education services showed
signs of growth. Reflecting the large reductions in international fuel prices, inflation as
recorded through the CPI, fell by 2.2 percent, but by the first quarter of 2016 had returned
to positive territory.

Preliminary data for FY2015 indicates the RMI achieved a fiscal surplus in FY2015 equiva-
lent to 2.9 percent of GDP. Tax revenues grew by 6 percent, which mainly reflected a sig-
nificant increase in ship registry fees. Without the ship registry fees, tax revenues grew by
0.5 percent reflecting the weak growth in the economy. Receipt of grants grew although
use of the Compact infrastructure grant fell. A large increase of $3.5 million was recorded
in the use of fishing royalties. The major growth item of expense was a large increase in
subsidy payments to the SOE sector of $5.6 million. Transfers to local government’s also
increased by $1.5 million.

A joint World Bank-IMF debt sustainability analysis conducted in November 2013 conclud-
ed that RMI is at high risk of debt distress. The country’s vulnerability to debt distress is
exacerbated by contingent liabilities associated with subsidies to poorly performing SOEs,
unfunded pension liabilities, and the lack of fiscal buffers.

      Poverty and Shared Prosperity

      The quantitative data available on the incidence of poverty in RMI are extremely limited
      but suggest that poverty is a serious issue. The last HIES (in 2002) identified an official
      national income poverty rate of 53 percent. Some sources have suggested incorrectly that
      20 percent of Marshallese live in extreme poverty, but that is incorrect.17 The World Bank
      is working with the government to prepare a new HIES for 2016/17 to gather updated in-
      formation.

      According to 1999 census data, the Gini coefficient for the distribution of household-level
      cash income in RMI was 0.54 (note that this figure is not comparable with measures of
      inequality that reflect the value of consumption per capita). An ADB and Asia Foundation
      report issued in 200618 concluded that the consequences of long-term economic stag-
      nation included social and health problems such as crime, domestic violence, unemploy-
      ment, malnourishment, and substance abuse. A 2009 report by the World Health Organi-
      zation cited evidence of increasing poverty and hardship in RMI.19 Government revenue
      and expenditure policies to counter existing inequalities have not achieved the expected
      objectives and could be strengthened through more effective execution and monitoring.
      The problem is acute in the outer islands, which are isolated from the mainstream and
      experience extremely limited access to capital or opportunities and poor service delivery
      (especially in health and education). The incidence of squalor and inequality appears to
      be increasing in urban areas; the traditional social bonds and extended family ties that
      provided some protection against poverty appear to be weakening. On the positive side,
      whereas past survey data suggested a net outflow of remittances to support emigrants
      to the USA (many of whom were reportedly living below the US poverty line), anecdotal
      evidence suggests that remittance inflows have started to pick up in recent years.

      Development Agenda

      Pursing the goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity in RMI—in line with the gov-
      ernment’s own objectives—will require additional reforms and political will. Political will is
      required to advance critical reforms such as restructuring SOEs and address the key is-
      sues of SOE governance, efficiency, pricing policies, and cross-subsidization. Such reforms
      could reduce the drain on public resources, which could then be redirected to priority areas,
      including poverty reduction. Poverty data could be strengthened to inform government
      and development assistance and enhance development outcomes.

         This figure appears to be based on government estimates from the 1999 census, which indicated that about
         one-fifth of all households had cash incomes below US$1 per day. This benchmark is not directly comparable
         to the Extreme Poverty line, which was set during 1999 at total consumption (including subsistence) valued
         at 1993 PPP US$1 per day per person.

To weather future shocks, including climate related ones, the RMI needs to build a suf-
ficiently large fiscal buffer. RMI faces many vulnerabilities, including substantial fiscal
risks from SOEs and the social security system, the sizable public debt (one of the highest
among the PICs), the expiration of most Compact grants after FY2023, uncertainty about
Compact Trust Fund returns, and future costs from climate change. To secure longer-term
sustainability, the government needs to build a sufficiently large fiscal buffer, yet the ris-
ing revenues from higher fishing license fees have not translated to higher savings in re-
cent years but rather to increased subsidies and transfers.

The public sector of the RMI plays an important role in service delivery, economic growth,
development, and sustainability. An effective government is therefore critical to ensure ef-
ficiency, effectiveness, accountability of public expenditure, and adequate service delivery
to the poor. Strengthening public sector capacity, PFM, and transparency and account-
ability are some of the channels which could support a more effective government.

The education sector could be strengthened. Adequate and correctly oriented education
to produce an appropriately qualified labor force could help facilitate increased economic
opportunities, including through open migration (labor market access) under the Com-
pact, and contribute to reducing poverty. Other social issues, such as malnutrition, gen-
der-based violence, and high rates of teenage fertility could also be addressed through
programs in the school system. Consultations in RMI highlighted the high levels of teenage
pregnancies as a key factor influencing women’s likelihood of obtaining employment and
remaining out of poverty.

As part of improvements to public service provision, SOE reforms should be a priority. The
limited data on access to essential services such as water, energy and telecommunica-
tions suggest that a significant proportion of the population remains without access to
these essential services due to remoteness or high cost. SOEs are likely to continue to play
a role in providing essential services, given RMI’s unique market structure, but services
should be provided in an efficient manner and not crowd out the private sector. Advancing
SOE restructuring by addressing the key issues of governance, efficiency, pricing policies,
and cross-subsidization could reduce the drain on public resources, which could be reori-
ented to priority areas, including poverty reduction. Where applicable, reforms to increase
private sector participation should also be considered.

National Strategy and Its Key Pillars/Focus

Vision 2018, the RMI national strategic development plan, aims to achieve a “country with-
in an interdependent world, with enhanced socio-economic self-reliance, and an educated,
healthy, productive, law abiding and God-loving people.” The strategic development frame-
work, drafted in 2001, addresses ten challenges essential to fulfilling the vision. Recently,
drawing on Vision 2018, the government introduced a three-year RMI National Strate-
gic Plan 2015–17 (NSP) to improve quality of life in all areas, including health, education,
energy, food security, law and order, gender equality, employment opportunities, and dis-
aster mitigation. The NSP Vision considers both the RMI Constitution and Vision 2018; its
objective is to achieve “Sustainable, Equitable and Measurable Development Reflecting
112   Regional Partnership Framework




      the Priorities and Culture of the Marshallese People.” Coordinated with the RMI planning
      and budgeting cycle, the NSP is designed as a three-year rolling plan that government
      leaders will use as the roadmap for development and progress in the medium term (2015–
      17), it includes five sectors: (1) Social Development; (2) Environment, Climate change and
      Resilience; (3) Infrastructure Development; (4) Sustainable Economic Development; and
      (5) Good Governance. The plan will be updated continually to meet longer-term objectives
      as the RMI moves toward scheduled completion of the Compact in 2023.

      The new government (January 2016) has developed Agenda 2020: A Framework for Pro-
      gress (Agenda 2020) that identifies the major national challenges and priority reforms
      to be addressed by Government toward the year 2020. It aims to strengthen the results-
      focus, proactively address the most pressing problems, and develop a culture of customer
      service in the public sector.

      World Bank Group Program

      The World Bank program has been developed through wide consultations with govern-
      ment and key stakeholders, it is fully aligned with the NSP, will support many of the key
      actions identified in the Agenda 2020 and builds on recommendations from the SCD. MoF
      has been instrumental in ensuring the program is aligned with government priorities and
      is endorsed by the leadership. The Division of Interational Development Assistance (DIDA)
      within the MoF has been established to coordinate and facilitate development programs of
      the multi-lateral agencies to ensure complementarity. DIDA will be a key a partner during
      implementation with it providing centralized coordination and fiduciary support.

The Bank will work collaboratively with other partners during the implementation of the
program. For PFM, the government have identified large needs in this area and have sought
support from both ADB and the World Bank and are ensuring complementarity with our
engagement, the ADB will provide ongoing support to strengthening SOE performance
and monitoring. The Government are proactively coordinating donor support to the en-
ergy sector, the Bank’s support will complement proposed and ongoing activities by New
Zealand, ADB, EU and JICA. SPC and the Bank will work jointly with the government on the
HIES. The Bank’s proposed project for resilience will help strengthen coordination of actors
engaged in this area, in addition the project design is such that the government will work
with and draw on experience from SPC, PIFs and IOM during implementation. The support
provided by the USG is programmed through the RMI government’s budget and planning
process or directly provided by US federal agencies. It is primarily focused on the sectors
of education, health and infrastructure. There may be opportunities during the RPF period
for collaboration particularly in the area of NCDs.

      REPUBLIC OF NAURU
      Sociopolitical and Institutional Factors
      The Republic of Nauru (formerly known as Pleasant Island), located in Micronesia, has a
      population of about 9,378 residents on 21 square kilometers, making it the smallest state
      in the South Pacific. A German colony in the 19th century, Nauru and was administered
      by Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom following the First World War. During
      the Second World War, Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops. After the war, it entered
      again into trusteeship until gaining independence in 1968.

      Nauru was among the world’s richest countries during the late 1960s and early 1970s.
      Its wealth was generated by exports of phosphates, but primary deposits have now been
      exhausted and mining of secondary deposits has resumed only recently. While revenues
      from phosphate mining were invested in a trust fund to help provide for Nauru’s econom-
      ic future, the fund lost value due to poor investment decisions, and heavy government
      spending depleted it further.

      In April 2014, the government applied for membership in IMF and IBRD. (The Articles of
      Agreement require a country to become a member of the IMF before joining the WBG.)
      Nauru was admitted as a member of the IMF and IBRD on April 12, 2016.

      Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
      The Government of Australia maintains a Regional Processing Centre (RPC), opened in
      2001 and designed for up to 800 people, to process applications of asylum seekers who
      have attempted to enter Australia by boat. The RPC and phosphate mining are currently
      the only industries generating significant revenue and employment opportunities in Nauru.
      Establishment of the RPC was accompanied by a pledge from the Government of Australia
      of A$20 million for development activities. The center was closed in 2008, but reopened in
      August 2012. In July 2013 several buildings were destroyed by fire during a riot.

      The resumption of phosphate mining in 2011, the reopening of the RPC in 2012, and an
      increase in revenues from fishing licenses have spurred economic activity, created jobs,
      and provided substantial fiscal revenues in recent years. Estimates indicate that real GDP
      grew by around 25 percent annually over the four years to FY2014, boosted by phosphate
      exports and various activities (hotels, construction, trade, transport) related to operat-
      ing the RPC. Nauru’s economy is estimated to have contracted in FY2015 after damage
      to port facilities disrupted phosphate exports (which declined by two-thirds) as well as
      imports of fuel and other supplies.

      Government revenues fluctuate depending on visa fees from the RPC, fishing license fees,
      collection of customs duties, and revenues from phosphate mining. Relatively high rev-
      enues in recent years have allowed the authorities to repay salary and rental arrears and
      raise the wage bill to prevent public servants leaving for the RPC, which offers higher sala-
      ries. In FY2015, however, the fiscal balance deteriorated, mainly on account of lower phos-
      phate revenues.

Nauru is facing enormous challenges in sustaining growth and ensuring fiscal and debt
sustainability over the medium term. The biggest challenge is to diversify the economy
beyond reliance on phosphate and the RPC, neither of which is sustainable in the long run.
Without substantial fiscal adjustments, the decline in visa fees after the RPC scales down
over the medium-term will jeopardize fiscal sustainability. To help build fiscal buffers, the
government established an Intergenerational Trust Fund in 2015, which will be capital-
ized with contributions from development partners and windfall revenues and is intended
eventually to provide a stable source of budget financing.

Nauru’s seaport is antiquated and has been dysfunctional, hampering trade and creating
frequent fuel shortages. The power infrastructure is nearly at the end of its life, resulting
in power outages. Health infrastructure is limited, while Nauru has the highest obesity
rate in the world and about 40 percent of the population age 45 and above has diabetes.

Poverty and Shared Prosperity

No estimates of poverty according to the internationally comparable PPP benchmarks
(2011 PPP US$1.90 and US$3.10 per person per day) are available for Nauru. A poverty
analysis based on the 2012/13 HIES estimated that 24 percent of households were living
on expenditure levels below a national basic-needs benchmark (but zero percent below the
food poverty line). A Gini coefficient of 0.52 is also reported, based on the per capita distri-
bution of expenditure, which is very high by Pacific and global standards.

Children and young people are among the most vulnerable groups in Nauru. This is in part
because poorer households tend to have a significantly larger number of children than bet-
ter-off households. Moreover, less than half of young people aged 15 to 29 are employed
by government or the private sector, while a relatively high proportion of the remainder
(students and young people who are unemployed or engaged in unpaid family work) have
consumption below the basic-needs benchmark.

In general, poverty in Nauru is primarily characterized by a lack of opportunities, socio-
economic exclusion, and/or inadequate resources to meet cash needs. Because of the lim-
ited area of arable land, agriculture consists largely of fishing, with minimal subsistence
agriculture. Households are relatively dependent on imported food and consumer goods,
and thus vulnerable to price volatility. Nauru is just one island, so access to local public
services—at least in physical terms—is generally equitable. Reach and/or quality of ser-
vice provision appears to have improved over time by some measures, but health and edu-
cation outcomes remain poor. In the decade leading to 2011, the net primary school enrol-
ment rate increased from 70 percent to 95 percent, although enrolment rates for children
of secondary-school age are much lower at 68 percent. Between 2001 and 2011, the infant
mortality rate declined from 89 to 21 per 1,000. Nonetheless, poor quality diets, low levels
of physical activity, and high rates of smoking and alcohol consumption have contributed
to levels of NCDs that are among the highest in the world.

      Development Agenda

      Nauru is IBRD’s newest and smallest member country. Nauru does not intend to apply for
      membership with IDA or any other WBG institution at this time. Nauru’s two critical sourc-
      es of foreign exchange (phosphate mining and the RPC) and are unlikely to be sustainable
      revenue sources from which to repay a long-term IBRD loan. Any IBRD loan would have to
      be secured by significant credit enhancements via “ring fencing” foreign exchange future
      cash flows for the repayment of IBRD. Given Nauru’s high per capita GDP of $11,394, it
      does not qualify for IDA funding, even under the small states exception.

      Nevertheless, through its IBRD membership, Nauru would be able to access various trust
      funds administered by the Bank including those which support increasing resilience to cli-
      mate change and natural disasters. Nauru may also qualify for support through regional
      projects, such as regional maritime support for the ports sector as well as regional avia-
      tion support for the rehabilitation of the country’s runway.

      National Strategy and Its Key Pillars/Focus

      The Republic of Nauru has a long-term National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS)
      that sets out policies and plans to 2025. The 2005 NSDS, updated in 2009, developed
      Nauru’s long-term vision for ‘a future where individual, community, business and govern-
      ment partnerships contribute to a sustainable quality of life for all Nauruans’. The NSDS
      focusses upon ‘partnerships for quality of life’ and sets out five long term goals for Nauru:
         1.	 Stable, trustworthy, fiscally responsible government
         2.	 Provision of enhanced social, infrastructure and utilities services
         3.	 Development of an economy based on multiple sources of revenue
         4.	 Rehabilitation of mined out lands for livelihood sustainability
         5.	 Development of domestic food production

      World Bank Group Program

      Due to its recent membership of the World Bank, Nauru does not as of yet have a World
      Bank program. As a result of the constraints posed by the inability of Nauru to access
      IDA and IBRD financing, the program will rely on the possibilities to mobilize trust fund
      resources for the country as well as encouraging Nauru’s inclusion in regional projects,
      where possible using resources from other development bilateral and multilateral develop-
      ment partners or identifying opportunities for IBRD financing through guarantee schemes
      or engagements that would provide the appropriate credit enhancement.

      Development Partners

      The World Bank will work closely with other partners, including Australia, ADB and Japan
      during RPF period to identify opportunities for support to the Government of Nauru. Sup-
      port will be opportunistic and limited to those areas where resources can be mobilized for
      investments or technical assistance despite the constraints on the World Bank’s ability to
      provide IDA or IBRD financing.

REPUBLIC OF PALAU
Sociopolitical and Institutional Factors
Palau is a representative democratic republic in which the president is both head of state
and head of government. The country is a de facto non-partisan democracy; currently it
has no political parties, although no law prevents the formation of political parties. Execu-
tive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the gov-
ernment and the Palau National Congress. The judiciary is independent of the executive/
legislature.

A sovereign country since 1994, Palau maintains deep ties and a cooperative relation-
ship with the USA. The Compact of Free Association between the USA and Republic of
Palau, which entered into force in 1994, provided several types of assistance aimed at
promoting Palau’s economic advancement and eventual self-sufficiency. In addition to es-
tablishing Palauan sovereignty and USA–Palau security and defense arrangements, the
Compact provided economic assistance which comprised, among other things, direct eco-
nomic assistance for 15 years to the Palau government; the establishment of a trust fund
intended to provide Palau US$15 million annually from 2010 through 2044; investments
in infrastructure, including a major road; and the provision of federal services, such as
postal, weather, and aviation services. The Compact also established a basis for United
States agencies to provide discretionary federal programs related to health, education,
and infrastructure. Provisions under the proposed September 2010 agreement between
the United States and Palau governments, among other things, extended economic as-
sistance to Palau beyond the original 15 years and included modified trust fund arrange-
ments. The bill to approve the Agreement has not yet been passed by the United States
Senate, however, and an interim agreement is put forward to Congress each year.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
Unlike many other PICs, Palau has a thriving tourism sector, but the unpredictability of
tourist arrivals complicates economic management. Tourist arrivals depend greatly on
external factors and are influenced by global economic performance, which has caused
significant volatility in the growth of Palau’s tourism sector over the past decade. In this
context, it becomes difficult for the government to ensure a consistent level of service
delivery and living standards for its citizens. An added complication is that Palau has no
central bank or monetary policy and uses the US dollar as its national currency, so fiscal
policy is the only lever to respond to shocks.

Economic growth surged to an estimated 8.0 percent in FY2014 (ending September 30)
following an unexpected rise in tourist arrivals from China, with new foreign investment
also contributing to growth. The bigger than expected rise in tourism arrivals (which was
supported by expanded accommodation capacity) was partly due to new air links with
Hong Kong SAR, China. In the first half of CY2015, tourist arrivals had grown by 40 per-
cent compared to the same period in 2014, again driven by increased arrivals from China.
Arrivals from Palau’s traditional tourism markets such as Japan and Taiwan, China are
declining, so Palau’s dependence on a single tourism market (China) is increasing. Con-
118   Regional Partnership Framework




      tinued strengthening of the US dollar and uncertainty in the Chinese economy pose risks
      to the tourism sector. Inflation continued to moderate, falling from 4 percent in FY2014
      to 0.4 percent in the second quarter of CY2015, driven by stable international food and
      falling fuel and utility prices. The current account deficit widened from 8.75 percent of
      GDP in FY2013 to 13 percent of GDP in FY2014, largely owing to tourist arrivals and con-
      struction related imports. A fiscal surplus equivalent to 1.25 percent of GDP is estimated
      for FY2014. Tax revenue continued to rise, thanks to increases in the volume and rates of
      tourism-related taxes, higher prices in the tourism industry, and improved tax compli-
      ance. Recurrent expenditure, on the other hand, fell owing to careful management of the
      public sector. With the scheduled end of Compact grants in FY2024, fiscal adjustment
      remains necessary over the medium term to build adequate government deposits and en-
      sure long-term fiscal sustainability.

      Poverty and Shared Prosperity
      No estimates of poverty according to the internationally comparable 2011 PPP bench-
      marks (US$1.90 and US$3.10 per person per day) are available for Palau, but extreme pov-
      erty is likely very rare. GNI per capita in Palau is high relative to other small PICs, and the
      inequality implicit in the distribution of consumption is around the middle of the range for
      the region (estimates from the 2006 HIES suggest the national Gini coefficient is 0.39 for
      the distribution of nominal per-capita expenditure across the population). One in four peo-
      ple in Palau live below the national basic-needs poverty line according to analyses of the
      2006 HIES (though reportedly food consumption was considerably underreported in this
      survey, so the welfare benchmark is difficult to interpret). In any case, poverty and hard-
      ship in Palau do not mean hunger or destitution, but in a high-cost society which enjoys
      a comparatively high standard of living, people do sometimes struggle to meet their cash
      needs. Reliance on subsistence production is apparently relatively low compared to many
      other Pacific countries (the 2006 HIES suggests only 13 percent of the value of household
      food consumption derives from subsistence), which leaves households vulnerable to in-
      ternational food price shocks. Malnutrition is also widespread due to a poor quality diet,
      and the incidence of obesity is high. As in many Pacific countries, educational attainment
      provides some protection against hardship through its association with higher levels of
      consumption (particularly for households where the head has a post-secondary educa-
      tion), as well as increased migration opportunities to the USA.

      Development Agenda
      The rise in tourist arrivals should be managed to ensure sustainability and translated into
      improved lives for the Palauans. In FY2014, Palau experienced a 13.4 percent increase in
      tourist arrivals (largely because numbers of Chinese tourists doubled from FY2013 lev-
      els), and an additional 1,000 new rooms are needed to satisfy demand going forward. Al-
      though rising tourism can increase government revenues, the domestic value added from
      this new source of tourism is expected to be limited, given that the structure of the value
      chain for packaged tours may not have trickled down to Palauans. The government has
      the opportunity to increase the domestic content of tourism and to introduce policies that
      would foster more equitable distribution of tourism revenues to its people. A careful bal-
      ance between tourism growth and the impact on environment and culture also needs to be
      established to ensure the sustainability of the industry.
                                                           Regional Partnership Framework         119




Other priority areas for strengthening the tourism industry are to address human resource
planning and management issues and labor laws. Palau has a service-based economy,
requiring well-trained people to serve the tourism market. Private sector employers have
highlighted the difficulty of hiring Palauans due to their lack of skills and work ethics. For-
eign labor in the interim has supplemented the domestic labor force. On the other hand,
open migration to the USA, partly as a result of uncompetitive domestic wages, has re-
sulted in a “brain drain.” The inadequate number of professionals being produced locally
also increased the need for foreign labor to fill the gap. As the tourism industry expands,
the government is conscious of the need for a comprehensive labor policy. One way of re-
taining more of the tourism dollar domestically is through further training of the domestic
workforce to increase their participation. Strengthening and tailoring vocational train-
ing programs and increasing the quality of education (up to secondary) are two poten-
tial avenues to increase domestic workforce participation. A comprehensive labor act to
provide fair compensation, safe working conditions, and labor protection to all could help
to protect employees and improve the business climate. The initiative to improve foreign
workers’ flexibility to switch jobs would also improve productivity and promote inclusive
growth.

Improving investment and the business climate would help to diversify the economy,
reduce economic vulnerability, and support growth. The expansion of basic infrastructure,
such as water and sanitation systems, is essential to develop the tourism industry and
ensure its long-term sustainability. Although Palau compares favorably to peers, further
improvement in the road network, aviation connectivity arrangements, and telecommu-
nications infrastructure would support economic diversification and enhance growth po-
tential. Weak enforcement of the existing foreign investment laws has resulted in contin-
ued foreign investment with limited domestic value added and limited requirements for
investors to protect the environment. Simplification of the investment approval process
and opening all business activities to foreign investment through joint ventures could also
support economic growth.

Finally, significant fiscal challenges remain. The fact that the renewed Compact has not
been endorsed definitively by the USA Senate creates uncertainty about a key source of
inflow. The renewed Compact, while favorable in comparison to the alternative (no re-
newal), includes a declining level of nominal resources. Another consideration is that the
CTF has not been designed as a perpetual fund (it is meant to supplement the budget until
2044), and additional resources must be found to maintain the real level of public services.
To address these challenges, the government could consider increasing revenue through
the adoption and implementation of a modern tax regime; reducing expenditures through
more efficient delivery of services; or growing the economy by capturing a greater share
of the tourism dollar.

      National Strategy and Its Key Pillars/Focus
      The Republic of Palau has a long-term National Master Development Plan (NMDP) that
      sets out policies and plans to 2020. The NMDP is a comprehensive document covering
      virtually all sectors, institutions, and policies in Palau that were relevant at the time it
      was initiated (1996). The vision established in the NMDP was “to substantially enhance
      the quality of life of Palauans and future generations of Palauans.” An important limita-
      tion of the NMDP, is that it provides limited guidance on priorities to reach Palau’s long
      term goals, hence a medium term development strategy (MTDS) described as Actions for
      Palau’s Future was formulated to address these weaknesses. The MTDS sets out the key
      strategies and actions to help achieve economic, social, environmental and cultural goals
      over a five-year period 2009 – 2014. It is consistent with the NMDP 2020 but takes into
      account change in circumstance and legislative and policy development. The overall goal
      of the MTDS is a sustained and widespread improvement in general standards of living
      while preserving cultural and environmental values. Five Priority Policy Actions have been
      identified to ensure meaningful focus and effective commitment these are: (1) Agriculture
      and Fisheries; (2) Tourism (3) Infrastructure; (4) Private Sector Development; and (5) Sus-
      tainable Government.

      World Bank Group Program
      Palau has been a member of the Bank since 1997, and is classified as an IBRD eligible coun-
      try. However, any IBRD loan would have to be secured by significant credit enhancements
      via “ring fencing” foreign exchange future cash flows for the repayment of IBRD. Through
      its IBRD membership, Palau is also able to access various trust funds administered by the
      Bank including those which support increasing resilience to climate change and natural
      disasters. The Bank’s program with Palau is focusing on support in three important areas,
      including support to address challenges with their national payment systems, technical
      assistance for the ICT sector specifically to support the regulatory reforms needed in this
      sector and allow Palau to maximize the benefit from the upcoming cable project. The Gov-
      ernment has also asked for assistance in the area of public private partnerships with a
      focus on strengthening the enabling environment.

      Development Partners
      As a result of the constraints posed by the inability of Palau to access IDA or IBRD re-
      sources the Bank will work closely with other development partners to identify areas of
      opportunity to provide support to Palau. The Bank is working closely with ADB on the
      Palau-FSM connectivity project, ADB is providing the financing for the Palau portion of the
      project and WB is providing the financing for the FSM portion. The WB is also providing
      complementary technical assistance to Palau to support the implementation of the cable
      project, through TF resources made available from DFAT.

INDEPENDENT STATE OF SAMOA
Sociopolitical and Institutional Factors

Since gaining independence from New Zealand in 1962, Samoa has been a stable democ-
racy. The Human Rights Protection Party has been in power for most of the past 30 years,
most recently winning office in March 2016 with a five-year mandate. The World Bank has
had a longer relationship with Samoa than any other Pacific island country, and the scope
of this engagement has grown in recent years. Samoa’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment score is one of the highest among the Bank’s Pacific Island member states and
among all IDA borrowing countries. Strong policy settings for almost two decades have
resulted in MDG outcomes and economic performance well above the average for com-
parable island countries. Samoa is a very cohesive and structured society, with a strong
traditional culture.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

From the mid-1990s until the late 2000s, Samoa was the star economic performer in the
Pacific, pursuing structural reforms that helped to increase growth to an average of over
4 percent in the decade to 2008, and prudent fiscal policies that significantly reduced
public debt from a peak of over 100 percent of GDP in the late 1990s. The events of recent
years have highlighted the disadvantages facing even island states such as Samoa that
are small and remote but perform well—particularly the fact that the economy remains
narrowly based and highly vulnerable to external shocks. The Samoan economy contract-
ed in 2009 as a result of the cumulative effects of the 2008 food and fuel price spikes,
the global slowdown, and a devastating tsunami in September 2009. A major cyclone in
December 2012 added to pressure on the fiscal position and balance of payments.

Samoa’s response to these shocks, including expansionary monetary policy and a signifi-
cant fiscal stimulus, provided a solid foundation for the economy to recover, while expand-
ing its productive capacity in the medium term. Growth has picked up modestly over the
last few years, initially supported by construction activity and more recently by tourism
earnings, remittances, and lower fuel prices. Economic growth is projected to continue in
the medium term at an average rate of around 2 percent, supported by increases in tour-
ism and agriculture, although the exit of a major manufacturer in 2017 will temporarily
lower growth.

As a result of continued fiscal deficits and only modest economic growth, Samoa’s external
public debt as a proportion of GDP has increased quite rapidly in recent years, from around
30 percent at end FY2008 to about 55 percent at end December 2015, well above the
authorities’ medium-term target of 50 percent of GDP. Looking ahead it is important that
fiscal consolidation proceeds as planned to ensure overall sustainability and sufficient
buffers to respond to future external shocks.
122   Regional Partnership Framework




      Poverty and Shared Prosperity

      Extreme poverty is very rare in Samoa. Estimates from the 2008 HIES suggest that
      less than 1 percent of the population lives below the internationally-comparable 2011
      PPP US$1.90 extreme poverty line, and 8 percent below the 2011 PPP US$$3.10 pover-
      ty line—both well-below small PIC averages. Using national poverty lines, food poverty
      was assessed to be rare in 2008, with only 5 percent living below the food poverty line, a
      significant decline from the 2002 HIES. On the other hand, 27 percent of the population
      reportedly experienced basic-needs poverty in 2008, with the incidence marginally higher
      than average in Apia and marginally lower than average in the less-populated island of
      Savai’i, although the incidence of poverty in rural areas may have been understated. This
      rate is a modest increase from the previous 2002 estimate (23 percent), although these
      numbers are not strictly comparable over time due to the use of a relative poverty line. A
      more recent HIES was conducted in late 2013 and early 2014, and while summary tables
      have been released, poverty estimates are not yet available.

      Estimates from the SCD suggest that inequality in Samoa is higher than in other small
      PICs, with a Gini coefficient on the population distribution of per capita nominal consump-
      tion of 0.43 as at 2008. Moreover, incomes of the B40 are estimated to have deteriorated
      slightly relative to average incomes nationwide in the preceding years.

      Development Agenda

      Given the constraints posed by smallness and remoteness, prospects for longer-term eco-
      nomic development in Samoa are likely to depend significantly on greater economic inte-
      gration with neighbors, maximizing the gains from tourism and agriculture, and continued
      external remittance and aid flows. Samoa already has a significant expatriate population
      in New Zealand, the USA, and Australia, although further labor market integration, includ-
      ing through increases in short-term employment opportunities, offers potential benefits
      for both Samoa and receiving countries. Better transport and communication links (in-
      cluding improvements in broadband connectivity) could mitigate the cost of distance and
      encourage integration, as can aligning and harmonizing regulatory rules and standards.

      Tourism is an important contributor to the economy of Samoa, with its distinctive geo-
      graphical and cultural features allowing it to charge premium prices that cover its relative-
      ly high production costs. Although visitor earnings were equivalent to around one-fifth of
      GDP in 2015, Samoa’s tourism industry remains underdeveloped in comparison with some
      of its neighbors, and hence a critical priority is to strengthen it. Agriculture (particularly
      coconut products and fishing) is extremely important from a livelihood point of view—it
      is the main activity for about one-third of the economically active population—with the
      potential for future growth dependent on improving supply links to the tourism sector,
      pursuing other opportunities for import substitution, and developing niche markets.
                                                         Regional Partnership Framework        123




Given the recent increase in debt, the need to build fiscal buffers, and the need to ensure
the longer-term sustainability of public finances, it is very important that fiscal consoli-
dation proceed as planned in the period ahead, including through a sustained focus on
ensuring value-for-money across all public sector expenditure. As well as ensuring alloca-
tive efficiency and sound public expenditure management, it will be important to continue
structural economic reform to improve Samoa’s competitiveness and encourage longer-
term growth. Opportunities for greater private sector development remain, particularly
by contracting out operation and maintenance services currently performed by SOEs.
Further structural reforms could also help to increase access to finance and encourage
new investment.

Compared with other lower-middle-income countries, Samoa performs relatively well on
measures of life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality rates. These gains are
being offset by the increased prevalence of NCDs such as diabetes, heart disease, and
stroke, which now account for around 70 percent of all deaths. An effective strategy to
target NCDs is essential, including through the reorientation of health expenditures to-
ward prevention and primary care. While Samoa has made significant gains in boosting
the accessibility of education in recent years, the focus now needs to shift toward improv-
ing its quality by implementing professional standards, increasing training, and providing
incentives for teachers to improve their qualifications.

Natural disasters pose a substantial risk in Samoa, while climate change is a major long-
term threat. Vulnerabilities are compounded by the fact that 70 percent of Samoa’s popu-
lation and infrastructure are located in low-lying coastal areas. Continued efforts are nec-
essary to “climate proof” roads and protect coastlines, including through the development
of a coordinated national climate adaptation plan.

National Strategy and Its Key Pillars/Focus

The Government is currently in the process of finalizing an updated Strategy for the De-
velopment of Samoa (SDS), which will cover the four-year period from FY2017 to FY2020.
The theme of the new SDS will be “accelerating sustainable development and creating
opportunities for all,” which emphasizes the national commitment to revitalizing sustaina-
ble, pro-poor growth while rebuilding buffers to help protect the economy from the effects
of future shocks. While the priorities—economic sustainability and business development,
improved education and health outcomes, better access to infrastructure, and climate
and disaster resilience—are in line with the existing SDS, there is an increased focus on
public-private partnerships as a means of promoting investments for social and economic
developments, and an explicit attempt to integrate climate resilience and disaster man-
agement into each of the priority areas.

      World Bank Group Program

      The World Bank partnership with Samoa predates that of any other Pacific island coun-
      try. The current program therefore builds upon a strong engagement and experience im-
      plementing projects in the country. It has been developed through wide consultations with
      government and key stakeholders, it is fully aligned with the SDS and builds on recom-
      mendations from the SCD. MoF has been instrumental in ensuring the program is aligned
      with government priorities and is endorsed by the leadership. The program also builds on
      strong liaison with other development partners, avoiding duplication of their ongoing ef-
      forts and collaborating where possible.

      TONGA
      Sociopolitical and Institutional Factors

      Tonga transitioned from an absolute to a Constitutional monarchy in late 2010, following
      major constitutional reforms that changed the legislative assembly to become majority
      democratically elected. The transition to a democracy has not been entirely smooth, but
      two elections have been held since the reforms. In November 2010, a party led by the
      nobles formed a government; the next election (November 2014) brought a party led by
      elected representatives into power for the first time in Tonga’s history. The current Cabi-
      net consists of 11 elected people’s representatives and 1 noble representative. Like many
      other PICs, Tonga has a strong cultural identity. Nearly all of the population belongs to
      the Christian faith and forms part of a traditional system of highly elaborate familial and
      reciprocal relationships that have an important bearing on almost all aspects of life in
      Tonga and for Tongans overseas. The WBG Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
      found that Tonga’s institutions and policies had improved rapidly owing to a concerted
      government effort over the past 10 years and were conducive to development in most
      areas, although institutional impediments to women’s economic participation remained.
      Other weaknesses were related to the fact that very small states such as Tonga generally
      have limited capacity to maintain the level of public services and governance needed for a
      developing nation-state.

      Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

      Tonga’s economic growth potential is hindered by the innately high cost structures and
      exposure to shocks that are common to many of the small Pacific island nations. Over
      the last 20 years, per capita GDP has grown by 1.0 percent per annum, compared to 2.4
      percent globally. While this rate is lower than any other region, it is still better than the
      average for the group of small Pacific islands, which on average grew at 0.9 percent per
      annum over the same period. In any given year, it is likely that Tonga is either hit by a
      major natural disaster or is recovering from the previous one. Small size and remoteness
      push up the cost of economic activity in Tonga, limiting the competitiveness of its exports
      of goods and services in world markets. These same factors also raise the cost of provid-
      ing public services. A high dependence on imports and an insufficient size for meaningful
      diversification make Tonga highly vulnerable to external economic shocks. These factors
      combine to make growth, inclusive or otherwise, particularly elusive in Tonga.

      Tonga has for the most part exercised appropriate macroeconomic and fiscal manage-
      ment, and the macroeconomic framework is adequate to support DPOs. In the last year,
      private sector credit growth started to rise after a long decline triggered by a housing
      market crash. Tonga has a structural current account deficit, which is mostly financed
      by development grants and personal remittances. The current account deficit was 7.9
      percent of GDP in FY2014 and is expected to remain around that level. Development as-
      sistance enabled the government to build up foreign exchange reserves, which have in-
      creased to seven months, an appropriate level given Tonga’s high vulnerability. Foreign
                                                          Regional Partnership Framework        127




direct investment inflows remain low at around 3 percent of GDP. The fiscal balance has
significantly improved, and debt levels have stabilized with prudent fiscal management.
The government has maintained the deficit below 2 percent of GDP or turned a small sur-
plus in each of the last three fiscal years. Domestic revenue mobilization has progressively
improved, increasing by 3 percent of GDP over the four years to FY2015. Nevertheless,
it is still a serious challenge to provide adequate financing for delivering public services.
Development grants financed 33 percent of government expenditure in FY2014. Tonga’s
risk of debt distress was recently reduced and has remained moderate, aided by continued
vigilance by the authorities. The government has been successful in controlling debt in
recent years, with public and publicly guaranteed external debt in present value terms to
GDP gradually declining from 35.7 percent in FY2012 to 34.1 percent in FY2015.

Poverty and Shared Prosperity
Extreme poverty is negligible in Tonga, but many people still experience some form of hard-
ship. Estimates from the 2009 HIES suggest that just 1 percent of Tongans (the order of
1,200 people) live below the 2011 PPP US$1.90 extreme poverty line, with 8 percent of the
population below the 2011 PPP US$3.10 per day poverty line. The Second National MDG
Report estimates that 23 percent of Tongans are living below a national basic-needs
benchmark as at 2009. This finding is consistent with local views that while there are very
few people in abject poverty in Tonga, “hardship” or lack of access to basic services, eco-
nomic opportunities, and cash for basic needs—including to meet customary obligations to
extended family, the village community, and/or the church—is more widespread. The SCD
estimates that incomes of the B40 kept pace with average incomes nationwide in the
years leading to the 2009 HIES, and the Gini coefficient on the distribution of nominal
per capita consumption is 0.38, which is around the lower end of the range for the PIC9.
The incidence of national basic-needs poverty is estimated to be roughly similar across
three geographical regions: Nuku’alofa, the rest of Tongatapu, and other islands. Although
reliable data for more recent years are not available for most income and non-income
measures, there are indications that hardship, in its different forms, remains. Among non-
monetary indicators, health outcomes are a particular concern, with the high incidence of
NCDs already eroding life expectancy.

Development Agenda

A new political era in Tonga offers the opportunity of improved governance and public
service delivery. To achieve the goal of shared prosperity, the government and partners
will need to actively ensure that benefits are evenly spread. An especially important task
it to redress gender disparities—in traditional Tongan systems women often achieve good
outcomes indirectly via their male relations, but it is critical to ensure that women are
not excluded because they lack direct access to assets and voice. While domestic reform
efforts will give Tonga the best chance of capitalizing on growth opportunities, a press-
ing development need is to identify ways of increasing income-generating opportunities
for Tongans in the challenging economic environment of the Pacific. Exports of labor and
tourism offer the potential to make use of Tonga’s natural and human resources—a unique
and beautiful country, and an able English-speaking workforce. A number of other sectors
128   Regional Partnership Framework




      hold potential for growth, particularly those that are based on natural resources (such
      as seabed minerals) or cultural capital (such as those exploiting a unique Tongan brand).
      Consistent with the recommendations of the SCD, good quality and relevant education
      and well as connective infrastructure will be important. Seeking ways to reduce the risk
      or impact of shocks (economic and natural) will also be important. This is a multi-level
      challenge, calling for the government and donor partners to take direct action to improve
      fiscal resilience and create policies and markets that will help communities, firms, and
      individuals better protect themselves. Finally, Tonga has strengthened its international
      reputation as a well-functioning, modern nation-state in recent years, but private en-
      terprise is challenged by a perceived volatility of policy, which increases sovereign risk.
      Evidence-based, consultative reforms appropriate for Tonga will help to show that Tonga
      is “serious about business.”

      National Strategy and Its Key Pillars/Focus

      The new government has set out Tonga’s national development strategy in the Tonga Stra-
      tegic Development Framework (TSDF), 2015–25, approved in April 2015. The TSDF sets
      out a medium-term vision that builds directly on the preceding TSDF 2011–2014 and is un-
      derpinned by an extensive consultation process. The vision of the TSDF is for “a more pro-
      gressive Tonga supporting a higher quality of life for all.” This vision is translated into sev-
      en high-level National Outcomes to achieve over the next 10 years. They aim to achieve: (i)
      a more dynamic, knowledge-based economy; (ii) more balanced urban-rural development;
      (iii) more empowering human development and gender equality; (iv) responsive and good
      governance, including law and order; (v) successful provision and maintenance of infra-
      structure and technology; (vi) effective land administration, environmental management,
      and resilience to climate and risk; and (vii) consistent advancement of Tonga’s external
      interests, security, and sovereignty. This new strategic framework includes a heightened
      emphasis on sustainability, good governance, and shared prosperity. The national out-
      comes are to be achieved via a set of 29 organizational outcomes, grouped by five pillars:
      economic institutions, social institutions, political institutions, infrastructure and tech-
      nology inputs, and natural resource and environmental inputs.

      World Bank Group Program

      The current program builds upon a strong engagement and experience implementing pro-
      jects in Tonga. It has been developed through wide consultations with government and key
      stakeholders, it is fully aligned with Tonga’s Development Strategy and builds on recom-
      mendations from the SCD. MoF has been instrumental in ensuring the program is aligned
      with government priorities and is endorsed by the leadership. The program also builds
      on strong liaison with other development partners, avoiding duplication of their ongoing
      efforts and collaborating where possible.

      Development Partners

      The World Bank will work closely with other development partners during the RPF period.
      The commitment to collaboration is highlighted by the intention of key partners to con-
      tinue to work together with the Government of Tonga to develop an agreed policy matrix
      as a foundation for budget support. The World Bank and ADB will continue to identify
      opportunities for jointly co-financing investments, coordinating closely with other key do-
      nors in the country, including the EU, Japan, China and the UN system.

TUVALU
Sociopolitical and Institutional Factors

Tuvalu is a parliamentary representative democratic monarchy, whereby the British mon-
arch is the head of state, represented by the Governor-General, while the Prime Minister
is the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the Government of Tuvalu. The
15 Members of Parliament (MPs) each serve a four-year term in the unicameral legislature.
Tuvalu has no formal political parties, and floor-crossing by MPs is possible, although this
situation has not led to frequent changes in government. MPs tend to have very close ties
to the island they represent, and election campaigns are conducted largely on the basis
of personal and family ties and reputation. Traditional chiefs also still play a significant
role in island affairs, particularly on the outer islands. The last General Election was held
in March 2015, and the Cabinet was formed in April. The March 2015 elections returned 7
out of 8 caretaker Cabinet members. The election results ensured continuity in the admin-
istration and continued commitment to the reform agenda.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

Tuvalu has experienced uneven economic growth, which has been low since the global fi-
nancial crisis. Growth is expected at over 3 percent in 2015 on the back of large increases in
capital investment (including investments related to Tropical Cyclone Pam). Inflation was
expected to pick-up to around 4.7 percent in 2015 before moderating, reflecting growing
government expenditure (partly offset by falling fuel prices) and a potential shortage of
essential items owing to disruptions caused by the cyclone in transport and the domestic
supply of agricultural products.

The current account of the balance of payments moved from a surplus of 26 percent of
GDP in 2014 to a deficit of around 6 percent of GDP in 2015 due to reconstruction following
Tropical Cyclone Pam and other capital investment activities. Boosted by the output of a
fishing joint venture, exports doubled in just a few years. With the introduction of a new
fishing licensing scheme, license fees more than tripled, accounting for two-thirds of GDP
in 2015. Foreign aid has been substantial, standing at around 28 percent GDP in 2015. De-
clining work opportunities on merchant ships since the global crisis caused remittances to
fall from around 17 percent of GDP in 2008 to around 10 percent of GDP in 2015. Limited
cash earning opportunities domestically, particularly outside of the capital, and the fall
in remittance flows led to a deterioration in the population’s access to basic goods and
services. Other income sources such as investment income from the Tuvalu Trust Fund
(TTF) and official grants remain variable and dependent on global economic conditions. As
current account deficits are largely financed by Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF) buffer
assets, maintaining the fund’s balance above the sustainable target is critical to macro-
economic stability in Tuvalu. The 2014 joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
concluded that Tuvalu is at a high risk of debt distress, although the government does not
face debt servicing risks. The government is committed to returning its debt to sustain-
able levels through prudent fiscal policy and effective debt management.
132   Regional Partnership Framework




      Tuvalu was expected to achieve a budget surplus in 2015 owing to high fishing license
      fees. With taxes funding a relatively small proportion of Tuvalu’s budget, the volatile na-
      ture of Tuvalu’s other sources of revenue (such as fishing license fees) and vulnerability to
      external shocks frequently result in unpredictable fiscal outcomes. Unlike other countries,
      Tuvalu has limited channels to finance fiscal deficits and relies heavily on buffer assets
      and grants (see the box). In recent years, through higher than expected windfall revenues,
      grants, and fiscal prudence, the government was able to rebuild the CIF from near deple-
      tion in 2011 to around A$30.8 million in November 2016, above the minimum sustainable
      target balance.

      FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY IN TUVALU

      In the Tuvalu context, fiscal sustainability is measured by the ability of financial assets
      in the TTF and CIF to continuously finance post-grant deficits, even though periods of
      shock. Based on historical information (length of shock and average deficit), a sustainable
      level of assets in the CIF is numerically expressed as 16 percent of the maintained value
      of the TTF. This level can be sustained when the government achieves pre-grant deficits
      of around 21 percent of GDP going forward. With grants expected at around 16 percent
      of GDP, the remaining deficit (around 5 percent of GDP) could be sustainably financed by
      drawdowns from CIF assets, which is fully replenished by distributions from the TTF even
      at an assumed lower rate of return.

Poverty and Shared Prosperity

Extreme poverty is relatively uncommon in Tuvalu. The SCD estimates that 3 percent of
the population lived below the extreme poverty line (2011 PPP US$1.90 per person per
day) in 2010, when a HIES was last administered. According to the less austere national
basic-needs poverty benchmark, 26 percent of the population are struggling to meet a lo-
cal standard of basic needs as of 2010 (with 3 percent living below the food poverty line).
This figure is up from 21 percent in 2005 (“food poverty” is down from 5 percent). However,
the basic-needs poverty benchmark is not strictly comparable over time (a general im-
provement in living standards is likely to lift the poverty benchmark and will tend to bias
estimates of the incidence of poverty upward in later years relative to earlier years). A new
HIES is expected to be administered in 2017.

Poverty in Tuvalu is concentrated in the outer islands and the welfare gap with the capital
Funafuti appears to have grown in recent years. The SCD estimates a relatively high Gini
coefficient on the per capita nominal consumption distribution of 0.41 as at 2010. Oth-
er related measures published in the Tuvalu poverty report suggest inequality increased
between 2005 and 2010. This finding is consistent with evidence presented in the SCD
indicating that incomes of the B40 have fallen relative to the nationwide average (with a
growth differential of the order of 4 percentage points). Particularly in the outer islands,
poverty is exacerbated by lack of access to services and employment (and hence remit-
tances), coupled with vulnerability to shocks. Tuvalu has experienced a diverse series of
adverse shocks in recent years—including natural disasters, global economic crises, more
localized economic shocks (such as the loss of job opportunities for seafarers), and food
price shocks.

Development Agenda
The economy faces challenges in achieving more robust growth in the medium term, and
growth is expected to remain dependent on public sector and donor-funded expenditure
over that period. Dispersion, remoteness from major markets, and the small scale of the
economy create a large and costly public sector and also raise the cost of delivering ser-
vices, which is why the efficiency of the public sector (including public enterprises) is im-
portant. Strengthening public financial management and ensuring the efficient use of
public resources are critical to achieving development priorities.

In the absence of monetary policy and given the tight fiscal situation, the authorities will
have limited policy space to respond to external shocks—which further highlights the
importance of maintaining adequate buffer assets to absorb inevitable future shocks.
Efforts to strengthen climate resilience will also support the country in facing future cli-
mate shocks.

To ensure sustained increases in living standards, Tuvaluans need to be better prepared for
overseas job opportunities. With limited domestic employment opportunities and demand
for Tuvaluan international maritime seafarers declining in the face of greater competition
from other countries, education and vocational training systems need to be strengthened
to enable Tuvaluans to compete effectively for overseas income-earning opportunities and
to overcome the tyranny of distance.
134   Regional Partnership Framework




      There is scope to improve the provision of essential services. Further investment in essen-
      tial infrastructure, including investment by development partners, will support improved
      service provision. SOEs are also likely to continue to play a role in providing essential ser-
      vices, given the unique structure of the Tuvaluan market. In recent years, some SOEs have
      not operated in cost-effectively. Advancing the restructuring of SOEs by addressing the
      key issues of governance, efficiency, pricing policies, and cross-subsidization could reduce
      the drain on public resources, which could then be reoriented to priority areas, including
      poverty reduction.

      Tuvalu also has significant opportunities to increase the economic return on its natural
      resources, including fisheries. Tuvalu’s EEZ is situated in one of the world’s last viable tuna
      fisheries. Although revenues and savings have increased in recent year, more could be
      done. Recent consultations with the department of resources and development revealed
      interest in deep-sea mining in Tuvalu’s EEZ for rare-earth mineral deposits.

National Strategy and Its Key Pillars/Focus

The government’s vision for sustainable development and “a more protected, secure, pros-
perous and healthier Tuvalu” is outlined in Te Kakeega III: National Strategy for Sustain-
able Development 2016-2020. The strategy was endorsed in 2016 and is rooted in a com-
mitment to attaining the SDGs and protecting Tuvalu from global and natural threats. The
strategy is underpinned by twelve strategic areas: (i) climate change; (ii) good governance;
(iii) the economy: stability and growth; (iv) social development and health; (v) falekaupule
and island development; (vi) private sector, employment and trade; (vii) education and
human resources; (viii) natural resources; (ix) infrastructure and support services; (x) en-
vironment; (xi) migration and urbanisation; and (xii) oceans and seas.

      VANUATU
      Sociopolitical and Institutional Factors
      Vanuatu has a hybrid political system consisting of a capital-focused Westminster sys-
      tem of government and a system of chiefly governance across the country at the local lev-
      el. The political situation has become increasingly unstable over the past few years, partly
      reflecting the fragmentation of Vanuatu politics. The main post-Independence parties
      split, the number of independents and small parties rose, and the government changed
      hands numerous times between 2011 and 2015 (six times in the first half of 2011 alone).
      Since June 2015 a corruption scandal has seen 14 government MPs sentenced to prison
      terms. The President recently dissolved Parliament, and a national election was scheduled
      for early 2016.

      This political instability, coupled with the prevalent view that a range of state institutions
      are ineffective and in some cases illegitimate, imposes a number of stresses: on doing
      business (by making business transactions more uncertain); on the delivery of public as-
      sets (with disputes over rights, compensation, and payments resulting in higher costs and
      delays); and on social cohesion (with intra-community and inter-generational tensions re-
      sulting from contests over benefit-sharing arrangements).

      Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
      The Vanuatu economy is characterized by a formal sector driven by tourism and agri-
      culture, and widespread informal subsistence activity outside the main urban centers of
      Port Vila and Luganville. In Vanuatu, as in other small PICs, economic remoteness, internal
      dispersion, and small size sharply curtail the set of viable economic strategies and the
      potential for export-led growth. Agriculture and tourism, which are relatively less affected
      by these constraints, each contribute an estimated one-quarter of GDP. GDP growth over
      the past decade has been among the highest in the region, driven primarily by tourism,
      but very high population growth (due to high fertility rates and limited migration oppor-
      tunities) means that per capita growth has been more modest at around 1.3 percent per
      annum.

      The government supported macroeconomic stability with a prudent fiscal stance over the
      past decade, but low public expenditure has contributed to inadequate public services
      and infrastructure. Vanuatu collects the least revenue of any country in the region, and it
      imposes no personal or corporate income tax. The government in recent years embarked
      on a substantial infrastructure development program, including new roads, seaports, and
      airports, financed with a mix of development grants and investment loans.

      Natural disasters severely constrain economic activity in Vanuatu. As a recent reminder,
      Tropical Cyclone Pam (which struck in March 2015) was one of the strongest cyclones ever
      seen in the Pacific. Eleven lives were lost, while around 75,000 people needed emergency
      shelter. The cyclone inflicted widespread damage to Vanuatu’s capital stock, including
      infrastructure, livestock, and household assets, with damages and losses equivalent to
      almost two-thirds of GDP. Because of cyclone damage, tourism and agricultural output
                                                          Regional Partnership Framework        137




declined sharply in 2015, although reconstruction activity and the commencement of sev-
eral large infrastructure projects partially offset those losses. GDP was expected to be flat
or increase only slightly in 2015, compared with the pre-cyclone forecast of 4.3 percent
growth.

As a result of Tropical Cyclone Pam, inflation was expected to be close to 4 percent in 2015,
reflecting cyclone-induced shortages and increases in the prices of materials to be used
in reconstruction activities. Exports were expected to decline relative to the pre-cyclone
forecast owing to damage to cash crops, including kava and copra. Tourism earnings were
expected to be dramatically affected, with a number of major hotels temporarily closing
for repair and renovation. The net effect was projected to be a 2015 current account defi-
cit of close to one-quarter of GDP, with the impact of the deterioration in the trade balance
partially offset by insurance receipts and external assistance.

Supporting the vulnerable population and restoring public facilities and infrastructure
will require a considerable expansion in government expenditure. If undertaken efficiently,
publicly funded investments should help foster future growth in Vanuatu, and the govern-
ment’s conservative fiscal stance in recent years allows it some scope to take on moder-
ate levels of concessional debt.

Poverty and Shared Prosperity
According to internationally comparable benchmarks, the incidence of extreme poverty
(per capita consumption below 2011 PPP US$1.90 per day) was 15 percent in Vanuatu in
2010, while the incidence of poverty (per capita consumption below 2011 PPP US$$3.10
per day) was 38 percent—both among the highest in the PICs. The national benchmark for
basic-needs poverty falls somewhere in between these two standards, with an estimat-
ed 13 percent of ni-Vanuatu in poverty according to this measure. Inequality is relatively
modest compared with other countries in the region. The SCD presents evidence suggest-
ing that the B40 experienced relatively strong income growth in the years leading up to
the 2010 HIES, and the Gini coefficient on the nominal per capita consumption distribution
across the population is estimated at 0.37.

Consumption-based poverty in Vanuatu is highly correlated with other indicators of dep-
rivation. While access to education has improved, 30 percent of children do not complete
primary school and most do not attend secondary school. The majority (70 percent) of
households outside the two main cities do not have electricity, and access to improved
water and sanitation is also low. The vast majority of the poor are based in the rural outer
islands and depend on subsistence farming. Many rural populations also reportedly face
severe constraints in accessing markets, schools, and hospitals because roads are either
not available or of poor quality.
138   Regional Partnership Framework




      Development Agenda
      Despite those challenges, Vanuatu has significant potential to increase shared prosperity
      and reduce poverty. The abundance of agricultural land and Vanuatu’s attractiveness as
      a tourist destination both provide opportunities. Vanuatu can further develop its tourist
      attractions and accommodation to increase spend per tourist and repeat visits. The other
      priority lies with building external demand, using savvy marketing and good product de-
      sign to enter new markets, especially in emerging Asia.

      The development of agricultural markets as a source of income for rural households faces
      multiple obstacles. Lack of infrastructure impedes market access, inadequate basic edu-
      cation limits farmers’ productivity, and frequent natural disasters reduce the incentive to
      make longer-term investments. Actions by the government in coordination with develop-
      ment partners, the community, and the private sector can help to alleviate each of these
      constraints. It is critical to continue to strengthen disaster early warning and prepared-
      ness, mainstream disaster risk and climate change considerations into planning and in-
      frastructure investment, and enhance financial resilience to climate and disaster shocks.

      To improve public service delivery, Vanuatu will need more public resources and stronger
      public financial management systems. With development assistance, efforts are already
      taking place to increase education and health services in the outer islands, and the sub-
      stantial public investment program currently underway should help meet critical infra-
      structure needs. To maintain this higher level of services and investment, Vanuatu will
      need to raise additional domestic revenues as well as access continued assistance from
      development partners. Robust systems to manage these flows and distribute resources
      nationwide will be essential.

      National Strategy and Its Key Pillars/Focus
      The government’s development strategy is contained in Vanuatu’s Priorities and Action
      Agenda 2006–15 (PAA) and in the Planning Long Acting Short Plan (PLAS) 2013–16. The
      PAA 2006-15 sets out a national vision of “an educated, healthy and wealthy Vanuatu.”
      Seven national strategic priorities support the achievement of that vision, including pri-
      vate sector development and employment creation; macroeconomic stability and equita-
      ble growth; good governance and public sector reform; primary sector development (natu-
      ral resources and the environment); provision of better basic services, especially in rural
      areas; education and human resource development; and economic infrastructure and sup-
      port services. The PAA is a high-level set of priorities and strategies with a ten-year time
      horizon. It is accompanied by the PLAS, which lists a set of priority actions for the govern-
      ment and development partners.

      An important overarching objective is to improve the environment for private sector-led
      economic growth, particularly in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, and tourism. This ob-
      jective can be achieved by improving the investment, operating, and regulatory environ-
      ment for the private sector and by providing necessary infrastructure in both rural and
      urban areas. Measures to improve quality and access to education and health services,
      and to ensure women’s equitable participation in social, economic, and political decision-
      making, are also viewed as key contributors.

Annex 10: Overview of PIC6 CAS/CPS Completion and
Learning Reviews
This overview summarizes the assessments of the individual Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) or Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) Completion and Learning Reviews (CLRs,
provided in Attachments 3A–8A of this annex) for the six Pacific Island Countries (referred
to here as the PIC6) for which individual country strategies were prepared starting about
FY2011. In a departure from the previous umbrella Regional Strategy, stand-alone CASs/
CPSs were developed for the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Kiribati, the Republic
of the Marshall Islands (RMI), Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu for various periods (mostly four
years) spanning FY2011-17. Because several country strategies or partnerships cover peri-
ods that remain to be completed or were completed very recently, it is not surprising that
some results are unmet and that full results remain to be achieved in the younger, ongoing
CPSs. These strategies were joint World Bank-IFC strategies, except for Tuvalu (which was
for IDA only as Tuvalu was not a member of IFC).

Even without an umbrella regional strategy, the individual CASs/CPSs reflect the features
and challenges commonly encountered among most of the PIC6, including their relative
isolation and remoteness, distance to markets, dispersion over wide oceanic areas as ar-
chipelagos, fragility and vulnerability with respect to climate change, small economies and
populations, economic dependence on external aid, large public sectors, and susceptibility
to external shocks. Thus each country strategy and partnership was shaped by the four
overarching themes identified as the framework for WBG engagement with the PIC6: (i)
strengthening regional/global integration; (ii) building resilience to economic shocks, nat-
ural disasters, and climate change; (iii) encouraging economic reform and private sector
development; and (iv) improving education, health, and social services. These four themes
were interpreted for the individual country strategies and partnerships in light of each
country’s specific circumstances, the country specific development challenges and priori-
ties, ongoing WBG activities and implementation experience, and the complementarity of
WBG assistance with the activities of development partners.

The PIC6 country strategies also aligned with the twin goals of the WBG: eliminating ex-
treme poverty by 2030 and boosting shared prosperity, measured as the income of the
bottom 40 percent in any given country. These goals strongly complemented the coun-
tries own visions, enunciated in various national development strategies and frameworks,
of achieving economic growth and development; addressing poverty, employment, quality
of life, reduction of hardships, and equity issues; and meeting specific social, environmen-
tal, and sustainability objectives.

      SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS
      This overview summarizes the assessments undertaken within the individual CLRs (At-
      tachments 3A–8A) for the six PICs and refrains from arriving at any single assessment for
      the PIC6 group as a whole. Details on progress related to the individual CAS/CPS outcomes
      and related indicators and milestones are presented in six separate Results Frameworks
      (RFs), consolidated in Attachments 3B-8B. Each RF also presents information on relat-
      ed WBG activities that support the CAS/CPS objectives, identifies the key development
      partners, and where relevant summarizes lessons from the design and implementation of
      the engagements and offers indicative suggestions for ongoing and future engagements
      and strategies to inform the Regional Partnership Framework (RPF). Attachments 1 and 2
      summarize the planned and actual WBG deliveries for the PIC6.

      The CLR results are based on self-assessments by the members of the WBG PIC6 country
      teams (both IDA and IFC) using the CAS/CPS outcomes as the units of accounting and
      taking into consideration progress on key indicators and milestones. The ratings scale
      follows the current OPCS guidelines for CLRs. The CLR guidelines require outcomes to be
      rated with one of the given categories. As a result, some outcomes and milestones have
      had to be rated within that scheme as “partially achieved” or “not achieved.” Those ratings
      were correct at the time of the CLR, because the related strategy was ongoing, but wher-
      ever appropriate, the team noted that good progress had been made toward achieving the
      results initially promised. The team also assessed the performance of the WBG in achiev-
      ing results and implementing various WBG-supported engagements. Even though the twin
      corporate goals of eliminating poverty and boosting shared prosperity were articulated
      after some of the PIC6 strategies had been developed, the team highlighted instances in
      which WBG activities in the six countries were aligned with those corporate goals.

      Development Outcomes

      The overall performance of the CAS/CPS programs in helping to achieve the subset of se-
      lected country goals was assessed as satisfactory for Samoa and Tonga, moderately sat-
      isfactory for FSM and Tuvalu, moderately unsatisfactory for Kiribati, and unsatisfactory
      for RMI (Table 1). The ratings for the individual country development outcomes are drawn
      from the evidence-based assessments of the CAS/CPS outcomes as the unit of account-
      ing (in most cases, using equal weights). In Samoa and Tonga (and to some extent Tuvalu),
      many outcomes were either fully or mostly achieved. In Kiribati and RMI, a large number of
      outcomes were partially or not yet achieved. For FSM, where the CPS has more than a year
      to go before it ends, the moderately satisfactory rating takes particular account of the
      trajectory and results achieved so far. Of the total 64 outcomes across the 6 countries, 13
      are considered fully achieved and 18 mostly achieved, for an aggregate achievement rate
      of about 48 percent, or about half of the outcomes. About one-third of the outcomes are
      partially achieved.

       World Bank Group Performance

       The performance of the WBG in designing and implementing the CAS/CPS programs in
       the PIC6 during this period is considered good in Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu and fair in
       the other countries (Table 1). The themes and strategic areas selected for the country
       programs aligned well with country priorities, the WBG regional framework, and the twin
       goals. The choice of instruments as well as the program of support were judicious and
       appropriate. Performance was hampered mostly by implementation issues. As evidenced
       by the one-third of outcomes that are partially achieved, projects often took much longer
       than anticipated to get off the ground.

       Two considerations are relevant for understanding this assessment. First, the engage-
       ments reviewed here often were the first to be undertaken by the WBG in these Pacific Is-
       land Countries, so WBG operations had a limited track record, and clients were unfamiliar
       with the WBG. Second, some strategies are still in progress or have just reached the end of
       their timeframe, so further results and milestones will be attained after supporting pro-
       ject components and activities are initiated or move beyond the preliminary stages when
       (for instance) staffing is ongoing, contracts are being placed, and procurement is proceed-
       ing (and sometimes encountering delays).

144   Regional Partnership Framework




      IFC has made good progress against goals set in the IFC Pacific Partnership Agreement:
      the formal platform of engagement between IFC and its core donors in the Pacific (the
      Governments of Australia and New Zealand). The Partnership Agreement, launched in
      2012, lays out clear development goals and set objectives, and is focused on driving eco-
      nomic growth, spurred by the private sector development in the Pacific, to help promote
      new jobs, opportunities, prosperity and reduce poverty. The development of a successor
      arrangement is currently being discussed with the core donors. In Tonga and Samoa, IFC
      has directed its efforts toward tourism, seeking to increase the development of new source
      markets. IFC has supported Tonga develop the first Tonga Tourism Yearbook was launched
      in 2014, and conducted a review for Samoa on how the island’s air connectivity affects
      tourism, as well as its tourism marketing strategy. Also in Samoa, IFC has supported the
      government establish a PPP concession to develop an integrated solid waste management
      system and in establishing a cost-effective, sustainable alternative for commercial dis-
      pute resolution (to complement to the formal court system). Through the Pacific Payment
      Systems project, IFC successfully provided the central banks of Samoa and Tonga with a
      Summary Note on the Request for Interest process for the payment systems infrastruc-
      ture reforms, and increased basic financial services to the unbanked and underbanked
      populations in remote areas of those two countries.

      HIGHLIGHTS OF ASSESSMENT
      The PIC6 CASs and CPSs reviewed here were prepared as country-specific strategies from
      2010 in a departure from the previous umbrella strategy for the region. As noted, owing to
      the commonalities in terms of economic geography and other traits such as isolation and
      remoteness, spatial dispersion, small size of the economy and population, fragility, vulner-
      ability to natural and economic shocks, and the similar human development challenges
      faced by the PIC6, WBG engagement in these countries remained highly focused on four
      overarching themes: (i) strengthening regional/global integration; (ii) building resilience to
      economic shocks, natural disasters and climate change; (iii) encouraging economic reform
      and private sector development; and (iv) improving education, health, and the social ser-
      vices. Because the strategic themes or strategic areas or priorities of the individual CASs
      and CPSs fit well within these overarching themes, they are used to structure the follow-
      ing discussion of the highlights of the assessments.

      Theme 1: Strengthening Regional/Global Integration

      Most of the PIC6 CASs/CPSs reflected this theme in one or more priority strategic areas
      or clusters of outcomes. Typically, these included outcomes or outcome clusters related
      to infrastructure development and maintenance of road, airport, and maritime facilities
      as well as aviation safety and institutional development; improved access to and lower
      costs of information and communication technology (ICT) services, including mobile te-
      lephony and internet use and regulatory reforms; and temporary labor migration schemes
      for employment opportunities and facilitation/lowering of remittance costs. These out-
      comes were supported well by country and regional projects on aviation (such as the Pa-
      cific Aviation Investment Program, PAIP), ICT connectivity (such as the Pacific Regional
      Connectivity Program), Technical Assistance (TA) on labor migration, and support for reg-
                                                          Regional Partnership Framework        145




ulatory reforms. In particular, the targets for building and maintaining roads, including
developing local maintenance capacity, were usually met or exceeded, while ICT projects
also had good results. Results linked to aviation outcomes are proving slow to accrue in
some instances, as frequently it has taken longer than anticipated in the CAS/CPS to
install infrastructure and safety facilities and conclude contracts. The objectives of ob-
taining International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) certification for major airports are
being flexibly addressed by using third-party support for accreditation. Temporary labor
migration schemes supported by Australia and New Zealand also have good traction and
are contributing to poverty reduction and the WBG has contributed to the policy discus-
sion in both countries.

In Kiribati, outcomes related to ICT development (increased mobile penetration, reduced
price for telecom services, and a stronger, more competitive ICT regulatory environment)
have been fully or mostly achieved. Mobile penetration reached about 30 percent, the
state-owned monopoly was privatized, and pricing for 3G mobile services has fallen. The
Samoa Pacific Regional Connectivity Phase III project is in the early stages of implementa-
tion. The ICT cluster of outcomes in Tonga (increased internet use, wholesale connectivity
cost reductions) has been achieved or mostly achieved. In RMI, IDA operations supporting
the population’s improved access to ICT services have not yet yielded results due to lo-
cal opposition to market reforms and liberalization. The FSM-Palau Connectivity Project,
conducted in partnership with Asian Development Bank (ADB), is in its early days, and the
related outcome is not achieved but on track.

The PAIP series of projects has supported Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu in address-
ing the challenges of geographic isolation by promoting opportunities arising from closer
regional and global integration. PAIP is providing support for rehabilitating the aviation
infrastructure of these countries and bringing the facilities into compliance with interna-
tional safety regulations and standards. The Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility (PRIF),
a multi-donor trust fund, has supported PAIP, with the primary focus of supporting sus-
tainability and ensuring funding for regulatory oversight. An AU$5 “security and safety
levy” for each departing international passenger has been implemented in all PAIP coun-
tries to help ensure fiscal sustainability for managing air transport and infrastructure
assets. This levy is providing significant revenue to high-traffic countries such as Tonga
and Samoa. Runway repairs have been completed in Tonga and Tuvalu and will soon start
in Samoa. Improvements to navigation aids, weather monitoring, rescue fire services, and
more have progressed. Advisors are supporting several countries to address their regu-
latory and operational standards. Tonga has mostly achieved the outcome of improving
compliance of its civil aviation and maritime sector with international safety standards.
The Ministry of Infrastructure (MoI), with support of the Tonga Transport Sector Consoli-
dation Project (TSCP), has drafted one civil aviation, two land transport, and 18 maritime
policies, as well as a dedicated MoI Act.

Tuvalu has achieved the labor migration outcomes of the CAS, supported by the WBG, by
taking greater advantage of temporary employment opportunities in New Zealand and
Australia, and it has met the milestone of providing training opportunities to Tuvaluans.
The specific target of increasing women’s participation in these schemes was not met.
146   Regional Partnership Framework




      Aside from the supply- and demand-side barriers to boosting women’s participation in
      the temporary agricultural labor schemes, sociocultural barriers and preferences make it
      challenging for women to work as seafarers. The goal of increasing the number of Samoan
      workers participating in temporary labor migration schemes in Australia and New Zea-
      land, with higher returns per worker as efficiency increases, is partially achieved.

      Theme 2: Building Resilience to Economic Shocks, Natural Disasters, and Climate Change

      Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu all have strategic priorities in their individual CASs/
      CPSs that address the overall theme of building resilience to shocks, natural disasters,
      and climate change. The strategies have focused particularly on improving the supply of
      petroleum and reducing volatility in supply and pricing. Given the vulnerability of the PIC6
      to natural disasters, disaster risk reduction (DRR) measures and measures to address the
      effects of climate change also received attention.

      Efforts to improve the petroleum supply chain to reduce volatility in the energy price and
      supply in Kiribati have achieved only partial results so far, and results related to increas-
      ing renewable energy to the grid and directly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
      have also been slow to gain traction. These efforts are supported by the Kiribati Grid-
      Connected Solar Photo-Voltaic (PV) Project, which has been delayed. Tonga had better
      success in improving petroleum supply chains through support from the Tonga Energy
      Sector Development Policy Operation (DPO) as well as the Economic Recovery Operations
      (EROs). The operation, which was integral to the Bank’s ongoing overall engagement in
      the energy sector, supported policy and institutional measures that helped Tonga sustain
      the momentum of energy sector reforms and implement recommendations from the 2010
      Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment. Tonga also partially
      achieved results under the outcome on increased efficiency of grid power system, including
      the reduction of technical and non-technical losses on the Tongatapu grid. The outcome
      and milestones formed part of a phased program for the Tonga Energy Road Map (TERM),
      and their achievement depended on initial activities in TERM program that remain to be
      evaluated conclusively. Renewable generation capacity has been increased, with a 1 MW
      solar plant now dispatching to the Nuku’alofa grid and providing lower-cost energy than
      existing diesel plants. This achievement contributes to improved service delivery and in-
      creases resilience against shocks.

      Kiribati launched the Kiribati Joint Implementation Plan (KJIP) for Climate Change and
      Disaster Risk Management in August 2014. The KJIP mainstreams disaster risk reduc-
      tion in national planning and investment programming. Greater integrated capacity to
      manage DRR and climate change adaptation (CCA) issues is partially achieved. Kiribati
      has been active in responding to the impacts of climate change and disasters at all levels.
      KJIP ensures that climate variability, climate change, and disaster risks (related to me-
      teorological, geological, or environmental risks) are incorporated in all development plan-
      ning processes. It also ensures that tangible, on-the-ground actions are identified for all
      sectors in order to reduce risks. Climate risk profiles were applied to four major coastal
      protection works on South Tarawa.

In Tonga, the post-cyclone Niuatoputapu reconstruction targets have been achieved with
support from the Post-Tsunami Reconstruction Project. A total of 127 buildings have been
rebuilt or repaired, with improved auxiliary water supply and sanitation facilities. Water
supply and road access to the new settlement areas outside the tsunami danger zone
have been established, and 13 km of the main spine road across the island underwent
resurfacing and preventive maintenance. A social survey found high levels of satisfaction
among the beneficiaries of these efforts. In addition, the objectives of improved national
disaster management and planning capacity have been met. The project strengthened in-
stitutional capacity for DRM. Capacity improvements include improved technical capabil-
ity and skills for hazard assessment and mapping, increased availability and accessibility
of improved hazard and risk information, and improved community-level awareness of
and preparedness for disasters.

The Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) pilot insur-
ance scheme (a joint Secretariat of the Pacific Community and World Bank initiative,
funded by Japan) triggered an insurance payout to Tonga in the amount of US$1.27 million
to fund immediate relief and recovery in response to Tropical Cyclone Ian and to Vanuatu
in the amount of US$1.9 million following Tropical Cyclone Pam. The positive outcome of
the pilot led PCRAFI member countries to establish an independent PCRAFI facility to
provide disaster and climate risk insurance, domiciled in the Cook Islands and established
by August 2016. Following COP21 in Paris, development partners have so far committed
US$35 million toward the facility.

Tuvalu intended to pursue CCA measures focusing on effective medium-term planning and
sustainable water resource (drought) management, but they did not eventuate, which con-
stitutes a major missed opportunity in light of Tuvalu’s critical vulnerability to the impacts
of climate change and natural disasters. No WBG-supported operations or TA were under-
taken that would lead to CAS outcomes in drought and water resource management. The
PCRAFI and Disaster Risk Financing Insurance (DRFI) programs developed risk profiles
(earthquakes and cyclones) but did not address water resource or drought management.
The aviation project had planned to create climate resilience and adaptation co-benefits
by using the runway as water catchment and creating water storage facilities, but later
that scheme was not considered to be viable for potable water.

A set of outcomes in the Kiribati CAS related to improving coastal resilience, strengthening
water resource management with greater access to clean water, and increasing capacity
to manage DRR and CCA. They were mostly achieved through support from the Kiribati
Adaptation Program (KAP) II and III. The government has strong support at the policy
level for water resource management in South Tarawa. The sustainability of the physical
improvements to the network and ongoing reliability of the water supply are accompa-
nied by behavior-change interventions aimed at improving water saving and management
as well as improving willingness to pay for the supply. Technical capacity has been built
within the Ministry of Public Works and Utilities for improved shoreline protection. Capac-
ity for the selection of appropriate measures has been built through the projects, and it
is being utilized in coastal resilience programs in other parts of the country. Rainwater
harvesting systems in Banabaand North Tarawa (six sites in four villages), which provide
5.3 m3 of potable water per day (toward the project target of 6.1 m3 per day) have been
completed thus far.
148   Regional Partnership Framework




      Samoa fully met its goal of completing 5 km of inland coastal road. The road, which pro-
      vides access to and for relocated communities in tsunami-stricken areas, supports the
      government’s priority of better preparing communities to respond to natural disasters.
      The country has also adopted a modern and comprehensive disaster risk management
      (DRM) framework that features greater community engagement. Also in Samoa, 16 dis-
      tricts are completing high-priority coastal protection initiatives (such as mangrove plant-
      ing), and milestones related to developing the Integrated National Climate Change Adap-
      tation Strategy and accessing regional risk pooling and catastrophe insurance schemes
      have been achieved.

      Theme 3: Encouraging Economic Reform and Private Sector Development

      The key objectives of fiscal consolidation and rebuilding of reserves in Samoa are mostly
      achieved. A tight fiscal stance, stronger revenue collection, and restraints on current ex-
      penditures have led to lower deficits in recent years, although deficits have still exceeded
      the government’s target of 3.5 percent of GDP. Two DPOs were declared effective and dis-
      bursed over the CPS period (in March 2013 and June 2015, respectively), and a further DPO
      is under preparation for FY17 delivery. These DPOs each added to progress toward fiscal
      sustainability by including actions specifically targeting debt management, revenues, and
      public expenditure (particularly procurement reforms), as well as by helping to motivate
      the maintenance of a sound macroeconomic framework overall. As a prior action for the
      2013 DPO in Samoa, the government approved and made public an updated medium-term
      debt strategy (MTDS), and it began to publish quarterly debt bulletins on the Ministry of
      Finance (MoF) website, which allow the government and the public to monitor key aspects
      of the debt portfolio. As a prior action for the 2014 DPO, the MoF established formal pro-
      cedures for contracting loans and issuing government guarantees (with TA from the World
      Bank), to strengthen overarching control of debt and contingent liabilities and ensure that
      new borrowing is consistent with the MTDS.

      The World Bank responded to Tuvalu’s request for support to strengthen fiscal man-
      agement and adjustments. The objective of reducing fiscal pressure and improving the
      economic outlook by reorienting and rationalizing government expenditure was mostly
      achieved: the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF) was rebuilt by managing expenditure
      and reorienting expenditure to priority areas, and these efforts, although somewhat at-
      tenuated by recent natural disasters, better equip the government to address future
      shocks. The Tuvalu Consumption Tax also increased from 3 percent of GDP to 7 percent
      in 2013 (exceeding the CAS target of 6 percent). The country fell short of its important
      milestone of reducing expenditures for the Tuvalu Medical Treatment Scheme (TMTS); the
      objective was for the scheme to move from consuming 57 percent of the health budget in
      2009 to 17 percent (equivalent to 2005 levels), but expenditure had declined only to 45
      percent by 2014 (note however that expenditures for Primary and Preventive Health Care
      increased by more than 5 percent over the past several years).

      The supplement to the Second DPO provided additional financing to meet an unexpected
      need resulting from Tropical Cyclone Pam. The operation ensures that reforms supported
      under the Second DPO remain on track and are implemented without the risk of delay due
      to competing capacity or budgetary priorities arising from post-disaster recovery.
                                                        Regional Partnership Framework       149




RMI did not achieve the goal of introducing cost-reflective fuel tariffs. Discussions were
held with the government and Marshalls Energy Company (MEC), but during the CAS pe-
riod, WBG support was not available to MEC or the energy sector; the government at the
time requested its program to focus fully on ICT reform and allocated all of its IDA re-
sources to a DPO in the ICT sector. In government and World Bank discussions of IDA17
programming in July 2015, MoF reported that the government did not support the Bank’s
involvement in the energy sector, noting that sufficient support was available from the
European Union (EU). Also in RMI, the overall outcome related to the Compact Trust Fund
(CTF) objectives—strategic asset allocation and investment management strategies re-
viewed, and options identified to improve long-term sustainability in response to econom-
ic and financial market volatilities—is rated partially achieved.

Samoa made satisfactory progress toward achieving public financial management (PFM)
outcomes. The government achieved the goal of strengthened PFM through recent reforms
(building on nearly two decades of progress) that have established an appropriate legisla-
tive framework, introduced program budgeting, and instituted government-wide sector
planning. The World Bank has also maintained a strong dialogue on revenue reform issues
with the government in the context of the Public Expenditure Review (PER), as well as the
2014 DPO, which supported revisions to the Customs Act to facilitate trade and improve-
ments to the customs information system. These legislative changes have allowed Samoa
to remove red tape in customs operations and employ risk management techniques, im-
proving transparency and predictability for traders and reducing the cost of doing busi-
ness. In recent years, Samoa has also created a new Procurement Division in the MoF, an
administrative arrangement that has driven the wider procurement reform process. Sup-
ported by the 2013 and 2014 DPOs, the government has ensured all tender notices and all
contract awards for procurements above SAT500,000 are publicly available.

The objectives of strengthening the investment climate and business environment across
the PIC6 have mixed ratings. In Samoa, the goal of improved competitiveness, including
improvements in the World Bank Doing Business (DB) indicators, is assessed as partial-
ly achieved. Development objectives of the 2014 DPO aimed to strengthen the payment
system, tourism sector policy, and private sector development opportunities as founda-
tions for more robust economic growth over the medium term. Contributing to these ob-
jectives were reforms to modernize the payment system and introduce a new PPP policy
framework to increase opportunities for private participation in the large state-owned
enterprise (SOE) sector. These reforms have helped (and will continue to help) to boost
the competitiveness of the Samoan economy. The PPP framework developed with WBG
assistance was endorsed by the Cabinet. In Samoa, IFC has also assisted the government
in establishing a PPP concession to develop an integrated solid waste management sys-
tem (to cover all waste generators—household, commercial, industrial) in both Upolu and
Savali Islands, covering 100 percent of the population. IFC also successfully established
the Samoa Alternative Dispute Resolution, which was a cost-effective, sustainable alter-
native for commercial dispute resolution (to complement to the formal court system).

In Tonga and Samoa, central to IFC’s focus has been advancing the tourism industry,
which fuels growth and employment, not least because of its multiplier effect: the tenta-
cles of tourism touch a myriad of other economic activities, catalysing the development of
150   Regional Partnership Framework




      small businesses in related production and service sectors, with the important corollary
      being job creation. In 2013 IFC initiated an Advisory project aimed at addressing both the
      demand and supply side and increasing the development of new source markets. With IFC
      support, the first Tonga Tourism Yearbook was launched in 2014, and IFC will continue to
      work with the ministry and the Statistics Office in implementing the Tourism Core Data-
      set Roadmap. The Government of Samoa also requested IFC’s support in reviewing how
      the island’s air connectivity affects tourism, and in turn exploring options for Samoa to
      improve air connectivity, as well as its tourism marketing strategy; this review has been
      completed and presented to the Government of Samoa.

      Some progress was seen in Tonga for the outcome cluster related to improving the busi-
      ness environment (improved business environment, as reflected in DB indicators; reduced
      cost of connectivity translating into reduced business transaction costs; and reduced
      number of procedures for obtaining a business license). The DPOs supported DB reforms
      with explicit links to DB indicators in their RFs. Some significant results (for instance,
      reductions in the cost of starting a business and simplification of the small business tax)
      and a number of more recent reforms have yet to be reflected in the DB scores but will
      have a big impact when they become fully effective (examples include reforms in receiver-
      ship and foreign investment law). There have been specific instances of movement. For ex-
      ample, the Central Bank of Samoa invited a WBG Finance & Market (F&M) team to assist
      in developing a credit bureau for the country. The objective of reduced cost of connectiv-
      ity is well served by the Tonga-Pacific Regional Connectivity Program, resulting in lower
      transaction costs for businesses, households, and the government.

      Through the Pacific Payment Systems project, IFC successfully provided the central banks
      of Samoa and Tonga with a Summary Note on the Request for Interest process for the
      payment systems infrastructure reforms, and increased basic financial services to the
      unbanked and underbanked populations in remote areas of those two countries. Beyond
      helping improve access to electronic payment services for the unserved and underserved
      populations in Tonga and Samoa, IFC strengthened legal frameworks, regulations and
      oversight of payment systems between these countries, together with other islands that
      fall outside the scope of this assessment. In Tonga, IFC also completed project implemen-
      tation for the creation of a remittances unit of the Tonga Development Bank (TDB), along
      the TDB to offer accounts for remittances transfers from New Zealand and Tonga at low
      cost.

      The objective of legislative and regulatory improvements to the investment climate in RMI
      is not achieved, although the RMI Chamber of Commerce has requested IFC to provide as-
      sistance in improving the country’s investment regime. Discussions revealed that the RMI
      government needs to further clarify its goals and the objectives of the investment policy
      regime, and the parties decided to put the request on hold temporarily. These challeng-
      es are exacerbated by the lack of funding for investment policy work in Northern Pacific
      countries through the IFC Investment Climate Rapid Response Project. In any case, WBG
      involvement in activities contributing to improvements in the investment climate in the
      remaining period of the CPS are unlikely.

In FSM, improvements in the business regulatory environment goals are rated partially
achieved on the strength of progress on the related indicators and milestones. Concerted
efforts and dialogue by the IFC created momentum for harmonizing foreign investment
approval processes at the national and state levels. The President and government agreed
with the approach that only the national government should have jurisdiction over invest-
ment matters, and the states would cease to exercise their jurisdictions.

In the energy sector, Samoa partially achieved the objective of concessions being tendered
for new private investment in energy generation following liberalization and the develop-
ment of a framework for independent power producers (IPPs). Two IPP concessions have
been awarded (2 MW and 3 MW) to a strong international private sector operator, and the
project is being developed. In FSM, the World Bank approved the Energy Sector Develop-
ment Project, which became effective in October 2014 with the aim of financing urgent
replacement of old and inefficient diesel generation units in Yap, Kosrae, and Pohnpei, and
financing solar generating units and efficient street lighting in Chuuk. Longer-term en-
ergy goals (including helping FSM to develop master plans for the four states and the
national government to move to renewable energy and energy efficiency projects) remain
unachieved because project activities have been slow to take off.

Progress toward the goal of establishing maintenance microenterprises for the road sec-
tor in Kiribati has been slow, partly because the original scheme had to be modified; it
now focuses on a few larger contractors to avoid overburdening the already overstretched
public service with a larger number of contracts to manage. In Tonga, the objective of
consolidating the transport- related departments under MoI is achieved. The TSCP has
successfully supported restructuring of the infrastructure ministry, which has devolved
several non-key business areas to focus on its role of policy and planning. The goal of
strengthening domestic private sector road maintenance capacity is also fully achieved.
TSCP succeeded in providing routine maintenance on the full road network of Tongata-
pu. The project ultimately helped to create a road maintenance industry in Tonga and
strengthened capacity toward that end.

In Kiribati, IFC provided transaction advisory support to the Government of Kiribati by
preparing and implementing a tender for the selection of private investors/operators for
the development of the Otintaii Hotel, a 40-room facility on the main island, Tarawa. The
project was IFC’s first engagement in Kiribati, and a significant private sector activity for
a country dominated by SOEs.

Outcomes in Samoa related to agricultural productivity and marketing have been mostly
or partially achieved through the Samoa Agriculture Competitiveness Enhancement Pro-
ject (SACEP). Yields of selected vegetable crops have increased (although not yet doubled),
and a greater share of locally produced fruits, vegetables, and beef is sold through do-
mestic channels. The RMI component of the Pacific Islands Regional Oceanscape Program
(PROP) became effective only in September 2015, and thus RMI has not yet achieved the
outcome on increased percentage (from 10 percent to 12 percent) of the landed value of
the tuna caught in national waters that is retained by the country via sales of access
rights. Similarly, the milestone on introduction of a market mechanism permitting the
152   Regional Partnership Framework




      trade of fishing licenses at international market rates is also not achieved. A key factor
      in these achievement ratings is that the start-up time needed for the project in RMI was
      underestimated.

      In Samoa, IFC tourism investments to support 4,000 new arrivals across three pilot coun-
      tries by 2016 remain only partially achieved. The PPP framework developed with WBG as-
      sistance will improve air services and encourage new private sector investments in tour-
      ism. The CPS noted that Samoa-specific indicators would be developed as the initiative
      progressed and would be included in the CPS Progress Report. In the absence of a Progress
      Report, however, those indicators remain unspecified.

      Theme 4: Improving Education, Health, and the Social Services

      Samoa partially achieved the outcome related to improved efficiency and effectiveness of
      service delivery to strengthen health financing and address education quality. The Samoa
      Health Sector Management Program Support Project responded to the National Health
      Strategic Plan’s priorities but progress was mixed, with certain indicators reflecting nega-
      tive trends and others having more positive outcomes. Results were partially achieved for
      improvements in policy, planning and implementation, efficiency in public health, commit-
      ment and ownership of the sector-wide process, harmonization, and quality of consulta-
      tions and processes. Health sector management has improved, although it could improve
      further with additional delineation between the Ministry of Health’s oversight and regu-
      latory functions and by allowing the National Health Service to manage health service
      delivery.

      Education sector outcomes in Tonga—net enrolment, dropout, retention rates, and stu-
      dent test performance improved from 2005 baselines; local participation and account-
      ability increased through introducing school-based management, with schools engaging
      communities in planning, budgeting, and results assessment—are mostly achieved. The
      World Bank’s contribution to Tonga’s education sector during the period enabled the gov-
      ernment to achieve its National Strategic Planning Framework 2009-2013 theme of “Fa-
      cilitating community development by involving district and village communities in meet-
      ing their service needs.” Tonga Education Support Project (TESP) outcomes have clearly
      demonstrated progress toward local-level resolution of school service delivery needs. Edu-
      cation investments have also benefitted from close donor coordination.

WORLD BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE AND LESSONS
Lessons from CAS/CPS Design

Most of the individual CASs and CPSs for the PIC6 are well aligned with the respective
country development frameworks and visions. Applying filters (such as the key challenges
and priorities; sequencing; development partner presence, plans, and roles in the area of
engagement; and demand and commitment from the clients) and building on previous
experience and projects in those countries with a legacy of WBG engagement, the strate-
gies were selective and well structured. They accommodated the increasing level of re-
sources available from the WBG to develop expanded programs of engagement and also
took on board potential regional resources available for various activities. The strategies
are tightly couched within the East Asia and Pacific (EAP) regional framework and over-
arching themes, and they are also aligned well with the WBG corporate goals of reduced
poverty and shared prosperity. They also benefited from wide-ranging and close consul-
tations with key stakeholders during their preparation. The Bank’s Pacific Futures study
influenced the design of these strategies in substantive ways—for example, by highlight-
ing continued reliance on remittances and aid flows over the longer term, and expansion
of budget support from the donors.

The choice of instruments was appropriate, with a mix of DPOs where warranted (based
on the experience of recent budget support operations in these and similar countries),
investment credits, sector-wide approaches (SWAps), additional financing, repeater and
phased projects, multi-country regional programs, TA, and other Advisory Services and
Analytics (ASA). The design of many programs included the use of budget support op-
erations in several of the PIC6. Regional operations were a strong feature in the unique
microstate context of the Pacific islands. Although regional engagements are sometimes
complex and difficult to manage, the risks can be substantially mitigated and regional IDA
operations (as well as regional ASA and TA) proved to be effective and efficient in the use of
WBG resources. Regional operations encouraged partnership between culturally aligned
but physically distant countries – including joint learning and collective approaches to
common problems (PCRAFI is a good example of catalyzing development assistance and
can offer lessons for disaster and crisis response operations). No MIGA operations were
undertaken in any of the countries during the period under review.

A key weakness common to several strategies is the complex design of the RFs. Given the
small sizes of the economies and populations, limited WBG engagements (in most cases
pre-existing WBG portfolios and ongoing projects were absent), and the need for simplified
results chains, having large numbers of outcomes and related indicators and milestones
was perhaps unwarranted in several cases. While the identification of the strategic ar-
eas and themes was judicious, the RFs should have included fewer individual outcomes,
which in turn become the units of accounting for exercises such as the CLR and Independ-
ent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluations. The CASs/CPSs also were often overambitious in
terms of the results that could be achieved through activities that would be developed,
appraised, negotiated, approved, made effective, and implemented within the timeframe.
However, recognition needs to be given to the unfamiliarity of the WBG in many of these
154   Regional Partnership Framework




      countries at the time the frameworks were developed, weak capacities on the ground, the
      inherent intention to recalibrate and adjust results as experience was gained, and the use
      of regional approaches to mitigate individual capacity constraints.

      These country strategies and partnerships represent the WBG’s first-ever systematic and
      strategic engagements with the PIC6 as individual clients, and they also include the first
      WBG financing for some of them. Unlike most CASs/CPSs, in most of these countries the
      WBG started from a zero base, with no ongoing portfolio or even solid ongoing relation-
      ships. A further consideration is that some of the CAS/CPS engagement periods are in-
      complete or have been completed only recently. For that reason, it is somewhat unrealistic
      to expect that measurable results specified in the various RFs should be fully achieved at
      this time. Perhaps some of the RF outcomes should not have been specified as achievable
      within this timeframe and within three-four years of initiating activities to support the
      new strategies. Perhaps alternative frameworks should have been considered for the first
      country-specific engagement, such as Country Engagement Notes (CENs), which would
      have outlined a two-year plan to initiate engagement and a program, without expecta-
      tions about larger results.

      Despite these caveats, the identification of risks to CAS implementation was candid
      and realistic. Several common threads run through each of the strategies. They include
      program delivery risks due to the thin capacity in the countries and minimal WBG staff
      in-country; political risks; the ever-present risks of exogenous shocks inherent in small,
      fragile, isolated, and geographically dispersed island economies; weaknesses in PFM; dif-
      ficulties of securing political consensus for reforms; unfamiliarity of the client with WBG
      procedures; extreme remoteness imposing high transport costs and logistical challenges;
      spatial dispersion increasing the cost and complexity of providing public services; weak
      economies of scale for most development activities; and severe skill and technical con-
      straints. Many of these risks materialized to various degrees in these countries and con-
      tributed directly to the slower-than-expected pace of implementation of many activities.
      The WBG aimed to mitigate these risks through close partnerships and communications
      with the governments, development partners, and a broad range of civil society organiza-
      tions, and by strengthening capacity and country systems as well as enhancing its sup-
      port for implementation. The need for well-managed transitions of WBG Task Team Lead-
      ers (TTLs) is a recurrent recommendation from the country teams.

      Lessons of Implementation

      The individual CLRs presented in Attachments 3A–8A detail the specific implementation
      experiences with the six CASs/CPSs. The commonalities emerging from that experience
      are highlighted here, without going into project particulars and individual circumstanc-
      es, to provide the key overarching lessons that can be drawn from implementing the six
      CASs/CPSs.

      The key challenge to implementation stemmed from underestimating the complexity and
      time required to design, appraise, negotiate, approve, make effective, and implement the
      WBG-supported projects. In reality, the anticipated results can come only later in the pro-
                                                          Regional Partnership Framework        155




ject cycles, often beyond the CPS period. Although CPS targets in the RF often are cali-
brated from the end-project targets to be met within the CPS period, frequently they are
still ambitious. As a result, a large number of outcomes are partially achieved, and quite a
few are not achieved. The number of fully achieved (or mostly achieved) outcomes remains
limited by the end-point of the CAS/CPS period.

Equally, the WBG underestimated the challenges inherent in implementing activities in
countries new to WBG procedures, where clear limitations on capacities and remoteness
and isolation added to the burden of supervision. It is no surprise that some outcomes
remain unachieved at the end of the CAS period, as many initiatives were only getting off
the ground toward the end of the CAS period or beyond. In this regard, an important lesson
is that the use of a single Technical and Fiduciary Services Unit (TFSU) in support of the
aviation projects proved useful in the PIC6. The unit, based in Tonga, was able to combine
procurement packages for different countries and obtain more competitive pricing during
bidding than would be possible under individual contracts. They also provided technical
expertise that was unavailable to the participating countries, particularly in such areas as
aviation, procurement, and financial and contract management. The economies of scale
from the TFSU resulted in a lower implementation cost than stand-alone project manage-
ment units for individual projects. In several cases (involving aviation or marine fisheries,
for instance), the use of multi-country platforms was useful in addressing transaction
costs, both for the clients and the WBG, and capacity constraints.

The WBG’s performance in promoting macroeconomic and fiscal resilience through its
DPOs and coordinated budget support with other development partners has been sound.
The Bank has supported the DPO prior actions with extensive TA and good ASA. The Bank’s
DPOs have provided important government-led mechanisms under which policy develop-
ment support and budget support from development partners have been coordinated and
prioritized. In particular, the use of a single Joint Policy Action Matrix reduced the trans-
action costs imposed on the government and enabled close consultation and cooperation
among development partners, including, for example, by ensuring that the sector-specific
expertise of individual development partners can be best leveraged. The policy matrices
are developed jointly with other donors and have provided an important platform around
which to agree on the key reform priorities in the various countries. Most DPOs have also
leveraged co-financing with other donors, such as ADB, Australia and New Zealand, who
have played a strong role in the policy dialogue with the governments. The WBG’s joint
ADB/WBG liaison offices in Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga (and Vanuatu though it is not covered
by this CLR) are good examples of close collaboration with the other major development
bank in the region. This arrangement has in fact fully matured in the CLR period.

For DPO prior actions related to PFM, the Bank provided effective support in the form of
extensive TA (for example, in the case of procurement and debt management reforms) and
analytical work (for example, the Public Expenditure Review). The Bank also ensured that
the development objectives and associated reform actions of the proposed operations
were closely aligned with the priorities and strategic areas in the economic development
arena and the government’s own PFM reform agenda.

      The Bank found that adequate investment in policy dialogue is vital but resource intensive.
      Furthermore, close coordination and engagement with other development partners in the
      identification of policy priorities is useful in sectors where the Bank has limited knowledge
      and engagement. However, the experience with attempts to implement reforms in certain
      sectors (such as ICT in RMI) is a reminder of the difficulties of sector reforms and points
      to the need for a deeper assessment of political economy realities. Starting engagement
      in a country with a DPO (and one that focuses on a difficult reform area) may not be the
      best decision. The WBG may need to continue exploring ways to engage citizens in reform
      processes and designing engagements with broader support as ways to recalibrate its
      standard approach to the demands of relatively smaller countries while not underestimat-
      ing the significance of political economy issues.

      A major issue that affected several projects during preparation was the underestimation of
      costs, resulting in extensive administrative efforts to bring on additional finance. This is-
      sue came about in large measure because no history of comparable projects was available
      and also because contractors placed a “remoteness” premium on works to reflect the risks
      perceived in undertaking them. These issues will continue in the future and cannot be fully
      mitigated. Similarly, projects suffered from the lack of detailed implementation arrange-
      ments for procurement, legal clearances, staffing, contract administration, land acquisi-
      tion, and so on, which needed to be developed as part of project preparation. In-country
      capacity proved to be a continuing challenge. Projects could draw upon only a very small
      domestic population to meet local staffing needs, and often this pool of potential project
      staff lacked experience in donor projects. In Tuvalu, the PAIP program addressed this issue
      by training interns in skills that they could use on future development projects.

      The Bank did well by responding swiftly to requests from governments to provide coordi-
      nation, analytical, and financial support in a timely manner to assess the effects of dis-
      asters—the tsunami (Samoa and Tonga 2009), Cyclone Evan (Samoa 2012), Cyclone Ian
      (Tonga 2014), and Cyclone Pam (Tuvalu 2015)—and assist with recovery and reconstruc-
      tion. For example, the Bank fielded an identification mission within 10 days of the tsunami
      that hit Samoa. The Bank coordinated and facilitated two comprehensive multi-sectoral
      Post-Disaster Needs Assessments (PDNAs) following the tsunami and cyclone Evan to
      support Samoa in resource mobilization and recovery planning, and it conducted a rapid
      damage assessment following Cyclone Ian in Tonga. The Bank mobilized additional re-
      sources from its IDA Crisis Response Window for these unanticipated events and targeted
      the additional IDA resources to the key sectors affected as follows: US$10 million for a
      Samoa Post Tsunami Reconstruction Project (P120594); US$5 million for a Tonga Post
      Tsunami Reconstruction Project (P120595); US$10 million contribution to US$15 million
      Samoa Development Policy Operation (P144377); US$5 million contribution to a US$20
      million Samoa Enhanced Road Access Project (P145545); US$5 million for a Samoa Ag-
      riculture and Fisheries Cyclone Response Project (P145938); US$12 million for a Tonga
      Cyclone Ian Reconstruction and Climate Resilience Project (P150113); and US$3 million
      through a supplemental DPO for Tuvalu. Supervision was close and the task team provided
      counterpart staff with timely feedback on technical, procurement, and safeguard issues,
      facilitating fast decision-making and smooth implementation. The regular and consist-
      ent missions helped to build a collegial working relationship with counterpart officials and
      helped ensure that the project was implemented relatively smoothly and fully achieved its
      development objectives.

Partnerships and coordination with other donors and key development partners have been
fully pursued and utilized, particularly given the small-country contexts where any over-
laps are not only wasteful but potentially disruptive. WBG partnerships and collabora-
tion are a necessity in this congested environment, where ODA per capita is high, and the
WBG approach was exemplary: engaging in areas where it held comparative advantage
and could complement existing bilateral, multilateral, and regional partners; promoting
donor coordination; and accommodating small implementation capacities. What may
best epitomize donor coordination in the Pacific is the Pacific Region Infrastructure Fa-
cility (PRIF), a multi-agency mechanism coordinating the delivery of development assis-
tance from donors and development partners to the infrastructure sector in the Pacific
region. Through the PRIF, representatives of the Japan International Cooperation Agency
(JICA), WBG, ADB, EU, and European Investment Bank (EIB) meet on a quarterly basis to
exchange views on their respective programs, share knowledge, and agree on the financing
of pieces of analytical work and research that are requested by client countries and that
also contribute to the identification and justification of new donor-funded projects. At the
technical level, five sector working groups (Water, Energy, Urban, ICT, and Transport) also
meet every three months for technical discussions, often piggybacking on larger learning
events or summits.

Coordination exists both between multilaterals, and between multilaterals and bilaterals.
For example, in Kiribati, the Aviation Investment Project benefited greatly from the joint
work between the Bank team and the New Zealand High Commission in Tarawa, which
led to the resumption of a project that had been paralyzed for about a year. New Zealand
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) presence on the ground, combined with ad-
ditional funds from Wellington to bridge a financing gap, was instrumental in restarting
a Bank-funded project and creating the conditions required to meet the objectives of the
project.

      ALIGNMENT WITH WORLD BANK GROUP CORPORATE STRATEGY
      The country CLRs at the end of this annex provide discussions and examples of how the
      PIC6 CASs/CPSs are aligned with the WBG’s twin goals of reducing poverty and boosting
      shared prosperity. While the twin goals had not yet been articulated when some of these
      strategies were prepared, retrospective and brief reviews of the various WBG engage-
      ments indicate that the programs and results are indeed well aligned with the twin goals.
      Examples of that alignment are provided below; further details are in the individual CLRs.

      Extreme poverty is negligible in Tonga, but significant numbers live in hardship, and the
      country faces serious challenges in securing prosperity for all. The WBG program in Tonga
      supports the twin goals through a number of interventions. The Tonga Pacific Regional
      Connectivity Program has helped to reduce the cost of internet connectivity, which con-
      tributes in turn to reducing transaction costs for businesses, households, and the gov-
      ernment. It has also facilitated the development of new platforms for business and ser-
      vice delivery (in health and education, for example) and potentially new job opportunities
      (e-commerce, online work). The support for the Consumer Information Bureau improves
      access to finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which represent the largest
      source of employment in most PICs. The TERM Implementation Unit (TERM-IU), supported
      by the Bank-financed DPO, reduces the impact of volatility in prices of diesel, which in turn
      will reduce fluctuations in electricity prices. Lower and more stable energy prices reduce
      the share of household income required for energy needs, increasing households’ capacity
      to meet other basic needs and reducing their exposure to severe hardship during periods
      when energy imports are high.

      The improvements in the transport sectors under the Tonga Transport Sector Consolida-
      tion Project have created a domestic road construction industry, and are expected to have
      a significant positive impact for users of domestic transport in Tonga by providing more
      reliable access to markets and to education and health services, as well as by facilitat-
      ing tourism. Given the unique geographical characteristics of Tonga, air connectivity is
      a crucial economic enabler, delivering major benefits from the provision of services that
      support activities linked to tourism, trade of goods and services, investment, and remit-
      tances. These economic benefits from improved transport connectivity are essential for
      boosting shared prosperity.

      In education, the positive outcomes of Tonga Education Support Program (TESP) are
      strongly relevant to the twin goals of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity.
      The project promoted a practical, sustainable approach to participatory school-based
      management to improve access to education services for disadvantaged communities
      and make service providers more accountable to community members. The project also
      reduced the disparity in access to learning materials across schools: prior to the project,
      schools in poorer villages had few or no materials.

      While extreme poverty is very rare in Samoa, it is difficult to get a clear sense of the inci-
      dence and dynamics of basic needs poverty. The poorest 40 percent of Samoa’s population
      face significant spending constraints, and as a result they tend to rely heavily on publicly
      funded health and education services. Promoting the quality and accessibility of these
      services is critical to the welfare of the most vulnerable, and at the macroeconomic level
      this task hinges on the country’s capacity to maintain fiscal stability and rebuild buffers
                                                          Regional Partnership Framework        159




to insulate these social sector expenditures from external shocks. Through the DPOs, the
achievement of these objectives has been strengthened by Bank-supported reforms to
improve debt management, strengthen revenue collection, and ensure value-for-money
and transparency in public procurement. In the aftermath of Cyclone Evan, funds provided
under the 2013 DPO prevented cutbacks in the frontline service delivery that particularly
benefits the poor. Analytical advice and input provided by the Bank in ASA products (such
as the PER), along with the PFM engagement, have helped the government to maintain
expenditure on those public services that the poorest and most vulnerable tend to rely
upon the most.

The activities supporting the agriculture sector outcome will enable beneficiary farmers
to increase their productivity (yields) for selected vegetables that are in demand on the
local market. These activities are complemented by support to help farmers run a suc-
cessful commercial enterprise (for example, training in business planning) and connect
to local markets (including restaurants and hotels). By supporting farmers not only to
increase the productivity of fruit, vegetable, and animal production but to increase the
sales of their production and therefore incomes, the project is helping to reduce food and
income poverty. The project’s focus on farmers helps to add to wealth in rural areas, which
have historically lagged behind the urban center, thereby sharing prosperity across the
population. By measuring women’s participation in the project, the project team will be
able to assess whether benefits from the project (increased incomes for commercial farm-
ers and increased productivity for subsistence farmers) are being shared equitably across
the population.

The data collected through the World Bank’s impact evaluations of the Seasonal Worker
Program (SWP, Australia) and Recognized Seasonal Employer scheme (RSE, New Zealand)
suggest that these programs have opened up significant seasonal migration opportunities
to poor, rural households. The participation of poorer and more rural households in the pro-
gram suggests that these programs are reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity
in Samoa. To the extent that the TA provided by the World Bank has allowed Samoa to
maintain its numbers in these schemes (given program caps), the CPS program as imple-
mented has had a strong alignment with the twin goals.

Kiribati is the poorest of the PIC6, with the highest poverty rate. The country’s ability
to respond to climate risks is hampered by its highly vulnerable socioeconomic and geo-
graphical situation. In addition to strengthening resilience against climate change, WBG
projects will also be helping to reduce Kiribati’s vulnerability to external economic shocks,
such as food and fuel price increases. The proposed 516 kW grid-connected solar PV gen-
erator for South Tarawa will help diversify electricity generation and, with the help of the
energy project, assist the poor by leading to lower energy costs. The Kiribati Road Reha-
bilitation Project addresses the poor condition of the South Tarawa road network, which
disproportionately affects poor residents. To a certain extent, these improvements will
also address shared prosperity. A reliable network of air links, within and among island
countries and onwards to major hubs such as Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, and beyond, is
essential to dissipate the economic vulnerability of Kiribati by providing needed access to
employment, medical treatment, and education to reduce poverty and boost shared pros-
perity. The outcome on labor employment directly benefits poverty reduction and shared
prosperity, as employment places unemployed and largely unskilled laborers in a better
position to meet their basic needs and those of their families.

      The CPS for FSM is explicitly aligned with the WBG’s twin goals of eliminating extreme
      poverty by 2030 and encouraging shared prosperity, especially for the bottom 40 percent
      of the population. The CPS identified the need to build a stronger analytical and evidence
      base on poverty within FSM to best target resources to address particular needs. Accord-
      ingly, a PER and poverty/gender and Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES)
      and analysis were undertaken to fill information gaps and ensure that fiscal consolidation
      could be as pro-poor as possible in the two largest sectors of education and health. The
      poverty- and gender-disaggregated analysis complements the PER by enabling effective
      targeting of all public expenditures to ensure that the bottom 40 percent and the poorest
      segment of the population benefit from the programs.

      The results area related to improved targeting and management of the fiscal adjust-
      ment process is critical to supporting the RMI in its effort to reduce poverty and boost
      shared prosperity. With no monetary policy and limited fiscal policy (given the utilization
      of the US dollar and high aid dependence), RMI faces a critical imperative to ensure fiscal
      sustainability and build adequate assets to buttress the economy against the variety of
      shocks it faces. At the same time, ensuring adequate and equitable service delivery as
      programmed under the CPS is also critical for supporting the twin goals. Although the
      CPS was designed prior to the WBG’s adoption of the twin goals, the set of priorities and
      outcomes contained within the CPS reflects these objectives.

      The review of the FY12-15 Tuvalu CAS demonstrates that several of its strategies aligned
      well with achieving greater shared prosperity and reducing poverty, which is distributed
      unevenly in Tuvalu (despite its per capita income level). Only limited data on poverty are
      available to assess Tuvalu’s performance against the twin goals. The World Bank is en-
      gaged in a coordinated dialogue on this front, and a HIES should be completed in 2015/16.
      The programmatic series of operations for Tuvalu is designed to support the government’s
      development objectives and contribute to the improved wellbeing of Tuvaluans in both
      Funafuti and the outer islands. Reforms to strengthen PFM can help to improve poverty
      and social outcomes in Tuvalu indirectly by making the budget a more effective tool for re-
      sponding to national poverty and social needs. Reforms to improve revenue and expendi-
      ture efficiencies will enable the government to maintain a sustainable fiscal buffer, which
      in the medium term will ensure continued service provision even through periods of shock.
      Better management of both the overseas scholarship and medical treatment programs is
      expected to free scarce resources and allow the government to start rebalancing its ex-
      penditure in education (toward more equitable, employment-oriented vocational training)
      and to increase the expenditure on basic healthcare (on which poorer households depend
      heavily). The aviation sector is particularly important for these objectives, as it allows
      Tuvaluans to take advantage of international job and education opportunities while re-
      maining connected to and contributing to their country and the region. Full rehabilita-
      tion of critical air transport infrastructure and ancillary services is part of the program.
      Ensuring that Tuvaluans will continue to be employed overseas will contribute to the goal
      of reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity, particularly for the outer islands,
      where poverty rates are higher.
