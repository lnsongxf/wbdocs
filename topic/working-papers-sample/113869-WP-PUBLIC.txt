there was evidence in a number of CPFs that the
identification of key focus areas in the SCD had resulted in a
significant shift of emphasis in the World Bank Group
program. The guidance is clear that one-to-one alignment is
not expected between SCD and CPF priorities. One major
factor driving nonalignment was the government’s view of
where the World Bank should focus its support. Other
important factors were the weight of the ongoing program

CPF priorities, in general they did not do a good job of
explaining the reasons for the differences between the two.
The guidance on principles and possible criteria for priority
setting in SCDs needs to be sharpened, while recognizing that
CPFs may draw selectively on SCD priorities in the dialogue
with the government on strategic CPF priorities. Either a
more detailed text discussion or a brief annex providing a
more systematic explanation regarding all the identified
SCD priorities would be a useful addition to the current
CPF.

with their dependence on private sector demand, can often
make it difficult to identify their future operations.

CPFs are generally better at articulating World Bank Group

alignment between the actions proposed and indicators in
the results frameworks is still often weak. The recent gender

CPFs.

1. Introduction
Background and the Objectives of the New Model
The new World Bank Group strategy (World Bank Group 2013) aims to focus
country programs on accelerating progress toward sustainably reducing poverty
and building shared prosperity (the “twin goals”) in a sustainable manner. The
strategy sets two ambitious goals:

      End extreme poverty by reducing the percentage of people living on less than
       $1.90 a day (in 2011 purchasing power parity terms) to 3 percent by 2030.
      Promote shared prosperity by fostering income growth of the bottom 40
       percent of the population in a sustainable manner in every country.

To accomplish this, the World Bank Group would align all its activities and
resources to the twin goals; use its strengths as a global institution by supporting
clients in delivering development solutions; and work as “One World Bank Group”
by leveraging the strength of all constituent agencies (World Bank, International
Finance Corporation [IFC], and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
[MIGA]). The World Bank Group would strengthen the focus of its country
programs by developing a more evidence-based and selective country engagement
model in the context of country ownership and national priorities, and in
coordination with other development partners.

During the past 50 years, since country strategies were first introduced at the World
Bank Group by then–President Robert McNamara, they have evolved from internal
management tools to public documents that strive to be country-owned, results-
driven, and flexible. This evolution is described in appendix A. Briefly, in the initial
stage, individual lending operations were put in the context of the World Bank’s
program of country activities. The subsequent early country assistance strategies
(CASs) were World Bank-centric notes appended to loan documents. The
preparation of free-standing CAS documents for all active World Bank borrowers,
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) as well as
International Development Association (IDA), began in 1992. With the advent of
public disclosure in the late 1990s, the CAS process began to include consultations
with key stakeholders, and ultimately became the center of World Bank-government
interaction.

The early CASs focused mostly on World Bank products and activities. As they
evolved, they came to reflect more strategic engagement based on country

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
development goals, but in the process they became longer and more complex. Over
time, their focus also shifted from inputs to development results. Results-based
CASs were piloted between 2003 and 2005, and were mainstreamed after that. The
central innovation was the results framework, which specified links between the
World Bank’s interventions and long-term development goals (World Bank Group
2005).

In addition, in fiscal 2005 management established a four-year CAS cycle with a
midpoint progress report. It also introduced the Interim Strategy Note for use when
a full CAS could not be prepared, as typically happened in fragile or conflict-
affected situations, and it initiated the use of the CAS Completion Report, with
review and validation by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). Around this
time, the World Bank also adopted a new title for the documents—country
partnership strategy (CPS)—thought to better reflect a relationship with the country
client based on mutual learning and responsibility. As it evolved, the CAS/CPS
became more flexible, allowing World Bank teams to customize World Bank services
to the country’s own needs and priorities, as well as to changing circumstances. The
guidelines now also called for joint World Bank-IFC-MIGA documents in all
countries where there was substantial scope for collaboration and synergies in
private sector development activities.

CASs/CPSs were often implemented in uncertain environments, and thus were
subject to risks, and the documents would therefore have a section discussing the
main risks and what the World Bank intended to do in case a given risk
materialized. However, the 2009 retrospective of CASs (World Bank Group 2009)
noted that even when the risks were well and comprehensively articulated, it was
difficult to distinguish how the perceived risk had been addressed in the
development of the strategy, the instruments, and the choice of interventions. The
retrospective also pointed out that a CAS was expected to reflect the existing state of
country knowledge; the country program; dialogue with government, donors, and
others; and relationships with stakeholders.

The 2009 retrospective identified four shortcomings of the CASs/CPSs:

       There had often been tension between the World Bank’s sector and corporate
        objectives (such as for infrastructure, finance, and social security) and the
        country’s vision and priorities.
       Despite the emphasis on results, some CASs had still taken a transaction-
        focused approach instead of concentrating on more strategic objectives and
        expected development outcomes.
       The World Bank and IFC had not operated in unison in countries.

                                                                          INTRODUCTION
      The discussion of risks had been weak in many CASs, without explicit links
       between identified risks and the CAS program or without sufficient
       discussion of the ways in which risks would be managed.

Against this background, the new World Bank Group strategy recognized that while
the country programs were broadly aligned with the World Bank Group’s mission,
they needed to provide countries with more coordinated and focused programs, and
activities and interventions needed to be better prioritized according to their
expected impacts on the twin goals. To this end, the World Bank would build
country strategies based on a systematic diagnosis that identified paths and
priorities for a country to achieve the twin goals. The country strategies would build
on the alignment with a country’s own priorities and the World Bank Group’s
comparative advantages, working as the One World Bank Group, with each agency
adapting its specific business model to ensure maximum development impact.


The New Country Engagement Model
Accordingly, the World Bank Group would establish a more evidence-based and
selective country engagement model incorporating two instruments to enhance
country engagement, replacing the CAS/CSP. A new, analytical Systematic Country
Diagnostic (SCD) would use data and analytic methods to support country clients
and World Bank Group teams in identifying the most critical constraints to, and
opportunities for, reducing poverty and building shared prosperity sustainably,
while considering the voices of the poor and the views of the private sector. A
separate Country Partnership Framework (CPF), developed from the CAS/CSP,
would discuss focus areas for World Bank Group support, aligned with the
country’s own development agenda, and these areas were expected to be selected
primarily to address the key constraints and opportunities identified in the SCD.

The SCD would be prepared upstream from the CPF and would identify priority
areas for the country to accelerate progress toward achieving the twin goals in ways
that consider the sustainability of the program. The SCD would build on available
analysis and diagnostic work, with a focus on the twin goals and on identifying the
most critical, pressing actions, not on a comprehensive list of policy
recommendations. It would be prepared in consultation with national authorities,
the private sector, and other stakeholders, but would reflect the evidence and
analysis of the World Bank Group. It would become the reference point for client
consultations and help focus the country, the World Bank Group, and other
development partners on the goals with the greatest potential impact on achieving
the twin goals.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
The CPF has replaced the CAS/CSP as the main tool guiding the World Bank
Group’s support for member countries’ development programs. It maintains the
World Bank Group’s country-driven model and starts from the country’s vision of
its development goals as set out in its own strategy. The World Bank Group and the
country then further draw on the SCD, and together they develop the CPF
objectives, which will be derived from the country development goals that reflect
the World Bank Group’s comparative advantage and align with the twin goals, as
identified in the SCD. The new approach is expected to emphasize learning at all
stages. During implementation, the country and the World Bank Group are to
engage in a continuous process of monitoring and learning. Every two years, or at
the midpoint of the CPF period, a Performance and Learning Review (PLR) will be
used to adjust the program and to update the Board on progress. The PLR will be
used to flesh out details on development objectives and the activities necessary to
achieve those objectives that were not clear when the CPF was originally prepared
or last updated. At the end of the CPF period, a PLR may be used to extend the CPF
by up to two years, but no CPF may run for more than six years.

At the end of the CPF period, the World Bank Group will engage with the country to
complete a self-assessment and issue a Completion and Learning Review, which is
intended to serve as both a means to enhance the World Bank Group’s knowledge
and to increase development effectiveness and as a tool for accountability. As part of
the Completion and Learning Review, the country team will complete a self-
assessment of the program’s performance, World Bank Group performance, and how
well aligned the strategy was with the twin goals. The self-assessment will be based
on the results framework of the most recent PLR, and IEG will validate the World
Bank Group’s self-assessments and verify its findings.

Working as One World Bank Group—with intra-agency cooperation—is a central
part of the new strategy, and a new Regional Coordinating Mechanism has been
established under which World Bank Regional vice presidents, IFC Regional
directors, and the MIGA vice president will meet quarterly. In addition, there has
been regular co-chairing by the World Bank and IFC of reviews of SCDs and CPFs.
The World Bank Group is also expected to increase the number of joint projects and
to review its portfolio of products and services to improve synergies and eliminate
overlap. The CPF is also intended to improve the identification and managing of risks
to the World Bank Group program. To this end, the risk section takes a systematic
approach to risk, based on the Systematic Operations Risk-Taking Tool (SORT; World
Bank Group 2014), to ensure that teams consider all major risks to achieving CPF
objectives, as well as any unintended adverse consequences that may be associated with
the program. Teams are expected to identify risks and propose measures to manage or

                                                                            INTRODUCTION
mitigate them, and may also discuss the risks of not engaging in the proposed program,
thereby highlighting the program’s risk-reward trade-offs.


The IEG Evaluation
This evaluation is being undertaken at the request of the Board of Executive
Directors to provide information about how the SCD/CPF process is working and to
identify areas that can be strengthened to enhance country engagement during the
production of SCDs and CPFs. It is a real-time process evaluation, designed to
provide early evaluative input into the operationalization and rollout of the new
country engagement model. Given that the new CPFs are only now being approved,
IEG clearly does not have country-level implementation results from the new
country engagement model. Instead, it has relied on evidence on steps taken to
produce SCDs and CPFs, both from desk reviews and field visits.

The evaluation has three objectives:

      To explore whether the guidelines, directives, and other resource materials
       related to the new country engagement process have thus far helped World
       Bank Group teams produce SCDs and CPFs that are focused on helping
       countries to tackle key constraints to poverty reduction and shared prosperity
       in accordance with the World Bank Group’s comparative advantage, and
       whether they have fostered coordination among the World Bank Group
       institutions.
      To provide the Board and management with early information about the
       functioning of the SCD/CPF process and the extent to which the
       shortcomings related to the previous processes have been addressed, so that
       changes can be made to improve the process.
      To identify good practice examples and lessons learned thus far.

To this end, the evaluation has focused on four dimensions for each SCD and CPF
(see appendix B for a detailed discussion of the evaluation methodology). For the
SCD, these include the evidence basis and framing of the issues, growth, poverty,
shared prosperity, and sustainability; identification of priorities for achieving the
twin goals; and process and World Bank Group integration. For the CPF, the
dimensions include alignment with country development priorities and the twin
goals, and sustainability; country ownership, selectivity, realism, and systematic

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
The evaluation questions are designed to explore the extent to which the new
country engagement model enhances selectivity and World Bank Group
coordination in establishing evidence-based country priorities that are aligned with
the twin goals. The core evaluation questions are:

       Has the SCD identified priorities in a convincing analytical way that helped
        design a program of selective interventions under the CPF?
       Has the CPF designed a program of lending and knowledge activities that
        aligns (not necessarily one-to-one) with country priorities and opportunities
        identified in the SCD and that makes the best use of World Bank Group
        resources and comparative advantage, including joint World Bank-IFC-MIGA
        projects where appropriate? Has the new country engagement model fostered
        country ownership, realism, and selectivity?
       Did the SCD and CPF teams have the necessary and appropriate products,
        systems, and resources, and was this new model helpful in integrating the
        work of the three institutions, in coordinating with global practices and cross-
        cutting solutions areas (CCSAs), and with interactions with government
        authorities and other key stakeholders?

The evaluation included desk reviews—using a systematic, detailed template—of all
the first 22 CPFs (cutoff, end of April 2016) discussed at the Board and their
associated SCDs, and thus with completed initial engagement cycles.1 These are
shown in appendix C. (That appendix also shows information for the SCDs and
CPFs completed by end of November 2016, outside of the evaluation time frame.)
All Regions were covered, with reasonable representation of both IBRD and IDA
borrowers, but with only one country for the Middle East and North Africa Region
and two each for South Asia and East Asia and Pacific. This analysis was
complemented and validated by meetings with task team leaders, World Bank
managers, and Regional chief economists, and by in-depth visits to 10 countries—2
per Region, except for the Middle East and North Africa Region and South Asia (1
each), due to their low number of completed initial engagement cycles. The missions
had interviews with governments; other development partners; other in-country
stakeholders, including representatives of civil society; and World Bank Group
managers and staff. In doing these assessments, the evaluation team took
appropriate note of World Bank guidance documents and any modifications over
time in the SCD and CPF processes, and also drew on other appropriate IEG
validation, evaluation, and learning products.

Evaluation Limitations. The evaluation covers the first 22 SCDs and CPFs (based on
timing of the CPFs). This is the full universe of products up to the cutoff date of end
of April 2016, and a reasonable number of documents to review, with 22 careful

desk reviews for each document and 10 field visits. The most important limitations
of the exercise are that as an early, real-time formative evaluation, it could not
establish the extent to which the new approach is delivering higher-impact
development results in pursuit of the twin goals. Thus, it could not assess the
realism of forecasts, plans, and expectations against actual developments and could
not assess the quality and contributions of applications of PLRs and Completion and
Learning Review.

Organization of the report. The rest of the report is organized into four chapters.
Chapter 2 provides a response to the first evaluation question: Has the SCD
identified priorities in a convincing analytical way that helped design a program of
selective interventions under the CPF? Chapter 3 summarizes the findings on CPFs.
Chapter 4 provides a response to the third question: Did the SCD and CPF teams
have the necessary and appropriate products, systems, and resources, and was this
new model helpful in integrating the work of the three institutions, in coordinating
with global practices and CCSAs, and with interactions with government authorities
and other key stakeholders? The concluding chapter summarizes the key findings
and provides recommendations for the strengthening of the new country
engagement model.

2. The Systematic Country Diagnostic
Background
The SCD was introduced under the 2013 World Bank Group strategy to enhance
(together with the CPF) the World Bank Group’s country engagement model. The
purpose of the new SCD instrument, according to a corporate directive (World Bank
Group 2014c), is to inform the strategic dialogue between the World Bank Group
and its clients about priority areas for engagement. It is a diagnostic exercise
conducted by the World Bank Group in close consultation with national authorities,
the private sector, civil society, and other stakeholders.

To this end, the SCD is expected to

       present a systematic assessment of the constraints the country has to address
        and the opportunities it can embrace to accelerate progress toward achieving
        the twin goals, not limited to areas or sectors where the World Bank Group is
        currently active or where it expects immediate country demand;
       discuss thoroughly the drivers of poverty reduction and shared prosperity,
        taking into account environmental, social, and economic sustainability;
       identify a set of priority areas in which follow-up actions could most
        effectively and sustainably achieve the twin goals; and
       serve as the analytical foundation and the reference point for consultations
        when developing the CPF (World Bank Group 2015).1

Further guidelines (World Bank Group 2014a) and guidance (World Bank Group
2014b) have indicated that the Country Management Unit (CMU) will select the
World Bank task team leader(s), who will have integrative and analytical skills. Task
teams are expected to draw on expertise across global practices and across the World
Bank Group. All SCDs are to be joint World Bank Group products, with IFC
participating more extensively in countries where it has a deeper presence and
country knowledge, and MIGA represented by the relevant Regional economist. The
guidelines foresee a robust and contestable review process for the SCDs, chaired by
IFC and the World Bank. All SCDs are to be approved by World Bank, IFC, and
MIGA managements. The final SCDs are disclosed in accordance with the access to
information policies of the three institutions.

                                                      THE SYSTEMATIC COUNTRY DIAGNOSTIC

Evidence Base and Framing of the Issues
IEG reviewed 22 SCDs.2 For a few of the very early documents there were modest
variations in approach or treatment that could be ascribed to their being first, but
there were no systematic differences between these and the subsequent bulk of
reviewed SCDs. A majority of SCDs reviewed (13 of the 22) provide a strong basis
for identifying the main issues, opportunities, and challenges the countries face in
achieving the twin goals. Seven other SCDs were judged acceptable, and only two
were assessed as having significant weaknesses in the evidence base or framing of
the issues, in one case due to a lack of systematic identification of knowledge gaps
and an excessive number of identified priorities, in the other because some
potentially important issues were not discussed.

Most SCDs do a good job of synthesizing the main issues and constraints facing their
respective countries, with a variety of evidence-based analyses. For example,
Uruguay’s SCD analyzed the challenges facing its growth model based on global
market expansion, wage increases aimed at lowering income inequality, and
progressive expansion of a welfare system. Costa Rica’s SCD benchmarked the
country against Latin America in terms of poverty reduction and shared prosperity,
analyzing trends in growth, poverty, and rising inequality. Panama’s SCD provided
a detailed analysis of poverty and factors contributing to growth, and its
inclusiveness and sustainability. The reports generally benefited from analytical
work by the World Bank and other organizations, in some cases providing for useful
cross-country comparisons, particularly for larger countries.

In a few cases, special analytical frameworks were used or developed to examine
key variables concerning economic growth and poverty. Thus, the Azerbaijan SCD
used an asset-based approach to frame the issues of growth and distribution. For the
El Salvador SCD, the country team commissioned a computable general equilibrium
model to shed light on the mechanisms through which competitiveness,
international trade, and prices are affected by remittances. And the Chad SCD used
a computable general equilibrium model to analyze a set of policy options, focusing
on growth and job creation in specific sectors.

SCDs depend heavily on available analytical material and data (World Bank
Group 2014a), and most of the analytical underpinnings come from the World
Bank’s own work, although some of the SCDs also used external work by donors or
governments (Albania and Mali are two examples). Going forward, such examples
could be used to encourage broader use of outside analytical work. The guidance
asks that teams identify gaps in data required for analysis of the progress achieved
and the projected requirements for meeting the twin goals, that they be discussed in


                                                                                       9

the SCD, and that the CPF indicate the support that the World Bank Group will offer
to help fill these gaps.

Many SCDs identified knowledge gaps that could be addressed to improve the
evidence base for future policy making; this was a useful input for the analytical
agendas in the CPFs. The most frequently reported knowledge gaps concern labor
markets, growth and productivity, and access and quality of basic services. The gaps
in data (most often regarding household surveys, firm-level surveys, and labor force
data) inevitably meant that some SCDs suffered from weaknesses in the
presentation of current realities and analysis of the future needs for achieving the
twin goals. The evaluation identified two SCDs as good practice examples of the
treatment of data gaps. The SCD for the Arab Republic of Egypt (see box 2.1)
identified steps needed to fill existing knowledge gaps, such as the need for
improved monitoring systems and experimentation with new antipoverty programs.
The Myanmar SCD clearly outlined data concerns and knowledge gaps, with plans
for addressing them. (The World Bank was not engaged in Myanmar during the
period leading up to the SCD, and thus there had been no opportunity to improve
the country’s data situation.)


 Box 1.1. Egypt’s Need for Stronger Poverty Data and Analysis
 Some of the evidence base for the critical elements of the analysis—concerning poverty
 and shared prosperity, macroeconomic analysis, and the private sector’s role in economic
 growth and job creation—is not sufficiently strong or current. The SCD attempts to
 present up-to-date analyses of macroeconomic conditions, poverty, and poverty
 distribution, but it only partially succeeds due to the lack of recent, good-quality poverty
 data, mainly related to some methodological differences between staff of the World Bank
 and their country counterparts on the use and interpretation of household survey data
 since the revolution of 2010–11. In part because of data issues, some important knowledge
 gaps have emerged. The SCD argues the need for establishing reliable systems of data
 collection, both quantitative and qualitative, across key social sectors (and the report
 questions the results of the government’s household income and expenditure surveys).
 However, in addition to the knowledge gaps identified in the SCD, there are other
 important analytic gaps. For instance, given the country’s current macroeconomic
 difficulties and the World Bank Group’s sizable program in support of the country’s
 ambitious reform program, there is an urgent need to prepare an in-depth
 macroeconomic and fiscal analysis or a Public Expenditure Review, and to prepare a
 much-needed poverty assessment (the first in seven years). IEG has been informed that
 these two products have now been programmed.

Growth, Poverty and Shared Prosperity, and Sustainability
Most SCDs satisfactorily analyzed the drivers of economic growth and their impact
on poverty and shared prosperity over time, capitalizing on analytic work at the
World Bank and elsewhere. Only one country (Côte d’Ivoire) was assessed as
marginally unsatisfactory in this dimension, with limited data availability
undermining the comprehensiveness of the growth, poverty, and sustainability
analysis. In the other SCDs, patterns of growth were discussed, and factors
contributing to poverty reduction were analyzed, such as agricultural growth in
Uganda, hydrocarbons in Azerbaijan and Bolivia, diamond revenues in Botswana,
and tourism in Maldives—together with appropriate macroeconomic policies.

The identification of opportunities for economic growth was the strongest among
the dimensions and subdimensions explored. A number of SCDs argued for shifts in
prevailing growth models or identified growth potential. For example, the SCD for
Albania calls for a shift from the consumption-driven growth model fueled by
transfers to a more sustainable, equitable, and export-driven model based on the
more effective use of domestic assets. Similarly, growth analyses for Azerbaijan,
Bolivia, and Colombia argue that recent growth models, based on commodity
exports that depend for their success on an exceptional external environment that is
unlikely to be sustained in the longer term, require transition. In Bolivia, transition is
needed to a model based on stronger levels of private investment and advances in
productivity; in Azerbaijan, to one based on private sector development supported
by effective public sector governance and institutions and greater connectivity; and
in Colombia, to one addressing institutional constraints, while improving
infrastructure and productivity. In general, emerging challenges identified in the
countries reviewed relate to a less supportive external environment and the need to
address domestic bottlenecks.

The analysis of poverty and shared prosperity was the second-strongest among all
dimensions and subdimensions. The impact of economic growth on the poor has
been analyzed extensively, with focus on the drivers of poverty reduction, such as
job creation and labor income, social assistance programs, and equality of
opportunity in education and health. Changing trends in poverty incidence have
been identified, both in monetary and nonmonetary dimensions, with an emphasis
on the vulnerability of the poor across gender, ethnic, and minority groups and
rural/urban dichotomies. The poverty analysis is frequently accompanied by
regional and international comparisons. However, a number of countries suffered
from outdated data and poverty analyses (of the five countries reviewed in the
Africa Region, only Uganda had updated data and analyses). The role of social
assistance programs has been analyzed in a number of reports as a factor in


                                                                                       11
CHAPTER 2
THE SYSTEMATIC COUNTRY DIAGNOSTIC
addressing poverty. For example, in Haiti, private transfers and international aid
have contributed to decreasing poverty; in Panama, government transfers have had
the biggest role in poverty reduction in rural areas; and in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Botswana, and Honduras, social assistance programs have been important.

Appropriate focus was given to the analysis of shared prosperity and the poorest 40
percent of the population, but generally without in-depth quantitative analysis. In
some countries (Bolivia and Botswana), growth was found to be associated with
reduced inequality, while in others (Indonesia, the Maldives) it was associated with
increased inequality (see box 2.2). Reports usually analyzed the factors contributing
to changes in income inequality, with emphasis on vulnerable groups in society. For
very poor countries, there may be little point in analyzing separately the poorest 40
percent, since poverty rates may exceed that number. For example, 60 percent of
Haiti’s population remains poor, in Bangladesh the poverty rates are still high
enough for the twin goals to largely overlap, in Mali the incidence of dollar-a-day
poverty exceeds 40 percent of the population, and in Uganda 30 percent of the
population is in extreme poverty. In such cases, SCD analysis of overall poverty
reduction supersedes the focus on the poorest 40 percent. In most countries,
however, focusing also on the poorest 40 percent remains relevant.


 Box 2.2. Impact of Economic Growth on the Poor in Indonesia
 The SCD finds that commodity-fueled economic growth led to massive job creation in
 2001–12, especially in the services sector, and particularly in urban areas. While job
 creation helped reduce poverty (more than halving it to 11.3 percent by 2014), it did not
 reduce vulnerability, because most of the new jobs were in low-productivity sectors
 where real wages remained stagnant for the bottom 40 percent of the wage distribution
 during 2001–14. Widening wage disparities have added to the increase in overall
 inequality. Limited workers’ protection (nearly 80 percent of total employment is
 potentially vulnerable, and women tend to be more vulnerable than men due to
 differences in job status) leave many Indonesians vulnerable to shocks and add to rising
 inequality, undermining recent welfare gains and shared prosperity. The bottom 40
 percent has benefited far less from economic growth than the rest, and the Gini coefficient
 increased by almost 12 percentage points during 2000–13, from 30 to 42 (the latter is likely
 higher). Indonesia’s shared prosperity record is poor compared with other countries in
 the Region. The SCD identifies education as a key factor in explaining inequality in
 Indonesia, and the most important factor enabling upward mobility. Other factors
 identified as contributing to inequality are the distribution of capital-asset ownership and
 the decline of labor’s share of national income. Overall, a third of inequality is due to
 inequality of opportunity (circumstances that children are born into).

                                                           THE SYSTEMATIC COUNTRY DIAGNOSTIC
Factors contributing to changes in inequality were identified. For example, in
Uruguay, reductions in inequality were associated with reductions in school fees,
progressive fiscal policies, and wage increases. In Indonesia, inequality of
opportunity and education were key factors in increases in inequality. In the
Maldives, an increase in inequality was attributed to limited job opportunities. In
Costa Rica, increases in inequality (which was low by regional standards)
underscore a large deficit in human capital.

Fiscal, environmental, and social sustainability aspects were adequately addressed
in all countries except Mali and Côte d’Ivoire. In these cases, important issues were
not always given equal attention. For example, in Mali the focus was on social and
political stability, but much less so on climate change. Social sustainability was
generally addressed well (for example, in El Salvador it was linked to high levels of
crime and violence). Environmental sustainability and/or climate change were
addressed well or adequately in 19 of the 22 reviewed SCDs, and such issues were
listed among the identified priorities in 18 SCDs. Vulnerabilities were identified, and
special factors in the economy were analyzed (Bolivia’s ethnic diversity, for
example).

Threats to social and political stability were well analyzed for Chad, where despite
overall reductions in poverty, the average income of the bottom 35 percent has fallen,
as well as for Uruguay, where issues of an aging population combined with a policy
focus on equity and a large middle class. However, not all SCDs—across the risk
spectrum—provided a sufficiently robust analysis and identification of relevant social
or political risks. The Indonesia SCD, for example, appeared to underplay the
significance of rapid urbanization, increased inequality, and the impact of slower
economic growth on social stability.



 Box 2.3. Indonesia’s Prioritization Process
 The SCD identified numerous reforms under three broad priority areas: economic growth
 and jobs, access to key services and opportunities for all, and natural resource
 management and environmental sustainability. These three priority areas are supported
 by cross-cutting prerequisites: domestic revenue mobilization and governance
 reforms. Reforms have been prioritized based on impact (evidence-based),
 complementarity/synergy, sequencing, and feasibility. While the process methodology is
 elaborate, the large number of high-priority and transformational policies identified,
 particularly when added to the cross-cutting prerequisites, however appropriate,
 weakens the argument of addressing the most critical issues in prioritizing transformative
 policies. The great number of priorities identified (24) dilutes their potential impact. No
 effort has been made to discuss systematically the synergies among the many priorities.



                                                                                           13
CHAPTER 2
THE SYSTEMATIC COUNTRY DIAGNOSTIC

Identification of Priorities for Achieving the Twin Goals
All SCDs identified priorities for achieving the twin goals. Yet identification of
priorities was the weakest of the four dimensions assessed. There was significant
variability among country teams in the methodology developed or applied to derive
priorities and on the number and nature of priorities identified. These were often at a
high level of generality—areas to be addressed rather than specific actions to be taken.
For some countries, priorities were specific and limited in number (six priority areas
in Chad, five in Panama, two broad priorities with eight actions in Uruguay). In
others, numerous priorities were identified (24 in Indonesia, see box 2.3; and 8 priority
areas and 36 actions in Uganda). Identifying a large number of priorities goes against
the expectation that an SCD would identify the most critical, pressing actions, and
can easily undermine attention and impact. The focus on priority areas is reasonable
if there is follow-up to define more specific policy actions through analytic work and
as part of the policy dialogue.

Some SCD task team leaders (as in Bolivia and Uganda) indicated that they received
conflicting instructions on the degree of specificity of the selection process and did
not get clear guidance from management on how to prioritize among competing
inputs (including those from various global practices and CCSAs). Also, some SCDs
discussed policies and policy alternatives (as in Indonesia), whereas others focused
largely on broader structural issues. As mentioned earlier, different methodologies
were used to identify priorities, some quite sophisticated or complex (in Azerbaijan,
Chad [box 2.4], and Indonesia). Consultative processes often were used to help
select priorities. While recognizing that one size does not fit all, clearer guidance is
needed on how to identify key priorities in the SCDs. In general, documents did not
provide any ordering of the identified priorities on the basis of their impact on the
twin goals (except for Botswana and Chad)—this is not a problem if the list of
priorities is clearly selective, focused, and well argued.


 Box 2.4. Use of Analytic Approaches in the Selection of Priorities in the Chad SCD
 The SCD uses a computable general equilibrium model to identify policy options focused
 on growth and job creation in “poor-intensive sectors.” One set of options relates to
 raising agricultural productivity. A second set is based on a decline in oil receipts and the
 need to develop new export markets to sustain economic growth. A third set looks at
 improving the efficiency of public service delivery through governance reforms. These
 reforms could reduce poverty by about 3 percentage points by 2030—from 29 percent to
 26 percent. (This is one of the few examples of quantified projections of possible impacts
 in the SCDs.) The SCD then looks at the potential impact of cash transfers to protect
 against shocks and speed the pace of poverty reduction. It discusses various types of
 social safety nets, including labor-intensive public works. The SCD uses a tailored version

                                                                                     CHAPTER 2
                                                             THE SYSTEMATIC COUNTRY DIAGNOSTIC
 of the Rodrik-Haussmann growth diagnostic framework to identify the binding
 constraints to achieving the two core poverty reduction approaches—growth in the
 agriculture sector and income transfers to the poor. This results in the identification of 15
 constraints. The SCD then uses a decision tree with a set of filters to identify the
 constraints that meet key criteria: short-term impact, political feasibility, implementation
 capacity, affordability, evidence base, and complementarities.


The high-level nature of priorities identified in most SCDs meant that there often
was no clear discussion of the paths that could lead from interventions to the
desired result, although such paths were discussed for Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Egypt,
Indonesia, Panama, and Uruguay with clear constraints to achieving the twin goals
and the corresponding set of policy priorities. Most reports did not quantify their
aspirations for economic growth, poverty reduction, or shared prosperity.

Governance was highlighted in most SCDs as a cross-cutting theme or prerequisite
for achieving the twin goals. It was candidly discussed in the SCDs for Myanmar
(box 2.5) and Indonesia. In the latter case, governance was seen as a factor leading to
the overexploitation of natural resources, land rights, and allocation issues, and the
SCD prioritized reforms to improve policy recommendations, project
implementation, and transparency, as well as to increase user participation and
sustainability of investments. However, a clear approach to governance was missing
in some SCDs. A number of the SCDs could also have benefited from more
systematic cross-country governance comparisons.


 Box 2.5. Treatment of Governance in Myanmar
 The SCD presents a candid picture of governance issues, including a history of cronyism
 and military control; lack of transparency, particularly with natural resource extraction
 and associated revenues; armed conflict in certain areas; limited institutional capacity; a
 weak Public Finance Management Project; and lack of Environmental and Social Impact
 Assessment requirements and environmental/social regulations pertaining to natural
 resource extraction. It also mentions public sector capacity constraints in certain areas, but
 points out the need for more in-depth understanding of capacity constraints in each sector
 and for a better understanding of the impact of politics on decision making within the
 bureaucracy.



Process and One World Bank Group
IEG assessed the internal World Bank Group processes for SCD preparation and review
and implementation of the One World Bank Group concept as less robust than the
more substantive areas evaluated, though still satisfactory. Internal processes typically


                                                                                                 15
CHAPTER 2
THE SYSTEMATIC COUNTRY DIAGNOSTIC
started with country team brainstorming meetings, and continued through the concept
note to the Regional Operation Committee (ROC) decision review meeting, which
usually resulted in numerous constructive, high-quality comments from different parts
of the World Bank Group. The corporate review process was broadly satisfactory,
enhancing the quality of reports. The global practices were heavily engaged in the
processes, both through participation in the large country teams and through formal
review meetings. however, task team leaders interviewed by IEG indicated that the
engagements with the global practices could be complex. in some cases, the global
practices went beyond reasonable and expected advocacy to enlist senior management
to press their case. Some task teams also mentioned pressure from the CMUs to align
their diagnoses with aspects of ongoing or planned programs. Occasionally, peer
reviewers were engaged in the discussion of SCDs (Haiti, Uganda). Task team leaders
indicated that they had good access to the requisite corporate guidance when they
required clarification of the guidelines and procedures.

The One World Bank Group approach systematically brought together the World
Bank, IFC, and MIGA during concept review, document preparation, and the review
process, with the intention to improve strategic directions through the SCDs and
bring the full range of World Bank Group expertise to bear on country analysis. The
approach has fostered multisectoral consultations between the World Bank and IFC,
with the latter providing analyses of private sector issues and prospects in some cases.
IFC’s role in promoting corporate governance and improved labor and working
conditions has also provided useful additional perspectives to the analysis in some
SCDs. Also, its short industry notes for several SCDs facilitated the prioritization
process there, and also in the subsequent CPFs (Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador, Haiti,
and Panama). In the Albania and Indonesia SCDs and CPFs, IFC led and moderated
consultations with the private sector.

SCDs are written by World Bank staff, with inputs and comments from IFC. World
Bank task team leaders generally found considerable IFC engagement in the SCD
processes, despite institutional challenges and different operational modalities.
Nevertheless, IFC’s contributions in the final document may appear modest because
of a decision to focus on high-priority activities, it has a small presence, or where there
is limited private sector interest. MIGA’s small size, lack of country presence,
operational model, or strategic considerations often did not allow for its extensive
participation in the process.

A related review of the treatment of private sector development (PSD) issues in SCDs
found that the assessment of PSD constraints and opportunities was World Bank-
centric, analyzed mostly from the policy perspective, and lacked business-oriented
analysis of the private sector and what it needs to contribute to growth and the twin

goals (see appendix G). The heavy public sector tilt in the assessment of PSD
constraints and opportunities also reflects the World Bank’s lead role in drafting
SCDs. IFC team leaders for the SCDs considered their contributions as “inputs” rather
than as the basis for fresh thinking about the needs and opportunities for private
sector growth. Perhaps as a result, the IFC programs comprise primarily the standard
package of finance for small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) and skill training.
Private sector analyses in the SCDs need to move toward a more business-oriented
and granular analysis of a country’s private sector, which could selectively provide
background on the structure and composition of a business sector, differentiating the
industry-specific constraints and opportunities according to the types and sizes of
business enterprises.

In consultations with stakeholders, at the stage of early dialogue, teams often took time
to explain the purpose, nature, and desired outcomes of the process and the product.
Box 2.6 describes a good example (Albania) of an extensive consultation process.
Some stakeholders expressed their appreciation to IEG for the participatory process,
while in other countries some stakeholders (aside from government authorities)
would have liked to see greater interaction and feedback. SCDs normally benefited
from but did not report on comments received from stakeholders. In Haiti, the World
Bank sponsored a competition of academic papers to foster research and debate, as
well as to identify issues that might have been overlooked. In some cases, government
interference with the consultation processes caused some delays and may have
compromised their quality (Azerbaijan and Bolivia), while probably affecting how the
World Bank presented its identified priorities only at the margin.

A number of the reports discussed elements of the government’s strategic priorities,
but usually without in-depth analysis. In some cases, the SCDs were developed in
parallel with preparation of a new government strategy or medium-term
development plan. In Albania and Azerbaijan, country teams viewed this as a
decided plus, enabling a meeting of minds about development priorities and
enabling the World Bank to play a role at the formative stage of the government’s
thinking. In other cases, however, the government felt strongly that it wanted an
opportunity to develop its strategy independently of the World Bank’s analysis, and
then to engage in a dialogue comparing the two approaches.


 Box 2.6. Albania’s Consultation Process
 A notable feature of the process in Albania was the team’s careful attention to ownership
 through consultation with a wide range of national stakeholders at all stages of SCD
 development and a systematic effort to provide participants with feedback. A second
 round of consultations with national stakeholders and external partners was conducted in



                                                                                         17
CHAPTER 2
THE SYSTEMATIC COUNTRY DIAGNOSTIC
     late 2014 following completion of the draft report, around the time of the ROC discussion.
     The consultations appear to have enhanced the broad ownership base of the document by
     informing and guiding discussions and engaging representatives of different population
     groups on priorities for World Bank Group support. The two-round consultation design
     also allowed the second round of consultations (with a large overlap of participation in
     the two rounds) to serve as a feedback mechanism regarding comments and suggestions
     from the first round.

 The Panama SCD, for example, was prepared a few months before a new
government was able to complete its own strategy and the government felt that, as a
result, it was not in a position to engage sufficiently with the World Bank in this
process. In El Salvador, the SCD was prepared in parallel with the preparation of the
government’s five-year plan, with substantial interaction with the World Bank. On
the positive side, there was cross-fertilization between the World Bank and the
government in the development of priorities, but there was not enough time for the
government to absorb the World Bank’s findings or integrate them into its own
priorities. In addition, some World Bank task team leaders expressed concern that a
parallel process could lead to questioning whether the SCD reflects the World
Bank’s own views on development priorities. Clearly the optimal timing of the SCD
relative to the development of the government’s own strategy needs to be
determined for each country context and through close consultation with the
national authorities.

The SCD documents often break new analytical ground for a country, which gives
them a significant public good aspect. All SCDs have been made publicly available by
the World Bank Group, in some cases with a time lag. A number of development
partners noted the usefulness of the SCDs for the formulation of their own country
programs. Stakeholders in the Azerbaijan government noted the importance of the
SCD in introducing the concept of shared prosperity into domestic policymaking and,
in Uruguay, the SCD was seen as a public good, leading to its broader dissemination.
However, IEG’s consultations with stakeholders also indicate significant weaknesses
in the extent to which the SCD is shared and discussed, with a considerable number of
stakeholders not having seen or read the reports, even when they were made publicly
available on the World Bank website and/or had been translated from English.

The SCD, beyond its function as an input to the CPF, provides an important
opportunity to help engender debate and to define an agenda for strategic dialogue
on key development issues in a country, and thus also to enhance broader country
ownership. It is therefore important for the World Bank Group to engage
systematically in the dissemination of this report beyond meeting its own disclosure
requirements—and much of that dissemination can be done at moderate or little cost.
Plans for dissemination beyond disclosure need to be part of the SCD process from

the start, in support of the World Bank Group strategic dialogue and to enhance
broader country ownership around key development priorities.

Overall, the analysis did not find any systematic differences between SCDs for IBRD
and IDA countries (listed in appendix C, table C.3), although the average ratings
tended to be slightly lower for the IDA countries for most categories. Data
availability was more of a constraint for the SCDs in IDA countries, but teams
typically found ways around this issue, including looking for outside information
sources. One notable difference is that the focus for many IDA countries is on
poverty rather than shared prosperity, due to the large percentages of the poor in
many of these countries.


Emerging Messages
Overall, the new SCD instrument has been a useful addition. For the most part, this
first round of SCDs has synthesized the main issues and constraints for a country
well, with a variety of evidence-based analyses. This instrument clearly reflects the
World Bank Group’s comparative advantage, given the depth of its country
experience, broad engagement, and analytic depth relative to other stakeholders and
development partners. The SCDs have been well received both inside and outside of
the World Bank Group, including by governments and other donors.

Internally, the preparation of the first batch of SCDs has been a learning experience.
The internal processes have been broadly satisfactory, with numerous consultations
within the World Bank at various stages of SCD preparation and review. The
corporate reviews have helped enhance the quality of reports, while underlining
and supporting the One World Bank Group approach. Integrating the work of
multiple global practices with that of CMUs in the preparation of the SCDs has
sometimes caused (manageable) friction.

The One World Bank Group approach has created the impetus for greater
integration of the World Bank, IFC, and (more selectively) MIGA, with positive
initial results. However, this integration needs to be broadened beyond countries
where IFC and (in a few cases) MIGA currently have major engagements. The
treatment of the private sector in economic growth and poverty reduction has
become more prominent than in previous CAS/CPS documents.

SCDs depend heavily on the available analytical material and data. It is therefore
important that future SCDs explicitly address knowledge gaps and data limitations,
and that these issues be picked up in the CPFs.



                                                                                     19
CHAPTER 2
THE SYSTEMATIC COUNTRY DIAGNOSTIC
All SCDs have identified priorities for achieving the twin goals, but with significant
variability between country teams on methodology, number of priorities, and
degree of specificity, although mostly at a high level of generality. The World Bank
Group guidance for priority setting could be improved to encourage more consistent
approaches around a limited number of priorities.

An important conclusion of this assessment is that the SCD should be seen as
transcending its purpose as an input to the CPF, assisting strategic dialogue with
key stakeholders and with an important public good dimension. This underlines the
need for proactive dissemination.

3. The Country Partnership Framework
Background
Unlike the SCD, the CPF is a well-established World Bank product. Nevertheless, the
new engagement model requires some modifications to the traditional CAS/CPS. The
model builds on the SCD’s analysis of the country priorities for the achievement of the
twin goals: accelerating progress toward sustainably reducing poverty and boosting
shared prosperity. The CPF identifies areas within the SCD’s framework of constraints
and priority actions where the World Bank program can most effectively support the
government’s own priorities. This explicit link between the World Bank program and
the achievement of the twin goals is a departure from the more generalized support to
growth and poverty reduction that framed the CAS/CPS programs. Another
innovation in the new model is the emphasis on integrating the World Bank, IFC, and
MIGA as One World Bank Group in the results chain linking operations to the
achievement of the defined objectives. In addition, the SORT was adopted for use in
CPFs.1

The World Bank, IFC, and MIGA issued a guidance note (World Bank Group 2014)
on developing CPF products for World Bank Group engagement with member
countries. An important focus of this evaluation was to assess whether the guidance
provided was adequate, well understood, and implemented.

THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK
Bank Group’s comparative advantages. These are shown in a graphic in the
guidance note, suggesting that the Group’s objectives are a subset of those that meet
all three criteria (figure 3.1). Most CPFs referred to these criteria, and some provided
a discussion of each of them. In practice, there was clearly also a fourth criterion—
the priorities reflected in the World Bank Group’s ongoing operations program—
whether or not these were consistent with the other criteria.

Alignment with the SCD. Aligning the program priorities of the CPF to the constraints
and priority areas identified in the SCD is challenging. The SCD and CPF have very
different purposes. The SCD’s purpose is to assess what steps the country needs to
take to achieve the twin goals by 2030. The purpose of the CPF, in contrast, is the
World Bank Group’s own program of support over a five-year period, focusing on
the areas where the World Bank Group can maximize its value added to the
government’s program. The benefits of thinking ahead about the constraints to
achieving poverty reduction and shared benefits in the SCD are shown by the good
quality of the summary discussions of constraints in the CPF text. It is also evident
from the reviews that the focus on the achievement of the twin goals in the SCDs has
driven the CPFs to zero in—much more explicitly than in the past—on what
programs are required to support this. However, the different time frames of the
two documents create a tension.

An important new element in the engagement model is guidance provided to SCD
teams to identify the gaps in knowledge and data needed to assess both the
incidence of poverty and the constraints to achieving the twin goals. The CPF
guidance asks for an indication of how the gaps will be filled and in what time
frame and for the arrangements and capacity for enhanced poverty monitoring.
While, as discussed, the SCDs generally provided a clear identification of the key
knowledge and data gaps, the CPFs were not as effective in following up on those
gaps. The credibility of the SCD’s analysis depends to a considerable extent on the
reliability of the data on which it is based. The CPFs need to do a much better job of
looking at each of the knowledge and data gaps and determining how they should
be addressed, reflecting the respective roles of the corporate units, CMUs, and
global practices in the World Bank Group and the role that external partners might
be expected to play, and in what time frame. This is not just a matter of collecting
baseline data. It includes the need to put in place the capacity for enhanced poverty
monitoring (see box 3.1). Data issues will be discussed in two upcoming IEG
evaluations.

The SCD identification of development constraints is important in enabling the CPF
to pick up on those constraints and focus the World Bank program, but the guidance
is clear that one-to-one alignment is not expected. There was evidence in a number
of CPFs (such as Uganda) that the identification of key focus areas in the SCD had

 Box 3.1. Addressing the Need for Enhanced Poverty Monitoring
 The guidance (World Bank Group 2014) asks that the CPF discuss the capacity to monitor
 poverty indicators, but this was rarely done. Nearly a third of all the CPFs reviewed rated low
 in this regard. A number of the SCDs provided a good discussion of the gaps in development
 data and of the country capacity to undertake household surveys, carry out poverty analysis
 based on survey data, and make the data and results publicly available so that they can be used
 by others. In general, however, the CPFs did not follow up. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, for
 example, the SCD’s excellent discussion of data issues and identification of key areas for
 improvement is not followed up in the CPF, where there is no indication that the program
 would seek to support poverty data collection and analysis. Since this is so central to the new
 engagement model, it seems that more explicit guidance is needed through the inclusion of an
 annex to the CPF identifying the knowledge and data gaps and how they will be filled and
 whether capacity building is required to sustain poverty monitoring.


resulted in a significant shift of emphasis in the World Bank program. However, one
major factor driving nonalignment of the SCD and CPF was the government’s view
of where the World Bank should focus its support (such as Côte d’Ivoire and
Panama, box 3.2). Other important factors were the weight of the ongoing program
(Chad) and the quality of the SCD analysis. As discussed in chapter 2, some SCDs
did not do a good job of identifying clear priorities and analyzing the trade-offs. In
those cases, the CPF teams tended to focus on alignment with the government’s
program. While most CPFs had a table or a paragraph comparing the SCD and CPF
priorities, in general they did not do a good job of explaining the reasons for the
differences between the two. There would be a difference between a CPF not
including some SCD priorities, or adding priorities not in the SCD, but in either case
it would be useful for the CPF to explain the differences and to acknowledge
explicitly any remaining SCD priorities and briefly explain the reasons for leaving
them out. This could be done either through more detailed text discussion or a brief
annex that more systematically explained all the identified SCD priorities.


 Box 3.2. Divergences Between the SCD and CPF Priorities
 In Panama, the CPF priorities diverge substantially from those identified in the SCD. While
 education, housing and health, and land management and environment are priorities in the
 SCD, they are not in the CPF. At the same time, the SCD’s focus on the implementation of
 the National Integrated Development Plan of the Indigenous Peoples of Panama is not a
 priority in the CPF. While it is understandable if the government’s priorities do not match
 those of the SCD, the CPF’s focus on areas that were not identified in the SCD as
 priorities—such as urban connectivity and financial inclusion—challenges the notion that
 the CPF objectives concentrate resources where they will have the most impact on the
 achievement of the twin goals.

CHAPTER 3
THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK
 In Côte d’Ivoire, the team preparing the CPF concluded that the SCD had failed to take
 sufficient account of some priority areas that were critical for achieving the twin goals. The
 CPF therefore included some areas that were not part of the priorities identified in the SCD.



Alignment with the government’s own priorities. The second criterion for selection of
World Bank Group program objectives is alignment with the government’s own
program. The CPF is a unique opportunity to engage with the differences in emphasis
or approach between the government’s strategy and World Bank Group’s view of
strategic priorities and to discuss these differences. The discussion of this alignment,
or lack of it, was a weakness in the CPFs reviewed. In many cases the priority areas of
the government plan were listed, and followed by a pro forma statement that the
World Bank Group objectives were aligned (Haiti, Honduras, Maldives, and Mali).

It is also clear that even where there is superficial alignment reflected in the
identification of pillars in the government strategy, the weight that governments
give to growth in the near term relative to poverty reduction and shared benefits
may be different from that of the World Bank Group. In some countries, this is
indicated by the prominence of national-level infrastructure in the government plan
relative, for example, to the World Bank Group’s emphasis on growth of SMEs,
smallholder agriculture, and human capital development (Egypt, Uganda).
Sustainable poverty reduction requires both growth and shared prosperity, and
there should be discussion of the appropriate balance during the program period
and its implications. In the best cases, there was a healthy dialogue to clarify
differences of view (Albania, Azerbaijan). Thus, in Azerbaijan the CPF recognizes
that government ownership is more critical to the success of the program than
perfect alignment between the SCD and CPF.

An important element in achieving alignment was the timing of the SCD in relation
to the government’s own plan. In the traditional CAS/CPS model, the presumption
was that for consistency, it was preferable to wait for the completion of the
government’s plan before preparing the World Bank’s strategy. However, evidence
is emerging that in the new model, there can be benefits from the preparation of the
SCD before or during plan preparation. In some countries, this enabled dialogue
when there was sufficient flexibility to develop a well-coordinated approach. In
Bosnia and Herzegovina, for example, the key areas of emphasis in the
government’s reform agenda were substantially informed by the SCD process.
Similarly, in Albania both World Bank-prepared Policy Notes and the SCD were
important inputs into the government’s National Strategy for Development and
Integration, resulting in close alignment with the CPF priorities.

                                                     THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK
The World Bank Group’s comparative advantage. All CPFs indicate that the World
Bank’s comparative advantage was a criterion for the selection of priority objectives.
In practice, however, they refer to absolute advantages, such as the World Bank’s
convening power or its ability to combine analytic work with operational support.
The World Bank’s comparative advantage depends not just on its own capacities,
but also on those of the government and development partners. The treatment of
development partner programs was uneven. It tended to be better in the Latin
America and the Caribbean countries where the World Bank is often a smaller
lender than the Inter-American Development Bank and Development Bank of Latin
America (Corporacion Andina de Fomento), so that it needs to be selective in
identifying areas where it can add value. In El Salvador, for example, the
preparation of the strategy took into consideration extensive areas of engagement by
development partners. As a result, some objectives identified in the SCD, such as
support for the judiciary, reducing crime and violence, and disaster risk
management, were not included in the program. In Serbia, a careful examination
was undertaken of the World Bank Group’s comparative advantage relative to other
partners, especially the European Union, European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, and European Investment Bank, both in terms of areas where each
institution may have leverage and the record in program implementation.

In some cases, the CPFs indicated that particular areas that were both SCD priorities
and consistent with the World Bank Group’s comparative advantage were not
selected because the government was not interested in World Bank participation in
those areas, such as education, health, and social protection in Bolivia. In this and
other cases, the World Bank has reshaped its support in areas that are critical for the
eventual achievement of the twin goals to focus on advisory services and analytics.
There are also examples where the World Bank felt that it did not have a
comparative advantage in a particular sector, but decided to remain engaged
because of the interest of the government in continued World Bank support, such as
in the water sector in Uganda.2

The ongoing program. Among the most difficult issues for country teams in preparing
the CPFs was the relation between the SCD priorities and the composition of the
ongoing lending program, including the pipeline of projects on which significant
preparatory work had been done.

In some cases, where the priorities had not shifted much since the previous strategy
document, as in Côte d’Ivoire, these were already well reflected in the ongoing
program. But many SCDs identified some new priority areas that were not
prominent in the World Bank’s ongoing program. In some cases, the objectives
implicit in one or two of the projects in the “legacy” portfolio were not covered by
the SCD priorities. This presented country teams with a dilemma and, according to

                                                                                     25
CHAPTER 3
THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK
many participants, much of the internal discussion on the CPF related to this
question. Some country teams dealt with this by papering over the cracks—either
the SCD had a long list of priorities that were consistent with almost any set of
World Bank–supported programs (Myanmar—albeit a country in a new and special
situation), or CPF objectives were categorized in such general terms that they could
contain both the ongoing program and the SCD priorities. In the Botswana CPF, for
example, only three objectives are defined, but they are: private sector–led, job-
intensive growth; effective resource management; and strengthened human and
physical assets. This reflects the approach of the previous CAS/CPF of defining
broad pillars, rather than to focus on the more specific objectives implied by the new
engagement model.

There is little evidence in the CPF documents of a serious rethinking of the ongoing
program to assess whether it remains relevant. For the most part, it is appropriate
that the ongoing program continues to be implemented with a view to achieving
development results, although there may be opportunities for canceling or scaling
back low-priority or poorly performing operations. But if the priorities are bent to
conform to the ongoing program, then the World Bank runs the risk of a sector
composition not responsive to addressing the twin goals. The Bangladesh CPF was
among the few to distinguish clearly between the “foundational” programs and the
“transformational” priorities that were to be supported in the outer years of the CPF.
This allowed for a discussion of how the program of World Bank–supported
advisory services and analytics in the initial period would set the stage for
subsequently addressing the transformational priorities. The increasing interest
emerging from the SCDs in the development of social protection systems in some of
the poorest countries—those unlikely to meet the twin goals by 2030—is an
important instance of the potential benefits of upstream thinking about downstream
priorities (Chad, Mali, Uganda). (See box 3.3.)


 Box 3.3. Matching the CPF Program with the Long-Term Priorities of the SCD
 An important finding of the SCD preparation is that for most fragile states and low-income
 countries, even pro-poor growth will not be sufficient to achieve the twin goals by 2030. This
 will require income redistribution programs through social transfers. The problem is that in the
 CPF time frame, many of these countries lack the capacity to identify the poor, to finance
 transfers, and to put in place the governance arrangements that ensure that the transfers reach
 those who need them. In general, the CPFs do not do an adequate job of indicating what
 analytic work and technical assistance needs to be carried out in the CPF period to build
 capacity to implement a meaningful social security system 10 or 15 years from now (Chad,
 Uganda).

                                                      THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK

Selectivity
Past IEG reviews of CAS/CPS documents have identified the need for more
selectivity in World Bank objectives. Selectivity in the CPF can be tracked at three
points in the strategic programming cycle. The first is in the number of objectives and
the specificity with which these objectives are defined. The second is in the number of
objective indicators put forward as proxies for the achievement of the objectives. The
third is in the number of World Bank Group operations designed to support the
achievement of the objectives. A comparison of the current CPS and the most recent
CAS/CPS for the country was used to inform this review.

There was a modest decline in the number of objectives in the nine countries where
comparisons to the past were made (from 122 to 106). However, the number of
objectives in itself is not a particularly useful standard of comparison. As the
Botswana example shows, some CPFs simply broaden the scope of the objectives so
that they encompass a wide area of the program. The objective indicators are a better
reflection of selectivity, since these need to be defined in specific, quantifiable terms
and their achievement will be used to assess the overall effectiveness of Bank
support. Here the progress is striking. For the nine countries, the number fell from
304 indicators in the previous CAS/CPS to 218 in the CPFs.

The trend for the number of World Bank Group operations is more difficult to
analyze. A program needs to encompass the operations required to support the
achievement of the objective. In some cases, however, long lists of operations are
provided in support of an objective, but many of these are clearly subsidiary for the
achievement of the objective. In Côte d’Ivoire and Uganda, there are objectives
linked to more than 20 separate World Bank Group activities. To give another
example, whether or not the SCD includes road transport as a priority, the ongoing
projects in the subsector are slotted into objectives such as “supporting PSD” or
“increasing access of the public to health and education services.” At the same time,
the CPF format does not give enough attention to institutional development and
capacity-building programs that are worth supporting, even if they cannot be linked
to the definition of quantifiable outcomes in the CPF time frame. Examples include
long-term engagements in building statistical capacity or promoting the
development of think tanks that can support evidence-based policy making.


The Results Framework
The key elements of a good results framework include the definition of a clear results
chain linking the objectives to monitorable and measurable outcome indicators. IEG’s past
reviews of CAS Completion Reports had indicated that many CAS/CPFs were


                                                                                       27
CHAPTER 3
THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK
deficient in setting out a clear results chain and in developing a set of quantified
indicators that are good proxies for achievement of the objectives.

The review of the CPFs suggests that the definition of the results chain remains a
work in progress, and that their results chains can best be described as truncated, with
several items missing, as discussed in appendix E. The framing of the guidance note
(World Bank Group 2014), which asks for the “intervention logic” to be specified in
the results framework, has encouraged more attention to the links between the
objectives (normally defined in broad directions) and the particular objectives
indicators selected as proxies for their achievement.

In general, the reviews found the upstream part of the results chain to be well
handled, although some gaps between achievement of objectives and achievement of
indicators must be expected. However, the role of the World Bank Group’s program
in contributing to the achievement of these outcomes was often not well thought
through and explained. It is worth noting the commendable effort made by some
team leaders to recognize that the contributions of other donors were also important
for the achievement of the results specified in the World Bank Group’s results
framework, but such contributions are rarely reflected in the CPF results chains.


Box 3.4. Examples of Ambiguous Indicators
Despite the progress that has been made in defining measurable objectives, there are still too
many instances where CPFs include indicators where the quantification has little or no
meaning, for example:
    In the Maldives: “50 percent of targeted island representatives demonstrate improved
     capacities to plan and manage multisectoral measures” (World Bank Group 2015c, 38).
    In Indonesia: “Number of households receiving improved access to reliable energy”
     (World Bank Group 2015b, 27).
    In Colombia: “Additional population benefiting from improved transport services in
     medium-size cities” (World Bank Group 2015a, 71).

The definition of monitorable and measurable results for the indicators was a strong
point of many of the CPFs reviewed, with more than half of the objectives indicators
classified by IEG as outcomes. The reviewers rated this area highly. Another key
element has been the distinction between objective indicators, which reflect
outcomes or outputs, and supplementary indicators, which are often inputs or
process steps on the critical path toward achieving the outcomes. While these
process steps are often necessary conditions for the achievement of subsequent
outcomes, too often CPFs are content to leave it at that, without thinking through
what can be done to assess whether they are actually contributing to progress in the
field.

                                                                             CHAPTER 3
                                                    THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK
To give an example, the Chad CPF identifies inputs such as training of officials in
the Ministry of Petroleum or delivering subsidies to community teachers. These
indicators are of limited value, however, without complementary evidence on
whether those trained were still working in the same field by the end of the program
and survey data on whether the trainees found the training useful. Similarly, the
impact of subsidies on teacher absenteeism could be tracked. In most programs,
there is still a certain amount of cleaning up required, and some indicators are too
ambiguous in their definition. See box 3.4 for some examples.

The tension, discussed above, between the World Bank Group’s ongoing program
and some of the new priority areas defined in the SCD comes to a head in the
definition of the results framework. The requirement for a measurable and
monitorable results framework means that indicators tend to be drawn mainly from
the existing World Bank Group support program. With a five-year program, the
planned results for the first three years are generally accounted for almost entirely
by the existing program. It is virtually impossible, at least for investment lending,
for planned new activities to be reflected significantly in the results framework in
that time frame. In practice, a number of results frameworks confine themselves to
indicators for the first two to three years, and thus do not reflect potential new
activities. This gives the wrong set of signals. Although the guidance note recognizes
this dilemma and discusses ways of dealing with it, a sharpening of this guidance is
needed. The results framework needs to make a clearer distinction between the
ongoing operations and any new program directions that are proposed in response
to the analysis carried out in the SCD, which will yield measurable results in the
outer years of the program. This has been done, for example, in the Azerbaijan CPF,
where the results framework and the text clearly distinguish the ongoing World
Bank Group activities—both lending and nonlending—from the new activities and
establish their link to the objectives.

At the same time, as pointed out above, the World Bank Group often has long-term
commitments to build capacity and institutions that are poorly reflected in the
results framework. The current formulation of the results framework, for example,
does not reflect the World Bank’s continuing support to the National Statistical
Bureau in Uganda or for Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in Chad,
which, to be effective, needs to be sustained over a number of CAS/CPF periods.
These support programs need to be separately delineated with the identification of
markers of progress that allow for monitoring to determine if these programs are on
track.

As discussed in the context of selectivity, the articulation of the links between the
World Bank Group program and the objectives indicators remains relatively weak. It
would be useful in the results frameworks to designate the core activities (both

                                                                                   29
CHAPTER 3
THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK
lending and nonlending) that will drive the achievement of the indicators and for
the text on the results chain to deal with these links more explicitly. Listing the
plethora of other activities that contribute contextual support to the objective over
time adds confusion rather than providing clarity to the results frameworks.

The World Bank Group’s nonlending activities—both World Bank advisory services
and analytics and IFC advisory services—are often poorly integrated into the results
frameworks. Given the importance of these activities in the World Bank Group’s
program, this is an issue in need of stronger guidance. The emphasis on quantification
works against the integration of these activities, as does the failure to incorporate
longer-term engagement of the World Bank Group in supporting institutional
development and capacity building. The contribution to outcomes of advisory
services and analytics and advisory services was sometimes not shown at all in the
results framework (Indonesia). Overall, the contribution of analysis and advice to the
World Bank Group program was handled unevenly in the CPFs under review. One-
third of the CPFs were found deficient in this regard. By contrast, the Bangladesh and
Panama CPFs were viewed as good practice.

One remaining weakness of some CPFs in this area is the failure to discuss the
capacity of the country to monitor the elements of the results framework. This is not
the same as the issue of overall data development and monitoring capacity, since the
data in the results framework is often generated at the project level and may be area-
specific. A particular issue is the weakness of the baseline data, as evidenced by the
large number of indicators that have zero as their baseline, indicating that only the
change can be monitored, but without an indication of how the World Bank Group
will contribute to the achievement of the twin goals. The inadequate quality and
frequency of household surveys make it difficult in many countries to assess the
impact of the program, and the World Bank Group is rightly making progress in this
area a priority.


One World Bank Group
The integration of IFC and MIGA into the CPF process has been significantly
improved under the new country engagement approach. All CPFs reviewed
discussed the strategic direction and content of IFC (and in some cases MIGA)
operations and their contributions to the overall World Bank Group program.
However, in many cases this discussion was only weakly reflected in the CPF results
framework. While ongoing IFC and MIGA operations are generally listed, there is
usually very little on their planned programs. IFC and MIGA ascribe this to their
respective business models, which depend heavily on private sector demand, making
it difficult to identify future operations.

30
                                                                                     CHAPTER 3
                                                          THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK
In Uganda, for example, agreement was reached during the CPF preparation that
IFC would attempt to identify new operations in the agriculture sector, with
potential support for value chains and agricultural finance, including leasing, which
would complement a number of World Bank–supported activities. The CPF
discusses this, but the results framework, while specifying the future World Bank
program, has only a general reference to possible IFC engagement in the sector. IFC
could go further in identifying the kinds of operations it might support, based on its
regional, country, or industry strategies and the role of its advisory services in
promoting operations outcomes in these areas, while recognizing its dependence on
private sector demand.

IEG’s review of the World Bank Group’s diagnostics of issues for PSD in the SCDs
(see chapter 2) also looked at how these were reflected in the CPF results
frameworks. The review found that program priorities identified in the CPF were
heavily focused on providing credit lines to SMEs and skills training for job creation
and growth, perhaps because of the policy focus of the SCD diagnostics. This could
raise the question of whether IFC team leaders had sufficient time and/or resources
(staff and dedicated budgets) to contribute fully to the SCD/CPF processes.



 Box 3.5. World Bank Group Collaboration in the CPFs
   In Mali, the CPF is emphatic that IDA and IFC will work together to unlock the
    potential for transformation, with planned interventions for both soft and hard
    investments. Five areas have been listed for special attention. A joint IFC–World Bank
    business plan will be built around competitive value chain development operations
    for specific areas. New IDA and IFC knowledge and technical assistance interventions
    are planned for financial sector and capacity building in the agricultural sector. Mali is
    also a priority country for MIGA.
   In Indonesia, there is considerable evidence of significant roles for the IBRD, IFC, and
    MIGA for the implementation of the CPF. Particularly for large and complex
    infrastructure investments such as energy, maritime, and housing, the government has
    requested that the World Bank Group bring the balance sheets of all three institutions to
    bear. Although the brunt of World Bank Group support remains with the IBRD,
    multiple IFC operations are already ongoing and new ones are planned under the CPF.
    MIGA has an ongoing project, but envisions new operations in the future, depending on
    demand.
   In the Egypt CPF, collaboration and appropriate division of labor among the World
    Bank, IFC, and MIGA is both meaningful and effective. The World Bank and IFC have
    identified and worked together on three key areas of collaboration: energy, youth skills
    development, and investment climate/competitiveness. Both the World Bank and IFC
    acknowledge that collaboration and coordination make business sense, given the large
    size of the Egypt portfolio. Since the 2011 revolution, MIGA has provided political risk
    insurance coverage to several foreign direct investors, complementing Bank and IFC
    support.

                                                                                             31
CHAPTER 3
THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK
        Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bangladesh were also cases of a well-coordinated
         operational approach. The Côte d’Ivoire CPF gave special prominence to MIGA’s
         contribution to the program.

The guidance asks that the CPF identify programs that will be undertaken jointly by
the World Bank Group entities. However, a number of the IFC participants in the
CPF process interviewed by IEG noted that the difference between the World Bank
and IFC operating models makes it difficult to develop joint programs. One
exception seems to be the use of public-private partnerships in the energy sector,
which characterizes a number of programs and where Bank activities to develop the
policy, institutional, and regulatory frameworks as well as Bank lending have
meshed with IFC support for investments and MIGA guarantees. In most cases,
however, Bank, IFC, and MIGA involvement proceeds in parallel rather than
through direct cofinancing by the institutions.

Ten CPFs envisioned joint projects or programs, which is quite an ambitious number
compared with past CASs. Generally, these were listed as “potential.” A few CPF
results matrixes included ongoing projects/programs cofinanced by at least two of
the World Bank Group institutions. But the realization of such cofinanced projects
depends ultimately on public and private sector client demand. This is a topic that
goes beyond the treatment in the CPF and requires some fundamental thinking in
the World Bank Group about when and where joint programs should be prioritized.

On balance, IEG assessed World Bank Group collaboration in CPF preparation
positively. Some good practice examples are cited in box 3.5.


Risk Analysis
All CPFs used the SORT, which was introduced in 2014 to provide a more
structured method of rating risks that would be broadly comparable across
countries. It identifies nine risk categories: political and governance,
macroeconomic, sector strategies and policies, technical design of project and
program, institutional capacity for implementation and sustainability, fiduciary,
environment and social, stakeholders, and other. Each risk category is rated as high,
substantial, moderate, or low.

The evidence suggests that for the CPFs, the country teams have taken considerable
care in deciding the ratings and have, if anything, been conservative (on the high
side) in their risk assessment. The descriptions of the risks are often very generic;
however, possibly in some cases out of concern that governments would react
adversely to a more precise formulation. In addition, risk mitigation is not well
handled in the text, possibly because of the broad way in which the risks themselves

                                                                                   CHAPTER 3
                                                         THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK
have been framed. There are many risks for which mitigation is not possible, at least
in the short term. In these cases, it is a matter of how the World Bank Group should
adapt to these risks.

A key part of the discussion of adaptation should be the question of the size of the
World Bank’s portfolio in relation to the various risks. Very few CPFs discussed this,
even when the CPF identifies important questions of the country’s absorptive
capacity (El Salvador, Myanmar). The presentation and discussion of risks also
needs to draw a clearer distinction between World Bank and IFC programs, since
these have very different risk profiles. It is also possible that MIGA’s long experience
in country risk assessments could usefully be drawn on for the CPF risk analyses.

It is evident that some elements of the SORT were designed for use in projects, and
have little relevance for the country-level risk analysis. While stakeholder risk, for
example, has a very clear meaning at the project level, it is difficult to see what it
means when aggregated to the country level, since different parts of the program are
likely to have very different levels of stakeholder risk. Similarly, the category of sector
strategies and policies was intended to deal with the tension between, say, an
agricultural project and the policies and institutions in the agriculture sector. It is not
clear how such specific sector risks would be aggregated to the country level. Technical
design is another category that seems inappropriate for a country-wide assessment—at
the country level, this would be picked up by the rating for institutional capacity. It is
evident from table 3.1 that these three risk categories were consistently rated as less
risky than others for most countries, with very little discussion in the text. It is probable
that they were simply not seen as relevant to the country-wide risk assessment.

The SORT combines higher-order political, social, and environmental risks with
more specific operational risks. It needs to be rethought in the context of the CPF,
with an increased focus on how the World Bank is addressing systemic operational
risks. In Uganda, for example, the delay of the legislature in approving IDA credits
has emerged as a serious constraint to achieving the results indicators. The World
Bank has decided, therefore, to carry out briefings and consultations with
parliamentarians at a much earlier stage of project preparation and to continue this
through the preparatory process to mitigate this risk. Similarly, systemic issues of
procurement and safeguards, and how the World Bank is addressing them, could be
taken up in this section, also including the interplay between program design and
operational risk that should be more extensively discussed in the CPFs.

The Use of Country Engagement Notes
World Bank Group guidance advises teams to use a Country Engagement Note (CEN)
only when country conditions are in crisis brought about by conflict or political
transition, or when the World Bank Group lacks sufficient knowledge when
reengaging in a country after a prolonged hiatus, and is unable to define detailed
objectives or develop a program for the medium-term (World Bank Group 2014).
Fragility or predictable instability is not in itself an argument for a CEN, and a
number of SCD/CPFs were prepared for fragile states. Because CENs are often
prepared in situations where the World Bank Group has knowledge gaps, it is not
required that a CEN be preceded by an SCD, and it is not expected to contain as much
documentation and analysis as a CPF. However, the 2014 guidance note states that “it
must contain sufficient analysis to support the preparation and monitoring of the
proposed engagement . . . [and] when possible, it is expected to have solid
underpinnings, including assessments on poverty, gender, fragility, and other
important aspects of development” (World Bank Group 2014, 17).

This evaluation reviewed the six CENs prepared from January 2015 to April 2016,
two of which were done for countries classified as fragile and conflict-affected
situations—the Central African Republic and Guinea-Bissau. The others were for
Ecuador, Fiji, Guyana, and Turkmenistan (see appendix F). At the same time, some
fragile and conflict-affected situation countries, such as Afghanistan and Myanmar,
which under the previous system may have prepared Interim Strategy Notes,
adopted the SCD/CPF process. Lack of confidence about country ownership for a
medium-term program seems to have been the primary motivation in Ecuador,
Guyana, and Turkmenistan. For some countries, the judgment was that the World
Bank Group lacked the knowledge base to develop a full SCD. Most of the CENs
were prepared for relatively small countries where the instrument provides the
possibility of delivering the strategy product at lower cost. However, in IEG’s view,

34
                                                                             CHAPTER 3
                                                     THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK
this is better handled by managing the costs of the SCD/CPF directly—for example,
by producing shorter documents with a small team, and by allowing for an update,
rather than a full SCD, in the next round.

IEG assessed adherence of the CENs to the guidance along multiple dimensions:
timing, content, evaluability, and preparations for subsequent regular country
programming documents. This is presented in appendix F. In summary, the review
found a number of apparent deviations from the expectations in the guidance,
leading to the conclusion that either the guidance or the current practice needs to be
modified:

      Justification: Most country teams justify CENs on the basis of a political
       crisis. However, this justification seems weak in Ecuador, where elections are
       not scheduled until 2017 and there is no immediate crisis.
      Time frame: CENs are expected to have a 12- to 24-month cycle, with a
       maximum limit of 2 years. However, Fiji exceeds this limit in its delivery
       schedule and its ability to complete intended activities.
      Data availability: Ecuador and Guyana had data that, if country ownership
       were not an issue, could have permitted the preparation of an SCD.
      Tracking performance: A CEN should describe benchmarks and indicators
       and analyze performance and lessons at the end of the CEN period. However,
       the absence of even a rudimentary results framework in three of the six CENs
       will make it difficult to accomplish this at the end of the CEN period.
      Risk analysis: All the CENs use SORT to assess risks, but only half of them
       acknowledge high risks, underestimating institutional and governance risks.
      Document length: All 6 CENs exceed the prescribed 15-page limit.


Emerging Messages
There is evidence of a modest improvement in the quality and focus of the CPFs in
comparison with the previous CAS/CPSs. The focus on the achievement of the twin
goals in the SCDs has caused the CPFs to focus much more explicitly on what
programs are required to support this, and there are clear indications of stronger
selectivity. Most CPFs now also include discussions of the strategic direction and
content of the IFC/MIGA programs and how these contribute to the World Bank
Group program.

Most CPFs have clearly benefited from having the SCDs and from the widespread
consultations on that document. However, the CPFs do not yet bring forward
systematically and completely the priorities identified in the SCD—priority
constraints, identified knowledge gaps, or identified data weaknesses and gaps.


                                                                                    35
CHAPTER 3
THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK
Also, the results frameworks would have benefited if more clearly set in the context
of longer-term expectations for the World Bank Group’s work in the country,
building on the SCD analysis.

The CPF results frameworks show improvements but are still a work in progress.
The requirement in the guidance note (World Bank Group 2014) for the intervention
logic to be specified has helped to direct more attention to the links between
objectives and their indicators, and the definition of monitorable and measurable
results for the indicators has been a strong point of many of the CPFs reviewed. The
intervention logic is often explained well, and most indicators are now measurable
and monitorable. But the broader results chains are truncated, many or most
indicators may be from ongoing rather than new activities, and there is too little
effort to link nonlending activities to results.

There is more systematic attention to risks, but the risk frameworks may need
rethinking. The CPFs now apply—with significant care—the same analytical tool
(SORT) as lending operations, but some elements of this tool have little relevance to
country-level analysis. As a result, current discussions are quite generic, and with no
real separation between country risks that the World Bank cannot influence and
more operational risks, or between risks for the World Bank versus IFC/MIGA.

The World Bank Group needs to clarify the justification for preparing CENs and
their role in preparing the ground for a subsequent SCD/CPF cycle. An economic
crisis or a change of government is not sufficient justification to use CENs. All CENs
have proposed to fill knowledge gaps, but only Guinea-Bissau used the CEN period
effectively to prepare an SCD. It is not clear whether the remaining countries will be
able to follow suit or will propose another CEN for the next cycle.

4. Institutional and Cross-Cutting Issues in the
New Country Engagement Model
Background
This chapter examines various aspects of the fourth evaluation question: Did the
SCD and CPF teams have the necessary and appropriate products, systems, and
resources, and was this new model helpful in integrating the work of the three
institutions, in coordinating with global practices and cross-cutting solutions areas,
and with interactions with government authorities and other key stakeholders?


Internal Processes
The key to the new country engagement model is its two-step approach. It consists
of two distinct documents with different World Bank Group task managers: an
analytical document (SCD) setting out the binding constraints on the country’s
development and the priorities as seen by the World Bank Group, followed by a
shorter programming document (CPF) that describes the World Bank Group’s
assistance strategy derived from the intersections of the identified priorities, the
government priorities, and the comparative advantages of the World Bank Group.

In general, the timing and processing of SCDs and CPFs have been robust and
helpful for most of the 22 SCDs and CPFs examined. Internal SCD processes
typically have started with country team brainstorming meetings, and continued
through the concept note to the ROC decision review meeting, which usually gave
rise to constructive comments from various parts of the World Bank Group.

Processing problems generally arose from country and timing issues. In some cases,
the documents were prepared while a government was still working on its own
development plans. In Bolivia, both the SCD and the CPF were completed before the
country published its Economic and Social Development Plan, which led to
restrictions on the publication and dissemination of the SCD. It may have been
preferable in this case to delay the CPF to provide the opportunity to incorporate the
government’s completed strategy. In Chad, the government held up publication of
the SCD and the processing of the CPF because of concerns about apparent
inconsistencies between the SCD and the recent Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
Completion Point Paper prepared by the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund. The CPF consultation process for Egypt was much more extensive

and inclusive than that for the SCD, which took place only at the concept paper
stage.

IEG found the corporate review process for the SCD and CPF comprehensive and
satisfactory. In many cases the reviewers noted considerable scrutiny or support from
Regional management, and (except for some of the very early SCDs) useful support
from central units. The formal review processes brought together different parts of the
World Bank Group and helped improve the quality of the reports. The review
meetings were co-chaired by the World Bank and IFC, which can involve scheduling
difficulties. It is not clear, however, that a ROC is really needed for an SCD at the
concept review stage, or whether review can be delegated to the chief economist for
the Region involved. (IEG found that all chief economists played active and
constructive roles in support of the SCD preparations, but with different approaches
based on regional differences and personal preferences.) The constructive role of peer
reviewers has also been noted (box 4.1).


 Box 4.1. The Corporate Review Process for the Serbia SCD
    The SCD concept note review meeting was co-chaired by the Europe and Central Asia
     Region and IFC vice presidents and received several sets of comments, including from
     three peer reviewers and the International Monetary Fund mission chief.
    Main issues discussed were the storyline on growth and shared prosperity and the
     analytical framework.
    The team was advised to be selective and to narrow down the areas to be analyzed.
    Extensive and high-quality comments were shared for the ROC meeting from three
     peer reviewers, several global practices, the Europe and Central Asia Development
     Effectiveness Unit, IFC, International Monetary Fund staff, and others.
    Major issues discussed were the strengthening of interlinkages, the analysis of risks to
     sustainability, prioritization, and sequencing.


SCD teams can be very large. For example, the Albania SCD had as many as 80 staff
listed as team members, many from the global practices, making it difficult to
differentiate those more substantively involved from those who simply commented
on drafts of the document. On the whole, the relations between the CMU and the
global practices seemed to work relatively well. In a few cases, there were some
bumps in the road, such as contradictory advice from managers and program
leaders, or global practices pushing excessively for “their” issues or projects. (The
engagement in the SCD and CPF processes of IFC and MIGA is discussed separately
in this chapter.)

                  INSTITUTIONAL AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
The Internal Audit Department has assisted IEG with data on processing times and
costs discussed in the following paragraphs, which compare data for the SCD and
CPF with data from the previous CASs in the same 22 countries. The new processes
take longer. The evaluation compared the time elapsed from the concept review
meeting to the Board delivery date for all three documents. The average time for the
CPF alone went down to 140 days, but the average for SCD delivery alone (from
concept review to Board) was 285 days, and in practice, there has been some overlap
between the SCD and CPF processes in most cases. Thus the average elapsed time has
increased from 231 days for the last CAS to 388 days for the new country engagement
model as a whole (figure 4.1 and table 4.1). However, the average numbers mask
significant differences, and the CAS numbers include some outliers (Botswana and
Maldives), where preparation of the previous CAS took more than two years. In the
future, processing times for the SCD/CPF may be reduced somewhat as the World
Bank Group moves up the learning curve for the new documents.

The new process clearly requires additional resources since the SCD is a new
product. The evaluation compared budgets (World Bank only) charged to each SCD
and CPF with the expenses on the last CAS in the same set of 22 countries. Despite
the shorter time spent on the CPF compared with the CAS, actual expenditures
charged to the CPF code were, on average, marginally higher than those spent on
the previous CAS. The $261,000 average expense on the SCD was additional
(table 4.2).

Note: CAS = country assistance strategy; CPF = Country Partnership Framework; SCD = Systematic Country Diagnostic.

Budget records indicate several anomalies in charges posted to SCD and CPF
budgets. The budget recording system underestimates the real cost of SCDs and
CPFs. During the country missions, sector staff indicated that they did not charge all
the time spent they spent on the SCD or CPF to the respective charge codes, while
IFC staff were mostly financed by IFC’s own budget, which is not reflected in the
costs. Preparation of the SCDs has substantial budget implications. Four of the 22
SCDs cost more than $450,000, while the average cost was $261,000. No discernable
pattern was detected by Region. In smaller countries, the cost of SCDs was just as
high as in larger countries, but CPF costs were slightly lower. Over time this
additional cost of the SCD might be offset by the longer life cycle of CPFs compared
with the previous CAS. It is also possible that in the next round more SCDs could be
prepared as updates to lower costs.


One World Bank Group—The Involvement of IFC and MIGA
The new country engagement approach places strong emphasis on integration of the
World Bank, IFC, and MIGA as One World Bank Group. In the past, IFC and
occasionally MIGA increasingly participated in the CAS in countries where they had a
substantial presence, but their role in the CAS process remained weak because of the
demand-driven nature of their portfolio. Even in joint CASs, most country strategies
lacked specific proposals on collaborative activities, and joint programs were often not
reflected in the results matrixes. IFC’s country engagement consisted of listing its



40
                                                                                 CHAPTER 4
                INSTITUTIONAL AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
ongoing investment and advisory services projects in the CAS. Monitoring and
evaluation of IFC activities was also difficult, since their expected outcomes or
indicators were rarely included in CAS results frameworks.

The guidance notes make clear that under the new approach “All CPF components
and the CEN are joint documents approved by the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA”
(World Bank Group 2014a, 5). Sign-off by World Bank, IFC, and MIGA team leaders
and managers is now required prior to formal reviews, and their senior
managements are expected to be involved in the SCD and CPF processes. These
arrangements are reinforced by the formalization of a Regional Coordination
Mechanism, consisting of senior regional management teams of the World Bank,
IFC, and MIGA in each Region. The Regional Coordination Mechanism is reported
to have played less of a role in SCD/CPF preparation than in monitoring
implementation.

IFC’s participation in the SCDs and CPFs is now stronger and more evident than
under the previous CAS approach. IFC was an integral part of the team in all 22
SCDs and CPFs reviewed by IEG, even in countries where it had limited operations.
There is now an IFC structure and established work flow for the new approach, with
internal ownership resting with the IFC Regional directors and country managers.
Normally, both the IFC team leader and strategy officers participate in internal
deliberations, including in-country consultations, and lead private sector
engagements for SCDs and CPFs. As a result, the integration of the IFC program in
the SCD/CPF process is much more substantive than in the previous CAS process.

The new approach has brought positive changes, including improved coordination
and collaboration between World Bank Group entities and, for IFC, greater
involvement in shaping the overall country strategy and more knowledge and
learning gained from the stakeholder consultations. The new approach has also
provided MIGA with better engagement opportunities within the World Bank
Group and, in the countries where they have been strategically engaged,
coordination is evident. However, the expectations of an integrated, One World
Bank Group approach have not been supported by dedicated resources for IFC and
MIGA staff. While World Bank staff have specified budget codes for SCD and CPF,
IFC and MIGA staff do not have a separate budget for these activities at the country
level. IFC does not yet have a mechanism for tracking the cost of its SCD and CPF
engagement in individual countries,1 and there is no allocated budget at the country
level for SCD and CPF preparation. All these issues, plus MIGA’s limited staff, have
affected the extent of engagement by several country units (Côte d’Ivoire, Costa Rica,
and Uganda are examples). MIGA uses a time recording system code to track staff
time and cost of its new country engagement, which is also funded through its


                                                                                       41
CHAPTER 4
INSTITUTIONAL AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
operating budget. Hence, the level and depth of IFC participation in an SCD or CPF
process depends on the resources (budget and staff) of Regional and country teams.
Like IFC, MIGA does not have a country-specific budget allocation for its SCD and
CPF engagement.

As discussed in chapters 2 and 3, the participation of IFC (and MIGA) was more
limited in the SCDs than in the CPFs. The SCDs still generally reflect a standardized
approach to private sector issues. With a few exceptions, private sector interventions
are viewed primarily as a response to a government policy of improving the business
climate, with evidence largely from the Doing Business reports and Enterprise Surveys
on the binding constraints for the private sector. There is relatively little discussion of
private sector strategic priorities to address the twin goals. IFC’s ongoing and new
engagements were integrated within the 22 CPFs reviewed. IFC programs mostly
clustered around inclusive growth objectives, often with IFC supporting two or
more objectives, and with the level of its involvement reflecting the relative scale of
its operations. However, IFC programs were not adequately reflected in results
frameworks, where concern about potential accountability based on a portfolio
dependent on private sector demand seems to have outweighed the potential of the
results framework in providing strategic focus to the programs for support through
IFC investments and advisory services.

The volume of MIGA’s existing exposure and business prospects in a country drive
the extent of its participation in the SCD and CPF processes. MIGA’s engagements
are limited by staffing constraints. MIGA could benefit from proactive and inclusive
World Bank team leadership and simple steps to bring MIGA into the teams early
and include them throughout the country engagement process.

For IFC and MIGA, the CPFs reflect mostly ongoing programs, highlighting the
difficulty of planning ahead under their business models. Sixty-three percent of IFC
projects listed in the 22 CPF results matrixes reviewed are ongoing projects
(including commitments dating back to fiscal 2007). Nearly 40 percent of IFC’s
ongoing and new projects support access to finance and financial inclusion
objectives in the CPF, and 25 percent support infrastructure development objectives.
In the future, it would be useful for IFC and MIGA to identify areas of concentration
and lines of promotional activities in the CPF results matrixes with process and
intermediate indicators that could be updated and replaced in the PLR.

Most CPFs discussed collaborative initiatives undertaken by the World Bank Group.
Ten CPFs envisioned joint projects or programs that were usually listed as
“potential,” while other CPF results matrixes included a few ongoing cofinanced
projects by at least two of the World Bank Group institutions. However,


42
                                                                                 CHAPTER 4
                INSTITUTIONAL AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
expectations of increased World Bank Group cofinanced projects need to be
tempered by the reality in the field and lessons from joint projects.2 Converting these
collaborative activities into projects that the World Bank Group could cofinance
depends ultimately on public and private sector client demand. Joint projects have
been useful and highly relevant in high-risk contexts, in supporting pioneering
investments and in complex projects. However, joint work also entailed costs and
risks.


Partnerships
Both country instruments are based on collaboration with governments, although in
different ways. The SCD reflects the evidence and analysis of the World Bank Group
and is prepared in consultation with national authorities, the private sector, and
other stakeholders. The CPF is developed in partnership with the government,
usually through several ministries or agencies and at various levels, although wider
consultations are also expected. This document is expected to take as its starting
point the country’s own vision of its development goals and its strategy for
achieving them. The guidance states that “It is important to make the case [in the
CPF] that there is a clear, country-owned development agenda on which to anchor
the CPF program” (World Bank Group 2014a, 8).

Stakeholder consultations have been effective in outreach to key stakeholders to
obtain inputs and help clarify priorities for the SCDs, and subsequently the CPFs.
Consultations were held with governments, development partners, think tanks, civil
society organizations, and the private sector. IFC played an important role in
outreach to the private sector. In Bangladesh, Bolivia, Egypt, and Myanmar,
consultations for the SCD and CPF were held in several cities. In Bolivia, a local
donor coordination forum sustained meaningful coordination with development
partners and facilitated the development of a framework document with the
government, which outlined potential common elements for all development
partners in Bolivia, ensuring that their strategies reflect the engagement of other
partners. A number of stakeholders also expressed appreciation for the participatory
processes, but other nongovernmental entities would have liked to see greater
interaction and feedback on their comments. However, to many of the stakeholders,
the difference between the SCD and CPF consultation processes was somewhat
blurred, and some participants found them lengthy and duplicative.

In many cases, there were several rounds of consultations. The first was typically on
a summary SCD concept note to get inputs into the analysis and focus of the SCD;
the second, often when the SCD was complete, aimed to disseminate the SCD and



                                                                                       43
CHAPTER 4
INSTITUTIONAL AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
lead into the CPF discussions. This also provided an opportunity for the government
and civil society to influence the CPF program. Following such processes, IEG found
good ownership of the CPF priorities, but with limitations (box 4.2). However, as
mentioned in chapter 2, the SCD was not always shared with stakeholders, which
prevented others from giving feedback on it for the subsequent CPF or from being
able to use it elsewhere, weakening its value as a public good.


 Box 4.2. Country Partnership of Proposed CPF Priorities Has Been Good but Is Not Assured
    In Albania, the World Bank sees a window of opportunity to push forward needed
     changes and structural reforms in key areas (fiscal, financial sector, energy, transport,
     agriculture, and social protection) to make fast progress toward the twin goals.
    In Bangladesh, the strategic approach of the government is similar to the World
     Bank’s approach and differs only in the pace of the reforms being undertaken.
    In Bolivia, the CPF is aligned with the government’s intent to sustain poverty
     reduction and continue growth. While poverty eradication goals are aligned, the
     government differs with the World Bank on how to achieve that goal, particularly on
     the role of the public and private sectors. Differences in government and World Bank
     priorities are limiting the areas of World Bank engagement, such as support for
     human development.
    In Egypt, the CPF is broadly consistent with the government’s program, but with
     some important differences between government and CPF strategies regarding a
     number of mega infrastructure projects proposed in the government’s development
     plan over the medium term.
    In Azerbaijan, a 5 percent increase in the lending envelope is designed to encourage
     much-needed structural reforms for PSD; effective public sector, human capital, and
     skills; infrastructure connectivity; and social and environmental sustainability. But the
     government did not want the World Bank involved in the social sectors, although
     these were identified as priorities in the SCD.



Cross-Cutting Themes and Issues in SCDs and CPFs
The guidance on SCDs and CPFs recommends attention to four cross-cutting themes:
gender, climate change, governance, and fragility. With one exception, the review
found that the 22 SCDs reviewed did a reasonable job (from a processing point of
view) of addressing these cross-cutting themes. There were, however, some variations
between SCDs in how well the various themes were addressed. In addition to these
themes, this section briefly discusses treatment of knowledge and governance issues.

GENDER
The depth and quality of gender analysis in SCDs varies. (See appendix H.) In all, 19
of the 22 SCDs reviewed discussed gender issues (16 on labor and 8 on education


44
                                                                                 CHAPTER 4
                INSTITUTIONAL AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
and health), while 8 SCDs highlighted gender issues among the main challenges.
SCDs referred to gender assessments in the 6 countries where they were current and
available during preparation. The review found several good examples of gender
integration, such as Albania and Chad. The Albania SCD discussed gender
constraints on labor and access to financial markets. The Chad SCD discussed
constraints to women’s agricultural productivity, as well as the impacts of high
fertility and early childbearing on women’s economic activity and health. However,
when priorities were identified in the SCDs, their gender linkages were often not
clearly spelled out. Gender inequality may not be recognized among the most
binding constraints to the twin goals in many countries, even if education, skills, and
access to jobs might be important dimensions of the priorities identified by SCDs.

Gender issues highlighted in SCDs tend to be echoed in CPFs. In SCDs, gender gaps
identified related to labor markets, followed by skills and school-to-work transitions.
These issues were often also picked up in the CPFs, where there seems to be an
evolution beyond human development in the previous generation of CASs toward
economic empowerment, especially related to labor issues, skills development, and
jobs. Poverty among female-headed households is also discussed. “More and better
jobs” is the centerpiece of the Bangladesh SCD, which also provides a very thorough
analysis of female employment and gender equality. While gender issues may not
be limited to women’s issues, the discussions on gender in SCDs and CPFs are
associated only with women’s issues. Risky behavior among men and boys (crime,
drugs) in Central American countries is not addressed.

Compared with previous CASs, CPFs are better at articulating World Bank Group
actions to address specific gender inequalities, and they include many more sex-
disaggregated indicators. But the alignment between the actions proposed and
indicators in the results frameworks is still relatively weak. The Costa Rica CPF, for
instance, refers to gender disparities and stereotypes in education and labor
markets, as well as IFC work on access to finance for women, but the results
framework only included indicators on female beneficiaries in two health and
education projects. CPFs often include indicators on the percentage of female
beneficiaries in existing projects but provide little new information beyond what is
already being monitored by individual projects.

Treatment of gender under the country engagement model has not been fully
consistent with the World Bank’s commitments on gender. The SCD guidance note
(World Bank Group 2014b) mentions gender in passing, while the 2014 CPF
guidance note (World Bank Group 2014a) did not fully adopt the gender
requirements under Operations Policy 4.20, the IDA replenishments, or in the
corporate scorecard. The World Bank Group Gender Strategy (World Bank Group


                                                                                       45
CHAPTER 4
INSTITUTIONAL AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
2015), finalized after the guidelines were completed, provides more specific
directions on how gender dimensions can be incorporated in the SCDs and CPFs,
noting that SCDs should highlight how closing the key gender gaps in endowments,
economic opportunities, and voice and agency would boost the attainment of the
twin goals. The gender strategy recommends broad consultations on gender with
the government and civil society as part of the CPF process. The CPF guidance
needs updating to incorporate these expectations.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
Climate change is an emerging agenda that needs analysis in the SCDs to position
the World Bank Group to engage more meaningfully in the future. In some
countries, such as Bangladesh, it received a great deal of attention in the SCD and
was elevated to one of the three focus areas in the CPF (see box 4.3). Similarly, in
Egypt, climate change and the environment is one of the main cross-cutting themes
discussed throughout the SCD and the CPF. Overall, 18 of the SCDs contained a
substantial discussion of climate change or environmental sustainability, and
included them directly or indirectly among SCD priorities. However, there was
limited attention to climate change in the SCDs in some vulnerable countries (such
as Bolivia—although it flagged climate change and natural disasters among
knowledge gaps—and Mali).


 Box 4.3. Responding to Government Priorities on Climate Change in Bangladesh
    In Bangladesh, building on the government’s priority to adaptive delta management,
     the SCD has integrated the discussion of climate change with sustainable resource
     management, especially of land, water, and aquatic resources.
    Climate and environmental management is one of the three CPF focus areas, with
     clear links to the other focus areas—growth and competitiveness and social
     inclusion—and to the twin goals reflected in the results framework.
    World Bank Group activities will focus on boosting Bangladesh’s resilience to climate
     change and natural disasters, improving the management of water infrastructure, and
     promoting agricultural productivity with climate-smart farm practices.

Climate change and environmental sustainability received attention in most of the
CPFs, including in countries where there had been little discussion in the SCDs.
Among the 22 CPFs reviewed, 18 specified objectives or subobjectives addressing
climate change or environmental sustainability. The Uganda SCD is silent on climate
change, while the CPF does discuss some of the links between population density
and environmental sustainability, without operational implications. In Bolivia,
climate change is not a priority in the SCD, but the CPF emphasizes the need to
strengthen capacity to manage climate risks, reduce vulnerability to natural
disasters, and deal with the environmental impacts of agro-industries. Overall, in


46
                                                                                 CHAPTER 4
                INSTITUTIONAL AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
several such cases there was often a discussion in the text, but this was not reflected
in the results framework. Possible reasons include the timing mismatch—climate
change is a long-term proposition, and actions taken now are unlikely to have
outcomes in the time frame of a CPF—and the fact that much of the World Bank
Group’s work on climate change is funded by trust funds. In other countries,
environmental sustainability is reflected in the CPF in relation to specific sector
operations, such as energy or land management.

FRAGILITY
The evaluation reviewed the contribution of fragility assessments to SCD/CPFs and
CENs in the six countries where they were available. Fragility assessments were
undertaken recently in the 4 fragile countries (Chad, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, and
Mali) of the 22 that prepared SCDs and CPFs during the evaluation period, and 2
countries with CENs (the Central African Republic and Guinea-Bissau). Uganda,
though not classified as fragile, had a risk and resilience assessment prepared in
June 2016 (appendix J). Bosnia and Herzegovina and Haiti did not have recent
fragility assessments to inform the process, and this may have impeded the quality
of the diagnostics, and hence the subsequent strategy. In its recent evaluation of
fragile situations (World Bank 2016), IEG recommended that fragility assessments be
applied systematically as part of the SCD/CPF process in countries where fragility,
violence, and conflict are a significant impediment to attaining the strategic
objectives of the World Bank Group.

The Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, and Mali SCDs explicitly referred to their respective
fragility assessments and discussed the historical nature of fragility in the country,
as well as current drivers of fragility. Fragility issues were also discussed in their
CPFs, though not in as much detail as in the SCDs. The fragility assessment is
featured quite prominently in the Mali CPF. Overall, the SCDs and CPFs in this
sample made good use of available fragility assessments. Their availability in
countries with fragile situations may have made it easier for SCDs, CPFs, or CENs to
integrate fragility within the World Bank Group strategy for those countries.

KNOWLEDGE
As discussed in chapters 2 and 3, knowledge gaps are not always identified, and
even when they are, the analytic work proposed is not always consistent with SCD
findings and CPF priorities. On the whole, the 22 SCDs did a better job of
identifying knowledge gaps (most often regarding labor markets, growth and
productivity, and access and quality of basic services) and areas where additional
work is required than the CPFs did in addressing these gaps. The analytical work
proposed in the CPFs was not always relevant and consistent with SCD findings and



                                                                                       47
CHAPTER 4
INSTITUTIONAL AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
recommendations. While only one SCD (Indonesia) was found to be deficient and
one moderately unsatisfactory (Egypt) in identifying some of the most important
knowledge gaps (such as macroeconomic and fiscal assessments), 7 of the 22 CPFs
reviewed were less than satisfactory in their analytical response.

Deeper analysis of the 10 countries visited by the evaluation team reinforced the
finding of a mismatch between knowledge gaps identified by SCDs and the
analytical response in the CPFs. While most of the SCDs identified data gaps (most
often regarding household surveys, firm-level surveys, and labor force data),
especially on poverty, some were less specific in the areas where focused attention
was needed. CPFs often went beyond the recommendations of the SCD, and in some
instances, such as Azerbaijan and Côte d’Ivoire, the CPF proposed analytical work
in areas other than those recommended by the SCD, while in Bolivia the CPF was
more selective. In Indonesia and Uganda, where a large body of analytical work
already exists, the value of this exercise was not evident, at least as far as identifying
knowledge gaps was concerned.

GOVERNANCE
The evaluation reviewed the governance and political economy aspects of SCDs and
CPFs in a purposive sample of seven countries: Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Chad,
Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, and Uganda. These countries were selected for
Regional spread (two countries for Africa and one country each in the other
Regions) and because they are known to have significant governance challenges.
One factor heightening these challenges was fragility. Guidance for SCDs points out
that political economy factors are a crucial part of country context, to be used in
identifying constraints, solutions, and opportunities. Guidance for CPFs suggests
three key aspects of governance that may be considered: the credibility and
legitimacy of the government, incentives for pursuing public interest policies, and
capacity of the public administration to implement the policies.

There is considerable evidence from IEG’s evaluation that World Bank teams are
following the guidance, with governance and political issues analyzed and
addressed in SCDs and CPFs, but at different levels of intensity (appendix I).
However, some countries try to influence the SCDs to exclude issues they consider
sensitive and, in some instances, not explicitly addressing key political economy
issues makes the SCD report hard to follow. The issue of weak incentives for reform
is featured in numerous ways, with proposals for incentivizing professionals to take
hard-to-fill positions and to improve results through performance-based
management. Weak capacity is also widely discussed, pointing to causes such as
limited human capital and weak educational and health systems. However, such
analysis misses the point that some governments may take on the appearance of

                                                                                 CHAPTER 4
                INSTITUTIONAL AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
reform, without improving governance outcomes—for example, by supporting new
laws, regulations, and computerized systems, but not their functional
implementation. This is not reflected in the guidance, and it is not apparent in the
SCDs and CPFs reviewed.

Governance features prominently as a key constraint in the SCDs for five of the
seven countries, as an overarching priority, a main cross-cutting issue, or an intrinsic
part of sustainability. Governance is also featured in all seven CPFs, but at different
levels of priority. The Egypt CPF, for example, supports a transformative program to
renew the social contract to support private sector job creation, social inclusion, and
enhanced governance. In contrast, the Bangladesh CPF views governance reform as
a long-term agenda rather than an immediate priority, even though governance is
identified as a risk factor.

Overall, most SCDs and CPFs take governance into account in both analysis and
program recommendations, but the measures proposed to address governance and
capacity constraints are not always commensurate with the shortcomings identified.
Consideration should be given to updating the SCD/CPF guidance so that it
incorporates some of the latest thinking now being presented in the 2017 World
Development Report (World Bank 2017).


Emerging Messages
On the whole, consultation processes have been effective in reaching out to key
stakeholders within the countries to obtain inputs and clarify priorities for the SCDs
and the CPFs. Consultations were held with governments, development partners,
think tanks, civil society organizations, and the private sector. IFC played an
important role in outreach to private sector stakeholders.

The new programming approach has been widely supported by both CMUs and
global practices, and in general the new approach has been working well and with
appropriate internal procedures.

The new process requires more time to complete, and requires additional resources.
Average processing times may decline somewhat as the World Bank Group moves
up the learning curve for the new instruments.

Under the new country engagement approach, IFC’s (and to a lesser extent MIGA’s)
participation in the SCDs and CPFs is now broader than under the previous CAS
approach, and the integration of the IFC program in the SCD and the CPF is
substantive compared with the previous CAS approach, especially for the CPF.


                                                                                       49
CHAPTER 4
INSTITUTIONAL AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
However, for IFC and MIGA staff, the expectations of an integrated, One World
Bank Group approach have not been matched by the available resources.

The new analytical approach in the SCDs still reflects mostly a one-size-fits-all
treatment of private sector issues, with limited new information coming from the
diagnostics of private sector constraints. Private sector analysis in the SCDs needs to
go beyond general policy constraints to include a more business-oriented and
granular analysis of a country’s private sector.

The new approach does a reasonable job of addressing cross-cutting themes,
although the treatment of gender has not been fully consistent with World Bank
commitments. The programming implications of gender discussed in SCD priorities
are only partially addressed in CPFs. CPFs are much more likely to refer to what is
being done in the existing portfolio to address gender issues than to propose future
actions (except with regard to analytical work).

The availability of fragility assessments in countries with fragile situations may have
made it easier for SCDs, CPFs, or CENs to integrate fragility within the World Bank
Group strategy for those countries, but the use of CENs needs to be minimized,
limiting its use only to countries facing conflict or political crises, or where the
World Bank Group is reengaging after a prolonged hiatus.

Knowledge gaps are not always identified, and even when they are, the analytical
work proposed is not always consistent with SCD findings and CPF priorities. On
the whole, the SCDs do a better job of identifying gaps in evidence and data where
additional work is required than the CPFs do in addressing them.

Most SCDs and CPFs take governance into account in both analysis and program
recommendations. However, consideration should be given to updating the
SCD/CPF guidance so that it incorporates some of the latest thinking arising from
the 2017 World Development Report. For example, analysis of weak capacity and
recommendations to address it could be strengthened with deeper analysis of the
bargaining among powerful interests needed for such improvements to succeed.

5. Findings and Recommendations
A New Approach
Under its new strategy, the World Bank Group committed to align its activities and
resources to the twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity. It did so by
leveraging its strengths as a global institution to support its clients and work as One
World Bank Group, drawing on all of its constituent agencies. To this end, it
replaced the CAS/CPS with a more evidence-based and selective country
engagement model, consisting of two instruments: an analytical SCD and a separate
CPF.

The SCD is prepared upstream of the CPF and uses evidence-based analysis to
identify binding constraints and priority areas with the greatest potential to help
achieve the twin goals. It draws on consultations with national authorities, the private
sector, and other stakeholders. The SCD is the reference point for the World Bank
Group’s dialogue with in-country stakeholders and development partners on the
country strategy, and it is an input to the broader development dialogue in the
country.

The CPF maps out the strategy for the World Bank Group’s support to a member
country. It starts from the country’s own vision and development plan. The World
Bank Group and the country then draw on the SCD and agree on the CPF objectives,
which are derived from the country development goals that reflect the World Bank
Group’s comparative advantage and the SCD priorities for achieving the twin goals.
Under the new country engagement model, the initial SCD and CPF will be
followed by PLRs for the CPF program, and at the end of every CPF period there
will be a Completion and Learning Review as a self-evaluation instrument, subject to
IEG validation.1


Main Findings
The SCD has provided a useful synthesis of the country’s main issues and
development constraints. The instrument draws on the comparative advantages of
the World Bank Group—no other development partner has a comparable program
range and depth of analytic work. The SCD has been well received both inside and
outside the World Bank Group, including by governments and other donors. With
some variations, the SCDs reviewed identified the main constraints and challenges

                                                                              CHAPTER 5
                                                           FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
facing the countries and the priorities to achieve the twin goals. A limited number of
SCDs had weaknesses in the use of evidence-based analysis to select priorities.

SCDs depend heavily on available analytical material and data. Many SCDs
identified knowledge gaps to improve the evidence base for future policy making;
this was a useful input for the analytical agendas in the CPFs. Data gaps also
inevitably meant that some SCDs suffered from weaknesses in their analysis of
current circumstances and future needs for achieving the twin goals. It is therefore
important that SCDs identify knowledge gaps and data limitations, and that CPFs
aim to close gaps and improve data quality.

The majority of SCDs analyzed satisfactorily the drivers of economic growth and
their impact on poverty and shared prosperity over time, capitalizing on analytic
work done at the World Bank and elsewhere. The analysis of poverty and
opportunities for economic growth was generally strong, although some reports
suffered from outdated data sets. The poverty analysis was frequently accompanied
by useful regional and international comparisons. Analysis of the trends in income
inequality was normally undertaken for countries where poverty rates are below 40
percent of the population.

Fiscal, environmental, and social sustainability aspects were addressed by a number
of SCDs, but other important issues did not always receive attention. With IFC
contributions, the role of the private sector in economic growth and poverty
reduction was more prominent in the analysis. However, there is much room for
improvement in the treatment of the private sector in the SCDs if it is to become the
anchor of economic growth and poverty reduction. Threats to social and political
stability were well analyzed in several cases, particularly when the analyses were
able to draw on a fragility assessment, but not all SCDs provided a sufficiently
robust analysis and identification of relevant social or political risks.

A number of SCDs fell short in the identification and definition of priority areas for
action. There was significant variability in the methodology used to derive priorities
and in the number and nature of priorities identified. Often these were at a relatively
high level of generality—areas to be addressed rather than specific actions to be
taken. Some SCDs identified a great number of priorities. In a few good practice
examples, after defining broad areas, the country team developed a set of
prioritization criteria and identified core program priorities based on these criteria.
The guidance for priority setting could be improved to encourage more consistent
approaches to selecting a limited number of priorities.

CHAPTER 5
FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Governance was highlighted in most SCDs as a cross-cutting theme or prerequisite
for achieving the twin goals. However, a clear approach to governance was missing
in some SCDs, which could have benefited from more systematic cross-country
comparisons on governance indicators and more explicit discussion of capacity
constraints and plans to build institutional capacity in line with country-specific
governance challenges.

The preparation of the first batch of SCDs has been a learning experience for the
World Bank Group and its stakeholders. The processes were broadly satisfactory,
with numerous consultations within the World Bank Group at various stages of SCD
preparation and review. Formal reviews enhanced the quality of reports. Corporate
guidance sometimes helped to clarify the guidelines and procedures. The global
Practices were engaged through participation in the task teams and the formal review
meetings. However, integrating the work of multiple global practices in the
preparation of the SCDs sometimes caused friction, although this was manageable.

On the whole, the consultation processes were effective in reaching out to key
stakeholders within countries to obtain inputs for the SCDs, and subsequently the
CPFs. Consultations were held with governments and stakeholders, but to many
stakeholders the difference between the SCD and CPF consultation processes was
somewhat blurred.

Some of the SCDs discussed elements of the government’s strategic priorities, but
usually without in-depth analysis. The government’s own development strategy
documents were not always available prior to SCD preparation. In some cases, there
were benefits from the preparation of the SCD before or during preparation of the
national plan. This enabled a dialogue at a stage where there was sufficient
flexibility to develop a well-coordinated approach.

Sharing of the SCD findings with country stakeholders has fallen short of serving
the potential public good nature of the instrument. In some countries, the SCD
document broke new analytical ground. In Albania, the SCD had an important
public good dimension—assisting strategic dialogue with key stakeholders and
helping to define an agenda for dialogue on key development issues in the country,
enhancing broader country ownership not only of the World Bank Group program
but also of the country’s own development agenda. All SCDs have been made
publicly available, in some cases with a time lag, but there were significant
weaknesses in the extent to which the document became part of the ongoing
stakeholder dialogue, which reduced its value as a public good. Going forward, it is
important for the World Bank Group to engage systematically and proactively to

ensure wider distribution of the SCDs beyond meeting its own disclosure
requirements.

There is evidence of a modest improvement in the quality and focus of the CPFs in
comparison with the previous CAS/CPSs. Most CPFs included discussions of the
strategic direction and content of IFC and MIGA programs and how these contribute
to the overall World Bank Group program. The focus on the twin goals in the SCDs
helped program selection in the CPFs, and their selection of objectives has clearly
improved. The requirement in the guidance note (World Bank Group 2014) for the
intervention logic to be specified increased attention to the links between objectives
and their indicators, and the definition of monitorable and measurable results for
the indicators was a strong point of many of the CPFs reviewed.

Most CPFs clearly benefited from the SCDs and from consultation processes.
However, many did not systematically address the priorities identified in the SCD—
strategic priorities, knowledge gaps, or data gaps.

Most CPFs referred to the three criteria for selection of program priorities but were
influenced heavily by the ongoing program. The World Bank Group’s guidance note
for the CPF (World Bank Group 2014) identifies three criteria for the selection of
program priorities: alignment with the priorities identified in the SCD, alignment
with the government’s own priorities, and the World Bank Group’s comparative
advantages. In practice, it was evident that there was a fourth criterion—the
priorities reflected in the World Bank Group’s ongoing operations program, whether
or not these were consistent with the other criteria.

The SCD identification of development constraints and priorities was an important
input to help the CPF focus the World Bank Group’s program. In a number of
countries, the identification of key priorities by the SCD implied a significant shift in
emphasis in the World Bank Group’s program. Although one-to-one alignment
between the CPF and SCD priorities was not expected, the CPFs did not do a good
job of explaining the reasons for their differences with the SCD’s priorities. And
when there was tension between the new SCD priorities and the existing lending
program and pipeline, there was little evidence in the CPFs of an assessment about
the relevance of the ongoing program. One useful approach, found in a few CPFs,
was to distinguish clearly between the ongoing programs and the new priorities that
could be supported by the CPF.

The lack of discussion of the alignment between the World Bank Group and
government programs was an important shortcoming in the CPFs reviewed. Often
the priority areas of the government plan were merely listed, with a statement that



                                                                                       55
CHAPTER 5
FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
the World Bank Group objectives were aligned. In practice, even where there is
apparent alignment, the weight that governments give to growth relative to poverty
reduction and shared benefits may be different from that of the World Bank Group.

All CPFs mentioned the comparative advantage of the World Bank Group as a
criterion for the selection of priority objectives. In practice, the CPFs referred to
absolute advantages such as the World Bank’s convening power or its ability to
combine analytic work with operational support. The comparative advantage of the
World Bank Group depends not just on its own capacities, but on those of the
government and development partners as well. But the treatment of development
partner programs was uneven. Only a handful of CPFs provided a systematic analysis
of what other donors were doing and what the implications were for the World Bank
Group program.

There are indications—fewer objectives and well-defined indicators under each
objective—that the programs under the CPFs are becoming more selective, but
deficiencies remain in the results frameworks. Many of the operations listed were
peripheral to the achievement of that objective. At the same time, the CPF format
did not seem to give enough attention to nonlending activities, including
institutional development and capacity-building programs. Indicators in the results
framework tended to be based largely on the existing program. Results for the first
three years were accounted for almost entirely by the existing program. A number of
results frameworks were confined to indicators for the first three years and did not
reflect potential new activities. The results framework needs to make a clearer
distinction between the ongoing operations and the newer program objectives to be
developed in the coming years, as has been done in a few of the CPFs.

The definition of the CPF results chain remains a work in progress. The guidance
note (World Bank Group 2014), which asks for the “intervention logic” to be
specified in the results framework, has helped to focus more attention on the links
between the objectives (defined broadly and directionally) and the particular
objectives indicators (with targets) selected as proxies for the achievement of the
objectives. The definition of monitorable and measurable indicators for the results
was a strong point of many of the CPFs reviewed, and in general the reviews found
this part of the results chain to be well handled. However, the role of the World
Bank Group’s program in contributing to the achievement of these outcomes was
often not clearly explained, and only in a very few cases did the results matrix
include information about the role of the programs supported by other development
partners in achieving the objectives.

                                                          FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
All CPFs used SORT, but the instrument may need to be adapted to increase its
relevance at the country level. CPF teams have been conservative in their risk
assessments. But the description of risks was often generic, and the risk mitigation
or risk adaptation strategy was often vague, with a lack of a clear distinction
between World Bank and IFC programs that normally have different risk profiles. It
was also evident that some SORT elements have little relevance for country-level
risk analysis. The SORT may need to be adapted for the CPF, with an increased
focus on how the World Bank Group is addressing systemic operational risks at the
country level and on the interplay between program design and operational risk.

A CEN was used on a limited number of occasions when a full-scale SCD/CPF was
seen as premature. The guidelines (World Bank Group 2014) stipulate that a CEN
may be used in countries facing conflict or political crisis, or when there is
reengagement after a prolonged hiatus, and lack of a knowledge base prevents
formulation of detailed objectives or a medium-term program. The review of six
country cases found inconsistencies in the application of current CEN guidelines.
Half of the CENs reviewed lacked the basic elements that would allow an analysis of
performance and lessons, and most of them did not make sufficient provision to
ensure that key knowledge gaps would be filled in time for the teams to prepare an
SCD and CPF before the end of the CEN cycle. There were also inconsistencies in the
CENs on time dimensions, overall justifications, and length of the documents.

The new country engagement model required more time to complete and more
resources than the previous CAS. Compared with the latest CASs for the reviewed
SCDs/CPFs, the time spent on production of the CPF was less than on the previous
CAS, but the SCD required additional preparation time. Consequently, overall costs
for the new model (for the World Bank alone) nearly doubled. For the two
instruments together, the average elapsed time increased from 231 days to 388 days
under the new model. The average processing times may decline as the World Bank
Group moves up the learning curve for the new instruments.

The One World Bank Group approach has promoted multisectoral consultations
within the World Bank, and between the World Bank and IFC, with the latter
providing analyses on private sector issues, but budget constraints remain. IFC’s
participation in the SCDs and CPFs was broader than under the previous CAS
approach, which led to improved coordination among World Bank Group entities.
IFC was more involved in shaping the World Bank Group country strategy and
gained more knowledge from the stakeholder consultations. IFC’s role in promoting
corporate governance and improved labor and working conditions was also useful.
MIGA’s small size, lack of country presence, and operational model did not allow for
extensive participation in this process. IFC does not yet have a mechanism for


                                                                                   57
CHAPTER 5
FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
tracking the cost of its SCD and CPF engagement in individual countries and there is
no allocated budget at the country level for SCD and CPF preparation. MIGA uses a
time recording system code to track staff time and cost of its new country
engagement, which is also funded through its operating budget. Like IFC, MIGA does
not have a country-specific budget allocation for its SCD and CPF engagement.

The new analytical approach to the private sector in the SCDs reflected a one-size-
fits-all treatment of private sector issues, with limited new information coming from
the diagnosis of private sector constraints. The level of IFC participation and the
integration of its contribution varied in the SCD documents. With a few exceptions,
the analysis of private sector contributions to the twin goals was largely from a
government policy perspective of improving the business climate. The private sector
analysis in SCDs provided little information on the profile, structure, and
composition of the country’s private sector. Such analyses in future SCDs need to go
beyond general policy constraints to include a more business-oriented and granular
analysis of a country’s private sector.

Coordination of the strategic focus among the World Bank Group constituent
agencies has improved in the CPFs, but further improvement is needed. Most CPFs
discussed the strategic direction and content of IFC and MIGA programs and how
these contribute to the overall World Bank Group program, but this discussion was
often not adequately reflected in the results framework. While ongoing programs of
IFC and MIGA were generally listed, there was very little on their planned
programs. Expectations of increased joint World Bank Group (cofinanced or
parallel) projects need to be tempered by the country circumstances and investment
climate, as well as by lessons from World Bank Group joint projects.

The new approach did a reasonable job of addressing the cross-cutting themes—
gender, climate change, and fragility—recommended in the guidance on SCDs and
CPFs. Although the treatment of gender was not yet fully consistent with other Bank
commitments on gender, compared with previous CASs, CPFs were generally better
in articulating World Bank Group actions to address specific gender inequalities,
and included many more sex-disaggregated indicators. SCDs indicated that the
World Bank Group’s work on gender is evolving toward skills development and
jobs. Climate change and environmental sustainability received attention in most
countries reviewed, and 18 of the 22 CPFs included objectives to address it. But in a
few countries where it was relevant, climate change was not adequately addressed.
The availability of fragility assessments in countries with fragile situations appears
to have made it easier for SCDs, CPFs, or CENs to integrate fragility within the
World Bank Group strategy for those countries.

Recommendations

Recommendation 1: The World Bank Group should enhance its guidance and
ensure more consistent and focused priority setting in SCDs and more explicit
discussion of strategic priorities in CPFs. CPFs could be strengthened by a
systematic discussion of the basis for the strategic priorities in the country program
and indicating its alignment with or the reasons for divergence with each of the
priorities identified in the SCD.

Recommendation 2: The World Bank Group should disseminate the SCD to
further enhance its potential use by other stakeholders in the country, with
specific steps to be determined by each country team. With appropriate
dissemination, the SCDs have the potential to underpin the development dialogue
both with and in borrower countries.

Recommendation 3: The CPFs should explicitly indicate how the SCD-identified
knowledge and data gaps, which are most relevant to CPF objectives, will be
addressed. SCDs depend heavily on available analytical material and data. The
guidance would benefit from providing adequate discussion in the CPF showing its
expected follow-up to the identified knowledge and data gaps.

Recommendation 4: The World Bank Group should strengthen the results
frameworks in CPFs to ensure that they more clearly reflect the ongoing and new
work programs and results of all types of interventions. This could be addressed in
four ways: first, by requiring CPFs to distinguish clearly between the ongoing
programs and the new programs that reflect the strategic directions in the country,
whose results will begin to materialize primarily in the outer years of the CPF;
second, by more explicit inclusion in the results framework of nonlending advisory
services and activities, as well as institutional development and capacity-building
programs; third, by more explicit inclusion in the results frameworks of the current
and future areas where IFC and MIGA intend to focus their support, considering
constraints from their business models; and fourth, by providing corresponding
training on results frameworks to country teams.

Recommendation 5: The World Bank Group should modify the country
engagement guidance to ensure consistency with the new gender strategy. The
guidance on the country engagement model needs to be reconciled with the directions
provided in the strategy to ensure its consistent application in SCDs and CPFs.

Recommendation 6: The World Bank Group should improve resource
management and budget transparency to strengthen One World Bank Group

participation in the new country engagement model. Budget allocation and
resource management systems could be strengthened at the country level by
improving budget recording practices in the World Bank for greater consistency and
to capture the full cost of preparing the SCDs and CPFs; and in IFC and MIGA, more
clearly allocating, tracking, and managing resources used on the new country
engagement products.

Appendix A. Evolution of Country Assistance
Strategies
1.     Country strategies at the World Bank Group have evolved from internal
management tools to public documents that strive to be country-owned, results-
driven, and flexible.1 For most of its early history, the World Bank engaged with
countries mainly though lending operations, without articulating a broader country
strategy. Internal planning of the lending programs at the country level began in the
early 1970s with the Country Program Papers. When the Board of Executive
Directors began to seek information on the strategy for individual countries in the
late 1980s, individual lending operations began to be put in the context of the World
Bank’s program of country activities. Then, in 1990, the International Development
Association (IDA) deputies asked that strategies be prepared for all IDA countries
and discussed with the Board as part of Bank operations. These early country
assistance strategies (CASs) were 10- to 15-page notes appended to loan documents.
They were Bank-centric and rarely involved consultation with country governments
or other stakeholders.

2.     The Board extended the preparation of CASs to all active Bank borrowers,
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) as well as IDA, in
1992. At that point, CASs were prepared in parallel with internal country strategy
papers prepared for management. In 1994, the CAS became a free-standing
document and the sole strategy document for both management and Board review.
The change to a free-standing document effectively delinked CAS discussions from
lending operations in 1996. With the advent of public disclosure in the late 1990s, the
CAS process began to include consultations with key stakeholders, and ultimately
became the center of World Bank-government interaction.

3.     The starting point for these CASs was the country’s own development
strategy. To ground the CAS program in the country context, a good strategy started
with a careful diagnosis of country conditions and a clear description of the
government’s own priorities and development strategy. Over time, the coverage of
the government’s agenda and development priorities improved, and by late 1997 the
government’s development agenda and priorities were covered substantively in a
separate section of the document. By then, more than 90 percent of CASs discussed
the goals and implementation of the government’s ongoing policy and reform
programs, and roughly two-thirds did so in some detail and relatively well.
However, in fiscal 1998 only about 40 percent of CASs put ongoing reforms in



                                                                                     61
APPENDIX A
EVOLUTION OF COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGIES
perspective by examining the effectiveness of past reforms, and only 20 percent did
so systematically.

4.     The early CASs focused mostly on World Bank products and activities, but as
they evolved, they came to reflect more strategic engagement based on country
development results. As CASs aimed to address an expanding range of issues,
however, they became more complex, less strategic, and longer. They were being
overloaded with goals and agendas. Addressing this concern, the first CAS
retrospective, in 1998, devoted considerable attention to strategic selectivity,
providing quantitative analysis of sectoral selectivity, defining strategic selectivity as a
matter of qualitative judgment based on three criteria, and recommending actions to
strengthen selectivity and focus.2

5.      As experience grew, the focus of the CASs shifted from inputs—a series of
products and activities—to development results. With this evolution, CASs started to
be designed to attain certain development outcomes. Results-based CASs were
piloted between 2003 and 2005, and were mainstreamed after that. The results-based
CAS was meant to help make country programs more strategic, as well as more
selective. The central innovation was the results framework, which specified links
between the World Bank’s interventions and long-term development goals.
Measurable indicators of progress would be tracked through CAS implementation,
encouraging active management of CAS programs and allowing both self- and
independent evaluation. The new approach was expected to create a better strategy,
with greater chances of success and development effectiveness (World Bank Group
2005).

6.     In fiscal 2005, management established a four-year CAS cycle with a midpoint
progress report. It also introduced the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for use when a
full CAS could not be prepared, as typically was the case in fragile or conflict-
affected states or situations (FCS), and it initiated the use of the CAS Completion
Report. Around this time, the World Bank also adopted a new title for the
documents. The country partnership strategy (CPS), as it was now called, was
thought to better reflect a relationship with the country client based on mutual
learning and responsibility.

7.     As it evolved, the CAS also became more flexible, allowing World Bank teams
to customize World Bank services to the country’s own needs and priorities as well
as to changing circumstances. Changes in country demand during the CAS period
meant that the World Bank needed to remain flexible during the CAS
implementation to ensure continued alignment with country priorities. In higher-
income countries with access to alternative financing and knowledge services, as

                                              EVOLUTION OF COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGIES
well as in fragile and conflict-affected states—where needs can change quickly—the
World Bank needed to change and adapt its services during implementation.

8.      As the importance of the CAS increased, it became clear that IBRD- and IDA-
funded activities would have greater development impact if they were designed and
implemented as part of an integrated World Bank Group–wide approach. CAS
guidelines called for joint World Bank-IFC CASs in all countries where there was
substantial scope for collaboration and synergies in private sector development
activities. Synergies ultimately would be a matter of collaboration at the operational
level, but World Bank staff believed that joint CASs could set the stage by
articulating the private sector role—and thus IFC’s role—in addressing key
development challenges.

9.      CASs are often implemented in uncertain environments, and are thus subject to
risks. All CASs now have a section that discusses the main risks, and what the World
Bank intends to do in case a given risk materializes. However, the 2009 retrospective
of CASs (World Bank Group 2009) noted that even when the risks were well
articulated and comprehensive, it was difficult to distinguish how the perceived risk
had been addressed in the development of the strategy, the instruments, and the
choice of interventions.

10.    The 2009 CAS retrospective also pointed out that a CAS was expected to reflect
the existing state of country knowledge; the country program; dialogue with
government, donors, and others; and relationships with stakeholders. While the CAS
was not meant to be analytic, upstream analysis, including analysis of the sources of
growth, macroeconomic sustainability, determinants of poverty, and public
expenditure and financial management systems, was expected to be carried out
regularly, in advance of CASs, and to explicitly inform the CAS diagnosis and the
design of World Bank support.

11.   Despite the evolution of CASs, World Bank staff have identified four
important shortcomings:

      The World Bank’s sector and corporate objectives (such as for infrastructure,
       finance, and social security) have often created tension with the country’s
       vision and priorities. The government may or may not prioritize the strategic
       objectives that the World Bank espouses. Moreover, the World Bank has not
       always appeared to invest resources in a way that would maximize the
       chances of achieving both country and Bank objectives. Weak results
       frameworks were partly to blame—as a list of activities spread across many




                                                                                     63
APPENDIX A
EVOLUTION OF COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGIES
         sectors failed to constitute the critical mass of interventions needed for
         maximum development impact.
        Despite the emphasis on results, some CASs have still taken a transaction-
         focused approach instead of concentrating on more strategic objectives and
         expected development outcomes. While World Bank interventions have
         broadly aligned with the mission of poverty reduction, in some cases they
         have lacked focus and have not concentrated on issues likely to have the
         greatest impact on countries’ development. A need remained for more
         selectivity and focus.
        The World Bank and IFC have not operated in unison in countries. While the
         formality of joint CASs after fiscal 2009 enhanced World Bank-IFC
         cooperation during strategy formulation, cooperation during program
         implementation has remained erratic.
        The discussion of risks has been weak in many CASs, without explicit links
         between identified risks and the CAS program, or without sufficient
         discussion of the ways in which risks would be managed. A more pointed
         identification of risks—and measures to deal with them— was required in
         CASs.

A New World Bank Group Strategy and Its Instruments
12.     Against this background and the weaknesses identified, the new World Bank
Group strategy (World Bank Group 2013) aims to focus country programs on
accelerating progress toward reducing poverty and building shared prosperity
(known as the twin goals) in a sustainable manner. It recognizes that while today’s
country strategies are broadly aligned with the World Bank Group’s mission, they
need to provide countries with more coordinated and focused programs, and
activities and interventions need to be better prioritized according to their expected
impact on the twin goals. It also recognizes that the World Bank Group needs to
establish an effective mechanism to reconcile country demands with the twin goals
and move away from any vestiges of a supply-driven approach.

13.      The new strategy sets two ambitious goals: end extreme poverty by reducing
the percentage of people living on less than $1.90 a day (in 2011 purchasing power
parity terms) to 3 percent by 2030 and promote shared prosperity by fostering
income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population in every country in a
sustainable manner. To accomplish these goals, the World Bank Group would: align
all its activities and resources to the twin goals, use its strengths as a global
institution by supporting clients in delivering development solutions, and work as
“One World Bank Group” by leveraging the strength of all constituent agencies
(World Bank, International Finance Corporation [IFC], and Multilateral Investment

                                                                                    APPENDIX A
                                                    EVOLUTION OF COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGIES
Guarantee Agency [MIGA]). The World Bank Group would strengthen the focus of
its country programs by developing a more evidence-based and selective country
engagement model in the context of country ownership and national priorities, and
in coordination with other development partners.

14.    Implementation of the strategy started in 2014 with a reorganization of the
World Bank Group into global practices. This change was intended to help
accelerate progress toward the twin goals through a new form of problem-solving
engagement with countries. In parallel, the World Bank Group’s engagement with
country members is being revamped (World Bank Group 2014b), as outlined below,
to make country programs more strategic and to strengthen analytical aspects of the
engagements, ensuring that the twin goals are at the center of the engagements,
while also concentrating efforts and resources in areas that are key for the country
development strategy.

15.    Two instruments will underpin the enhanced country engagement model
(figure A.1). A new Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) will use data and analytic
methods to support country clients and World Bank Group teams in identifying the
most critical constraints to, and opportunities for, reducing poverty and building
shared prosperity sustainably, while considering the voices of the poor and the
views of the private sector. The Country Partnership Framework (CPF), evolving
from the CAS, will discuss focus areas for World Bank Group support, aligned with
the country’s own development agenda and selected primarily to address the key
constraints and opportunities identified in the SCD.

16.     The SCD will be prepared upstream from the CPF and will identify priority
areas for the country to accelerate progress toward achieving the twin goals in ways
that take into account the sustainability of the program. The SCD will be prepared in
consultation with national authorities, the private sector, and other stakeholders, but
it will reflect the evidence and analysis of the World Bank Group. It will become the
reference point for client consultations and help focus the country, the World Bank

Group, and other development partners on goals with the most potential for impact
in achieving the twin goals.

17.    The CPF will replace the CAS as the main tool guiding the World Bank
Group’s support for member countries’ development programs. The CPF will
maintain the World Bank Group’s country-driven model and will start from the
country’s vision of its development goals as set out in its own strategy. The World
Bank and the country will further draw on the SCD and will develop the CPF
objectives together. The objectives will be derived from the country development
goals that reflect the World Bank Group’s comparative advantage and align with the
twin goals, as identified in the SCD.

18.    The keys to selecting CPF objectives require that each objective: (a) focuses on
areas identified by the SCD or other analysis as critical for achieving the twin goals
in a sustainable manner, (b) is consistent with the World Bank Group’s comparative
advantage and capacity to deliver based on experience, and (c) is congruent with the
country’s own development goals and capacity to deliver (see figure A.2). In the
end, while selectivity is multidimensional and complex, the Independent Evaluation
Group’s (IEG’s) evidence from country program evaluations and country strategies
suggests that selectivity can be enhanced by paying careful attention to client
country capacities, grounding all operations in solid analytical work, taking a long-
term view and sequencing interventions accordingly, properly factoring in design
and implementation risks to results delivery, and taking account of the World
Bank’s comparative advantage (World Bank 2014).

19.   The new approach is expected to emphasize learning at all stages. During
implementation, the country and the World Bank Group are to engage in a
continuous process of monitoring and learning. Every two years, this will lead to a

Performance and Learning Review (PLR, the third block in figure A.1), which will be
used to adjust the program and to update the Board on progress. The PLR will be
used to flesh out details of development objectives and the activities necessary to
achieve those objectives that were not clear when the CPF was originally prepared
or last updated. At the end of the CPF period, a PLR may be used to extend the CPF
by up to two years.

20.    At the end of the CPF period, the World Bank Group will engage with the
country to complete a self-assessment and issue a Completion and Learning Review
(CLR, the fourth block in figure A.1). The CLR will be both a means to enhance the
World Bank Group’s knowledge and to increase development effectiveness and a
tool for accountability. As part of the CLR, the country team will complete a self-
assessment of the program’s performance, World Bank Group performance, and
how well aligned the strategy was with the twin goals. The self-assessment will be
based on the results framework of the most recent PLR, and IEG will validate the
World Bank Group’s self-assessments and verify its findings.

21.    Working as One World Bank Group—intra-agency cooperation—is central to
the new strategy. The CPF is expected to mainstream joint business planning as the
backbone for strengthening operational collaboration. The World Bank Group is
expected to increase the number of joint projects and review its portfolio of products
and services to improve synergies and eliminate overlap. These initiatives will be
reinforced through stepped-up efforts to align policies and practices and promote
changes in the operational culture of each agency. A new Regional Coordination
Mechanism is to formalize country- and regional-level coordination among the
World Bank, IFC, and MIGA, and help the World Bank Group with its regional
engagements.

22.    The CPF is designed to improve the identification and managing of risks to the
World Bank Group program. The risk section will take a systematic approach to risk,
based on the Systematic Operations Risk-Taking Tool (SORT; figure A.3), to ensure that
teams consider all major risks to achieving CPF objectives, as well as any unintended
adverse consequences that may be associated with the program (World Bank Group
2014a). The risk section is designed to increase transparency by better informing
stakeholders of program risks. Teams are expected to identify risks and propose
measures to manage or mitigate them, and may also discuss the risks of not engaging in
the proposed program, thereby highlighting the program’s risk-reward trade-offs.

23.     The risk assessment will take into account the likelihood of the risks
materializing and the likely severity of their impacts on the achievement of the intended
results. The assessment will be based on current residual risk—that is, after considering
the impact of mitigation measures that have already been implemented, but not
presuming any future additional mitigation measures (figure A.3). The risk categories
have been designed with the intention of capturing the key risks that could affect
programs in CPFs. The categories are: political and governance, macroeconomic, sector
strategies and policies, technical design of program, institutional capacity for
implementation and sustainability, fiduciary, environment and social, stakeholders, and
other.

Appendix B. Methodology
Methodological Framework
1.    The evaluation was designed around a comparative assessment framework of
Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs) and Country Partnership Frameworks
(CPFs). The methodological design included the following components:

        Assessment templates were developed for the SCDs and CPFs, each
         comprising 4 dimensions with 22 (for SCD) and 28 (for CPF)
         indicators/questions, respectively.
        Twenty-two desk-based assessments of the SCDs and CPFs were conducted
         following the dimensions and indicators of the templates. These covered all
         documents for which the CPFs had been discussed by the Board through end
         of April 2016.
        Ten selected country visits (out of the 22 countries) were conducted to
         validate and deepen the desk-based assessments. The selection of countries is
         elucidated in appendix C.
        As part of the above, interviews were conducted with selected stakeholders at
         the headquarters of the World Bank Group and at the country level as part of
         the country visits. In addition, interviews were conducted with other World
         Bank Group representatives engaged in the SCD and/or CPF processes,
         including all six World Bank chief economists.

2.     The templates for assessing the SCDs and CPFs were initially designed on the
basis of the guidelines for SCD and CPF preparation, the World Bank Group
Strategy of October 2013, and a note on the new approach to World Bank Group
country engagement. Subsequently, they were applied to a few pilot cases, and the
final version of templates incorporated the lessons learned from those pilots, as well
as lessons learned by IEG and presented in learning notes on results frameworks,
selectivity, and World Bank-International Finance Corporation (IFC) cooperation.

SYSTEMATIC COUNTRY DIAGNOSTICS

3.    The following dimensions were assessed in the SCD review—these were
determined as the core dimensions in the respective SCD guidelines:

        Evidence basis and framing of the issues
        Growth, poverty and shared prosperity, and sustainability
        Identification of priorities for achieving the twin goals

                                                                            METHODOLOGY
      Process and One World Bank Group.

4.     The accompanying template provides the questions that were answered for
each dimension. The evaluators rated each dimension using a six-point scale based
on criteria set out in the attached rating scale table (table B.1).

5.     Evidence basis and framing of the issues assessed the quality of the background
analytical work and data the SCD used to frame the main issues and challenges
facing the country in question. It also assessed how the SCD identified and
addressed data gaps and weaknesses found during its production.

6.      Growth, poverty and shared prosperity, and sustainability assessed whether the
SCD convincingly showed the key opportunities and constraints the country faces. It
assessed whether sources of growth were properly identified, their impact on
poverty and inclusiveness, and prospects of economic growth (fiscal and debt),
social, and environmental sustainability. These issues were analyzed against the
background of the twin goals.

7.     Identification of priorities for achieving the twin goals assessed whether the SCD
identified some key areas (sufficiently narrow in scope to reflect an effective
prioritization process) on the critical path to reducing poverty and enhancing shared
prosperity, including progress achieved so far. The report assessed whether future
priorities are in the context of growth, inclusiveness, and sustainability. This
dimension also assessed whether the SCD had an adequate discussion of trade-offs
between short- and long-term goals.

8.     Process and One World Bank Group assessed whether the production of the
SCD, and any consultation, reflected a unified approach by the World Bank, IFC,
and MIGA to underpin the new country engagement model. It also assessed the
quality of corporate review, and the adequacy of the World Bank Group’s
interactions with the government and civil society stakeholders during SCD
preparation.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORKS

9.    The following dimensions were assessed in the CPF review. These were
designated as the core dimensions in the respective CPF guidelines:

      Alignment with country development priorities and the World Bank Group’s
       opportunities to achieve the twin goals identified in the SCD, and
       sustainability
      Country ownership, realism, and selectivity


                                                                                         71
APPENDIX B
METHODOLOGY
        Quality of results framework and systematic risk assessment
        One World Bank Group.

10.    As with the SCD, for each dimension of the assessment the evaluators
provided a rating on the six-point scale based on criteria set out in the attached
rating scale table.

11.     Alignment with country development priorities and the twin goals and sustainability
assessed whether the CPF (following its guidance note, World Bank Group 2014)
found the proper intersection between country development goals and
opportunities to achieve the twin goals identified in the SCD when putting together
the World Bank Group interventions and the results framework of the program.
Clarity of the country’s development strategy and definition of its priorities in the
CPF were key in that assessment. The sustainability of policies was also assessed in
this section.

12.    Country ownership, realism, and selectivity assessed the extent to which the CPF
took advantage of consultations with stakeholders—and particularly with the
government—to develop a program whose success will be enhanced by an adequate
assessment of country capacity and government commitment to the policies. This
section also assessed selectivity by evaluating whether resources were concentrated
in areas representing an adequate intersection of country development goals, the
twin goals, and the World Bank Group’s comparative advantage. And it looked at
whether proposed analytic work was relevant and consistent with CPF priorities
and SCD findings. Moreover, it assessed the extent to which the CPF adequately
considered major risks to the implementation of the World Bank Group program,
and options to manage the most serious ones.

13.    Quality of results framework and systematic risk assessment assessed the
appropriateness and realism of the results framework, focusing on the results chain
running from World Bank Group interventions to specified outcomes. It also
assessed whether objectives were achievable, outcome indicators were appropriate
to measure progress toward the objectives, and whether they were measurable and
systematically tracked. The CPF results frameworks were compared with the results
frameworks for the previous CASs for the same countries.

14.    One World Bank Group assessed evidence of appropriate collaboration
between the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA in working toward CPF objectives, and
whether the results framework offered evidence of joint interventions by these
institutions.

                                                                          METHODOLOGY
DOCUMENTATION

15.   The IEG reviewers had access to relevant documentation for the SCD and
CPF review. The main documents were the following:

      Concept notes for the SCD and CPF
      SCD decision draft
      CPF decision draft
      CPF Board version
      Minutes of the Operations Committee and Regional Operations Committee
       (ROC) meetings for the SCD and CPF
      Comments provided in the context of the Operations Committee and ROC
       meetings
      Latest International Monetary Fund Article IV Consultation
      Other relevant recent reports.

INTERVIEWS WITH MANAGEMENT, STAFF, BORROWER, STAKEHOLDERS, AND PARTNERS

16.    After the desk review and initial assessment of the SCD and CPF, the
reviewers identified information gaps and determined whether it was necessary to
interview specific people, specifying the proposed agenda and questions. The
interview took the form of e-mails, phone calls, face-to-face meetings, or short
questionnaires. During field visits, the IEG teams met stakeholders in the country
(from government, disenfranchised groups, academia, the private sector, and
nongovernmental organizations, among other groups) and multilateral and bilateral
partners, to validate consistency of views reflected in the SCD and CPF documents.
The task manager for the evaluation signed off on all the interviews.

QUALITY ASSURANCE OF THE SCD/CPF ASSESSMENTS

17.    Reviewers received detailed instructions on the application of the templates.
To further ensure consistency between assessments, to reduce possible inter-
reviewer bias, and to enhance their quality, all assessments were reviewed by the
task team leader. Any differences in viewpoints were discussed and resolved
through dialogue between the task team leader and the reviewers of the individual
assessments.

       clear any divergence of views between the country and the World Bank
       Group?
      Does it highlight any country poverty or prosperity goals and discuss how
       they align with the twin goals?
      Does the CPF provide a concise description of the country’s poverty and
       income distribution patterns and trends, including at least poverty trends
       using national and international poverty lines, inequality measures, and
       income/consumption growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population?

         reflected in broad commitment (particularly from the government) and in the
         design of the strategy?
        is the World Bank Group’s country program matched to country capacity and
         appropriately estimated government commitment?
        are the program objectives consistent with the World Bank Group’s
         comparative advantage?
        do CPF objectives concentrate resources into critical areas where they will
         have the most development impact (intersection of country development
         goals, twin goals, and World Bank Group comparative advantage)?

C. Quality of results framework and systematic risk assessment

         CPF’s targeted outcomes?
        Are results chains from interventions to outcomes explained sufficiently,
         including any scaling-up of interventions expected to achieve the targeted
         outcomes? Are obstacles to be overcome, logical causality, assumptions, and
         risks highlighted?

       Mechanism, with joint implementation work (World Bank, IFC, MIGA) where
       relevant, and timely inclusion of IFC and MIGA in joint work?
      How meaningful was donor coordination in the preparation of the CPF?
      Are there program complementarities (World Bank, IFC, MIGA) in achieving
       common goals, and are those complementarities expressed in the results
       matrix?
      Is IFC working on poverty issues? Are IFC and MIGA interventions included
       in the results framework with appropriate, measurable indicators?
      Is there evidence of joint work of the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA in specific
       interventions?

RATING SCALE FOR SCD/CPF PROCESS QUESTIONNAIRE

18.    For internal evaluation purposes, the responses to the questions were rated
on a six-point scale using the criteria in the table below. This rating system was a
tool for the aggregation and reporting of specific evaluation findings. The ratings on
individual questions were aggregated to arrive at an overall rating for each block of
issues under the SCD process and the CPF process. The overall rating for each block
was the simple average of the ratings for each question under the block, giving equal
weight for all the questions. The possibility of using unequal weights was
considered during the evaluation if warranted by special issues, but no such
weighting was found necessary.

Appendix D. Poverty Reduction and Shared
Prosperity in Systematic Country Diagnostics
19.    In 2013, as part of its new corporate strategy (World Bank Group 2013), the
World Bank Group adopted two ambitious goals: ending extreme poverty globally
and boosting shared prosperity in every country in a sustainable way. This appendix
assesses progress toward meeting the first goal on the basis of changes in the rate of
extreme poverty, using the World Bank’s newly estimated international poverty
standard of $1.90 a day in income or consumption expenditure. The target is to
reduce the extreme poverty headcount rate from 12.7 percent of the population in
developing countries in 2012 to 3 percent by 2030. The second goal is measured by
the growth in the average income or consumption expenditure of the poorest 40
percent of the population in each country.

20.    A major challenge in measuring progress toward achieving the twin goals is
the lack of reliable data on a significant number of economies. Monitoring trends in
poverty requires conducting household surveys at least every three years. But
despite some progress, 21 countries still have no poverty estimates, and 74 countries
lack the basic data required to monitor poverty and shared prosperity between two
points in time within a 10-year period.1

21.    As part of its evaluation of the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and
Country Partnership Framework (CPF), the Independent Evaluation Group
reviewed 22 SCDs.2 Part of its review examined the quality of the data and analysis
pertaining to the twin goals. It posed the following questions:

         Are the quality of the data discussion and the steps that have been taken to
          address data gaps and weaknesses, including the proxies used for missing
          data, appropriate?
         To what extent is the SCD analyzing adequate and equal opportunities,
          especially the distribution of the gains from growth among the poor and the
          bottom 40 percent and basic elements of social well-being and shared
          prosperity?
         Are the priorities for poverty reduction and shared growth clearly spelled out
          in quantitative terms and are they realistic?

22.       Following are the main findings from this review.




                                                                                      84
                                                                                APPENDIX D
                 POVERTY REDUCTION AND SHARED PROSPERITY IN SYSTEMATIC COUNTRY DIAGNOSTICS

Data Quality
      Eight of the 22 country cases reviewed (Botswana, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Arab
       Republic of Egypt, Haiti, Mali, Maldives, and Myanmar) had significant data
       gaps or out-of-date data, and 3 had some data gaps (Azerbaijan, Honduras,
       and Maldives). The data inadequacies adversely affected the quality and
       relevance of the analysis of poverty and shared prosperity, particularly over
       the three- to five-year period leading to the preparation of their SCDs. Most,
       but not all, of the SCDs reviewed identified data issues where they existed.
      Of the eight countries that lacked sufficient data, three (Botswana, Chad, and
       Mali) were in Sub-Saharan Africa, and two (Haiti and Maldives) were small
       islands. Of the four Sub-Saharan countries reviewed for this evaluation, only
       Uganda had adequate data.
      Almost all of the 12 countries that had sufficient data (Albania, Bangladesh,
       Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador,
       Indonesia, Panama, Serbia, Uganda, and Uruguay), including the data
       needed to monitor and analyze poverty and shared prosperity in the SCDs,
       are middle-income countries. Nearly all the middle-income countries in the
       sample had sufficient and up-to-date poverty and shared prosperity data of
       acceptable quality to the World Bank (exceptions were Azerbaijan and
       Egypt).

Analysis of Poverty and Shared Prosperity in SCDs
      Half of the 22 countries reviewed—most of them middle-income countries—
       conducted solid analysis of inequality and shared prosperity in their SCDs,
       though in some, such as Azerbaijan and Egypt, the analysis was based on
       dated data (five to six years old).
      For another eight, mostly low-income countries (Bangladesh, Botswana,
       Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Haiti, Mali, Myanmar, and Uganda), the twin goals
       largely or entirely overlapped during the review period because of these
       countries’ very high poverty levels (between 30 to 50 percent of their
       respective populations). In these countries, the focus of the analysis was
       mainly on the inclusiveness of economic growth rather than inequality.
      In most countries, analysis of shared prosperity was combined with analysis
       of inequality; nonincome correlates of shared prosperity; and, in middle-
       income countries, the challenges facing the middle class. In Europe and
       Central Asia, the focus was on economic growth and how it affects different
       segments of the population and ethnic groups (such as the Roma), rather than
       on inequality or the situation at the bottom of the distribution per se.

Priorities for Achieving the Twin Goals in SCDs
        Nearly all the SCDs reviewed discussed priority areas that require the
         attention of policy makers in achieving the twin goals. There was
         considerable variation in terms of their depth, the inclusion of quantitative
         targets, and realism, however. Only four (Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Egypt, and
         Indonesia) included quantitative targets.

Other Noteworthy Findings
        Most of the SCDs cited improving the income or consumption growth of the
         bottom 40 percent of the distribution.
        Nearly all the SCDs provided the average annual income or consumption
         growth of the bottom 40 percent.
        Only 11 SCDs (Albania, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador,
         Honduras, Indonesia, Panama, Serbia, Uganda, and Uruguay) provided the
         estimated growth in income or consumption expenditures for the bottom 40
         percent between the Great Recession of 2008–09 and 2012–15.
        Many of the SCDs provided the income growth of other groups, such as the
         growth of the top 60 percent or top 10 percent or the mean income growth,
         for comparison, but the comparison indicators selected differed across
         countries.
        The SCDs used a range of inequality measures. The Gini index was featured
         most frequently, but the Theil index and the 90/10 ratio were also used.
        Most of the SCDs implicitly incorporated non-income indicators into the
         understanding of shared prosperity in most of the SCDs, but they rarely
         included data on such indicators among the bottom 40 percent.

Appendix E. Results Frameworks in CPFs
Background—Results Frameworks in Country Assistance Strategies
23.     Early country strategies focused mostly on World Bank products and activities,
but as they evolved, they came to reflect more strategic engagement based on
development results. As strategies aimed to address an expanding range of issues,
however, they became more complex, less strategic, and longer. As experience grew,
the focus of the strategies shifted from inputs—a series of products and activities—to
development results. With this evolution, the strategies started to be designed to
attain certain development outcomes.

24.    Results-based country assistance strategies (CASs) were piloted between 2003
and 2005, and were mainstreamed after that. The results-based CAS was meant to
help make country programs more strategic as well as more selective. The central
innovation was the results framework, which specified links between the World Bank’s
interventions and long-term development goals. Measurable indicators of progress
would be tracked through implementation of the CAS, encouraging active
management of CAS programs and allowing both self- and independent evaluation.
The new approach was expected to create a better strategy, with greater chances of
success and development effectiveness.

25.   A fiscal 2014 learning product reviewed the results frameworks in CASs
(World Bank 2014b). The key conclusions were the following:
        The results-based CAS approach brought several benefits, including the focus
         on results, better alignment between World Bank Group country engagement
         and national priorities, and flexibility in instruments to accommodate
         programming for the increasingly diverse set of Bank clients.
        However, common deficiencies included a focus on outputs instead of
         outcomes, a weak link between designed interventions and outcomes, and the
         absence of monitoring indicators to track outcomes.
        Such aspects are important because several recent evaluations and reports had
         demonstrated that a weak CAS results framework is a key determinant of
         unsatisfactory outcome performance at the country-program level.

26.     The paper noted that the results framework is an integral part of all the
components of the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) process, and saw the
operational results chain as the most critical and challenging task for the development
of the results framework:

RESULTS FRAMEWORKS IN CPFS
        The results chain begins with inputs, moves through activities and outputs, and
         culminates in outcomes, impacts, and feedback.1
        A proper results chain needs to make explicit the underlying assumptions
         about the actions by the government, the private sector, and other development
         partners, including the possible impact of external shocks.
        To the extent that several instruments are mobilized, it is important for the
         results chain to first recognize the synergy between instruments.

27.    To assess the success of a World Bank Group program, monitorable indicators
are needed. This last element of the results framework should be the results matrix,
which is a tool for assessing the achievements of the CAS objectives. It summarizes
the key country goals, the CAS objectives, and the supporting programs of the World
Bank Group, government, and development partners, but most importantly the
outcome indicators.

28.    The paper notes that, in general, good outcome indicators should be close
proxies of the CAS objectives, of the same scope as the CAS objectives (may be
achieved by a set of indicators rather than a single one), measurable and with a
baseline and target, and supported by a data collection system. The paper notes that
intermediate indicators are not sufficient evidence for the achievement of CAS
objectives.

Results Frameworks in the CPF Guidelines
29.  The current CPF guidelines discuss the CPF results frameworks (World Bank
Group 2014):

        The CPF program is selective, with a limited number of CPF objectives that
         concentrate the World Bank Group’s resources in critical areas where they will
         have the most development impact.
        In many cases the World Bank Group is unable to define its program beyond
         the initial years of the CPF.
        The World Bank Group program is presented at the strategic level with
         emphasis on the CPF objectives rather than activities.
        There must be a clear articulation of a results chain for each CPF objective,
         including the intervention logic that explains how ongoing and planned
         activities link to each CPF objective and how the CPF objective relates to a
         country development goal.
        It is particularly important to be clear about assumptions regarding
         contributions from other development partners or the country in regard to
         achievement of the CPF objective.

                                                                  RESULTS FRAMEWORKS IN CPFS
         For each results chain, there should be a brief description of ongoing and
          planned activities that contribute to the country achieving the CPF objective.
         For purposes of future evaluation, the CPF text may identify certain CPF
          objectives as of higher priority than others.

30.       The guidelines then discuss the results matrix that is required as a CPF annex:
         It should provide a concise summary of the results chain articulated in the text,
          showing the linkages between the country development goals, the
          development challenges, and the CPF objectives.
         The matrix presents only the CPF objectives that are expected to be met by the
          end of the CPF period (the text also should discuss longer-term results).
         The matrix should include indicators that provide evidence that the objectives
          have been achieved—they should be both achievable and measurable within
          the CPF period. They can be either quantitative or qualitative, with the former
          having baselines and targets.
         It is best practice for the matrix to include information on data sources.
         If necessary, the main text is used to explain how selected indicators
          demonstrate that a CPF objective has been achieved.
         Teams may include supplementary progress indicators in the matrix if it helps
          in the assessment of progress—and if these are relevant in helping to assess
          World Bank Group performance.

Analysis of the CPF Results Matrixes
31.    IEG undertook analysis of the results frameworks in the CPFs for the 10
countries selected for field missions for the evaluation.2 The CPF objectives and
corresponding objective indicators were analyzed and coded into one of three
categories: process, output, or outcome. Objectives were coded and validated by at
least two people. If there was disagreement on a classification, the team discussed it
and came to a consensus. IEG consulted relevant literature and used the following
practical definitions (World Bank 2014a, 25–28; Morra-Imas and Rist 2009):

         Outputs: Goods produced, activities, products or services delivered, or actions
          taken.
         Outcomes: Behavioral changes, such as increased consumption of goods and
          services. (For this purpose, outcomes included intermediate outcomes.)
         Process: Indicators that describe activities that contribute to the achievement of
          outcomes.

32.   The numerical analysis drew from the results matrixes, but the analysis also
consulted the discussion in the text of the reports of the results frameworks. In


                                                                                           89
APPENDIX E
RESULTS FRAMEWORKS IN CPFS
addition to coding the objectives and the objective indicators, the analysis looked for
explicit prioritization or ranking of CPF objectives, reliance on actions or activities
completed by external actors, and clear inclusion of IFC activities in either objective or
supplementary process indicators. The team also captured information on whether
indicators included a timeline and a baseline/target.

33.       The numerical information is listed in table E.1. The main findings include:
         The average number of CPF objectives is slightly more than 10, with a range
          from 5 (Bolivia) to 18 (Indonesia). Of the 106 objectives analyzed (across all 10
          CPFs), 48 percent are classified as outputs, followed by outcomes (39 percent)
          and process (13 percent).
         Every objective was aspirational in formulation (to enhance, improve,
          strengthen, and the like), and not a single one included a target, whether
          numerical or qualitative.
         On average, there are two objective indicators for each CPF objective (an average
          of 22 per CPF). In contrast to the CPF objectives, most of the objective
          indicators across the sample (56 percent) are outcomes, followed by outputs (44
          percent). Only 1 of the 218 objectives indicators is a process indicator.
         There is an average of 32 supplementary process indicators in each CPF, with some
          variance. The number of supplementary indicators ranges from 12 (Bolivia) to
          53 (Arab Republic of Egypt).
         There is no language in the analyzed results frameworks that indicates that any
          objectives are ranked or prioritized over others. There is language on alignment
          of CPF objectives with SCD priorities, but within the objectives there is no
          differentiation.
         None of the results frameworks references reliance on actions or activities of
          others, though quite a few described partnerships, synergies, and collaboration
          with government agencies and other development agencies.
         Almost all of the objectives and indicators are time-bound, with a time span
          ranging from two years to six years. There is variation within CPFs—not all the
          indicators in the same CPF are measured at the same interval.
         Almost all the objectives indicators included a baseline and target. The
          exception is Indonesia, where 8 of the 45 objective indicators (17 percent) did
          not have a baseline or a target (they are designated as “to be determined”).
         Explicit reflection of the contribution of IFC interventions to achievement of the
          indicators was included for some indicators, but this was not consistently
          adopted for objectives where IFC interventions were referenced in the ongoing
          or indicative program.

Conclusions from This Analysis
      The results frameworks can best be described as constituting truncated results
       chains, with several items missing.
      However, the core intervention logic is often well presented.
      The results frameworks seem to assume (often probably quite reasonably) that
       the objectives relate to country development goals, but this is sometimes not
       discussed very clearly. As one illustration, the Uganda CPF explains (in
       paragraph 70) that the World Bank Group will continue supporting key
       government (Second National Development Plan) priorities. This seems a
       rather short way of explaining that the program objectives relate to country
       development goals.
      The objectives are formulated in aspirational (or directional) terms and without
       targets.
      The objectives indicators will therefore be vital to determining whether
       objectives have been met. These are often quite narrow, while the objectives are
       typically general and broad. (An illustration is given in the next section.) It
       must therefore be expected that, for example, for the ex post self-evaluation or
       IEG validation, it will sometimes be found that the objective indicator(s) may
       have been met, but not the objective itself.
      There are no examples from this sample of any objectives being ranked above
       others.
      There are also no examples of the results frameworks referencing reliance on
       the support or actions by others.

Correlation Between Objective and Objective Indicator—An Illustration
      For the Uganda CPF, objective 1 is “Enhanced economic governance and fiscal
       management.”
      The text of the CPF sets out the World Bank’s broad and long-term ambitions
       and areas of focus, presumably going beyond the CPF period, but this is not
       stated explicitly, and there is no clear sense from the text about where the
       ambitions end for the CPF period. (Thus, the ambitions for objective 1, as set
       out in the text, include economic governance issues, such as addressing tax
       exemptions, evidence-based resource allocation, effectiveness of internal
       audits, improving performance of procurement systems, implementation of
       fiscal decentralization, preparing to leverage the benefits of oil, and various
       steps to strengthen country systems for transparency, participation, and
       accountability.)
      The two objective indicators in the results matrix for objective 1 seem limited
       relative to the objective, as well as to the ambitions described in the text. One


                                                                                       91

      indicator relates to decentralized spending in health and education, and one to
      non-oil domestic revenue in percent of gross domestic product. These
      indicators scarcely cover all the areas of ambition and work, and it is therefore
      easy to imagine circumstances under which the indicators may be met, but not
      the objective itself.

Appendix F. Country Engagement Notes
Introduction and Scope
34.    In April 2014, the World Bank Group introduced a new approach to country
engagement to better serve its clients and support the twin goals of eliminating
extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The
central mechanism of the approach, the CPF, is designed to help the World Bank
Group to selectively address areas with the most potential to affect countries’ efforts
to achieve the twin goals. The approach relies on an SCD, which will present a
timely and evidence-based assessment of the constraints a country must confront,
with a select set of priority focus areas to address these constraints and accelerate
progress. The World Bank Group and the country will draw on the SCD to work
together to develop the CPF objectives, deriving them from the country
development goals that reflect the World Bank Group’s comparative advantage, as
well as alignment with the twin goals.

35.    The World Bank Group guidance for CPF products (World Bank Group
2014b) states that on the limited occasions when a government and the World Bank
Group are unable to define detailed objectives or develop a program for the medium
term, a Country Engagement Note (CEN) will be used instead of the SCD/CPF
process.

36.    This appendix describes the conditions under which the guidance provides
for use of a CEN and examines experience with the six CENs prepared through
April 2016.1 It examines the rationale for use of CENs, as well as their adherence to
the guidance regarding timing and content, the evidence base and knowledge gaps,
the benchmarks and indicators to monitor progress, and the assessment of risks.

CEN Background and Guidance
37.     The Board paper creating the new country engagement approach
acknowledges a lack of satisfaction with the option to prepare an Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) rather than a CAS (World Bank Group 2014a). While initially the ISNs
were intended to be short notes to guide activities in conflict situations until a full
CAS could be developed, country teams were allowed significant discretion in when
to use them. Consequently, ISNs had been used not only in conflict-affected countries,
but also in a wide variety of other situations, including when the World Bank Group
was reengaging in a country after a long absence, when there was a high level of
political uncertainty, and when there was a need to align the CAS cycle with an

COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT NOTES
upcoming country development plan. By 2014, the World Bank Group had produced
27 ISNs, and as many as 3 in a row in some countries.

38.    The Board paper says: “Although ISNs were intended to be short notes that
are not required to have a results matrix, some recent ISNs have been long
documents, setting out long-term objectives with detailed results matrixes. For all
intents and purposes, many ISNs have become two-year CASs” (World Bank 2014a,
4). ISNs were not formally evaluated by the country team, nor were they reviewed
by IEG in the same way as CASs. It had become a concern that the World Bank had
come to rely on ISNs, even in some countries with a large portfolio of long-term
investments, or a large pipeline of future investments.

39.     The guidance for CPF products allows the use of CENs only under four
specific, limited conditions—for countries in transition from conflict or political
crisis, when a country is going through an unusually uncertain period (for example,
preelection, social crisis, natural disaster) that prevents the formation of medium-
term objectives, when the World Bank Group lacks sufficient knowledge when
reengaging in a country after a prolonged hiatus, or in transitory situations when
the World Bank Group does not have the knowledge required to develop a full
strategy. Under all four possible circumstances “the decision to use a CEN . . . is
based on the expected time horizon of the development objectives the [World Bank
Group] is supporting” (World Bank 2014b, 4).

40.    The persistence of fragility is not defined as a crisis. To the contrary, the
guidance stresses that “uncertainty or fragility alone does not justify the use of a
CEN; it is expected that a full CPF will be prepared in most fragile states and volatile
countries” (4). Thus, under the new country engagement model, Afghanistan and
Myanmar prepared SCDs and CPFs although under the previous system as FCS
countries they might have prepared ISNs. Even when a high level of uncertainty
persists, it advises, a CPF should be prepared if the World Bank Group “can
undertake activities with long- or medium-term impact” (4). Furthermore, “the CEN
does not substitute for a full CPF, but bridges a gap until longer-term objectives can
be developed and a CPF prepared” (World Bank 2014b, 4).

41.     While there clearly can be considerable overlaps between the use of ISNs and
CENs, the two main circumstances where CENs may be used are when either an
immediate crisis or knowledge gaps prevent the preparation of a medium-term
strategy. Given the more dynamic and uncertain country circumstances under
which CENs are used, they are expected to have a much shorter cycle—12 to 24
months—than CPFs, which may run for up to 6 years. The 2014 guidance further
clarifies that in exceptional circumstances, a CEN may be followed by another CEN

affected countries is no longer consistent with the guidance, and “CENs are not used
to align the timing of [the] program with the government’s plan” (World Bank
Group 2014b, 4). This implies that a CEN may be permissible if there is an
immediate crisis that prevents formulation of medium-term objectives or if there are
significant knowledge gaps. If neither condition is met, the country team should
adopt the SCD/CPF path. Where knowledge gaps exist “one of the main purposes
of the CEN is to gather enough information through gender assessments, poverty
assessments, fragility assessments, and other key economic and sector work as
outputs of the CEN for the [World Bank Group] to develop a full program” (World
Bank Group 2014b, 17).

Expected Content of CENs
42.     Because CENs will often be prepared in situations where the World Bank
Group has knowledge gaps, it is not required that a CEN be preceded by an SCD,
and it is not expected to contain as much documentation and analysis as a CPF.
However, the guidance note states, “it must contain sufficient analysis to support
the preparation and monitoring of the proposed engagement. . . . [And] when
possible, it is expected to have solid underpinnings, including assessments on
poverty, gender, fragility, and other important aspects of development” (World
Bank Group 2014b, 17).

43.     CENs are expected to be no more than 15 pages, and are to be structured
around the objectives that the World Bank Group expects to help the country achieve
in the short term. A CEN will not have a detailed results matrix, but the document
should describe benchmarks and performance monitoring indicators to assess
progress, which could be in the form of a matrix listing outputs or milestones of
activities. CENs should discuss risks to the World Bank Group program, based on the
SORT. The risk section should focus on the risks to the CEN program achieving its
goals, including the risk of unintended negative consequences.

44.    CENs are not required to have a CLR and are not subject to IEG validation.
However, at the end of the CEN period, teams should conduct a thorough analysis
of World Bank Group performance and lessons learned, which is expected to be
incorporated into the subsequent CPF or CEN. This guidance places the burden
entirely on self-assessment, which led to the proliferation of ISNs in the first place.

Rationales for CENs
45.     Two of the six reviewed CENs were prepared for countries classified as
fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS)—the Central African Republic and
Guinea-Bissau. The Central African Republic has been affected by a recent internal
conflict and is also going through a political transition. Although the country
reached the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative completion point for debt
relief in 2009, a political security crisis triggered by rebellion in the north against an
increasingly exclusive regime resulted in large-scale violence. This deteriorated into
violence based on ethno-religious recrimination, displacement of over 25 percent of
the population, and a significant economic downturn. The crisis created by the failed
rebellion led to a large-scale international response, including peacekeeping
interventions and emergency relief by United Nations agencies and
nongovernmental organizations. The Central African Republic is also one of three
countries going through a political transition. The transitional government began a
national dialogue culminating in the National Forum in Bangui in May 2015, laying
the groundwork for national elections scheduled for October 2015.

46.     The World Bank supported the crisis response in January 2014 with a $100
million package of emergency operations through regular and restructured IDA
lending. The CEN continues the crisis response and maps out the next steps for
recovery and development over 18 months (July 2015–end 2016). “Given that much
of the country is insecure, access for World Bank staff is still restricted, and the
country is undergoing a fragile political transition, a CEN is considered the most
appropriate vehicle to outline the World Bank’s strategy” (World Bank 2015a, 1).

47.     Guinea-Bissau presents a convincing rationale for use of a CEN as an interim
measure. Despite a series of successful elections from 1994 to 2008, the country went
through acute instability, and several governments were overthrown by coups. The
last coup in 2012 paralyzed the country and led to a deep fiscal and poverty crisis.
The use of the country as a transit point for international drug trafficking worsened
its fragility. An elected government is now in place and is showing leadership to
sustain peace and restart development. It is preparing a comprehensive
development program, to be anchored by a list of priority investments. The CEN for
fiscal 2015–16 was prepared in coordination with other donors to support the
government of Guinea-Bissau. The country is also among the first two proposed as a
candidate for exceptional allocation from IDA17 for “turnaround” situations. The
Guinea-Bissau CEN committed to delivering an SCD in fiscal 2016. This document
was finalized in June 2016.

48.     For two other countries, Ecuador and Guyana, the CENs identify political
transition as the primary reason for using this instrument. Both provide further
justifications for the use of a CEN. The Ecuador CEN was preceded by an ISN for
fiscal 2014–15, which allowed the World Bank Group to reengage with Ecuador in
fiscal 2014 and demonstrate its technical rigor, operational effectiveness, and
financial benefits. Under the ISN, the World Bank Group produced a number of
analytical products on informality and the labor market, productivity and
competitiveness, conditional cash transfers, and a national strategy for water and
sanitation.

49.     Although the World Bank Group has had limited engagement in Ecuador, in
addition to the World Bank’s active portfolio of six projects ($718 million), IFC also
has a committed/outstanding portfolio of around $250 million. The choice of a CEN
is attributed to the upcoming presidential elections, scheduled for early 2017, and
the adverse macroeconomic context, which the CEN argues poses a risk to the pace
of implementation of a more comprehensive program. In this case, in IEG’s view the
preparation of an SCD, even with some knowledge gaps, could have positioned the
World Bank Group to offer more meaningful advice to the new government.

50.     The choice of a CEN for engagement in Guyana in fiscal 2016–18 is also
attributed to uncertainty arising from political transition. In this case, however, the
new government had already been elected in May 2015. The justification the CEN
offers is that the government is in the process of preparing their national development
strategy. The CEN was preceded by the fiscal 2009–12 CAS, following which the
World Bank Group’s engagement was focused on implementation of activities
committed under that CAS and on addressing requests for policy advice and technical
support through administrative funds or grant financing.


                                                                                     99

COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT NOTES
51.     New lending resumed in fiscal 2014, leading to a doubling of the IDA portfolio
in fiscal 2014–15. The resumption of lending and the presence of a new government
could also have been seen as an opportunity to prepare an SCD to inform the national
development strategy. The CEN claims there was an absence of poverty data.
However, the data cited on education, health, and water supply and the references to
analytical work conducted by other agencies suggest there was sufficient knowledge
to undertake an SCD, which could have identified further knowledge gaps to be filled
in the next cycle. While a CPF could perhaps have awaited the government’s
development strategy, delaying the preparation of an SCD is a missed opportunity
based on underestimating its potential value.

52.    The rationale for both Turkmenistan and Fiji is reengagement. In
Turkmenistan, the World Bank Group has had limited involvement, but it reengaged
with the country in 2012 with a knowledge-based program financed largely through
reimbursable advisory services (RAS). Prior to the CEN, engagement was based on
the ISN for fiscal 2014–15, which covered RAS activities on macroeconomic statistics,
financial sector development and support for privatization, and strategic studies on
reform priorities. The previous ISN also included an IFC program supporting the
government’s privatization program.

53.    While the country has maintained an impressive growth record largely based
on extractive industries, the CEN argues that the paucity of poverty data and
uncertainty about a medium-term engagement make a CEN a more appropriate
vehicle for World Bank Group engagement. The CEN envisages continuing with the
World Bank’s knowledge-based program with four main areas of engagement:
improving data for policy making and governance, financial sector modernization,
enhancing competitiveness, and managing natural resources efficiently. IFC will
participate in the last two of these through advisory services, and possibly as an
investor. MIGA has no current engagement but will explore opportunities for
guarantees to potential investors.

54.    The CEN for Fiji was the first country strategy for the country and marks the
resumption of IBRD lending after a 20-year hiatus. It followed the democratic
elections in September 2014, which provided civilian legitimacy to Commodore
Bainimarama, who initially came to power through a coup in 2006. The World Bank
Group had extended no new lending to Fiji since 2005. Following the 2014 elections,
Fiji was readmitted to the Commonwealth, and the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat
and Australia and New Zealand have lifted all sanctions. The Asian Development
Bank endorsed a new CPF in December 2014, and immediately approved a new
transport sector project.

                                                              COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT NOTES
55.    The CEN aimed to rebuild the World Bank Group’s partnership with the
government of Fiji, and for the World Bank Group to deepen its knowledge base.
The CEN was accompanied by a $50 million transport sector loan, with a provision
for another $75 million for another operation whose content has yet to be
determined. However, it should be noted that the country department had
previously operated with a regional strategy for Pacific Island countries, and going
forward it is preparing a regional SCD, to be followed by a regional CPF.

The Relevance of Time
56.    In this section, the CENs are assessed along three time dimensions:
immediacy of the crisis or transition, the time frame of the CEN, and the duration of
the program proposed by the CEN (table F.2). On the first dimension, Ecuador
seems questionable. On the second and third dimensions, the Fiji CEN seems
inconsistent with the two-year limit for CENs.

57.     Most country teams justify CENs on the basis of political transitions. With the
exception of Turkmenistan, all the CENs provide a justification based on timing,
which they argue prevents the formulation of a medium-term program. On this
criterion, the Fiji, Guinea-Bissau, and Guyana CENs follow a recent election, and the
Central African Republic CEN immediately precedes an election. Fiji and Guinea-
Bissau are also countries where the World Bank Group is reengaging after a hiatus
of several years, and Guinea-Bissau and Central African Republic have also been
adversely affected by political instability, conflict, and fragility. Fiji has been
relatively stable and performed well economically compared with its peers in the
Pacific Islands, but was ostracized by development partners after the 2006 coup. In
Ecuador, where elections are not scheduled until 2017, there is no immediate crisis.
The argument that this is a preelection period, which provides a level of uncertainty,
is unconvincing, because it is not very different from the nature of World Bank
Group relations over the past few years or from conditions in other World Bank
Group clients from time to time. The CEN is clearly buying time in the hope that the
2017 election will bring about a change toward a more responsive government.
Turkmenistan is in a different league. Timing is not a factor. Its knowledge-based
program is driven largely by RAS, and the World Bank is trying to reestablish itself
as a reliable and trustworthy partner.

58.     Most of the CENs have a two-year time frame. World Bank Group guidance
says that CENs are expected to have a 12–24-month cycle, with a maximum limit of
two years. Except for Fiji, all the CENs are at the upper limit. The Fiji CEN was also
put forward as a two-year CEN to build the World Bank Group’s “partnership with
Fiji, deepen its knowledge base, and support critical investments” (World Bank

2015b, 1), but the program is actually longer. The timing of deliverables starts in
March 2015 (implying it started earlier) and continues through June 2017, making it
at least a 28-month CEN.

59.      The program duration indicates a short time horizon for the lending and
advisory services and analytics programs in most CENs. Without prejudging
whether it was feasible to propose a medium-term program in some of these
countries, the actual programs put forth in five of the six CENs are consistent with
the guidelines of focusing on short-term objectives—strengthening institutions,
restoring basic services, providing short-term livelihood support, and undertaking
analytical work to fill knowledge gaps in areas of mutual agreement. The program
in Fiji, however, appears to be more like a medium-term program. The Transport
Infrastructure Investment Project, financed by the IBRD, which accompanied the
CEN, may not be completed within the time span of the CEN. And the provisioning
of $75 million for another operation—either an investment project in agriculture,
energy, tourism, or fisheries, or a development policy operation in public sector
reform—which had not even been determined by the Board date, is even more likely
to exceed the short-term objective of a CEN.

Consistency with Guidance on Content
22.    In this section, the CENs are assessed against guidance provided on the
length of the document, the evidence base and knowledge gaps, the indicators
proposed to monitor progress, and risk assessment.

23.     None of the six CENs reviewed met the page limit prescribed by World Bank
Group guidance, which clearly provides for a maximum of 15 pages. The main body
of the text alone ranged from 17 to 23 pages. With the annexes, the CENs ranged
from 30 to 85 pages. Either the guidance needs to be revised, or more stringent
systems introduced to prompt adherence to the guidance.

24.      Most of the CEN countries had a paucity of current data on poverty. Despite
the country’s fragility, analytical work in Guinea-Bissau was well under way, and
this is the only CEN country to have undertaken an SCD, discussed in the Board in
June 2016. The World Bank Group prepared a Country Economic Memorandum
(CEM), a fragility assessment, and analytical work in the health sector. Further work
on poverty is planned in the form of poverty mapping and a poverty and social
impact analysis of the cashew sector, the country’s main cash crop.

25.     Analytical work in the Central African Republic has focused largely on
fragility and the conflict context. The CEN draws on several relevant pieces of
analytical work, which are also included as four separate annexes on conflict and
fragility analysis, armed groups, displacement, and pastoralism and conflict.
Although the CEN briefly describes the economic context, it appropriately focuses
on stabilization and services to rebuild livelihoods.

26.   Poverty data in Fiji and Guyana are based on household surveys done in
2008/2009 and 2006, respectively. The CEN for Fiji commits to update the poverty

assessment based on the 2013/2014 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. It
also ambitiously plans a CEM and an SCD by June 2016, and a country gender
assessment by December 2016. However, there is no evidence that these have been
prepared, or are even well under way. The Country Management Unit (CMU) is
now reported to be preparing a regional SCD and CPF. Since poverty data are not
current, accurate measures of poverty are not available for Guyana. The CEN
reports significant improvements in nutrition and child health, but maternal and
reproductive health indicators remain poor. Improvements in education, access to
water, and gender equality are reported, but significant geographical and ethnic
disparities persist. During the previous CAS period, $97 million in debt relief was
approved (see table F.2), but reform momentum subsequently slowed down, and the
World Bank Group did not prepare a subsequent country strategy, although it
resumed lending in fiscal 2014 and 2015. The CEN program envisages $27.3 million
for disaster risk management, education, and PSD, in addition to IFC and MIGA
efforts to support the private sector.

27.    The Ecuador CEN builds on the analytical work done under the previous ISN
on informality and the labor market, productivity and competitiveness, the
graduation process from conditional cash transfer programs, and the water and
sanitation sector. The World Bank Group also initiated RAS activities on
competitiveness in global value chains. Macroeconomic data support the analysis of
drivers of progress and the challenges facing the country. The CEN also presents
evidence of gains in growth, poverty reduction, and shared prosperity due to rising
employment and income opportunities, as well as public transfers, although
sustainability remains a concern. This suggests that paucity of analytical evidence
was not a constraint for preparation of an SCD.

28.    Turkmenistan is the most extreme case, since the government shares very
limited data. Recent analytical work done by the World Bank Group generated useful
data on macroeconomic trends and the financial sector, and the government is
welcoming further analytical work on privatization and PSD. The CEN reports on the
country’s social, political, and gender profile. However, there is no mention of a CEM,
a poverty assessment, or a gender assessment, nor is there any commitment to
prepare an SCD.

29.    Most CENs lack basic elements that would allow a thorough analysis of
performance and lessons. CENs are not expected to have a detailed results matrix,
but the document should describe benchmarks and performance monitoring
indicators to assess progress. Among the six CENs, the only two that present a
matrix with indicators to monitor program outputs are from the FCS countries—the
Central African Republic and Guinea-Bissau—while Fiji has a more simplified
matrix of activities, and outputs labeled milestones. The CENs for Turkmenistan and
Ecuador do not have any mechanism to monitor progress, and the Guyana CEN

COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT NOTES
states that performance will be measured by qualitative criteria “derived from
portfolio results frameworks” (World Bank Group 2015c, 14).

30.    Current World Bank Group guidance says that CENs are not expected to
prepare a CLR and are not subject to validation by IEG. But the teams are expected
to conduct a thorough analysis of World Bank Group performance and lessons
learned at the end of the CEN period, which is expected to be incorporated into the
following CPF or CEN. The absence of even a rudimentary results framework in
three of the CENs renders even this limited objective out of reach.

31.    All the CENs use SORT to identify and summarize risks, but only half of them
acknowledge high risks. Not surprisingly, CENs for the two FCS countries—the
Central African Republic and Guinea-Bissau—assess political and governance risks
and macroeconomic risks as high. The Ecuador CEN is also candid about high overall
operational risks, and also rates macroeconomic, institutional capacity, and natural
hazards risks as high. But the Fiji CEN underestimates operational and institutional
capacity risks to the program, while Guyana underestimates institutional and
governance risks (table F.3). Given the modest, knowledge-based nature of the CEN in
Turkmenistan, it assesses the risks to the program as being moderate. While this may
well be true, there is no evidence yet that Turkmenistan will be able to graduate to the
SCD/CPF country engagement model in the foreseeable future.

Main Messages
32.     The guidance for preparation of a CEN allows consideration of the instrument
only for countries in crisis, when a country is going through an unusually uncertain
period, or when the World Bank Group is reengaging with a country and lacks
sufficient knowledge to formulate medium-term objectives. The World Bank Group
has used this option for six countries, of which only two were FCS countries. Of those,
only Fiji embarked on a program with a time frame that is likely to exceed the two-
year time span. Lack of confidence about country ownership for a medium-term
program seems to have been the primary motivation in Guyana, Ecuador, and
Turkmenistan. In several countries, the World Bank Group also lacked the knowledge
base to develop a full SCD that addresses the binding constraints on poverty
reduction and shared prosperity. However, with the exception of Guinea-Bissau, the
CENs have not made sufficient provisions to ensure that these knowledge gaps will
be filled in time for the teams to prepare an SCD and CPF before the end of the CEN
cycle.

33.   In comparison with the SCD/CPFs prepared under the new country
engagement model, the CENs have had a rather cursory treatment of cross-cutting

                                                                                      APPENDIX F
                                                                        COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT NOTES
themes. Fragility received adequate attention in the two FCS countries, but fragility
risks were underestimated elsewhere. The treatment of gender issues was rather
superficial in the few cases where it was discussed. And despite references to
climate risks in Fiji and Guyana, these risks were undervalued in the CENs.

34.     The creation of CENs has provided the World Bank Group with a nimble
instrument to engage in client countries where a medium-term strategic program
cannot yet be developed. But the CENs run the risk of emulating the previous
pattern of repeated ISNs. If this cycle is to be broken, and countries currently
operating under CENs are expected to contribute substantially to the World Bank
Group’s twin goals, senior management will need to send clear signals that a CEN
should not be followed by yet another CEN, unless there is an immediate crisis. One
way to change the incentive structure would be to remove the discretion from
country teams by mandating an external review of CENs. An alternative would be
to institute an external validation by IEG of the performance review and lessons
from the CEN prepared by country teams.

Appendix G. IFC and MIGA Integration in the
SCD/CPF Process
Introduction
35.    The purpose of this summary note is to analyze the extent to which IFC and
MIGA programs have been integrated into the SCD and CPF process as part of One
World Bank Group, compared with the previous CAS approach. It also describes the
early experience of IFC and MIGA staff with their participation in the SCD and CPF
processes. Finally, this note examines the integration of private sector binding
constraints, challenges and opportunities, and analysis of the sector’s contribution to
the achievement of the twin goals in the SCD and the CPF. The note is based on the
review of SCDs and CPFs of 22 countries that were approved by the Board of
Directors as of April 30, 2016. IEG conducted visits to 10 countries to get firsthand
feedback from the respective governments and other stakeholders.

36.   To implement the 2013 World Bank Group strategy more effectively, a
number of operational and organizational changes were implemented. The changes
were meant to better serve World Bank Group clients and support the goals of
eliminating extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity in a sustainable
manner (the “twin goals”). One important change is the new country engagement
approach, aimed at increasing the strategic focus of World Bank Group country
programs. The approach builds on the previous CAS process and adds
improvements and new features to enable the organization to operate effectively as
One World Bank Group to help client countries achieve the twin goals.

37.     The new country engagement approach was also designed to overcome the
challenges and learn lessons from the CAS experience, especially on the effective
integration of IFC and MIGA into the country strategies and country ownership.
Although IFC, and occasionally MIGA, participated in several CASs,1 the extent of
their integration into the CAS process varied. Reviews of CASs indicate that IFC
became an integral part of the CAS in countries where the institution already had a
significant presence (World Bank Group 2009). In countries where it had limited or
minimal presence, IFC’s contributions were relegated to a few paragraphs or
sentences in the CAS. Several IFC staff interviewed for this evaluation also
mentioned that under the previous CAS approach, World Bank team leaders would
give them short notice—in extreme cases, a day—to draft a paragraph explaining
IFC’s contribution to the CAS.

                                        IFC AND MIGA INTEGRATION IN THE SCD /CPF PROCESS
38.    IEG’s learning note on World Bank-IFC cooperation in country strategy
development found that despite the increase in the number of joint CASs, the
majority of the strategies failed to include specific proposals to implement planned
World Bank Group cooperation (World Bank 2015b). IEG also noted that references
to cooperation were often perfunctory, and joint programs were not reflected in the
results matrixes. In addition, IFC’s country engagement in the CASs tended to be
merely a listing of its planned investment and advisory projects in the country. In
the majority of the strategies reviewed, IEG found that the discussions lacked a
clearly defined structure and implementation plan. World Bank and IFC cooperation
was presented without quantifiable metrics or planned division of labor between the
two institutions, and without any specific, identified outcomes. Monitoring and
evaluation of the impact of IFC activities was also hindered by the absence of
expected outcomes or indicators of IFC projects in most of the CASs.

39.     The underlying reasons for the mixed results in achieving a truly joint World
Bank Group country strategy under the CAS approach included: the differing
importance of the CAS to the World Bank and IFC; different business models; lack of
incentives for World Bank and IFC staff to cooperate; and even unfamiliarity among
staff of the other institution’s procedures and decision-making processes. Concerns
over conflicts of interest and limited resources of IFC strategy officers were also
identified as structural reasons for the low level of intra–World Bank Group
cooperation under the CAS approach. Nevertheless, IEG’s learning note
acknowledged the potential for selective Bank-IFC cooperation to help improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of World Bank Group operations and its development
impact in client countries.

40.     The new country engagement approach is designed to remedy these
shortcomings and strongly emphasizes the integration of the World Bank, IFC, and
MIGA as One World Bank Group at the country strategy level. IFC and MIGA are
expected to participate in the preparation and delivery of the SCD, CPF, the
Performance and Learning Review (PLR), and until the self-assessment or the
Completion and Learning Review (CLR) at the end of the CPF cycle. To strengthen
this remit, a World Bank Group directive, procedure, and guidance were issued,
setting out the process, governance structure, organizational responsibilities, and
templates (World Bank Group 2014b, 2014c, 2015e). Training of World Bank, IFC,
and MIGA staff in the CPF Academy and regular Board updates are also important
pieces in ensuring the effective implementation of the new approach. These
arrangements are reinforced by the Regional Coordination Mechanisms consisting
of regional management teams of the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA.2 The guidance
makes clear that “All CPF components and the CEN [Country Engagement Note]
are joint documents and are approved by the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA” (World

Bank Group 2014b, 5). Sign-off by the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA team leaders is
required to send the SCD and CPF documents for formal reviews. In contrast,
coordination among the three World Bank Group institutions under the CAS
approach tended to be ad hoc and relied mostly on individual teams. It is crucial to
the new approach that senior management of the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA be
involved in the SCD and CPF process.

DOCUMENTS

41.     IFC integration in the SCD and CPF. IFC’s participation in the SCD and CPF is
broader than in the previous CAS approach, with clear internal structure and
workflow. IFC was an integral part of the team in all 22 SCDs and CPFs reviewed by
IEG, even in countries where it had limited operations (Bolivia, Botswana, Chad,
Maldives, and Uruguay). IFC’s participation in both the SCD and the CPF is
coordinated by nine senior strategy officers with global and regional strategy
functions in the Country Framework Engagement Unit in IFC headquarters under
the Office of the Chief Economist (figure G.1). For the first batch of SCDs and CPFs
(Albania, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Panama), the unit’s senior strategy officers
served as the IFC team leaders. They consulted the relevant IFC regional and
industry directors and staff, and country field offices, and gathered and summarized
their inputs.3

42.     Unlike the CAS approach, there is an IFC internal structure for the new
approach. Ownership of the SCD and CPF in IFC rests with the IFC regional
directors and country heads.4 IFC’s internal process involves the regional director
appointing the IFC team leader in the SCD and the CPF, usually the country
managers. IFC team leaders of most CPFs approved after April 2015 (Azerbaijan,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, the Arab Republic of
Egypt, Indonesia, Mali, Serbia, and Uganda) were senior staff from the country
offices.5 Typically, IFC designates the same team leader for the SCD and CPF.

43.    The IFC team leader pulls in industry experts from its global or regional
industry teams on the investment side and the cross-cutting advisory services units
to shape industry-specific discussions. Both the IFC team leader and the IFC strategy
officers participate in internal World Bank Group deliberations, including in-country
consultations, and lead private sector engagements in tier 1 SCDs and CPFs. The
Results Measurement Unit supports in the structuring of the results framework.
IFC’s chief economist or the manager of the Country Framework Engagement Unit
provides oversight on IFC’s inputs into the SCD and the CPF. IFC’s vice president
for Global Client Services approves and clears all strategy documents for IFC and
co-chairs decision meetings and Board discussions for tier 1 SCDs and CPFs. The
CBCCF team (Country Framework Engagement Unit) coordinates and participates
in the working group meetings with the World Bank’s Operations Policy and
Country Services and MIGA teams on the overall implementation of the new
country engagement approach. IFC’s global presence, with some offices co-located
in the World Bank country offices, facilitates participation in brainstorming

World Bank document. IFC inputs and participation in the SCDs are mostly
recognized by the World Bank teams, but the level of participation and integration
of its contribution in the diagnostic document varied. In the Bolivia, Colombia, El
Salvador, Haiti, and Panama SCDs, short industry notes prepared by the IFC teams
were included as annexes, providing background and context to the diagnosis of
binding constraints and priority areas for private sector development. In the
stakeholder consultations for the Albania and Indonesia SCDs and CPFs, IFC led
and moderated consultations with the private sector.6 In the Côte d’Ivoire and
Uganda SCDs, IFC provided important inputs, albeit verbally, that were integrated
by the World Bank team leaders into the SCD.

45.    IFC’s ongoing and new engagements are well integrated in the 22 CPFs—in
the main document and in the results matrix. The IFC program in the CPFs supports
the countries’ inclusive growth objectives and social and economic inclusion goals as
pathways to achieving the twin goals. The IFC program in 15 CPFs was clustered
around the inclusive growth objectives (figure G.2). In most of the CPFs reviewed,
IFC supports two or more objectives. In the Myanmar CPF, for example, IFC intends
to support projects that are aligned with the country’s multiple objectives in the
CPF: poverty reduction, social inclusion, competitiveness, and job creation. In the
Albania and El Salvador CPF’s, IFC’s programs are consistent with these countries’
inclusive growth goals.

finance and financial inclusion objectives in the CPF, and 25 percent support
infrastructure development objectives (figure G.3).

47.    MIGA integration in the SCD and CPF. Compared with the practice in the
CAS approach, the integration of MIGA in the SCDs and CPFs is greater, but
evidence of its inputs is more difficult to detect in the SCDs. The level of its
involvement in both the SCD and the CPF reflects the scale of its operations and
staffing relative to the World Bank and IFC. The volume of its existing exposure in
the country and business prospects drive the extent of MIGA’s participation in the
SCD and CPF processes. Countries where it has large exposures, such as
Bangladesh, Côte d’Ivoire, and Panama, are considered priorities, and its
participation in the SCD and CPF has been more extensive. In the Côte d’Ivoire SCD
and CPF, MIGA was present in all World Bank Group deliberations and provided
verbal comments because Côte d’Ivoire was their largest country exposure in fiscal
2014.7 MIGA also attended World Bank Group meetings and provided written
comments in the Bangladesh and Myanmar SCDs and CPFs because of their large
active portfolio and pipeline of projects in these countries. Its engagement in the
Colombia, El Salvador, Egypt, and Uganda SCDs and CPFs was more calibrated, but
MIGA’s ongoing projects and planned activities were mentioned in the CPFs. In the
SCDs and CPFs for Azerbaijan, Albania, Bolivia, Botswana, Costa Rica, Chad, Haiti,
Maldives, Mali, and Uruguay, MIGA participation was minimal. Nevertheless,

48.     Full engagement by MIGA in the SCD and CPF processes is limited by its
small staff complement relative to the World Bank and IFC. Insurers typically do not
have large staff complements and their operating margins are thin. MIGA has a total
of 120 staff in its headquarters and two regional hubs. The responsibility for
contributing and coordinating activities related to the SCD and CPF rests with the
Economics Unit of MIGA’s Economic and Sustainability Group. The unit consists of
six staff and a manager, all of whom have served as the focal point and represented
MIGA in the SCD and CPF process, just as in the previous CAS model (figure G.4).

49.    The personality of the World Bank team leader and World Bank country
manager/director can make a difference in integration. Several MIGA and IFC team
leaders mentioned the role of leadership behavior in facilitating their integration and
engagement in the SCD and CPF process. When World Bank team leaders and
country managers/directors have reached out to MIGA early in the process, it has
made a difference in ensuring that the agency is well integrated into the SCD and
CPF process, despite the agency’s constraints. In these instances, they brought
MIGA into the SCD or CPF team as early as the brainstorming meetings for the SCD
concept note, ensured that the MIGA team leader was copied in all communications
and invited to all internal deliberations, with sufficient time to provide comments
(Côte d’Ivoire SCD and Uganda SCD and CPF).8 An IFC coteam leader also noted

                                         IFC AND MIGA INTEGRATION IN THE SCD /CPF PROCESS
that the welcoming attitude of the World Bank SCD team leader made the IFC’s
participation in the SCD easier (Bangladesh SCD).9 On the other hand, lack of
adequate communication and coordination within the team can slow down the
process, as it did in the Egypt SCD.10

50.    MIGA activities are mostly aligned with CPF priorities related to inclusive
growth. Of the five CPFs that included MIGA projects in the results matrix, the
projects tend to cluster around CPF focus areas related to growth.

THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT APPROACH BROUGHT POSITIVE CHANGES

51.   IFC and MIGA staff interviewed by IEG recognized the benefits gained from
the new country engagement model and the One World Bank Group approach.
They acknowledged that the new approach has brought about several welcome
changes:

      Improved coordination/collaboration of the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA
       compared with the previous CAS process. IFC and MIGA participation is
       actively sought by the World Bank and is not just pro forma. Several of the
       IFC and MIGA interviewees cited examples of World Bank staff reaching out
       to them (and vice-versa) regarding a related issue or potential collaboration
       as a result of their participation in the SCD/CPF exercise.
      Deeper understanding of the country’s development challenges, their
       underlying causes, and the complexity of the issues.
      Greater understanding of the challenges faced by each World Bank Group
       institution, although differences in perspectives and even institutional biases
       remain.
      Improved ability to fit and design IFC’s program according to SCD and CPF
       priorities and align these with the World Bank Group’s twin goals. It also
       allowed them to situate IFC interventions within a broader strategic context.11
      Opportunity for IFC to integrate its priorities and perspectives in the World
       Bank Group’s country strategy.
      Greater involvement in shaping the country strategy, unlike in the previous
       CAS model, where the IFC strategy team was asked to write a paragraph on
       IFC activities for the CAS, often on short notice.
      Appreciation of World Bank research and analytical materials, which the IFC
       is not equipped to undertake due to limited resources and capacity. Also,
       generating research is not one of IFC’s core functions.
      Knowledge and learning gained from the stakeholder consultations. In
       countries where IFC led the private sector consultations, the SCD and CPF

          provided the platform for engaging with the country’s private sector over the
          long term.12
         Recognition and increasing involvement of MIGA as part of the World Bank
          Group. The new approach has also provided MIGA with greater collaborative
          opportunities within the World Bank Group.

THE NEW APPROACH ALSO BROUGHT FRESH CHALLENGES FOR IFC AND MIGA

52.     The expectations of an integrated, One World Bank Group approach are not
matched by the available resources, and this is an unfunded mandate for some.
There is particular asymmetry regarding the resources available to the World Bank
compared with IFC, and especially compared with MIGA. While the CPF serves as
the budget document for the World Bank’s engagement in the country, it does not
serve the same purpose for IFC and MIGA. World Bank staff can charge their time
against the budget code for each SCD and CPF, but IFC does not yet have a system
for tracking costs related to country level SCD and CPF engagement. MIGA uses the
time recording system to track staff time and the cost of its SCD and CPF
engagement, but not at the country level. This time recording code (unfunded) was
created to track staff time for participation in the SCD and CPF after concerns were
expressed about the amount of time spent on these tasks compared with their main
work program. MIGA does not yet have a separate budget for SCD and CPF
activities. These costs are currently funded through its regular operating costs. IFC
has a slightly different arrangement, whereby some of the expenses are absorbed by
the country offices’ business development and operating budgets. Several IFC team
leaders lamented the lack of dedicated budget for the SCD and the CPF. The level
and depth of participation in the SCD, and especially the CPF process, also
depended on the resources of the respective IFC in-region and in-country teams.

53.    IFC’s “hub-and-spoke” organizational structure can inhibit its integration and
influence in the SCD and CPF. Although IFC has 104 offices in 94 countries, its
Regional and country staff cover several countries, and this had some effect on: (a)
the extent of engagement in the SCD and CPF process; (b) the ability to influence
and reflect its priority issues in the SCD and CPF; and (c) the participation in the
consultations with stakeholders. An IFC manager reported contrasting experiences
with the SCD and CPF process in two countries. She was heavily involved in one
SCD, but felt excluded from another SCD’s consultative process. The local IFC office
was not invited to the government consultations for the CPF, possibly because of the
lack of IFC physical presence in the country. The absence of an IFC senior
representative in residence in another country may have been an obstacle to a more
influential IFC presence and larger role in the CPF and in that country’s economy.13

                                                                               APPENDIX G
                                         IFC AND MIGA INTEGRATION IN THE SCD /CPF PROCESS
54.    The new country engagement process needs greater flexibility with regard to
the frequency of the SCD and CPF. The SCD pulled together what used to be
conducted separately, but repeating the exercise every four to five years (on
average) has high transaction costs, especially for IFC and MIGA, and takes away
resources from implementation. Although the guidance for CPF products allows for
some flexibility, IFC and MIGA staff interviewed by IEG expressed concerns over
producing the SCD and the CPF every four to six years, in addition to the PLR every
two years and a CLR at the end of the period (World Bank Group 2014b). Such
frequency compresses the time for CPF implementation, for monitoring, and for IFC
and MIGA to develop the pipeline of projects in support of the country program.
The new country engagement could allow for greater flexibility than is outlined in
the current guidance—for example, it could call for preparation of a new SCD and
CPF after four years only if there are significant changes in country conditions (or on
the World Bank side). Otherwise, the guidance could allow for even longer intervals.

Areas to Improve
55.     Balancing legacy and new programs in the CPF. The CPFs reflect mostly
ongoing programs, highlighting the difficulty of balancing the composition of
ongoing programs and new projects. The guidance allows ongoing projects to be
included in the CPF results framework and notes that the CPF document should
indicate how the World Bank Group program will shift over time “even if the
activities and objectives under the new direction will emerge only gradually over
the course of the CPF or in later strategies” (World Bank Group 2014b, 10).
However, the guidance is unclear about the appropriate balance between new and
ongoing or legacy projects, as well as the time frame for ongoing projects that can be
included in the CPF results matrix. This balancing dilemma is widely shared across
the World Bank Group, but specifically by the World Bank and IFC. In general, the
magnitude of the ongoing IFC portfolio and MIGA exposure and their business
development prospects continue to guide the level of participation and the resources
(staff and time) devoted to the SCD and CPF process. Sixty-three percent of IFC
projects listed in the 22 CPF results matrixes are ongoing projects, with a few
projects committed as far back as fiscal 2007.

56.   IEG found little evidence that the CPF teams rigorously assessed the
continued relevance of the World Bank Group’s legacy programs. It seems
appropriate that ongoing programs are not discontinued, so that the expected
development results can be achieved. But absent a serious rethinking of their
relevance, it becomes difficult to redeploy World Bank Group funding from poor-
performing or low-priority ongoing projects to strategically relevant projects. It is
important to note that if the CPF objectives are deliberately made to conform to


                                                                                     117
APPENDIX G
IFC AND MIGA INTEGRATION IN THE SCD /CPF PROCESS
ongoing programs that were not identified in the SCD as priority or focus areas, the
World Bank Group runs the risk of supporting sectors, programs, or projects that do
not address the twin goals. This gray area also creates attribution problems when
assessing World Bank Group performance and results in the CLR.

57.     Expectations of World Bank Group joint programs and projects in the CPF.
To the extent that the CPF envisions joint projects, there is already a history of joint
(cofinanced), parallel and sequential projects by the World Bank Group in a country.
For example, there are more World Bank Group joint projects ongoing and planned
in the Bangladesh CPF than in the other CPFs reviewed by IEG. Most of the World
Bank Group joint projects are in the power sector, where the three institutions are
jointly coordinating their support. IFC and MIGA are also cofinancing power
generation projects. However, this One World Bank Group approach to
Bangladesh’s power sector preceded the CPF. There were previous World Bank
Group joint investment projects in Bangladesh’s power sector such as Khulna (IFC-
MIGA), Bibiyana (World Bank-IFC), and several others with advisory and analytics
or Energy Sector Management Assistance Program support. There were also past
joint World Bank-IFC advisory services projects related to public-private
partnerships and the investment climate in Bangladesh, as well as examples of
World Bank and IFC advisory services joint projects envisioned in several CPFs that
had their origins in past cofinanced projects.

58.    Improving the analytics on private sector development constraints and
opportunities in the SCD and CPF. The new approach still reflects a one-size-fits-all
treatment of the private sector, with limited new information coming from the
diagnostics of private sector constraints and opportunities (hereafter referred to as
PSD analysis). Private sector development is explicitly identified as a focus or
priority engagement area in 10 CPFs reviewed by IEG. In the other 11 CPFs, PSD
was subsumed in other CPF objectives.14 With few exceptions, and much like the
previous CAS approach, the analysis of private sector contribution to the twin goals
in the SCD is still very much from a government policy perspective of improving the
business climate.

59.     This perspective is likely the result of relying primarily on the Doing Business
reports and Enterprise Surveys to diagnose private sector binding constraints. The
heavy public sector tilt in PSD analysis also reflects the World Bank’s lead role in
drafting the SCDs, with IFC and MIGA providing substantive inputs. Although the
SCDs linked support to private sector development and growth to the achievement
of the twin goals, the analysis of binding constraints for the private sector is
predictable, presenting a run-down of the same recurring issues. The result is the
continuity of World Bank Group programs related to access to finance through

provision of credit lines for onlending to medium, small, and micro enterprises
(MSMEs), as indicated in figure G.3, and investment climate approaches, which are
then reflected as CPF objectives. Several stakeholders, including IFC and MIGA
staff, interviewed by IEG for this evaluation admitted candidly that they were not
satisfied by the private sector analysis in the SCD and CPF (Albania, Egypt, and
Uganda). However, IFC and MIGA staff do not have the capacity or resources to
undertake the analysis themselves.

 Box G.1. Contextual Analysis of Private Constraints and Opportunities in the Myanmar and
 Haiti SCDs
 Despite the data gaps and lack of World Bank analytical materials on Myanmar, the
 World Bank Group’s analysis of private sector constraints and potential sector
 involvement had more contextual information than the PSD analysis in the other SCDs
 reviewed by IEG. The Myanmar SCD identified the industries and economic sectors that
 present potential for private investment. In terms of constraints and challenges, the SCD
 described the nature of the private sector in Myanmar, which includes the dominant
 state-owned and military-owned enterprises in the economy that effectively stifled PSD.
 The SCD also analyzed which among the different groups of Myanmar’s poor would
 likely benefit from private sector–led off-farm employment. The private sector is expected
 to be the lifeline for the transitional poor. But for the traditional poor, agriculture will
 continue to be their lifeline, and the private sector is not expected to play a large role until
 other constraints facing this group are resolved.
 The Haiti SCD analyzed the historical development of the country’s business elites and
 the linkage to the elite capture of a large segment of the country’s economy today. The
 SCD presented a table on the import quotas held by 19 families and the effect that such
 arrangements have on expanding Haiti’s private sector. The Haiti CPF discusses the
 implications of this historical development for the failure to expand the formal private
 sector in the country and what is required to make this expansion happen.
 Sources: World Bank Group 2014a, 2015b, 2015c, 2015d.


60.    The SCDs lack business-oriented diagnostics of the private sector that could
help with selectivity in the CPF. Private sector consultations should be broader and
deeper. Such weaknesses were prevalent in the previous CAS approach, and they
appear to continue under the new country engagement approach. At minimum, the
SCDs can include information on the structure and composition of the country’s
business sector, the types of companies operating in the country, and differentiate
the industry-specific constraints and opportunities according to the types and sizes
of business enterprises. This implies knowledge about the country’s business world,
and it requires preparatory work and consulting a wider range of business
enterprises and business owners (including nonclients), not just heads of chambers
of commerce or other such umbrella associations. Wider consultations also imply


                                                                                                 119
APPENDIX G
IFC AND MIGA INTEGRATION IN THE SCD /CPF PROCESS
having time to consult stakeholders from outside the World Bank’s usual network
and counterparts.

61.     With the exception of the Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador, Haiti, Myanmar,
and Panama SCDs, private sector analysis in SCDs provided little information on the
profile, structure, and composition of the country’s private sector that could help
with priority setting in the SCD and CPF. In the Azerbaijan SCD and CPF, for
example, the private sector was described as “very underdeveloped,” without much
granularity in the analysis. Yet the membership of the American Chamber of
Commerce, whose executive director was interviewed by IEG, consisted of several
private U.S. and Canadian companies that have invested in Azerbaijan. The
association of Turkish companies in Azerbaijan was also mentioned in IEG’s back-
to-office report from its mission there. The Indonesia SCD and CPF did not include
discussions of sufficient granularity about the country’s large and thriving private
sector.


 Box G.2. One Size Does Not Fit All: Analysis of Private Sector Constraints and Opportunities
 in the Indonesia SCD and CPF
 Private sector analysis in the Indonesia SCD and CPF treated the private sector as a
 homogeneous entity, and the prescribed program assumed a one-size-fits-all strategy for
 PSD. The SCD and the CPF did not analyze the structure and characteristics of
 Indonesia’s private sector, nor were the binding constraints differentiated according to
 firm size, sector, or other characteristics. The SCD and CPF analyses did not mention the
 existence of Indonesian conglomerates that have been operating as large multinational
 enterprises—such as the Salim, Sinar Mas, Bakrie, Lippo, Astra, and Indorama Groups—
 some of which were IFC and MIGA clients. These conglomerates own diverse interests in
 the Indonesian economy, including cross-holdings as owners of banks, insurance and
 leasing, real estate, extractive industry companies, and businesses in other sectors. Private
 sector analysis in the Indonesia SCD and CPF seems to assume that the same problems
 are faced across the sector, whereas the challenges differ according to firm size,
 geographic location of firms and their markets, and other contextual factors.


62.    IFC’s short industry notes in the Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador, Haiti, and
Panama SCDs provided informative, granular analysis of the countries’ private
sector constraints and opportunities that also facilitated prioritization in the CPFs.
These industry notes could be improved and adopted in the next generation of SCDs
and CPFs. In the Panama SCD, IFC’s industry notes became the basis of the SCD
priorities and ensured consistency with the CPF focus areas and objectives. Nine
CPFs have objectives related to PSD, while other CPFs integrated the private sector’s
role into other objectives.15 Considering the private sector’s critical role in fostering
inclusive growth, job creation, and eventually in reducing extreme poverty, World

                                          IFC AND MIGA INTEGRATION IN THE SCD /CPF PROCESS
Bank Group country strategy documents can do better with their analysis of private
sector constraints and opportunities. This would facilitate the selectivity exercise, as
in the Panama SCD and CPF.

63.     Improving MSME analyses in the SCD and the CPF. Most SCD analyses of
MSME binding constraints tend to be policy-oriented, do not provide direction on
“how-to” and the kind of activities that would develop MSMEs, and do not consider
differentiated demand. Increasing onlending facilities or providing credit lines for
MSMEs were listed as CPF objective indicators in 17 CPFs reviewed, but this is not
often backed by an assessment of the needs of each MSME segment within the
country context. The Egypt CPF intended to support MSMEs headed by women and
youth, but other CPFs did not have even this level of targeting. The lack of specifics
will likely present difficulty in determining the effectiveness of the World Bank
Group’s MSME program at the end of the CPF period. As noted in IEG’s evaluation
of World Bank Group support for financial inclusion (World Bank 2015a), the
historic approach of trying to lift the poor out of poverty through microcredit was
built on a set of assumptions that proved overly optimistic. Previous support for
financial inclusion focused entirely on the provision of credit. It assumed that the
poor would invest these funds in productive assets, and eventually be lifted out of
poverty. The evaluation showed that such assumptions were flawed and did not
lead to success, because access to finance was not the binding constraint to start
with. The loan recipients did not invest in productive assets, but used these funds to
smooth consumption and manage their day-to-day finances, or recipients lacked the
entrepreneurial skills required. As the evaluation noted, “only a very small fraction
of recipients were able to develop their microenterprises and thus escape poverty”
(World Bank 2015a, 36).

64.     Eighteen CPFs16 included objectives to help MSMEs as a means to reduce
extreme poverty; create jobs; and achieve shared prosperity, inclusion, and growth.
While these SCDs and CPFs provided the analytic justification (some more than
others) for targeting MSMEs, there are gaps that can be strengthened along the lines
of the recommendations in the IEG evaluations of the World Bank Group experience
with targeted support to small and medium enterprises (SMEs; World Bank 2014a)
and the World Bank Group’s support for financial inclusion (World Bank 2015a). In
particular, the SCD and CPF diagnostics on MSMEs could be strengthened by
adding:

      The profile of SMEs in the country and analysis could address each
       differently, based on existing country conditions. In many of the SCDs and
       CPFs reviewed, MSMEs are treated as a single group, even though different
       firm sizes face different constraints and have diverse needs.


                                                                                      121
APPENDIX G
IFC AND MIGA INTEGRATION IN THE SCD /CPF PROCESS
         The definition of the SMEs being targeted could be using measurable, country
          evidence-based criteria, such as number of employees and annual revenues,
          along with an explanation that the targeted SME group (some of which could
          be a subset of SMEs) suffers from size-specific market failures. Some CPFs
          (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama) provided a definition of
          MSMEs, albeit taken from IFC’s standard definition based on loan sizes—not
          based on country-specific evidence. The Colombia CPF had a footnote that
          referred to using the SME definition from the World Enterprise Survey.
          Although these are good starts compared with the other CPFs that did not
          define the eligibility criteria for MSMEs, there is room for further
          improvement.
         In the results frameworks indicators, it can help to include the impact of
          World Bank Group intervention on the targeted group (not just a reference to
          a generic SME) and on the binding constraints. IEG’s review of the CPF result
          matrixes observed that the recommendation has not been followed.
         For MSME support channeled through financial intermediaries, a results
          framework that considers the evolution of the financial intermediary’s
          distribution of the MSME portfolio plus the composition of the beneficiary
          institutions and firms. This would ensure that the benefits are shifted from
          better-served firms and markets into underserved segments. In the CPF
          results matrixes reviewed by IEG, the indicators focus on outputs (number
          and volume of loans or MSME beneficiaries) instead of outcomes.


 Box G.3. Support for SMEs in Bolivia’s CPF: Incorporating Lessons from the CLR
 In the Bolivia CPF, IFC’s program envisions providing credit lines to two financial
 institutions for onlending to MSMEs under CPF pillar 1, objective 3–Improve opportunities
 for income generation, market access, and sustainable intensification. IFC’s experience in
 supporting SMEs in Bolivia has been challenging, and its program in the CPF incorporated
 some lessons learned from recent experience. What is not so clear, however, is how IFC will
 ensure that its new/planned investment will have a different outcome. Lessons from the
 2011–15 CAS CLR noted that IFC’s investments to support SMEs in the previous CAS did
 not achieve their objectives and were unsuccessful, including MSME credit lines provided
 to public banks, because the underlying problem was low productivity growth and not
 access to credit. The CLR lesson highlighted the need for appropriate sequencing of MSME
 support, especially credit support, until the more binding constraints are addressed.
 IFC also extended advisory support to its investee banks for expanding their SME and rural
 finance businesses, but its efforts have been stymied and all are on hold or terminated.
 Through its Business Edge training support, IFC tried to develop sustainable training
 services to provide local SMEs with access to applicable and customized business training.
 The program succeeded in strengthening the capacity of one local partner, but two others
 had to be dropped due to poor performance. Feedback from the local partner mentioned

 that the training only worked for large Bolivian companies because the time and cost
 involved made them prohibitive for Bolivian SMEs, which required an entirely different
 kind of business training. Under the newly established SME Facility in the Region, IFC
 initiated many pilot projects to explore assistance models. Some of the pilots were
 successful, others were not. Few were replicated due to dwindling donor funding. Perhaps
 due to the results of its advisory services program under the CAS, there is no new advisory
 services program in the CPF results framework.

65.     Realism and quality of CPF results frameworks. The guidance requires a CPF
results framework that “provides a concise summary of the results chains
articulated in the text, showing the linkages between the country development
goals, the development challenges, and the CPF Objectives” (World Bank Group
2014b, 12). The results matrix is a required annex in the CPF document that will be
used to assess progress toward achieving the CPF objectives. Indicators can be either
qualitative or qualitative, with quantitative indicators, with baselines and targets.
The indicators need to be both achievable and measurable within the CPF period.
The guidance also mentions that “It is best practice for the matrix to include
information on data sources for indicators to assist future program evaluation”
(World Bank Group 2014b, 13). 17

66.    Realism and consistency of the CPF results frameworks linked to the World
Bank Group programs, including IFC and MIGA, continue to be a challenge. The
results frameworks flow from the statement of problem, the intervention logic, and
the intended World Bank Group support, followed by the indicators with baseline
and targets and the list of World Bank Group programs. All 22 CPFs contain results
matrixes that present the baseline and target indicators, but many of the targets are
unexplained and seem unrealistic (Albania, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Côte d’Ivoire,
Egypt, and Uganda CPFs).

67.    In several CPFs, the World Bank Group program tends to overpromise on the
outcomes, perhaps because there is a corrective mechanism in the PLRs. The
Indonesia CPF presented ambitious targets, although most of the projects in the
program are still to be determined. In the other CPFs, it is difficult to determine
which of the projects in the World Bank Group program would contribute to the
indicators because the entries in the CPF results matrixes are not arrayed well
(Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, and Mali are examples). CPF indicators were mostly
outputs rather than outcomes, particularly for indicators relating to MSME access to
finance. In the Azerbaijan CPF results matrix, IFC investments to nine financial
intermediaries to support MSMEs were listed as part of the World Bank Group’s



                                                                                          123
APPENDIX G
IFC AND MIGA INTEGRATION IN THE SCD /CPF PROCESS
ongoing program to support access to finance. Achievement of this objective will use
the number of MSME loans through IFC client banks as a metric. A more relevant
outcome indicator would have been the increase in the share of MSME loans relative
to the total loan portfolios of the IFC-supported financial institutions.

68.   Six CPFs presented the operational definition and data sources for monitoring
and evaluation of their CPF results frameworks,18 which would greatly facilitate the
preparation of the PLR and CLR. These can be improved by including explanations
about how baseline and target indicators were calculated. The Bangladesh and
Uruguay CPFs explained the indicators in footnotes, but the Bangladesh CPF results
matrix stands out as best practice according to the guidance (World Bank Group
2014b) in explaining the calculation of the baseline and target indicators, which
should also facilitate outcome monitoring.

69.    Inclusion of MIGA program in the CPF results framework. The MIGA program
could be better reflected in the CPF results matrixes, especially its ongoing projects.
Private sector indicators in the CPF matrix relate to IFC ongoing and
pipeline/potential investment and advisory services program and the private
sector–related program of the World Bank. MIGA projects formed part of the World
Bank Group program in the Bangladesh, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Honduras,
Indonesia, Myanmar, and Panama CPF results matrixes, although there is no MIGA-
specific CPF indicator. But matrixes also have ongoing projects in Bolivia, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Uganda. MIGA’s reluctance to include indicators
stems from (a) a business model that makes it difficult to project five years outward
and (b) learning from experience when it was penalized by IEG in past CAS
Completion Reports if its indicative targets were not met or the planned transaction
did not materialize.19

70.    Addressing IFC and MIGA’s lack of dedicated budget for the new country
engagement model. The capacity to fully contribute in the new country engagement
approach is also determined by the resources allocated for each SCD and CPF. The
lack of dedicated budget has constrained the ability of IFC, for example, to influence
the PSD diagnostics and priorities in the SCDs and CPFs. Resources are also needed
to develop a realistic, measurable results framework although close attention by the
CPF team leaders is also required.

71.    To a large extent, the quality of IFC inputs (less so for MIGA) in the CPF
results matrix is determined by the resources available to the teams. The IFC team
leaders for the Bangladesh CPF had the resources and staff that allowed the team to
pay close attention to the results matrix. The IFC team included staff from its Results
Measurement Unit, who assisted in the preparation of the CPF results matrix. In

                                          IFC AND MIGA INTEGRATION IN THE SCD /CPF PROCESS
addition, the IFC Advisory Services South Asia Regional Operation is based in
Dhaka, so the IFC team leaders were able to get additional support. The difference
made by having additional staff to contribute to the preparation of the CPF results
matrix is evident in the coherence of the Bangladesh CPF results matrix and the
clarity of the baseline and target indicators, which included an explanation of how
the baseline and target indicators were calculated. Other IFC CPF team leaders had
resource constraints and were given extremely tight deadlines, in addition to the
task of balancing the demands of their regular responsibilities, including those as
country managers (Uganda, Côte d’Ivoire, and Egypt CPFs).

72.    World Bank Group joint program expectations. Expectations of increased joint
World Bank Group (cofinanced) projects need to be tempered by the reality in the
field and lessons from previous joint projects. Ten CPFs envisioned joint projects by
the World Bank Group. Most of those listed are still considered “potential,” while
other CPF results matrixes included ongoing cofinanced projects by two or all the
World Bank Group institutions.20 Mali and Myanmar had joint business plans or
implementation plans for the agriculture and energy sectors, respectively.21 But the
realization of cofinanced projects by the World Bank, IFC, and/or MIGA ultimately
depends on public and private sector client demand.

73.    Greater clarity is needed in the guidance about what is meant by World Bank
Group “jointness.” The October 2013 World Bank Group strategy referred to two
types of joint projects: cofinancing of a single project and a sequence of projects with
a shared objective and strategy (World Bank Group 2013). However, there is no such
distinction in the 2014 Directive on Country Engagement or in the guidance on CPF
products and expectations for joint programs need to be clarified (World Bank
Group 2014b, 2014c). Is it sufficient to carry out programs in parallel, noting what
the other part of the World Bank Group is doing and trying to mold programs to be
broadly consistent and supportive? Or should the institution look for a more active
synergy through the design, cofinancing, and implementation of joint programs?
IEG’s learning note on joint World Bank Group projects noted that, overall,
cofinanced joint projects represented less than 1–2 percent of World Bank and IFC
commitments (1.4 percent of combined commitments by the World Bank Group) for
the past 20 years. The learning note also found that joint projects had been useful
and highly relevant in high-risk contexts, in supporting pioneering investments, and
in complex projects. However, jointness also entailed costs and risks. More
important, World Bank Group cofinancing of projects did not ensure successful
outcomes, although such joint projects can be powerful tools and are effective under
the right conditions and with robust due diligence, monitoring, and supervision.

IFC AND MIGA INTEGRATION IN THE SCD /CPF PROCESS

Emerging Lessons
74.     The integration of the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA as One World Bank
Group has begun to take root as envisioned under the new country engagement
approach. Unlike past initiatives to have an integrated World Bank Group country
strategy, the new approach is reinforced by (a) strong World Bank Group senior
management support; (b) requiring that the SCDs and CPFs be approved by the
managements of the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA; (c) guidance notes that repeatedly
emphasized the One World Bank Group nature of the SCD and CPF and outlined
the processes, governance structure, organizational responsibilities, and templates;
(d) including IFC and MIGA team leaders for the CPF and point persons for the
SCD; and (e) establishing the CPF Academy to train World Bank, IFC, and MIGA
staff. All 22 SCDs and CPFs reviewed by IEG reflected this One World Bank Group
approach to country strategies.

75.    The new country engagement approach is in its early stages, and evidence
from the 22 pioneering new country engagement documents show considerable
improvements from the past CAS approach. IFC and MIGA are integrated into the
SCD and CPF processes, although institutional capacity and existing operations
continue to determine the level of engagement. But there are areas for continued
attention—among them, improvements in private sector and MSME diagnostics,
quality control over the CPF results framework, and further improvements in the
SCD and CPF processes. Adequate resources are needed to produce quality country
diagnostics and country strategies. Involving IFC and MIGA early in the process
would allow for greater participation and ownership, especially of the CPF.
However, it remains to be seen if the integration would result in increased business
volume for IFC and MIGA, as well as support for projects with better development
outcomes.

Appendix H. Gender Integration in the New
Country Engagement Model
Introduction
76.    The guidance note for the country engagement model has not integrated the
gender commitments that the World Bank Group made under Operations Policy
(OP) 4.20,1 the IDA commitments, or the commitments reflected in the corporate
scorecard gender indicators (World Bank Group 2014c).2 Gender is only referred to
once in passing in the SCD guidance note, when it lists the potential knowledge
products that the SCD could synthetize; the identification of data gaps is considered
optional (World Bank Group 2014a).3,4

77.    The Gender Cross-Cutting Solutions Area (CCSA) has offered guidance on
gender in SCDs, including World Bank Groupthe rationale for gender integration in
SCDs, the relevant commitments, and how to integrate gender. It has identified the
Albania SCD as good practice.5 There is no information on the extent to which this
guidance is being used by teams. A roundtable was organized in September 2014
with gender experts and SCD task team leaders to discuss the challenges team
leaders were facing in integrating gender in the first cohort of SCDs and to share
strategies to overcome these challenges.

78.    The CPF guidance note has a paragraph on gender, stating that gender
considerations can be integrated in the CPF analysis, content of the program, and
results framework (World Bank Group 2014d, 9). The guidance specifically refers to
the World Bank Group’s commitments with regard to gender and to available
guidance:

      Gender considerations can be integrated into the CPF in three places:
      the analysis, the content of the program, and the results framework.
      The findings of a gender assessment and constraints identified in the
      SCD can inform the CPF’s analysis of gender as a driver of poverty
      and development challenges. The content of the CPF program can
      include specific measures when the analysis has identified the need for
      gender-responsive interventions, and when there is country ownership
      and demand. Gender is integrated into the results framework by
      including gender-sensitive and sex-disaggregated indicators to
      measure outcomes. As part of the IDA17 Replenishment, the World
      Bank Group has committed to integrating gender considerations into


                                                                                  128
                                                                                APPENDIX H
                                   GENDER INTEGRATION IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
      the analysis, program content, and results framework of all IDA CPFs.
      The corporate scorecard monitors the integration of gender
      considerations in all IDA and IBRD CPFs, with a target of 100 percent
      satisfactory attention to gender by fiscal 2017. (Staff should refer to
      OP/BP 4.20, Gender and Development, and the guidance note.)

79.    CPFs are subject to the requirements of OP/BP 4.20 on Gender and
Development, which says that CPFs need to be informed by a Country Gender
Assessment.6 Yet the CPF guidance says “can” and not “must” or “should,” which
may confuse teams. The Gender CCSA is tasked with monitoring this commitment.
Gender guidance to teams preparing CPFs has yet to be updated; existing guidance
referenced in the OP or the Operations Policy and Country Services website is the
material previously used for CASs.7

A New World Bank Group Gender Strategy

 Box H.1. Corporate Commitments on Gender
   OP 4.20 requires CPFs to be informed by a gender assessment.
   IDA17 requires all CPFs to integrate gender in its analysis, program, and results
    framework.
   Corporate scorecard tracks gender‐integrated CPFs, with a target of 100 percent.

80.    In December 2015, the World Bank Group approved a new gender strategy,
reviving its commitment to gender. The strategy focuses on economic opportunities
(access to more and better jobs, and access to and control over assets and finance),
human endowments (health, education, social protection), and voice and agency
(gender-based violence, representation of women in local service delivery
governance structures; World Bank Group 2015f). Eight of the 22 CPFs included in
this analysis were approved at the same time or after the new gender strategy. While
the strategy explicitly refers to the new country engagement model, the CPFs
approved before the gender strategy were still required to observe OP 4.20 and other
gender commitments.8 The strategy, in line with OP 4.20, reconfirms the adoption of
a country-level approach to gender. Balancing country-level objectives (and the
country-driven model) with the priorities outlined in the gender strategy, as well as
the World Bank Group’s corporate commitments on gender, which require universal
compliance (box H.1), could be a challenging task for teams working on SCDs and
CPFs, as contradictions may arise among these various principles.

81.   Referring to the new country engagement model, the gender strategy stresses
the importance of including gender in SCDs, recognizing SCDs as the primary
documents to inform CPFs: As the World Bank Group “will adopt a more systematic


                                                                                        129
APPENDIX H
GENDER INTEGRATION IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
approach to assessing the adequacy of its country knowledge on gender issues”
(World Bank Group 2015f, 63). The gender strategy sets high expectations: “SCDs
should highlight how closing the key gender gaps in endowments, economic
opportunities, and voice and agency would boost the attainment of the twin goals”
(63). The strategy aims to move teams away from mere diagnostics of gender
equality gaps to a “better understanding of why gaps exist, and the key constraints
that must be lifted for the gaps to narrow and how the proposed [World Bank
Group] support contributes to lifting these constraints individually and as a whole.”
Moreover, diagnostics should highlight heterogeneity among men and women:
“SCDs should also document the availability of sex-disaggregated data and identify
which gender data gaps should be filled” (World Bank Group 2015f, 63).

82.     A gender assessment, when available, should inform the SCD, which in turn
will inform the CPF. Alternatively, the SCD analysis itself could constitute a gender
assessment according to OP 4.20.9 But problems arise in moving from statements of
principle to implementation. There is nothing in the text of the strategy that states
clearly who is responsible for including gender in SCDs. The strategy requires that
“at a minimum, CMUs should map the alignment between the key gender gaps
highlighted in the SCD, the CPF gender equality objectives, and the portfolio of
operations. . . . CMU will look across operations to ensure they reflect appropriate
actions to close key gender gaps identified in the CPF” (World Bank Group 2015f,
66). The strategy is silent about what to do if gender gaps are not identified in the
SCD or the CPF or if the CPF does not outline gender equality objectives. As part of
the CPF preparation process, the strategy expects wide consultations on gender with
the government and civil society to help identify the objectives with regard to
gender. But it is silent on the role, if any, of Regional or Country Gender Action
Plans, despite acknowledging their existence in some Regions.10 Because of limited
staffing, the Gender CCSA involvement in the production of SCDs or CPFs is limited
to providing comments at formal reviews. It remains to be seen how the CPF and
the SCD guidance will be revised to take into account the commitments and
recommendations of the gender strategy.

Methodology to Assess Gender Integration in SCDs and CPFs
83.   IEG reviewed the universe of SCD and CPF documents included in this
evaluation to assess the treatment of gender. Criteria for assessment of the treatment
of gender in SCDs and CPFs focus more on the process than on the substance and
were developed based on the guidance note for CPFs, the guidance note on Gender
for SCD developed by the Gender CCSA, and the spirit of the World Bank Group
Gender Strategy:

                                  GENDER INTEGRATION IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
      Whether the SCD and CPF draw on (or explicitly refer to) gender analysis
       that already exists (CPFs have to be informed by a gender assessment and
       SCDs are based on existing material and are not expected to produce new
       knowledge).
      Whether gender dimensions were raised during consultations (consultations
       could provide important input to identify gender priorities in a country).
      How the gender discussion is woven into the document: whether it is
       seamlessly integrated or if it appears as an add-on (relegated to a box or
       separate paragraph that does not appear to be linked to the rest of the
       document).
      How gender is treated: whether gender is equivalent to women, whether
       women are identified as an excluded group, whether key gender gaps are
       identified or not, whether heterogeneity among men and women or boys and
       girls is discussed, whether the discussion of gender is merely descriptive or
       analytic, whether the gender discussion focuses on the priorities identified in
       the gender strategy, and similar concerns.
      Whether a person assigned to specifically look at gender issues is part of the
       SCD team (assuming that this relaxes the technical constraints and the limited
       time).
      Whether gender issues are not covered in SCDs due to a stated lack of data
       and, if so, identified as data gaps.
      Whether CPFs clearly outline the objectives with regard to gender, its
       rationale, the World Bank Group activities planned to achieve the objectives,
       and whether there are corresponding indicators in the results framework.

84.    The methodology was centered on the review of documents (at both the
concept note and final stages), comments received at ROC meetings, and interviews
with task team leaders and gender experts. The review also benefited from the
recent IEG assessment of gender integration in CASs conducted for the 2015 Results
and Performance of the World Bank Group (World Bank 2016, chapter 1).

85.    The aim of this assessment was not necessarily to find gender issues listed
among the most pressing binding constraints to growth and shared prosperity in
many countries. But, instead, to review the extent to which gender dimensions of
key binding constraints were analyzed in SCDs, and the implications for the country
program, and discussed in CPFs. The selected criteria provided descriptive
categories for the analysis. Criteria were not meant to select “good practice,” as this
is highly context- and case-specific.




                                                                                     131
APPENDIX H
GENDER INTEGRATION IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL

Gender Integration in SCD
86.     The depth and quality of gender analysis in SCDs varies. In all, 19 of the 22
SCDs reviewed discussed gender issues (16 on labor, and 8 on education and
health), while 8 SCDs highlighted gender issues among the main challenges. Among
the earliest group of SCDs, Albania is a good example of gender integration, because
it has a comprehensive discussion of the most pressing gender issues (youth
unemployment, labor force participation, land rights). The discussion is not merely
descriptive; issues are carried through to the prioritization exercise (land, labor,
access to financial markets), and relevant data gaps in the labor markets were
identified. Among the most recent cohort of SCDs, Chad stands out because it
discusses in detail several constraints to women’s agricultural productivity (land,
labor, cash crops), as well as the impacts of high fertility and early childbearing on
women’s economic activity and maternal health. Women’s limited access to land
and lack of time were included in the final list of constraints.

87.    Indonesia is typical of cases where gender seems to be an add-on. Despite the
existence of a great deal of recent literature to draw on, the SCD makes limited
reference to it in a single (but dense) paragraph that describes a few of the
disadvantages women face in terms of economic opportunity. The issues described in
this paragraph, though, seem an add-on—they are not picked up anywhere else in the
document:

       Women tend to be more vulnerable than men due to differences in job status.
       Women constitute most of the self-employed and unpaid family workers,
       making them more susceptible to personal and financial insecurity. The
       gender wage gap in Indonesia is larger than in other countries in East Asia,
       with women only earning about 70 percent of what men earn, in part because
       female workers tend to have less secure terms of employment and are more
       likely to be self-employed, doing unpaid family work or working in the
       informal sector. Being a woman increases the probability of working in the
       informal sector by 24 percent. Women-owned SMEs are mostly self-
       employed by necessity. Indonesia’s social assistance programs favor female-
       headed households (FHH), but as typically the sole income earner in the
       household, FHHs tend to be more vulnerable to shocks and their poverty
       rates tend to be more volatile. Furthermore, out of the large labor pool of 37
       million working-age Indonesians that is inactive, 86 percent of which are
       women (World Bank Group 2015b, 36).

88.   Some SCDs include a summary box describing a few gender issues in the
country (Bolivia, Côte d’Ivoire, Haiti, El Salvador, Mali, Uganda), but little (if any) of


132
                                                                               APPENDIX H
                                  GENDER INTEGRATION IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
what is mentioned in the boxes is included in the prioritization or policy discussion.
This merely descriptive treatment of gender issues is similar to what happens with
social inclusion in SCDs.11

89.    The majority of SCDs refer to women when discussing gender issues. In the
Latin America and the Caribbean Region, at-risk behaviors of boys and men are
sometimes discussed, but their omission is most noted (as in the case of violence
associated with gangs in El Salvador or the issue of youth not in school, or working
in Honduras—the so-called ninis). Several SCDs singled out women as part of
excluded groups (Albania, Azerbaijan, Botswana, Chad, Costa Rica, the Arab
Republic of Egypt, Haiti, Mali, Myanmar, Serbia). But this identification of women
as part of groups in need of attention does not necessarily derive from a detailed
gender analysis. The Serbia SCD, for instance, only briefly refers to women’s
constraints in accessing economic opportunities in the labor market; the Myanmar
SCD has one sentence referring to gender-related reasons for social exclusion.

90.    Detailed gender analysis in SCDs is most commonly found in the labor
markets and school-to-work transition discussions (see table H.1). It is not clear why
gender dimensions do not come up in other detailed sector analysis. One possible
explanation might be the availability of data. Yet gender data gaps were identified in
only a few countries (Albania, Bangladesh, Egypt, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and
Uruguay), and some of these countries also have a good integration of gender.
Moreover, SCDs that do not include a discussion of gender issues do not necessarily
identify gender data gaps (table H.1). Maybe this is because identifying gender data
gaps is only optional according to the SCD guidance note (World Bank Group
2014a). Another reason gender issues are disproportionately discussed in the context
of labor markets and school-to-work transitions may be the nature of the SCDs
themselves; they are required to focus more on the economic constraints to (shared
and sustainable) growth rather than the human development aspects.12 Another
possible explanation may be that this is driven by a deliberate choice of the Gender
CCSA, through its comments, given their limited resources.

91.     Gender inequality may not be recognized among the most binding
constraints to the twin goals in many countries even if education, skills, and access
to jobs might be important dimensions of the priorities identified by SCDs.
Differences in constraints and opportunities between males and females, boys and
girls, are very rarely included among SCD priorities. In the best cases, they made it
to the long list but are lost in the prioritization exercise (Colombia). In other cases,
even when the list of priorities includes gender issues discussed in the text, these
linkages were not explicitly spelled out in the prioritization (Bangladesh). In several
instances, when the priorities are listed, their gender implications are not described.


                                                                                     133
APPENDIX H
GENDER INTEGRATION IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
There are also cases where a single sentence is added in the prioritization chapter
referring to the importance of gender in generic terms (Mali).

92.    Half of the SCDs reviewed had identified a person responsible for gender
(table H.1). In two cases, the person responsible for gender was also the team leader
of the SCD (Albania and Egypt). In at least two cases the person responsible for
gender was also the team leader for the gender assessment (Albania, Bangladesh).
Persons responsible for gender are not mapped to the Gender CCSA, except in one
case (Botswana).

93.    Having a dedicated person responsible for gender ensures integration, but it
does not necessarily guarantee good integration. While some of the best examples of
gender integration in SCDs had a dedicated person for gender (Albania, Chad),
there are also examples of good integration of gender, even when no person was
identified as responsible (Colombia). In other cases, a person responsible for gender
was identified, but the SCD included only brief references to gender (Serbia, Mali).

94.   Country gender assessments were available in 11 of the 22 countries, but two
dated back to 2006 (Indonesia and Mali) while three (Bolivia, Costa Rica, and
Honduras) were prepared subsequent to the SCDs. SCDs referred to gender
assessments when they were current and available during preparation, three of
them to an existing report (Azerbaijan, Bosnia, and Myanmar); Panama SCD to a
gender note; and Bangladesh and Maldives to a forthcoming report (table H.1).

Gender Integration in CPFs
95.    CPFs include less discussion of gender issues in the background and context
section than CASs used to do, probably because CPFs include less diagnostic
information in general (this is supposed to be covered by SCDs). Yet CPFs need to
be informed by a gender assessment, according to OP 4.20. While such reference is
usually noted, it is not coming from the SCDs in most cases.

96.    CPFs seldom refer to country or Regional Gender Action Plans. The Indonesia
CPF is an exception: the Country Gender Action Plan will continue to “identify,
coordinate and monitor activities to promote gender issues in the broader
engagement in Indonesia as well as in specific operations and knowledge products
across four dimensions of gender equality: endowment, economic opportunities,
voice and agency, and emerging risks areas” (World Bank Group 2015a, 46). The
Myanmar CPF notes that a country-level gender action plan will be developed
during the CPF period.




134
                                                                                APPENDIX H
                                   GENDER INTEGRATION IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
97.    Consultations could provide important input to identify gender priorities in a
country, but they are not commonly used (or their outcome was not reported). Bolivia,
Colombia, Egypt, El Salvador, Mali, and Uruguay are among the few CPFs that refer
to consultations touching on gender issues. Yet only the Bolivia and Egypt CPFs
outline a response to issues raised in these consultations in the proposed program.

98.    Little discussion of gender is found in CPF focus areas and program
objectives. This lack was also observed in CASs in the past.13 Most CPFs have a
generic reference to gender mainstreaming in the portfolio, regardless of whether or
not gender is identified as a cross-cutting issue. When it comes to identifying
concrete actions in the work program, gender references are more common in the
advisory services and analytics program than in the lending program. This limited
presence of gender in CPF focus areas may have to do with the noted absence in
SCDs of a discussion of the reasons underlying gender disparities, thus limiting its
policy implications.

99.     Many CPFs do identify what the existing portfolio is doing to address gender
considerations; this is an improvement over previous CASs (table H.2). For instance,
the Chad CPF refers to ongoing health and education operations as well as to the
Regional Sahel Women’s Empowerment and Demographic Dividend Project to
improve rural access to and quality of reproductive health and education services
for girls. While it falls short of fully addressing the constraints to women’s economic
empowerment raised in the SCD (limited access to land and other productive
resources, limited availability of time for economic activities due to high fertility), it
is definitely an improvement.

100. In some cases, the importance of addressing gender is emphasized in the
CPF, but little is included in the proposed program. For instance, the CPF for Mali
calls for more commitment, but nothing concrete is included in the work program:
“transformation requires substantially improved human capital, contained
demographic growth and reduced gender inequalities…. The high-value impact of
gender approaches would benefit Mali, but it requires bolder political commitment”
(World Bank Group 2015c, 2 and 12).

101. Good integration of gender issues in an SCD does not necessarily translate
into good integration of gender in CPFs. This might be expected when the
integration of gender is seen in a topic not considered a priority for the CPF (as in
the school-to-work transition in Bolivia). Motivations for this absence are much less
clear in other cases (such as Colombia, where the CPF does not refer to any of the
gender issues discussed in the SCD, even when some of these issues were also
highlighted during SCD consultations).


                                                                                       135
APPENDIX H
GENDER INTEGRATION IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
102. CPFs tend to align with SCDs in the identification of key gender issues, but
they do not necessarily identify strategic priorities for gender. In some cases
(Albania, Haiti, Uganda, Uruguay), CPFs outline clear areas of action (not
necessarily identifying them as key gender gaps). In other cases, they just refer to
gender mainstreaming activities in the World Bank Group portfolio and analytical
work (Colombia, Maldives, Mali; table H.2). The Panama CPF is a good example of
the typical integration. While the CPF points to opportunities to integrate gender in
existing operations (“Gender disparities may create barriers for taking full
advantage of growth, as they affect women’s and men’s endowments, economic
opportunities and agency” [World Bank Group 2015e, 11]), it ignores gender issues
when referring to the priorities.

103. In a few cases, exactly the same information on gender is included in both the
SCD and CPF. This is especially the case when gender is discussed in summary
boxes or summarized in one paragraph, as in Honduras or El Salvador, for instance.
Only a few CPFs pick up on gender data gaps identified in the SCD and propose
analytical work to address them (Azerbaijan, Costa Rica). In Bangladesh and Egypt,
the SCD raised the need to update the gender assessment, and the corresponding
CPF was diligent in including it among the proposed analytical work. In other cases
(Albania, El Salvador, Uruguay), data gaps clearly identified in SCDs are not
mentioned in CPFs. The Myanmar CPF highlights gender data gaps not previously
identified by the SCD (Myanmar CPF).

104. Sex-disaggregated indicators are commonly found in CPFs, regardless of
whether the CPF refers to gender in the proposed program or not (table H.2). The
majority of these indicators are project beneficiaries’ indicators (such as percentage
female). This is not surprising, considering that the number and share of
beneficiaries who are female are included in the corporate scorecard,14 and therefore
are more frequently found in projects, and thus are readily available as a potential
indicator for the CPF. These indicators are of little value. The majority measure
outputs, tracking the percentage of female recipients or beneficiaries living in
projects’ areas.15

105. Very few indicators aim at measuring gender gaps (this is most commonly
done in education). The Uruguay CPF, for instance, has an indicator on the burden
of care for poor young women. Maternal mortality is not mentioned as often as it
was in CASs. Other indicators included in CPFs are more focused on process, such
as “gender assessment disseminated,” “government policy or programs gender
informed,” and “new labor force survey that analyzes sex-disaggregated
employment data and sex-disaggregated data on the wage gap and its determinants
conducted” (table H.2).

                                 GENDER INTEGRATION IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL

Emerging Findings
106. This analysis has used descriptive categories (explicitly and implicitly
identified in the gender strategy, some also reflected in the SCD and CPF guidelines)
to assess the quality of gender integration in SCDs and CPFs. Based on these
categories, IEG found little difference in the treatment of gender in CPFs compared
with previous CASs as a result of the new country engagement model.

107. Most SCDs are not providing a comprehensive gender diagnosis. Gender
issues highlighted in SCDs tend to be echoed by CPFs. The majority of the SCDs and
CPFs reviewed describe some gender issues countries may be facing but do not
identify key gender gaps to be addressed, nor do they refer to an existing gender
assessment. In SCDs, the gender gaps that receive the most attention relate to labor
markets, followed by skills and school-to-work transition. In the CPFs as well there
seems to be an evolution beyond human development, commonly found in the
previous generation of CASs, toward economic empowerment, and especially related
to labor issues. Poverty among female-headed households is also commonly
discussed. While “gender issues” are not limited to “women’s issues,” the discussion
on gender, when present in SCDs and CPFs, is generally associated with women’s
issues only.

108. Some SCDs and CPFs are stronger than others. Implications for the World
Bank Group country program of the gender considerations discussed in SCD
priorities are only partially addressed in CPFs. CPFs are much more likely to refer to
what is being done in the existing portfolio to address gender issues than to propose
future actions to address them (except with regard to analytical work).

109. Compared with previous CASs, CPFs are better at articulating World Bank
Group actions to address specific gender inequalities and include many more sex-
disaggregated indicators. But the alignment between the actions proposed and the
indicators included in results frameworks is still weak. Moreover, indicators
included in CPFs tend to be the percentage of female beneficiaries of existing
projects, which provides little new information beyond what is already being
monitored by individual projects.

110. The absence of major change in the treatment of gender in CPFs compared
with CASs is not surprising, considering that the guidance for the new country
engagement model did not fully adopt the gender commitments that the World
Bank Group made under OP 4.20, the IDA commitments, or the corporate scorecard
with regard to gender. While the CPF guidance refers to these commitments, the
SCD guidance note only mentions gender in passing (World Bank Group 2014b,



                                                                                    137
APPENDIX H
GENDER INTEGRATION IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
2014d). The World Bank Group gender strategy, finalized after the guidance was
completed, provides more specific directions on how gender dimensions can be
incorporated in the SCD and CPF, but these have yet to be internalized in the CPF
guidance (World Bank Group 2015a).


 Box H.2. Gender CCSA Guidance to Teams Preparing SCDs and CPFs
     Addressing gender is not only a matter of inclusion (that is, women are agents of
      change in economic, social, and political life and not only a vulnerable group).
     Women are a heterogeneous group (only certain interactions with gender—race,
      education, and income, for example—may be key to address).
     Sex-disaggregate all individual-level indicators and identify data gaps if needed.
     Recognize gaps and constraints (concrete differences between females and males), and
      not only in social sectors (that is, segmentation of industries, occupations, division of
      labor in productive and reproductive activities).
     Identify both explicit and implicit gender biases in policies, regulations, and market
      processes.

111. The responsibility for gender integration in SCDs and CPFs is not clear. The
Gender Leadership Council, which includes representatives from all Regional vice-
presidencies; IFC; Development Economics; and the Poverty and Social, Urban,
Rural, and Resilience global practices, could potentially play a key role.16 While the
council does not have the specific role of overseeing the integration of gender in
SCDs or CPFs among its functions, it identifies regional gender focal points that
could help with this. Council members are supposed to meet quarterly to review
implementation progress on the World Bank’s gender equality strategy, corporate
targets, IDA 17, and Regional Gender Action Plans, among other matters. In
addition, the Council is expected to “play a pivotal role in setting priorities for the
World Bank’s agenda on gender equality and women’s empowerment and in
fostering regional and country ownership of its activities.”

112. The Gender CCSA is tasked with monitoring compliance with OP 4.20, but
recognizing that mostly focusing on compliance with an operational policy
diminishes the value of the input of the gender experts, the Gender CCSA is paying
little attention to this (compared with what Poverty Reduction and Economic
Management Gender used to do). Instead, the Gender CCSA devotes a great deal of
time to providing upstream comments to both SCD and CPF documents. Comments
seem to have improved over time, and recent contributions are more focused and
specific, many providing references and data sources (table H.2).17 Yet these
comments are seldom addressed.




138
                                                                                APPENDIX H
                                   GENDER INTEGRATION IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
113. Comments provided by the Gender CCSA to CPF and SCD teams tend to
focus on the pillars of economic opportunities of the gender strategy: access to more
and better jobs and access to and control over assets and finance. Much less attention
is given to human endowments and voice and agency. Access to jobs is a priority
identified by the strategy, but this is not the only priority. Plus, one has to square the
principle of the priorities with the other principle also identified in the strategy of
the country as the entry point for gender. Thus, it is insufficient to only focus on
gender issues in the economic domain.

114. Concrete inputs are often given by the Gender CCSA at the concept note and
ROC stages to strengthen the discussion on gender in SCDs. In the case of CPFs, the
Gender CCSA comments at ROC tend to recommend strengthening the narrative
and alignment with the CPF’s overall priorities and goals. With the more
streamlined process of comments, the Gender CCSA does not see the final CPF
before it goes to Board; this limits the Gender CCSA ability to ensure compliance
with OP 4.20. In the case of SCDs, comments from the Gender CCSA aim to
encourage the diagnostics to move beyond establishing that there is a gap between
males and females in a domain to discuss underlying reasons and what could be
done about the gap (that is, to translate into policy recommendations).

115. There is no systematic process that can guarantee a minimum level of quality
with regard to gender integration, nor a clear definition of what a minimum
threshold looks like. The Gender CCSA and the Poverty Global Practice are
discussing the possibility of working with selected upcoming SCDs to come up with
good practice guidance to teams. Maybe what is needed is a more proactive role of
the Gender CCSA. For instance, it might be useful to decide whether it is best to aim
at being systematic, even if that implies doing a basic analysis but covering a broad
range of potential issues, or whether it is worth choosing two or three
transformation elements for SCDs, and discussing the implications for CPFs. Maybe
the Gender CCSA needs to do more than just comment and issue guidance notes
(which are of limited value if they do not actively participate in the process).

116. Task team leaders and gender experts interviewed for this evaluation
mentioned several challenges to detailed integration of gender in SCDs. Challenges
most often mentioned include: lack or limited technical capacity in the team; lack or
limited availability of data, tendency to rely on household surveys/quantitative data
and limited use of qualitative data, absence of Regional or country strategies or
strategic plans with regard to gender, having to address multiple topics under
severe time constraints, and lack of realistic support by the Gender CCSA. Many of
these challenges were also raised at a roundtable in September 2014 (a few months
after the first round of SCDs were completed).


                                                                                      139
APPENDIX H
GENDER INTEGRATION IN THE NEW COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT MODEL
117. The lack of incentive mechanisms and clear responsibility and accountability
systems are potential reasons for the limited change with regard to gender
integration in the new country engagement model.18

Timing may also be an issue for integrating gender more systematically in SCDs or
CPFs. SCDs (and CPFs) are supposed to rely on existing material that might not
always be readily available. In some cases, the Regional Gender Action Plan is
finalized after the CPF. In others, the Country Gender Assessment is an action
planned during CPF implementation. Space is also often a concern, since CPFs are
becoming shorter and more concrete.

Appendix I. Assessment of Governance and
Political Economy Issues in SCDs and CPFs
Purpose
1.      The purpose of this appendix is to assess how SCDs have addressed
governance and political economy issues, and how this analysis affected the design
of the country program in CPFs in ways known to enhance the chances of achieving
the objectives sought in their operations. The review considers the adequacy of the
guidance and directives in this area (World Bank Group 2014a, 2014b), and the
content of the SCDs and CPFs.

Guidance and Directives
2.     Guidance for SCDs points out that political economy factors are a crucial part
of country context, to be used in identifying constraints, solutions, and
opportunities. Issues include weak incentives or official capacity, low payoffs to
political actors, predatory behavior, political volatility, transparency, accountability,
access to information, quality of core government systems, contestation over land
access and use rights, and other political risks.

3.     Guidance for CPFs also suggests three key aspects of governance that may be
considered: the credibility and legitimacy of the government, incentives for
pursuing public interest policies, and capacity of the public administration to
implement the policies. Governance may be a cross-cutting theme mainstreamed
throughout the CPF. It may not address all the priorities of the SCD when there is no
political traction to address that challenge, but if deemed important enough, there
may be need for a tough dialogue and investment in political consensus building.

Latest Thinking on Governance and Political Economy
4.      The World Development Report 2017 presents the latest thinking on governance
for achieving the World Bank’s twin goals (World Bank Group 2017).1 In this
paragraph, IEG summarizes some pertinent points from the literature.2 Briefly, there
are three key points: “think of function, not only form,” “think of power, not only
capacity,” and “think of the role of law, not only the rule of law.” Whether a policy
functions and is carried out is more important than the form that it takes. Function
depends on commitment, cooperation, and coordination of the key parties concerned.
Often extensive behavioral change is needed to make this happen. When commitment
is not credible and cooperation is difficult, key parties may stop bargaining and

                                                                                APPENDIX I
                   ASSESSMENT OF GOVERNANCE AND POLITICAL ECONOMY ISSUES IN SCDS AND CPFS
withdraw, or even turn to conflict. Reform success comes from addressing the key
constraints to commitment, cooperation, and coordination that stand in the way of
promoting development by nurturing prodevelopment coalitions. Progress is more
likely when building on processes that have worked in the past, and avoiding
processes that have previously failed to gain traction.

5.     Security issues are critical for fragile states, and there are methods for
improving security outcomes: power sharing, resource redistribution, dispute
settlement, and sanctions. Power sharing can take place in legislatures and through
other means to get elites and their followers to compromise. Redistribution can take
place through budget transfers, targeted service delivery, and jobs programs.
Dispute settlement can be done through truth and reconciliation commissions,
arbitration, and customary councils. Sanctions can include increased policing, with
safeguards for citizen’s rights.

6.      Failures in policy functionality often come from powerful interests. While
capacity building is important, new capacities will not be effective or sustained unless
powerful interests let them. The adoption of laws by countries is no guarantee that
they will be enforced, and weak capacity often suits powerful interests. Moving from
form to function is a process of contest and bargaining among powerful interests. The
effectiveness of policies depends not just on what policies are chosen but also on how
they are chosen and implemented through bargaining and contest among different
actors. Donors need to take into account the openings and constraints presented by
shifting politics in supporting governance reforms.

Overall Assessment
7.     Taking into account the SCD and CPF guidance, and the latest thinking as
presented in the World Development Report 2017, this appendix qualitatively assesses
the governance and political economy aspects of SCDs and CPFs using a purposive
sample of seven countries: Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Chad, Colombia, the Arab
Republic of Egypt, Indonesia, and Uganda. These countries were selected because
among the countries reviewed in the evaluation, they are known to have serious
governance issues. Two are from the Africa Region: one Anglophone and one
Francophone, and one from each of the other World Bank Regions.

8.     Based on this, there is considerable evidence that World Bank teams are taking
into account the guidance, with governance and political issues analyzed and
addressed in SCDs and CPFs, but at different levels of intensity. For example, weak
incentives for reform feature in numerous ways, with proposals for incentivizing
professionals to take hard-to-fill positions and to improve results through



                                                                                      161
APPENDIX I
ASSESSMENT OF GOVERNANCE AND POLITICAL ECONOMY ISSUES IN SCDS AND CPFS
performance-based management. Weak capacity is also widely discussed, pointing to
causes of limited human capital and weak educational and health systems.

9.     However, this analysis may miss the point that regimes may intentionally
focus their best people on priority areas, such as security, while limiting capacity in
areas where it is not wanted, such as in audits of high-value procurements or
environmental safeguards. Regimes may well support new laws, regulations, and
computerized systems, but not their functional implementation. In this way, regimes
can take on the appearance or form of reform, without improving governance
outcomes. As pointed out in the World Development Report 2017, moving from form
to function often means bargaining among powerful interests (World Bank Group
2017). The World Bank needs to consider the openings and constraints presented by
shifting politics in supporting the bargaining process. This was not called for in the
guidance, and not explicitly done in the reviewed SCDs and CPFs.

10.     Governance features prominently in the SCDs of five of the seven countries as
a key constraint (Azerbaijan, Chad), overarching priority (Egypt), main cross-cutting
issue (Indonesia), and intrinsic part of sustainability (Uganda). There is less emphasis
in the other two. For Bangladesh, there is some discussion in a two-page annex of
strengthening public institutions. However, governance is not a key priority, and
political economy analysis was dropped from the SCD at the request of the
government.3 In the case of Colombia, governance is less prominent than for other
countries analyzed for this report, although some aspects are covered in pillar 1 on
balanced territorial development.

11.     Governance features in all CPFs, but at different levels of priority. The Egypt
CPF supports a transformative program to renew the social contract to support
private sector job creation, social inclusion, and enhanced governance. Governance
is at the heart of all the areas, with policy and institutional reforms, increasing
transparency and accountability at the sector level, and enhancing citizen voice and
grievance redress. Likewise, the Uganda CPF states, “the CPF will, in every activity
and throughout the portfolio, focus on understanding political economy dynamics,
institutional and capacity bottlenecks in implementation, and aim to improve
transparency, accountability, and service delivery” (World Bank Group 2015d, 17).
Governance is also a key priority of the Azerbaijan CPF, with a focus on “better
public resource management, service delivery, and a rules-based relationship
between the public and private sectors. The idea is to build on this a basis for
broader reforms and engagement when the government is ready” (World Bank
Group 2015d, ii). At the same time, the Bangladesh CPF views governance reform as
a long-term agenda rather than an immediate priority. It includes maintaining
ongoing public sector reforms, capacity building within ongoing operations, and


162
                                                                                APPENDIX I
                   ASSESSMENT OF GOVERNANCE AND POLITICAL ECONOMY ISSUES IN SCDS AND CPFS
enhanced fiduciary oversight and use of forensic audits; any transformation will be
a long way off.

12.     Governance is also addressed as a risk factor. The main risk (high) to the
Bangladesh CPF emerges from the political and governance environment and weak
fiduciary capacity. There is a substantial political and governance risk in the
Azerbaijan CPF. It is mitigated by taking governance and institution building into
consideration in every World Bank Group activity, use of diagnostic tools such as
Public Expenditure Reviews and Financial Accountability Assessments to monitor
improvements, and limiting corporate management risks through IFC advisory
activities. There is a moderate political and governance risk in Colombia’s CPF,
including possible lack of political support at the local and provincial levels that
could lead to delays, combined with low administrative and governance capacity at
the subnational levels. These risks will be mitigated by strengthening subnational
institutions, simplifying governance and fiduciary structures for project
implementation, and addressing issues of conflict and displacement, drawing on
lessons of the World Development Report 2011: Conflict, Security, and Development.

13.    Governance and political economy are sensitive issues everywhere, and this
sensitivity appeared in the SCD process in some countries. Political economy
analysis was dropped from the Bangladesh SCD on the insistence of the
government, and governance reform is not an immediate priority in the CPF. A draft
of the Egypt SCD was leaked after the decision review meeting, leading to concerns
about the focus on governance issues among some in the government. While this led
to a 10-month delay in revising the SCD, governance reform was retained as a
central priority in the CPF.

14.    Weak incentives to implement reforms and provide quality public services are
discussed in many SCDs and CPFs—for example, informal networks between
business and administrative officials, which provide incentives for weak
implementation and enforcement; reticence to implement reforms at the middle and
lower levels due to lack of incentives; misaligned incentives and informal payments in
health and education (Azerbaijan); a political context in which project selection and
approvals take place, limiting incentives to produce technically high-quality projects;
and a system of promotion based on years of service rather than performance, with no
adequate incentives to encourage initiative and reward excellence (Bangladesh).

15.    To address these constraints, proposals are offered: providing incentives for
the gradual engagement of the private sector in the management and maintenance
of transport assets (Azerbaijan); linking postgraduate admission for health
professionals with service in hard-to-reach areas; reexamining the institutional


                                                                                      163
APPENDIX I
ASSESSMENT OF GOVERNANCE AND POLITICAL ECONOMY ISSUES IN SCDS AND CPFS
incentives for Department of Environment staff, based on performance indicators,
and transparency and accountability; and performance-based incentives for
secondary cities, towns, and union parishes that demonstrate sustained progress in
planning, public financial management, revenue mobilization, and social
accountability (Bangladesh).

16.    Making the state credible is an idea featured in many of these reports. Thus, the
Azerbaijan SCD calls for strengthened accountability, transparency, and efficiency of
public spending by instituting credible fiscal rules, particularly regarding oil
revenues. The Azerbaijan CPF adds improving internal and external audit capacity
and enhancing independent and credible procurement complaint mechanisms. The
Uganda SCD finds that public financial management systems are weak with regard to
budget credibility and budget execution controls. Improving the quality and
credibility of budget planning, a priority in the CPF, will help deliver national
economic objectives and support effective service delivery and development projects.

17.    Political volatility is also featured in many reports. The Uganda SCD states,
“focus on the northern and eastern regions will be needed for Uganda to end
extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity as well as to reduce social and political
tensions that can emerge from stark differences across regions” (World Bank Group
2015e, 7–8). The Colombia SCD calls for a three-step transition: “(a) away from
violence toward the rule of law; (b) away from a wartime to a peacetime economy
that successfully enhances basic services and opportunities; and (c) away from
turning to violence in the face of political differences to accepting participatory
democracy” (World Bank Group 2015b, 19). The Chad SCD states, “political stability
has been maintained by forging alliances between the regime and key
constituencies, such as the security forces and other powerful interest groups, rather
than relying primarily on institutional development and improved public service
delivery for all” (World Bank Group 2015a, 4).

18.      Contestation over land access and use is also a common theme. Thus, the
Colombia SCD highlights land use as critical for the peace process, the Chad SCD
discusses women’s weak land tenure, and the Uganda SCD states that “only 20
percent of Uganda’s land is registered and most of the registered land is mailo
(tenure) which is unsuitable as collateral since it cannot be liquidated by banks”
(xiii). Improving agricultural productivity will take “accelerating systematic land
registration, developing capacity of land dispute resolution institutions” (World
Bank Group 2015e, xv). The CPF has a target of increasing the percentage of rural
land registered from 5 percent in 2014 to 10 percent in 2021. The Egypt SCD notes,
“Land use laws are rigid and outdated, and prohibit the formal expansion of cities
into rural areas, while rent control policies and height restrictions have also limited

                                                                                APPENDIX I
                   ASSESSMENT OF GOVERNANCE AND POLITICAL ECONOMY ISSUES IN SCDS AND CPFS
the supply of housing” (World Bank Group 2015c, 57) and proceeds to make a
number of policy recommendations.

19.    Access to information is another theme that is often discussed. The Uganda
CPF states, “the country has continued policy and legislative reforms largely led by
technocrats and supported by development partners. In some areas, such as
disclosure of public information, this has made Uganda a regional leader” (15). It
goes on to say, “The Bank will take steps to strengthen country systems for
transparency, participation and accountability” (World Bank Group 2015d, 21). The
Egypt SCD calls for “increasing government transparency both by making more
data publicly available and by making progress toward a more comprehensive right
to information law” (World Bank Group 2015c, xiv). The Colombia SCD advocates
for the “need to invest in improving communication and information media on
indigenous communities, as there has been a general tendency to focus on the
conflicts and challenges that they face. Participants emphasized that it is imperative
to create more awareness on the positive attributes of these communities, including
their culture, identity, and philosophy” (World Bank Group 2015b, 126).

Emerging Messages
20.    In summary, most SCDs and CPFs take governance and political economy
into account in both analysis and program recommendations, but some refinements
to the guidance are suggested:
      Governance features prominently in most reports as a key constraint,
       overarching priority, main cross-cutting issue, or intrinsic part of
       sustainability. There are analyses and recommendations addressing weak
       incentives and capacity for reform, making the state credible, addressing
       political volatility, increasing access to land, and providing information to
       citizens.
      Governance and politics are also addressed as risk factors, rated as moderate
       to high in the sample countries.
      Political economy analysis is sensitive, which in one case led to removal of
       sections from the SCD, and in another to delay of the SCD process until the
       government’s concerns could be addressed.
      However, some of the latest thinking in the area, as reflected in the World
       Development Report 2017, could be made more prominent. For example,
       analysis of and recommendations to address weak capacity would be
       strengthened with deeper analysis of the bargaining among powerful
       interests needed for such improvements to succeed.

Appendix J. Integration of Fragility
Assessments in SCDs, CPFs, and CENs
21.     This evaluation reviewed the contribution of fragility assessments to
Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs), Country Partnership Frameworks (CPFs),
and Country Engagement Notes (CENs) in seven countries. Of the 22 countries that
prepared SCDs and CPFs during the evaluation period, 4 are classified by the World
Bank as “fragile” and have a recent fragility assessment— Chad, Colombia, Côte
d’Ivoire, and Mali. Uganda, though not classified as “fragile,” had a risk and
resilience assessment prepared in June 2016. Five additional countries with CENs
were included in the evaluation sample—the Central African Republic, Ecuador, Fiji,
Guinea-Bissau, and Turkmenistan. Of these five, two are classified as “fragile”
(Central African Republic and Guinea-Bissau) and have prepared recent fragility
assessments, but do not have SCDs. Five (the Central African Republic, Colombia,
Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, and Mali) of the seven fragility assessments contain
some form of recommendations.

22.    Drivers of fragility were comprehensively discussed in four of the five SCDs
(Chad, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, and Mali) and were aligned with the discussion in
the fragility assessment (table J.1). The Côte d’Ivoire and Mali SCDs explicitly
referred to their respective fragility assessments and include deep discussions on the
historical nature of fragility in the country, as well as the current drivers of fragility.

23.     Fragility issues were also discussed in the same four country CPFs (not
covered in the Uganda CPF), though not in as much detail as in the SCDs. The
fragility assessment is featured quite prominently in the Mali CPF. The two CENs—
for the Central African Republic and Guinea-Bissau—do not refer to their fragility
assessments, though the CEN for the Central African Republic was completed in
mid-2015 and the fragility assessment was not completed until the first quarter of
2016.

24.     There were several common key drivers of fragility across the seven
countries. Political and governance issues, such as weak institutional capacity, weak
judicial systems, abuse of political power, insecure political power and coups, and
violent rebel uprisings and mutinies, have been regular occurrences (in the Central
African Republic, Chad, Guinea-Bissau, and Mali) and are common drivers of
fragility.

APPENDIX J
INTEGRATION OF FRAGILITY ASSESSMENTS IN SCDS, CPFS, AND CENS
25.    Land, particularly disputes over the use and ownership of land, is a key
driver of conflict fragility in all five countries. In Colombia, rural areas, disconnected
from the national economy and political life, are rich in natural resources and
represent potential rents that perpetuate armed conflict. In Côte d’Ivoire, insecure
access to land exacerbates divisions between groups and is at the root of the vast
majority of local conflicts. Increasing pressure on land and the inability of customary
land tenure arrangements to deal with rapid change have caused massive violent
outbreaks.

26.    Regional instability is also a key driver of fragility in these countries. Chad
has suffered considerable upheaval spilling across its borders in the form of
displaced persons, and it has also been drawn into regional conflicts over trafficking
(in humans, firearms, food, or drugs) and recruitment into terror groups—with the
Central African Republic, Sudan, and Libya. Uganda faces a number of external
threats to stability (terrorism; border disputes; and refugees from South Sudan,
Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and other areas). Mali faces the same
regional insecurity with its neighbors (Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, Chad, and the
spread of terrorist organizations, among others).

27.    Issues related to youth were also considered drivers of fragility. Youth are
easily mobilized and manipulated. In Mali, youth unemployment has motivated
young people to join the networks of organized crime as the only way to move from
rags to riches. In Côte d’Ivoire, high levels of unemployed youth are at the center of
the conflict, and some of the disenfranchised youth have proven useful to the main
actors in the crisis, who have found them easily mobilized and manipulated for their
political gain.

  Alignment with the priorities of the SCD is one of the criteria for identification of World Bank Group program
priorities in the CPF. The Operations Policy and Country Services note on procedure (World Bank Group 2015)
indicates that the SCD is conducted prior to the CPF process and is finalized before the CPF concept review
meeting takes place, in order to provide the analytical foundation for the CPF.

    All 22 SCDs are listed as a group in the bibliography.

 The SORT has broader application than the CPF. It applies both to World Bank –supported projects and
country programs.

sector, given the need to engage with a large number of subnational units. The government, however, felt that
the World Bank had a comparative advantage in supporting this area, relative to other potential development
partners.

                                         INTEGRATION OF FRAGILITY ASSESSMENTS IN SCDS, CPFS, AND CENS

1As part of IFC’s organizational alignment (2016), a ne w IFC vice presidency, Economics and Private Sector
Development, will oversee the Regional strategy teams, which typically lead the SCD and CPF process.
Staffing and other matters related to the new country engagement are expected to be examined, including
budgeting systems.
2 The October 2013 World Bank Group strategy classifies World Bank Group projects into two types: (a)
cofinancing of a single project using a combination of World Bank, IFC, and/or MIGA products and
instruments (Type 1 joint project); and (b) sequenced, separate projects with shared objective or strategy using a
range of World Bank Group products/services (Type 2 joint project).
1 The PLRs are to be prepared every two years, or at the midpoint of the CPF, as short documents that briefly
summarize progress in implementing the CPF program and review the continuous relevance of the strategy. In
countries where significant changes have taken place, the PLR is expected to realign the strategy and the CPF
program. The PLR can also be used to extend the time period of the CPF for up to two years, but no CPF may
run for more than six years. In light of the changes to country programming under the new model, some
adjustments to the current criteria for the CLRs and their independent validations could be warranted. Such
adjustments might consider whether —and if so, how—to take account of (i) the new SCD instrument, (ii) the
likely somewhat longer time between CPFs, and (iii) the possibility that programs might be adjusted, perhaps
significantly, during the CPF period, including as little as two years before the end of the period.

 This section is based on four country assistance strategy retrospectives (World Bank Group 1998, 2000, 2003,
and 2009) and on World Bank Group 2005.

  These 74 countries have no data points, only one data point each, or two data points that are more than five
years apart.

  The countries are Albania, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Chad,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Indonesia, Panama, Maldives, Mali,
Myanmar, Serbia, Uganda, and Uruguay. For 11 of them (Albania, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Côte
d’Ivoire, Egypt, Indonesia, Panama, Myanmar, Serbia, and Uganda), the country case study by the Independent
Evaluation Group included field visits and interviews with the local counterparts and stakeholders.

  This explanation of the results chain coheres with the literature. In The Road to Results, for example, the
results chain is described as a “causal sequence for a development intervention that stipulates the necessary
sequence to achieve desired objectives, beginning with inputs, moving through activities and outputs, and
culminating in outcomes, impacts and feedback” (Morra-Imas and Rist 2009, 166). That text goes on to say that
a results chain does not have to have the same level of detail as a flow chart (described in the same place), but it
should be possible to depict it with key assumptions in a chart.

 Six CPFs (Botswana, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Indonesia, and Uganda) were led by IFC country managers.
Eight CPFs had IFC country managers or heads as CPF co-task leaders (Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bolivia,
Bosnia Herzegovina, Haiti, Maldives, Myanmar and Serbia).

  The guidance note on CPF products (World Bank Group 2014b, 7) mentions that “IFC teams will lead
consultations in relation to IFC activities and will be fully engaged in consultations with the private sector in
general, particularly in Tier 1 SCDs, CPFs/CENs and PLRs.” In the Albania and Indonesia SCDs, the IFC team
leader was given full responsibility (including moderating) over the private sector consultations and
summarizing the inputs in the documents.

  Private sector development was considered a cross-cutting issue in the Azerbaijan CPF, but not a focus area.
The Bangladesh, Bolivia, Chad, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Indonesia, Mali, Panama, and Uruguay
CPFs did not have a CPF focus area pertaining to private sector development, but the CPF objectives involved
private sector participation.
 The Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Botswana, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Indonesia, and Myanmar CP Fs and the
15

Uganda SCD reflected private sector development as a priority or focus area.
16
  The Albania, Bangladesh, Chad, and Uruguay CPFs did not prioritize MSME’s access to finance or financial
services.
17
   World Bank Group 2014d states that “The CPF articulates a results-based engagement, centered on a results
framework, that lays out the objectives that the WBG activities are expected to help the country achieve, and
links those objectives to the country’s development goals” (paragraph 8, 4).

CPF.

  OP 4.20 requires the CPF to be informed by a gender assessment. Gender assessments may be stand-alone
products or carried out as part of other Bank economic and sector work, such as poverty assessments (see OP
1.00, Poverty Reduction), country economic memoranda, Public Expenditure Reviews, development policy
reviews, poverty and social impact assessments, or institutional analyses. Analyses carried out by other donors
may also count as gender assessments, provided their quality is acceptable to the World Bank.
2
  In particular, a commitment reiterated since IDA16 and reflected in the corporate scorecards requires that 100
percent of country strategies integrate gender (identify gender gaps and discuss potential policy responses). The
recent World Bank Group Gender Strategy confirms that the country is the main entry point for addressing
gender, hence the requirement that country strategies discuss and address gender issues of importance for the
country.
3
 Gender assessments are mentioned among the list of World Bank Group knowledge products that the SCD
could synthetize (World Bank Group 2014b, 3)

  The data diagnostics in the SCD guidance note suggest that teams, on an optional basis, can include
information on whether each of the surveys/censuses has sex-disaggregated data (World Bank Group 2014b, 3).
5
  The World Bank commitments refer to gender integration in the country strategies and the existence of a
gender assessment as a diagnostic tool; SCDs are not formally required to integrate gender. However,
considering that the SCDs are meant to provide the diagnostic for properly guiding the preparation of the
country strategy, and that the World Bank often needs to play a proactive role to generate and sustain country
demand for gender engagement, functionally speaking, it appears that the SCD should discuss gender issues for
a meaningful integration of gender in the CPF to take place, as required.

  This paper reviews if and how social inclusion is addressed in the first 17 SCDs. The paper concludes that
while data on social inclusion is often presented, there is little discussion about the reasons for such exclusion,
and policy recommendations to address it are even less common.

  SCDs aim to address the question: what are the most critical constraints (and opportunities) facing a country
in accelerating progress toward the goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a
sustainable manner?

   The director-general, evaluation, statement to the Board on the occasion of the presentation and discussion of
the World Bank Group Gender Strategy in December 2015 includes the observation that accountability and
incentive mechanisms play a crucial role in the implementation of the gender agenda. IEG observed that “issues
like inadequate project preparation work, poor quality at entry, and reduced budgets for supervision, are
common and may affect the quality of gender integration as much as they do affect other aspects of project
performance. More specific to gender, issues related to prioritization among competing corporate pressures,
proper definition and enforcement of quality standards for what are often perceived ‘add -on’ topics, and
management ‘buy-in’ are also important. All these factors need to be explicitly analyzed, and incentive
mechanisms and clear accountability systems need to be defined, to address them effectively.”
