    A joint analysis of poverty and living
    standards was conducted by a technical
    team from the Ministry of Planning and
    Finance, Government of Myanmar, and
    the Poverty and Equity Global Practice
    of the World Bank.

    The findings of the joint
    analysis are summarized in a
    two-part report:

1   Part One puts forward trends in
    poverty over time. Annexes include
    the technical details of the poverty
    measurement exercise. This report
    also makes recommendations on the
    need to revise the poverty measure
    used to reflect the needs of the
    population a decade after poverty
    was first measured in Myanmar.

2   Part Two (forthcoming) presents the
    poverty profile for 2015 based on the
    new poverty line.
Poverty has previously been estimated using data
from the Integrated Household Living Conditions
Survey conducted in 2004/05 and 2009/10. A key
objective of this part one report was to give an
assessment of poverty in 2015 using data from the
Myanmar Poverty and Living Conditions Survey.


Poverty in Myanmar has previously been estimated
using two different approaches.

Poverty was initially measured by the Government of Myanmar
and its development partners using data from IHLCA-I; this first
measure of poverty based the poverty line and estimate in the
living conditions of 2004/05. Poverty was estimated to be 32.1
percent in 2004/05 and was estimated to have dropped to 25.6
percent in 2009/10 (GOM et al, 2007 and GOM et al, 2011). A
poverty estimate based on 2009/10 standards of living was put
forward by the World Bank in 2014, using data from the IHLCA-II.
The World Bank estimated poverty to be 37.5 percent in 2009/10
(World Bank, 2014).
                                                       This report finds that living standards have improved
                                                       in Myanmar between 2004/05 and 2015, and that
                                                       poverty has declined.

                                                       Poverty is estimated to have declined from 32.1 percent in
                                                       2004/05 to 25.6 percent in 2009/10 and to 19.4 in 2015 using
                                                       the method first proposed by the Government of Myanmar and
                                                       its development partners in 2007, based on living standards
                                                       from 2004/05. Similarly, a decaline was registered using the
                                                       methodology put forward in World Bank (2014): using this second
                                                       method, poverty is estimated to have declined from 44.5 percent
                                                       in 2004/05 to 37.5 percent in 2009/10 and to 26.1 percent in 2015.

                                                       Increases in well-being were seen across a number of
                                                       indicators.

                                                       These improvements in well-being are also reflected in
                                                       multiple measures of welfare, including average consumption
                                                       expenditures and asset ownership.
Urban areas have seen faster expenditure growth
than rural areas.

While living standards in rural areas have seen substantial
improvements, the changes have been more limited than those
seen in Myanmar’s cities and towns. The share of the population
working in agriculture has remained broadly constant between
2004/05 and 2015, and growth in agriculture has been more
limited than growth in manufacturing and services.


Measures of inequality rose over the last five years,
albeit from a low base.

The rise in inequality is noteworthy but unsurprising, as individuals
with better education and more capital to invest benefitted more
from the early liberalizations and reforms. The rise in inequality
replicates the experience of reform periods seen in multiple
countries in the region. While the inequality figures in Myanmar are
not at levels that stand out from a regional or global perspective,
it will be important to monitor reform efforts to ensure that they
have the potential to reach the entire population. Supporting
stronger growth in Myanmar’s farms and villages will be vital,
both for reducing poverty and for keeping inequality in check.


The joint assessment recommends that the
Government of Myanmar consider revising and
rebasing its poverty measure in order to better reflect
living standards and the needs of the poor in 2015.

Myanmar’s poverty estimates are currently based on living
conditions in 2004/05, when poverty was first measured in
Myanmar. Since Myanmar and the needs of its poor have changed
in multiple ways since 2004/05, this joint technical analysis
recommends rebasing and revising Myanmar’s consumption
aggregate and poverty line. Updates to a country’s welfare
aggregate and poverty line are recommended approximately
every ten years to reflect changes in living conditions, such as an
increase in the non-food share, and to reflect changes in survey
and poverty estimation methodology. This revision is suggested
at the end of the period of reporting for the Millennium
Development Goals, and at the beginning of the new period of
international monitoring for the Sustainable Development Goals.


Living conditions and the needs of the poor have
changed in three ways since poverty was first
measured in 2004/05.

First, the share of food in a household’s basket has declined
while non-food items have become more diverse, raising the
need to capture a greater diversity of non-food items. Second,
and related, the number and variety of goods has increased,
particularly for household assets. Third broad reforms have
changed the spending patterns of households, as government
resources to key services have increased allowing households to
diversify the range of items they spend resources on. This report
therefore recommends revising the consumption aggregate and
poverty line to reflect the needs of the population in 2015.


Following acceptance of the recommendation to revise and
rebase the national poverty measure, Part Two of the poverty
assessment (forthcoming) will present a comprehensive poverty
profile using a revised and rebased new poverty measure for
Myanmar.
