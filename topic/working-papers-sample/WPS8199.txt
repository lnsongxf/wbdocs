I. Introduction

The economic thinking around the role of agriculture for development has evolved since the 1950s.
Classical economists viewed economic development as the relocation of factors of production
from a traditional agricultural sector to a more productive, modern industrial sector (Lewis, 1954).
This structural transformation has been described as the process that marks the change from an
agrarian society to an industrial one, and from artisanal manufacturing to mass production. As
economies grow and urbanize, services from commerce, finance, and the state become increasingly
important (Clark, 1951, Kuznets, 1957, Chenery and Syrquin, 1975). Such literature looked at
agriculture as a mere source of underutilized cheap labor, and has paid little attention to the
development of the sector itself.
A new view emerged in the 1960s – largely thanks to the success of the Green Revolution in Asian
economies – highlighting agriculture’s central role as a driver of growth, especially in the early
stages of industrialization (Johnston and Mellor, 1961). This branch of the literature did not oppose
agriculture’s relative decline in size, but rejected the notion of its marginality with regards to the
development process (Trimmer, 1988). Scholars emphasized agriculture’s modernization
potential, in contrast with the traditional view of agriculture as an inherently less productive sector
(North, 1959; Schultz, 1964; Hayami and Ruttan, 1985). Others called attention to agriculture’s
growth linkages and multiplier effects to highlight the sector’s importance for broader economic
development (Adelman, 1984; Mellor, 1998; Hsieh and Sadoulet, 2007).
Recent years witnessed a renewed interest in agriculture’s role for development. The adoption of
the Millennium Development Goals by the United Nations began to shift the development debate
from achieving growth per se to promoting pro-poor – or “shared” – growth (Ravallion and Chen,
2003; Kraay, 2006). Some economists have stressed agriculture’s new role as the result of
globalization, technological and institutional innovations, and environmental constraints. They see
agriculture as a key sector for this new development framework thanks to its potential to
accomplish multiple functions: triggering growth, reducing poverty and inequality, providing food
security, and delivering environmental services (Byerlee, De Janvry and Saudolet, 2009;
Christiaensen, Demery and Kuhl, 2011).

From a development perspective, two main reasons constitute our rationale for focusing on
agricultural productivity. The first reason is agriculture’s relevance in the short run given its size.
The figures on agriculture’s contribution to the economy validate the idea that the sector is far
from being marginal to the development process. Between the last two decades of the 20th century
and the first 15 years of the 2000s agriculture’s contribution has declined globally both in terms
of GDP and employment (Table 1). In the latter period agriculture accounted only 2.7% of the
GDP and 4.5% of total employment in high-income economies. The picture is however quite
different for less wealthy nations. Since 2000, agriculture averaged 28.9% of the GDP of low-
income† economies and 71.4% of total employment. Even among upper-middle income countries
where agriculture downsized from 15.1% to 7.8% of GDP, the sector is still responsible for over
one-fifth of total employment. Agriculture’s relative decline in terms of contribution to
employment and GDP as countries graduate to higher levels of income is a remarkable empirical
regularity. Nonetheless, the sector’s relevance for development is not to be questioned. While it
may be trivial in high-income economies, agriculture’s contribution is still substantial in most of
the developing world.

 Low-income economies are defined as those with a GNI per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method,
of $1,005 or less in 2016; lower middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between $1,006 and $3,955;
upper middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between $3,956 and $12,235; high-income economies
are those with a GNI per capita of $12,236 or more.

The second reason is that, despite its decline in relative size, agriculture continues to play a crucial
role in ensuring a successful structural transformation of the economy in the long run. In non-
industrialized countries agriculture is the only source of government revenue. A sharp and
sustained increase in agricultural productivity is a precondition for industrial development. All of
today’s high-income countries kick started industrialization by taxing their reformed agricultural
sectors.‡ In the subsequent early industrialization phases, a productive agricultural sector becomes
a key contributor to overall growth by stimulating demand for industrial products, containing urban
wages by producing affordable food and ensuring foreign currency inflow through agricultural
exports. As agriculture integrates with the rest of the economy, capital and labor progressively
shift towards uses with higher returns in manufacturing and services. This triggers a convergence
in the labor productivities – and therefore incomes – of the two sectors, but important gaps persist
to the present in rich countries (Table 2).

Notes: Labor productivity is calculated as the ratio between the GDP and the number of workers in each sector. The
     labor productivity gap is calculated as the labor productivity in agriculture expressed as a share of that in
                                             manufacturing and services.

Significant imbalances between urban and rural incomes generate political tensions in response to
which governments tend to protect the agricultural sector from international competition and
ultimately provide direct income subsidies to farmers (Lindert, 1991). Even for industrialized
countries – most of which severely subsidize their farmers – raising agricultural productivity is
key to contain the distortionary and budgetary costs of agricultural protection (Timmer, 1988).


Despite what is discussed above, much of the economic literature has treated agriculture as a
marginal sector, leaving many questions around the drivers of agricultural development

unanswered. In an attempt to fill part of this gap, our research focuses on the role of regulation in
determining economic performance in agriculture. Our research follows the argument of Hayami
and Ruttan (1985), which emphasizes poor institutions as the major constraint to agricultural
performance over resource endowments and technological availability. Unlike capital and
technology, policies and regulations are characterized by high spatial stickiness: they cannot flow
easily across countries. This puts high responsibility in the hands of policy makers across
developing countries to enact an enabling policy and regulatory environment for agriculture.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II summarizes the existing literature
around the relationship between regulation and agricultural transformation. Section III presents
new data on agricultural regulation and proposes some measures of regulatory quality. Section IV
proposes an empirical analysis of the relationship between business regulations and productivity
in agriculture. Section V draws some concluding remarks.


II. Regulation and Agricultural Transformation

The structural change literature studies how countries reallocate their economic activities from
agriculture to other sectors as they develop. A less obvious, though no less important,
transformation occurs within the agricultural sector itself (Timmer 2009). Agricultural
transformation has been shaped by increases in productivity, a shift towards cash crops and high-
value/high-risk varieties, as well as an increased integration with the rest of the economy
(Divanbeigi, Paustian and Loayza 2016). The extent of this transformation has often been
dramatic. From 1960 to the present, agricultural output per hectare has expanded by over 250
percent (Alston, Babcock and Pardey 2010). In some cases, this expansion has been led by
developing countries. Cereal yields in East Asia have risen by an impressive 2.8 percent per year,
much more than the 1.8 percent growth in industrial countries (World Bank 2007).
Progress towards agricultural transformation has however been far from homogeneous.
Economists have thus attempted to identify specific factors behind transformational success. They
identified the success of the Green Revolution (1966 to 1985) and the two decades that followed
as the result of a combination of high rates of investment in crop research, market development
and policy support (Pingali 2012; Hazell 2010). Researchers also recognized public goods
provision such as transport and irrigation infrastructure (Dercon and others 2009; Lipton,


                                                 5
Litchfield and Faurès 2005). Regulatory improvements also contributed to the transformation of
agriculture, though research in this area has been limited. Sustained trade liberalization over the
past five decades also supported agricultural transformation by expanding opportunities for
exporters of agricultural products. In the past 50 years, exports of agricultural products from
developing countries have multiplied eight-fold while those of agriculture-based manufactured
products increased ten-fold. Studies found that regulation impacts the development of key
agricultural markets such as seed (Gisselquist and Grether 2000; Langyintuo et al. 2010),
machinery (Gisselquist and Grether 2000) and fertilizer (Freeman and Kaguongo 2003; Kormawa,
Munyemana and Soule 2003).


Regulation and economic performance
Regulations are sets of rules that constrain the actions of economic agents with the objective of
achieving social goals such as safety, job security or health. The theory of regulation emerged in
the nineteenth century and it encompasses a vast collection of literature.§ Regulations are justified
by structural market failures arising from informational asymmetries, economies of scale in
production, fragmented markets and externalities. In their presence, economic agents do not
internalize the social costs and benefits of their actions, and therefore adequate regulation can raise
social welfare (Pigou 1938). However, the political economy that characterizes regulations is
complex and social goals typically compete with interest groups that distort regulations to capture
economic rents. Industry incumbents can acquire regulations that create rents for themselves
thanks to lower information and organization costs than dispersed consumers (Tullock 1967;
Stigler 1971). Politicians and bureaucrats themselves use regulation both to create rents and to
extract them through campaign contributions, votes, and bribes (McChensney 1987; De Soto 1990;
Shleifer and Vishny 1998).
Over the past decade, a branch of the literature has studied how business regulations affect
economic performance (Djankov, McLiesh and Ramalho 2006; Jalilian, Kirkpatrick and Parker
2007; Loayza and Servén 2010). This depends on the balance between the market failures that
regulations are able to correct and the costs they impose on economic agents. Part of this literature
concentrated on identifying transmission channels through which specific regulations impact
economic performance. They found that obstacles imposed by excessive regulation – e.g. high

business registration costs – prevent firms from investing and push them to the informal sector
(Bruhn 2011; Branstetter et al. 2014). Overregulated labor markets also lead to a large informal
economy and high unemployment because they increase barriers to formal employment and make
markets too rigid to adjust to changing conditions (Amin 2009). Another channel through which
regulation affects firms is by reducing uncertainty. Effective judicial courts, credit markets,
bankruptcy laws and investor protection mechanisms ensure easier contract enforcement and
higher debt recovery rates, shorten debt recovery suits and strengthen the rights of lenders to
recover assets of defaulting borrowers (Visaria 2009). Higher predictability puts companies in a
better position to optimize their productive decisions. Regulations also impact transaction costs
for firms. Several studies show that regulations that make import and export processes more
burdensome significantly decrease trade volumes (Djankov, Freund and Pham 2010; Hoekman
and Nicita 2011). Others highlight the negative effects of high entry-costs on economic output and
productivity across firms (Barseghyan 2008). Similarly, overly strict financial regulations limit
access to financial services and disproportionally penalize smaller firms (Love, Martinez-Peria and
Singh 2016).


Regulation in agriculture
The relationship between regulation and agriculture is far less explored by the literature. The
studies cited above focus mainly on the impact of regulations on manufacturing. But does
regulation play a role in promoting (or hampering) agricultural development? And does this role
differ for different kinds of regulations? Obtaining empirical evidence to answer these questions
is challenging due to the lack of comparable data on both agricultural regulations and production
activities.
From a theoretical standpoint, two arguments motivate us to extend to agriculture the conclusions
drawn by the general literature referenced. The first one is that several components of a supportive
regulatory environment are not sector-specific. Like manufacturing firms, farming businesses
benefit from secure property rights, efficient taxation, increased access to finance and the balanced
entry and operational standards offered by a supportive investment climate.
The second argument is that the above-mentioned channels through which regulation affects
economic performance are critical in agriculture. Externalities are predominant in agriculture,
justifying regulation in a number of areas including biosafety, food safety, grades and standards,

                                                 7
intellectual property protection, agricultural input quality, groundwater extraction, and
environmental protection. Due to agriculture’s importance for human health and food security,
political stability and environmental sustainability, it is not unusual for governments to implement
more stringent agricultural regulations (Diaz-Bonilla 2014).
Another example concerns informality. In general, when the cost of compliance is higher than the
benefits of legality firms may move to the informal sector. As agricultural production involves less
complex processes than services or manufacturing, legal protection and contract enforcement
become less valuable. Consequently, firms in agriculture are more sensitive to regulations with
high costs of compliance, and consequently more prone to avoiding them by remaining (or
becoming) informal (Loayza, Servén and Sugawara 2009).
As discussed, effective regulations reduce uncertainty by setting clear and easily enforceable rules.
Predictability is critical in the farming business where risk is typically inherent. Farmers face
considerable risk due to their susceptibility to exogenous elements such as weather, plague of
insects, and diseases. Moreover, production decisions are made before knowing the market price
of their crops. Uncertainty is further exacerbated by the inherent volatility of agricultural markets
(Aimin 2010).
Transaction costs represent another dimension where regulatory efficiency is key in agriculture.
Transport costs can make up one-third of the farm gate price in some Sub-Saharan African
countries (World Bank 2007) and prevent farmers from specializing in the goods where they have
a competitive advantage (Gollin and Rogerson 2010). High marketing costs due to isolation from
markets and roads, lack of means of transport or inefficient transport services often discourage
farmers from commercializing their production (Gebremedhin and Jaleta 2012). Finally, credit is
often rationed in rural areas and financial services are often low quality and do not respond
adequately to the demand of producers (Hoellinger 2011).
The prevalence of externalities, uncertainty, informality and high transaction costs implies that
regulation matters for agricultural performance. What is more, it suggests that regulations affect
agriculture through dimensions that are peculiar to the farming business. These include regulations
of agricultural input markets such as seed, fertilizer, land and water, as well as regulations that
enable small-scale and remote farmers to access financial services. Moreover, they include product
quality, sanitary and phytosanitary standards as well as licenses regulating trucking services
(Cullinan 1999; Hafeez 2003; Alternburg and von Drachenfels 2007; Goldstein and Udry 2008;

                                                 8
Christy et al. 2009; Das 2012; Dethier and Effenberg 2012; Mobarak and Rosenzweig 2013; Diaz-
Bonilla et al. 2014).
Our research investigates the role played by laws and regulations for agricultural development.
We contribute to the existing literature by employing a new data set that covers regulatory areas
that are specifically relevant for agricultural businesses. We propose new measures of quality and
efficiency for business regulations in agriculture and analyze their relationship with agricultural
productivity.


III. Measuring Regulation in Agriculture

Designing regulations that can pursue social objectives without imposing excessive costs on firms
or other undesired economic effects is no easy task. In the agricultural sector, more balanced
regulations that foster well-functioning markets while ensuring transparent and strong protections
for consumers are needed (Swinnen et al., 2015). Economic research is key in guiding evidence-
based policy making towards more effective regulations. This relies critically on the availability
of firm-level data as well as on data on the quality and efficiency of regulatory practices. To build
our measure of business regulations for agriculture, we use a new data set produced by the World
Bank Group (WBG), Enabling the Business of Agriculture (EBA), which provides benchmarks on
regulations that impact firms along the agricultural value chain.


Data description
EBA indicators cover 62 economies in their 2017 edition.** The data are standardized through
case-study assumptions which allow robust comparison of a country’s regulations with those of
others. EBA data collection is primarily survey-based and the data are validated through a direct
analysis of the relevant legislation. Questionnaires are completed by private and public sector
experts as well as civil society organizations in each target country.
The EBA project collects primary data focusing on legal barriers for businesses operating in
agriculture attempting to quantify the transaction costs of dealing with government regulations.
EBA indicators cover a wide range of regulatory domains that are relevant to firms operating in

agriculture (Table 3). The data set features two types of indicators. Quality indicators reflect the
text of laws and regulations. They assess their conformity with several global regulatory good
practices aimed at correcting market failures. For example, requirements on registration, labeling
and monitoring of new fertilizers are important. They ensure that farmers have full information on
the fertilizer they plan to use on their crops and protect them from purchasing low-quality products.
Inadequate nutrients, heavy metals or other residues found in fertilizer products can contaminate
crops, animals and humans (Sartain et al., 2004). Farmers should be given assurance that the
products they use will not contaminate their crops and the environment.

Further, efficiency indicators measure the transaction costs that firms have to bear to comply with
national regulations on the ground. Transaction costs are expressed in time or monetary units, like
the time and cost needed to comply with requirements on agricultural exports. Regulatory
bottlenecks exporting agricultural products – such as special licenses, registration and export
                                                       10
documentation – can raise transaction costs associated specifically with exports and discourage
private investment in marketing and storage capacity (World Bank, 2012; Pannhausen and Untied,
2010). Delays in obtaining mandatory export documents can reduce overall export volumes due to
damage or deterioration, especially for time-sensitive agricultural products (Djankov, Freund and
Pham, 2010).


Data aggregation: Quality and Efficiency
As discussed, the debate on the impact of regulation evolves around both quality and efficiency
arguments. It depends on the balance between the market failures it is able to correct and the costs
it imposes on businesses. In this context, EBA indicators are of particular interest as they provide
information on both dimensions. Based on the nature of each EBA indicator i we compute our
quality or efficiency scores for economy j as follows:
                                ,                                           ,
                    ,    =                 (1)                ,   =1−                  (2)

where GP, GPmin and GPmax are the observed, minimum and maximum number of regulatory
good practices; TC, TCmin and TCmaxi are the observed, minimum and maximum transaction cost
amounts in the sample. After multiplying them by 100, we obtain scores that are normalized
between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best practice and 0 the worst. To avoid outliers,
transaction costs that exceed the 99th percentile are assigned a value of 0.
A first aggregation is obtained at the topic level by averaging for each economy all normalized
scores for each regulatory area. Topic regulatory scores represent the overall quality of regulations
in a specific area, and can combine efficiency and quality indicators (Table 4).

Topic-level scores display a moderate positive correlation. The lowest correlation (0.14) is found
between Machinery and Finance regulations, while the highest (0.68) is found between Seed and

ICT regulations. Further, aggregate measures for regulatory efficiency and quality are obtained by
averaging all efficiency and quality indicators for each economy. The quality and efficiency
components are then averaged to build a measure of overall regulatory quality. Both regulatory
good practices and transaction costs display large variation across the sample. This derives from
the diversity of regulatory practices enacted by the countries in our sample. The measure of
regulatory efficiency appears more dispersed, while countries are more clustered around the mean
when it comes to regulatory quality. This may be in part driven by construction, given that
efficiency measures are based on continuous variables while quality ones are categorical. On both
dimensions, the right tail of the distribution is widened by a number of good performers (Figure
1).

Averaging quality and efficiency, we observe a positive association between income levels and

the supportiveness of countries’ regulatory environment. Countries with higher income per capita

have in fact more efficient and higher quality agricultural regulations (Figure 2).

To explore further the relationship between regulatory quality and efficiency, we look at country-
level scores on the two dimensions (Figure 3).

These display a positive correlation (0.67), suggesting that countries with more regulatory good
practices tend to impose lower transaction costs on agricultural businesses.†† A number of

countries combine low transaction costs with a high number of regulatory good practices. This
points against the argument that improvements in regulatory quality involve high efficiency costs.
Spain displays good practices across several regulatory areas. It enacts sound requirements on
registration, labeling and monitoring of new fertilizers. Further, it ensures reliable pest
management and control at the border through surveillance and pest reporting obligations,
quarantine pest lists and risk-based border inspections, domestic containment and border
quarantine procedures. At the same time, transaction costs that agribusinesses in Spain bear to
register new fertilizer, commercialize new seed varieties and export agricultural goods are rather
low. Conversely, other economies perform poorly in either dimension. Liberia, for example, lacks
most mentioned good practices while imposing high transaction costs on agribusinesses. Finally,
several countries display high scores in only one of the two dimensions while not performing as
well on the other, showing potential for targeted regulatory improvement.


Correlations with other measures of institutional quality
The EBA overall score provides a synthetic measure of the quality of countries’ regulatory
environment for agriculture. To be effective, however, regulations need to be enforced. One
potential critique to EBA indicators could be that, being largely based on law on the books, the
good practices that they reward may not be observed in practice. In this case one would expect a
negative association between our scores and measures of law enforcement. Conversely, EBA
scores could be perfectly correlated with other measures of business regulation making them
redundant.
To address these points, we look at the correlations between EBA scores and the following indexes:
Rule of Law (RoL) from the Worldwide Governance Indicators database and the Ease of Doing
Business (DB) from the World Bank’s Doing Business data set. As expected, both correlations are
positive and significant. The RoL index proxies the level of enforcement of laws and other societal
rules. Its positive correlation (r=0.63) with the EBA score implies that where good regulatory
practices are in place, laws also tend to be better enforced. On the other hand, the DB index
measures the quality of a country’s business regulations for the manufacturing and services sectors.
EBA scores do not correlate perfectly with the DB index (r=0.74). This implies that our measure
captures different and more agriculture-specific dimensions of overall regulatory quality.

IV. Results

The economic literature presented above argues that regulations can contribute to agricultural
development through several channels, many of which are specific to the sector. Among these,
they stress efficient input markets, secure water rights, effective rural ICT and transportation
services, accessible irrigation systems, comprehensive financial infrastructure and sound sanitary
and phytosanitary standards. In order to provide new evidence to this literature we investigate the
relationship between regulation and productivity in agriculture.
The first data set used draws from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (2016) and
covers agricultural total output and countries’ stock of human capital. The agricultural total output
is measured by agricultural value added in constant 2000 US dollars.‡‡ The stock of human capital
is measured by combining primary, secondary and tertiary gross enrollment ratios. Moreover,
figures on main agricultural inputs (labor, land and livestock) are drawn from FAO (2016).§§
Fertilizer use is measured as the sum of nitrogen, potash, and phosphate content of various
fertilizers consumed, in metric tons. Labor is in thousands of economically active population in
agriculture. Land is measured as thousands of hectares of arable land and permanent cropland.
Livestock is measured in thousands of cow-equivalent livestock units, as calculated by Hayami
and Ruttan (1970). To take the effect of climate conditions into account, we add the variable of
average annual precipitation in the model. The data of this variable are provided by the WDI
database. This variable is presumed to have positive impact on agricultural productivity as in other
studies (Weibe, 2003). We use data from CIA (2016) to build a dummy variable for landlocked
countries. Previous studies have found this geographical property to have negative impacts on a
country’s development (Faye et al., 2004).
Following the approach of Lio and Liu (2008), we estimate country i’s aggregate agricultural
production function as:


                   =    +                     +              +                         +              +      (3)


‡‡
   Converting production value in domestic currency to US dollars may result in a downward bias for products relevant
to developing countries. An alternative is using international dollars, but following Antle (1983) we prefer to use US
dollars as purchasing power parity-adjusted values might overstate the agricultural production in developing countries.
§§
   Fertilizer was excluded from the analysis due to its high correlation with EBA indicators. This is due to the presence
of several indicators relating to fertilizer regulation among our aggregate measures based on regulatory quality.

                                                          15
This specification allows us to study the association between regulation and agricultural output
after controlling for agricultural inputs (labor, land, livestock, human capital), country
characteristics (average precipitation, landlocked-ness) and regional fixed-effects. The available
sample has 59 countries.*** Following Huber (1967) and White (1980) we employ OLS regression
with robust standard errors to address heteroskedasticity.
The adjusted R2 for all OLS regressions exceeds 0.75, which suggests that the fitted regression
outcomes explain the variation in cross-country agricultural outputs by a significant level. Table 5
displays the results of one baseline regression (OLS1) where we have excluded the regulatory
measures to maximize sample size. Further, we report 3 estimations of our model performed using
our overall (OLS2), quality (OLS3) and efficiency (OLS4) regulatory measures as explanatory
variables.

In all estimations inputs show the expected positive sign and achieve statistical significance. In
OLS4 LIVESTOCK is not statistically significant. The coefficient of the LANDLOCK variable is
negative and significant in all estimations, confirming a negative impact of countries’ landlocked-
ness on agricultural productivity. Our empirical results support the hypothesis that better
agricultural regulation is associated with higher agricultural productivity. Regression OLS2 shows
a positive and statistically significant coefficient for our overall measure of regulatory quality,
indicating that a country with better agricultural regulations produces on average more agricultural
output with the same amounts of agricultural inputs. Regressions OLS3 and OLS4 test our
efficiency and quality measures separately and show a similar result: lower regulatory transaction
costs and a higher number of regulatory good practices are associated with higher average
agricultural productivity. Comparing the 3 proposed indicators, the overall measure displays a
larger coefficient, indicating that quality and efficiency features display a stronger association with
agricultural productivity when they are combined.
From these results, we cannot establish causality. In fact, while countries might be more productive
thanks to better regulation, it could also be that regulation is better in more productive countries
where more resources are available to improve business regulation. Moreover, there could be
another variable that makes regulatory quality and agricultural output move together. Following
La Porta et al (1998), we instrument business regulations with countries’ legal origin.††† Table 5
reports the results of the two-stage least squared model (2SLS). The effect of more business-
friendly regulation on agricultural productivity remains positive and significant.


V. Conclusions
The development of the agricultural sector has been considered a key priority for all developing
countries. Economists and policy makers have devoted their attention to improving agricultural
technologies, physical infrastructure and education. More recently, the interest on the role of
institutions such as governance and regulations on economic development has increased. We
propose new measures of regulatory quality and efficiency in agriculture. Employing these we
explore the relationship between the heterogeneity in countries’ agricultural productivity and their
regulatory environment. We find some evidence to confirm the hypothesis that regulation

contributes to agricultural outcomes. Our results indicate that agricultural productivity is on
average higher where transaction costs imposed by regulations are lower and where countries
adhere to a higher number of regulatory good practices. In particular, this relationship is stronger
when low transaction costs and regulatory good practices are combined. The outcome of our
research is encouraging, but points at the need for improved agricultural data. Better coverage and
quality of data on agricultural productivity and regulation are needed to measure their relationship
with higher precision. In this regard, one limitation of our study is represented by its purely cross-
sectional nature. A panel analysis is necessary to further test the robustness of our hypothesis and
will be conducted once the necessary data are available.
