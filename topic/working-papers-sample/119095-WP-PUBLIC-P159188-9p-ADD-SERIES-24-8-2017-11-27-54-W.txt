Key Characteristics of Aggregation Case Study
                                  La Línea Regional Scheme, Colombia
Context                          •	 Upper-middle-income country
                                 •	 Aggregation covering urban and rural areas
                                 •	 Low level of water supply and sanitation (WSS) performance
Purpose                          Performance, professionalization, economic efficiency
Scope                            WSS functions and services
Scale                            •	 Administrative boundaries
                                 •	 Localities covered: 4 for water
                                 •	 Population covered: 32,000 inhabitants for water
                                 •	 Coverage: 67%a for water
                                 •	 Connections: 5,051 for water
Process                          Voluntary and incentivized
Governance                       •	 Delegated (18 months and 15 yearsb)
                                 •	 Public-private partnership (PPP)
                                 •	 Decision making: the intermunicipal public company for local services is the contracting party signing the
                                    build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract
                                 •	 Asset transfer: assets remain the property of municipalities and are transferred to the operator for the
                                    duration of the delegation contract
                                 •	 Liability: liabilities and debts from previous operators are not taken over by the private operator
                                 •	 Staff transfer: none
                                 •	 Clear entry and exit rules as stipulated in the PPP contract
Outcome                          Negative

Findings                         Political opportunistic behaviors, lack of long-term financial support, lack of utility champion and governance
