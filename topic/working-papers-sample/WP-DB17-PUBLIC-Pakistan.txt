This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

                    Pakistan reduced the time to export by improving electronic
                    communication between the Karachi Port authorities and the
DB2011
                    private terminals, which have also boosted efficiency by
                    introducing new equipment.
                    Pakistan made trading across borders easier by introducing a
                    fully automated, computerized system (the Web-Based One
DB2015              Customs system) for the submission and processing of export
                    and import documents. This reform applies to both Lahore and
                    Karachi.
                    Pakistan made exporting and importing easier by enhancing
DB2017
                    its electronic "Web Based One Customs Platform".

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is

                                     Answer                                   Explanation
                                                 After Mirage's default on payment, the BizBank will bring a recovery
                                                 action (foreclosure proceedings) under Section 9 of the Financial
                  Karachi,                       Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance 2001, against the

                  Lahore                         Mirage at the Banking Court. This is the most effective way for
                                                 BizBank to recoup its investment with the security interest over
                                                 Mirage's assets.

                                              After Court's decision on Mirage's case, BizBank would gain
                  Karachi,                    possession of Mirage's assets and sell them piecemeal in a public
Outcome                        piecemeal sale
                  Lahore                      auction by the court appointed auctioneer. The hotel will stop
                                              operating.

                                                 The foreclosure procedure until BizBank is repaid some or all of the
                                                 money owed to it takes approximate 2.8 years. BizBank would
                                                 initiate foreclosure 3 months after Mirage's default. The Court will
                                                 then review the case, notify all relevant parties, hold a hearing and
                                                 appoint an official receiver. This period usually takes about 4

                                                 additional 4 months to have the court's final decision made. The
                                                 court would then appoint an auctioneer to conduct the sale of
                                                 Mirage's assets. Execution of the auction sale until BizBank is repaid
                                                 takes around 1 year.

                                                 The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately

Doing Business introduced new data on job quality in 2015. Doing Business 2017 covers eight questions on job
quality (i) whether the law mandates equal remuneration for work of equal value; (ii) whether the law mandates
nondiscrimination based on gender in hiring; (iii) whether the law mandates paid or unpaid maternity leave; (iv)
the minimum length of paid maternity leave (in calendar days); (v) whether employees on maternity leave receive
100% of wages; (vi) the availability of five fully paid days of sick leave a year; (vii) whether a worker is eligible for
an unemployment protection scheme after one year of service; and (viii) the minimum duration of the contribution
period (in months) required for unemployment.

would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
