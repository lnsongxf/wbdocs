This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2016 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2016 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2017 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

       The company name can be verified at the commercial registry (Ficheiro
       Central de Denominações Sociais), affiliated with the Ministry of Justice.

       To obtain the company name certificate, an application (with copy of
       identification attached) must be filed with the one stop shop (Guichê
       Único da Empresa), as follows:
       1. State the company’s proposed name                                                      Kz 400 + Kz 29,090

      Verify the company documents at the Guichê Único da Empresa

      Companies have 2 options: either to resort to a lawyer's services to
      draft the company documents or to fill in the standards documents
      themselves. If the company decides to use the standard Statutes of
      Association from the Guichê Único da Empresa (2 pages), it takes
      around 1 hour to complete. The applicant just enters the information
      (ID info of associates, address, activities of company) and confirms that                  included in

      Obtain NIF

      Once documents are verified and completed, applicants must apply to
      the National Tax Office (Direcção National dos Impostos) to obtain the
      National Identification Number (NIF).

      The applicant submits the dossier to the Notary Public at the Guichê
      Único da Empresa. Once the Notary reviews and notarizes the dossier,
      he will have a reading with the applicant present or the accredited
      person to ensure that there are no mistakes. This service fee is included
      in the Guichê fees and takes a day depending on room availability and
      complexity of the company’s Articles of incorporation. After this lecture,

      Each agent from each institution is in charge of sending the files to
      his/her agency, but this doesn't impede on the process of registration.

      Obtain the Commercial Operations Permit from the Ministry of
      Commerce

      To carry out commercial activities in Angola, a company must obtain a
      commercial operations permit (Alvará) from the Ministry of Commerce.
      To apply for the issuance of the commercial operations permit, the
      following documents must be filed with the Municipal Delegation of the
      Ministry of Commerce:
      (a) company’s notary deed of incorporation;
      (b) copy of the tax identification card;
      (c) commercial registration certificate;
      (d) statistical registration certificate;
      (e) extracts from the criminal record of the founders;
      (f) opinion, by the relevant administrative authority, on the company’s
      geographical location and social and economic feasibility; and
      (g) a photocopy of ID or passport. For the issuance of the commercial
      operations permit, one requirement is for the relevant administrative
      authorities to inspect the company’s premises to confirm they are
      suitable for commercial activities.
                                                                                   Between 15-45    see procedure

      In order to obtain the license, some inspections to the facilities need to       days             details
      take place in some businesses.

      Since the Decree no. 40/12 came into effect, it is now possible to get a
      provisional license right away giving the firm a permit to operate for
      180 days while the definitive license is issued by the Ministry of
      Commerce. The entrepreneur can apply online to schedule the

        Before obtaining the proof of title, BuildCo must also obtain the

        case study that BuildCo already owns the land.

        BuildCo must obtain a proof of title of property for the land from
        the Real Estate Registry in Luanda. An updated certificate of the
        property ("certidão predial") is obtained from the relevant Real
        Estate Registry. It sets out a full description of the property,
        including information on its owner and any charges, liens or

     meter road (such as by excavation or overhead
     lines) but are all carried out on public land. There

    Does not require work to install the internal
     wiring of the warehouse. This has already been
     completed up to and including the customer’s
     service panel or switchboard and the meter base.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       An updated tax certificate is obtained from the relevant Tax Office,
       detailing the description of the property (Certidão Matricial). An
       important piece of information to obtain from the tax certificate is
       whether the property was ever confiscated by the State upon freedom
       from Portugal. Sometimes this information will not be included in the tax
       certificate. In this case, the buyer or his/her lawyer has to search the    4 to 6 months

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11

rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
