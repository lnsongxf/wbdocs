          gender analysis                                           Tip 2
                                                                    Questions to initiate a gender analysis
     The gender analysis can be divided into three main
     steps (adapted from FAO 2014a):                                To start a gender analysis, you may consider the
                                                                    following set of questions, disaggregating data
                                                                    by sex and age:
     1.	 Planning: During this step, we need to select the
         framework for the gender analysis, what are the            ▶▶ Labor: Who does what? How? Where?
                                                                       When? Why?
         potential target groups (both men and women),
         what needs to be explored, what questions have to be       ▶▶ Access: Who uses what? How? Where?
                                                                       When? Why?

         complementary analytical frameworks exist for

         planning gender analysis.                                  ▶▶ Participation: Who is included in what? How?
                                                                       Where? When? Why?

     2.	 Data collection: Data required for gender analysis         Source: FAO and CCAFS, 2013.
         can be collected from different sources, using
         various data collection methods and tools, such
         as sex-disaggregated statistics (if available),
         meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, key      Using participatory tools for data collection is highly
         informant interviews, discussions with different        recommended to engage the intended beneficiaries
         stakeholder groups, and participatory data              from the start and also to give voice to disadvantaged
         collection methods. It is important to combine          and vulnerable groups of men and women.

         perceptions and points of view of men and women         tools for the context analysis, livelihood analysis, and
         and different stakeholders, and to also employ          stakeholder analysis, and it discusses how those tools
         triangulation, which uses different data collection     can be used to collect data for a gender analysis in
         methods and compares data from different sources        CSA interventions. Detailed guidance on the use of
         to obtain a more reliable and comprehensive view        participatory gender analysis tools can be found in the

narrower focus than that of a comprehensive and
long-term program (see Example  4 on Oxfam’s

human resources available will also affect the scope

reason, it is important to partner with others and, if
feasible, combine data collection for gender analysis

topics centered on the following questions: What
are the three main gender issues when promoting
agroforestry or conservation agriculture in your
country? Why these three? Would these issues create
barriers to adoption of agroforestry or conservation
agriculture? If yes, how could they be overcome?

Checklist to explore potential effects of CA on women and men in
smallholder agricultural systems

 Category        Questions for exploring potential effects of CA on women and men

 Food security   ▶▶ Is there potential for a yield increase? Who benefits from this?
 and nutrition   ▶▶ Will crop rotation/intercropping affect nutrition diversity and food security? How?
 diversity
                 ▶▶ Will herbicides and mulch layers affect traditional intercrops and wild vegetables (often planted/
                    controlled by women)? If so, will this affect nutrition diversity, food security, or increase
                    gender disparities?
                 ▶▶ Does anyone depend on crop residues? Is there a risk that livestock farmers will be negatively
                    affected if residues are retained for mulching? What are the gender implications?
                 ▶▶ Will food or cash crops be grown? If cash crops are used, who controls the income, and is it
                    allocated to household food and health expenditure?
                 ▶▶ What is the risk of yield reduction, and how will it affect food security?
                 ▶▶ What types of crops provide more/less risks for food security? Who will be most affected?
                 ▶▶ What types of crops for intercropping provide more/less risk for food security?
                 ▶▶ Who decides, and who will be most affected by, decisions taken by others? Is there any specific
                    gender impact?

 Health          ▶▶ Will yield increase or crop diversification improve nutrition? How? Will household members benefit
                    equally? How will this lead to better health?
                 ▶▶ Is there a risk that herbicide use may lead to health hazards? How? Who will be affected?
                 ▶▶ What are the effects of increased labor requirements on household members, especially
                    women and children? For example, is there a risk that children’s welfare and nutrition may be
                    negatively affected?

 Access to       ▶▶ Do extension services target women and men equally? Are the extension services gender-
 information        responsive – i.e., do they consider women’s special needs?
 and             ▶▶ Will the understanding of agricultural management practices be increased? Whose understanding?
 technology         Is there a risk this may increase gender disparities? Who will be targeted and who will benefit?
                 ▶▶ Will other sustainable agricultural technologies be discussed as alternatives to CA?
                 ▶▶ What are women’s specific needs and constraints in the farming system? Are these taken into
                    account? Is there a risk that women may be excluded from the use and benefits of mechanization
                    due to prevailing gender norms?

 Resources and   ▶▶ How will the introduction of CA change the division of tasks and the roles of men and women?
 labor           ▶▶ Who will benefit from reduced drudgery due to mechanization and/or reduced tilling?
                 ▶▶ Will labor requirements for land preparation increase in the short term? Who will do this labor?
                 ▶▶ Whose labor will be reduced when herbicides are introduced? To whom is this a benefit?
                 ▶▶ Who can lose out from a reduction in labor requirements?
                 ▶▶ Are herbicides available and affordable? To whom? Who decides on herbicide use?
                 ▶▶ Who has access to and control over land? Is there a risk that land improvement through CA can
                    lead to loss of access to land and/or water?
                 ▶▶ Is there a risk that crop rotation/intercropping will lead to “men’s crops” encroaching on females’
                    plots? Is there a risk that women may lose access to land or control of traditional “women’s crops”
                    and/or related income?
                 ▶▶ Is there a risk that labor requirements to obtain alternative livestock feed or fuel will increase if
                    residue availability is reduced? Who will be affected by this?
                 ▶▶ Who, if anybody, is affected when herbicides/mechanization replace labor? Women or men? Do they
                    have alternative income opportunities? What does it mean for their families and for food security?

                    affect shepherds/livestock producers?
                 ▶▶ What are the effects of investment in CA technologies on households’ financial situations?
                 ▶▶ Who (men or women, or both) markets the crops?
                 ▶▶ Are CA products recognized by traders, retailers, and consumers?
                 ▶▶ What types of markets are accessible to men and women, such as group marketing, local markets,          49

How to integrate gender issues
in climate-smart agriculture projects
Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an approach aimed at sustainably increasing
agricultural productivity and incomes; adapting and building resilience to climate
change; and reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas emissions. When it comes
to developing and adopting CSA practices, men and women are not starting at the
same point, due to their different access to productive resources, financial capital,
and advisory services. There is now an international consensus that the design and
implementation of climate change response strategies and projects must consider
gender‑specific differences in the capacity to adapt to and mitigate climate change.

The training module How to Integrate Gender Issues in Climate-smart Agriculture Projects
provides practical approaches for designing gender‑responsive CSA projects. It uses
lessons from previous work to illustrate ways of integrating gender issues throughout
the project cycle to ensure that the specific needs and priorities of men and women
are adequately addressed. The module also provides an overview of gender‑responsive
planning and implementation processes, approaches and tools for conducting a gender
analysis, a glossary of key terms and concepts of CSA and gender, and checklists for
gender integration in each phase of the project cycle.
