Executive Summary

Urban water services in Australia are recognized as delivering efficiency, productivity and
security of supply as well as upholding robust environmental standards. This has not always
been the case, and how Australia has reformed urban water supply services has yet to be
fully documented. The story of reform in the Australian urban water sector is varied and
multifaceted. It is a story of government policy leadership together with sector-driven
changes and adaptations, in response to shifting institutional, economic and environmental
conditions and demands.
  To assist in understanding this story of progress, this report focuses on highlighting the
important context for each of the significant Australian reforms, and emphasises why unique
and varied historical circumstances (along with the influential figures involved) in this
process matter. The report begins by outlining the study background, including the aims of
­
the study, the framework used, and the research methods. The report describes reforms in
the Australian urban water supply services in four main parts:

•	 Historical context and chronology of reforms

•	 Drivers of reforms and formal responses by governments

•	 Development of a retrospective framework for reforms by exploring how they were trans-
  lated into actions

•	 Exploration of the experiences of states and utilities in the reform process

  Through these components of reform, the roles of institutions, structures, and stakehold-
ers are considered, including (a) the national, state, and local governments; (b) in-service
delivery models in the urban water sector; (c) regional utilities; (d) economic regulations;
(e) financial incentives; (f) the private sector; and (g) a growing focus on customer service
and engagement. Part II provides a deep dive into the reforms that took place in New South
Wales. This deep dive allows the reader to understand how the broader national reforms
played out at the state level.
  A summary of the history of reforms in the Australian context over a 30-year period from
the 1980s through 2010 is provided. The narrative covers the transition from the traditional
model of “build and supply” urban water utilities—based on a rigid structure of state-owned
bodies, which were highly fragmented across the nation—through isolated attempts at pric-
ing reform, and subsequently, a series of national economic reform agendas that enabled
transformation of the urban water sector.
  Over the decades the drivers of reform varied: the first phase focused on improvement of
water supply performance and outcomes, the roles of the states and the federal government,
governance reform, and corporatization of the water sector. The second phase was to a
greater extent driven by the impacts of drought. Responses included the adoption of inte-
grated water resource management approaches, including consideration of the challenges

                                             and pathways for achieving security of supply. The research herein provides an understand-
                                             ing of the factors that were relevant at different times, and in different places, in the reform
                                             process (figure ES.1, figure ES.2).
                                                     The research shows that three core sets of activities underpinned the initial state- or
                                             utility-led reform programs, and of the later national-level reform agendas of the Council of
                                             ­
                                             Australian Governments (COAG) and the National Water Initiative (NWI). These core activi-
                                             ties included the following:

                                             •	 Reforming the pricing of urban water services and supply

                                             •	 Modernizing institutional arrangements and structures

                                             •	 Improving environmental and resource management

                                                     The report then outlines the reform framework as defined by COAG (Figure ES.2), exploring the
                                             workings of institutional reforms that not only increased utility efficiency and return on invest-

involved an important and mostly amicable interplay between the federal and state
­governments, including performance-based fiscal transfers to states that undertook reforms—
and therefore required the necessary budget at the federal level to provide sufficient incen-
tives (i.e., $A 5.7 billion over a seven-year period). Independent regulation was put in place,
limiting political interference and enhancing financial sustainability in the sector. There were
clear champions at the political and top posts in the utilities who were ready to undertake
tough and wide-reaching changes, including reacting quickly to immediate needs, such
as drought.
  The World Bank operates in countries with quite different enabling environments and
­
economic contexts than Australia. The types of challenges low- and middle-income coun-
tries (LMICs) often face in the water sector include:

•	 Insufficient financial resources to make the investments required to increase access and
  improve service delivery

•	 Lack of incentives on the part of service providers to improve service quality and
  efficiency

•	 Inequity in coverage between rural and urban areas

•	 Challenges with ability or willingness to pay (at least once connected to a network)

•	 Inability to sustain service level improvements

•	 Management of extreme circumstances, such as very constrained water resources
  or floods

  Contextual factors that were important in Australia may or may not exist in Bank client
countries. For example, the establishment of an effective forum for developing intergovern-
mental agreements (i.e., COAG) and the relatively small number of states and territories
participating in the negotiation of national strategic agreements can be challenging in many
­
LMIC environments. The ability to establish a regulatory system removed from political
interference and, therefore, make fairly predictable and consistent decisions to support
financial sustainability can also be challenging. The World Bank’s World Development Report
2017: Governance and the Law states that commitment, coordination and cooperation
(“the three Cs”) are critical for appropriate governance to effectively deliver services. Many
LMICs have far to go on establishing and implementing institutional, policy, regulatory, and
other interventions that enhance the three Cs, whereas Australia’s water sector already
embodies these principles.
  Nevertheless, being cognizant that there are really no “best practices” (WDR 2017 encour-
ages development practitioners to move away from this notion) and that each enabling
environment is quite different, there are lessons to learn from the reform process in
Australia’s water sector. In particular, countries organized in the federal-state model can
learn from the reform process in Australia, which clearly has involved mechanisms and
practices enhancing some degree of commitment, coordination, and cooperation from both

    the federal and state levels. Further, Australia’s sector is dominated by corporatized
    state-owned ­
    ­           enterprises; therefore, there are good lessons for LMICs that rely heavily on
    publicly owned utilities, including on how to incentivize, regulate, and monitor them. The
    common process steps observed from the Australian experience are distilled in this report,
    and may help inform development practitioners seeking to take a similar reform journey
    toward greater efficiency and effectiveness in the urban water sector.




6   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
Chapter 1   Introduction

            In 2016, the International Water Centre (IWC), with funding from the World Bank, com-
            menced a review of the water utilities reform processes in Australia. The aim of this work is
            to explore the key success factors in the reform of urban water supply services through a
            study of the Australian example, from which relevant lessons can be drawn for other
            countries. To meet this aim, the IWC and researchers from the University of Queensland have
            sought to identify commonalities and differences between the steps taken by the various
            states and water utilities during Australia’s experience of reform in the urban water sector.
              In Australia, responsibility for land and water management is delegated to states (six states
            and two mainland territories; see map 1). States each play a leading role for water policy for
            urban water supply, with local authorities taking the main delivery role for water services
            beyond the major cities. The national government assumes roles associated with enablement,
            funding, and oversight, and setting strategic directions to ensure national interests. The prog-
            ress of the Australian urban water reform process has been an interplay between those levels
            that is neither simple nor linear. Our research examines and illustrates the Australian case
            through a framework that distinguishes between “levels” (scales) and paces of reform.
            Documentation of Australia’s reform history needs to differentiate between the states’ actions;
            this allows for inspection of different approaches and paces in reform, and highlights how
            shared approaches evolved in different settings to address unique challenges.
              One goal of our research is to reveal insights into the interplay between the state level of
            reform and regulation and national framework agreements. The related story of regulatory
            oversight, as part of the overall reform process, has been examined elsewhere. For example,
            the role of the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) in New South Wales is
            important to that state’s pricing, regulatory, and sector reforms. Because there are many les-
            sons to be learned from the New South Wales case—including and beyond IPART—the urban
            water sector reforms in New South Wales are the subject of a case study (see part II).
              Thus, this report analyzes urban water reforms initiated by recent national agreements
            in Australia, and demonstrates variations between jurisdictions and between approaches
            at different times. The analysis focuses on water utilities in the major cities (principally
            the state-level capital cities). The analysis also demonstrates how the Australian urban
            water reform process is part of a wider and longer series of national and subnational reg-
            ulatory reforms since the late 1980s. These include competition policy reform, corpora-
            tization of government agencies, and the formation in the 1990s of the Council of
            Australian Governments (COAG). The COAG was crucial for bringing all states on board
            for reform in Australia, but there are major questions about how such coalition building
            among governmental leaders and senior bureaucrats can be adapted to the circumstances
            of other countries.
              Some of the factors that led to successful reforms in Australia include (but are not limited
            to) incentives, political will, skill levels, technology, funding, and increased customer focus.

Chapter 2   History of Reforms

            The research for this report examined the interplay and collaboration between various levels
            of government, water utilities, and sector governance bodies in Australia. The results fit into
            the wider context of government major reform agendas, such as the National Competition
            Policy (NCP), introduced by the national government in the mid-1990s. But there are several
            contextual factors to consider along the reform pathway; being aware of these multiple
            strands in which reform appeared can help draw out relevant lessons for other contexts.
            Policy makers need to consider how the story of Australian urban water reforms can be inter-
            preted from different perspectives, and with a view to the historical context from which the
            reform movement emerged and played out. This information is gleaned from historical
            accounts and supplemented through interviews with urban water sector experts whose
            insights and perspectives help focus attention on relevant contextual factors.


            2.1. Australian Context
            Since the beginning of European settlement of the Australian continent, access to water
            resources has been a central concern of life and livelihoods, much as it had been for the
            indigenous inhabitants in previous centuries. Yet the British colonies in Australia faced
            problems with water management from early times, owing to their unfamiliarity with the
            water supply and the climatic vagaries of Australia’s environment. Australia is now renowned
            for its highly variable climate, evidenced by recurrent droughts interspersed with periodic
            floods. Unpredictable rainfall patterns and high rates of evaporation mean that Australia is
            the driest inhabited continent, yet, probably unsurprisingly, among the “thirstiest” of water
            consumers in today’s terms. To illustrate this, Australia—with a population of roughly
            24 million, of whom about 90 percent live in dense urban areas on the coastal fringe—stores
            more water per head of population than any other developed nation (BOM 2015).
              Since federation in 1901, Australia is a commonwealth of six states and two mainland
            territories. Under the nation’s Constitution, the governments of these separate jurisdic-
            tions bear responsibility for land and water management, with the national government
            assuming responsibility for enablement, funding and oversight, and seeking to chart direc-
            tions for “the national interest” (AWA 2012). This relationship between government levels
            has shaped the processes for water management for more than a century. By the 1980s,
            governments and their agencies were wrestling with difficult economic and cross-­
            jurisdictional environmental challenges, with many calling for a national approach to
            tackle the most pressing issues. One such challenge was developing a national water reform
            agenda, which required the agreement of the national government and the governments of
            each of the states and territories.

     2.2. Build and Supply Era
     The period from federation in 1901 until the latter part of the 20th century was characterized
     as a “build and supply” development phase of large-scale water storage construction
     and distribution systems in each of the states. During this period a fairly rigid structure of
     state-owned water bodies were consolidated, operating on traditional “unlimited public
     resource” assumptions. By the 1980s, however, the large investments in capacity building in
     the water resource sector had brought numerous problematic issues to light. Governments
     were saddled with a significant legacy of debt and ongoing system maintenance expendi-
     tures after many years of substantial infrastructure investment. The short-term focus behind
     some water infrastructure development left certain regions experiencing increasing water
     demand and competition for scarce and variable water resources, with limited options to
     augment existing storage sites in a cost-effective manner.
       During this period Australia’s water sector was, and in some regions still remains, highly
     fragmented. The system was dominated by large, bureaucratic, publicly owned institutions,
     which provided water and sewerage services to the capital cities, but there were also
     hundreds of small authorities or local government agencies providing variable quality,
     sometimes unreliable, and nearly always unprofitable, water and sewerage services to
     regional communities. This fragmented pattern invited cross-subsidization to other local
     government services in those communities. These water authorities set their own service
     charges and in many cases established inconsistent environmental standards. Prices for
     water services in urban centers had long been tied to property values, rather than the actual
     costs of water supply or levels of water consumption. Water metering was not used univer-
     sally across the major cities, and in one instance, the City of Brisbane in the 1980s even
     abandoned a metering plan for new residential subdivisions owing to concern about elec-
     toral popularity. River catchment areas and marine outflows surrounding major cities
     frequently suffered from poorly controlled urban wastewater discharges. As the public
     increasingly demanded consistent and affordable piped water services, governments faced
     an increasing need to enforce environmental standards coupled with increased pressure for
     financial efficiency. As a result, the focus of water management in urban settings eventually
     shifted to tackling debt control; ineffective water pricing and service delivery; and environ-
     mental impacts and water security. These changes did not occur overnight, but unfolded
     over a 30-year period commencing in the 1980s.



     2.3. Early State-Led Initiatives
     Initial reforms emerged at utility and state levels. Typically these early initiatives were iso-
     lated responses to specific issues within their respective jurisdictions. In Victoria, a Public
     Bodies Review Committee, established in 1980 to evaluate all public organizations, under-
     took a wide-ranging and bipartisan review of water management. At that time there
     were many small urban water authorities in Victoria outside the capital city, some with a


10   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
customer base of less than thirty residents. The committee’s detailed study of institutional
arrangements and water resource management produced an influential report in 1983,
setting an agenda for long-term water reform in Victoria (Public Bodies Review Committee
1983). The report drove structural change in Victorian water reform for decades following.
It led to the consolidation of water authorities to less than 20, and responsibility was shifted
from local government to state authorities. This was a significant reform milestone, sending
signals to other states and to the national government of what could be achieved in the
context of bipartisan agenda setting.


2.4. First Wave of National-Led Reforms
Prime Minister Bob Hawke (1983–91) had played a key role as a consensus builder, guiding
his government on what was politically feasible and how best to achieve collaborative reform
that was palatable to the public. Hawke’s example, and his legacy of a shared policy agenda,
paved the way for his successors in the government and industry sectors in the 1990s. Hawke
helped establish settings in which often difficult structural reforms were achievable owing
to consensus politics, which he promoted. In fact, a Hawke proposal to convene regular
“special Premiers conferences,” the first of which was held in Brisbane in 1990, proved to be
the forerunner of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in 1992. Moreover, the
Hawke government increased the social wage as part of its lauded Wages Accord with
the nation’s trade unions, a policy that allowed it the public standing to introduce further
economic liberalization reforms.
  The impetus for national economic reforms in the 1990s largely came from Hawke’s
successor as prime minister, Paul Keating (1991–96).1 He was supported in these endeav-
ours by a reformist federal Cabinet, and also by a willing band group of state leaders who
supported the economic liberalization and efficiency agenda. Between 1983 and 1996, the
Hawke and Keating governments achieved a package of social and economic reforms
including improved service provision, higher government transfer payments, and stream-
lining of the taxation system in an economic or political environment not always condu-
cive to such changes.


2.4.1. Scaling Up Urban Water Pricing
An example of early water reform is the case of urban water pricing. Over the course of a
decade, most urban utilities moved toward a “user pays,” multitiered tariff pricing regime in
place of inefficient charges based on property values. That initiative first emerged in the city
of Perth, Western Australia, in the late 1970s, largely in response to rapidly and continually
declining inflows to local reservoirs from the middle of that decade. In an effort to pursue
demand management, Western Australian water authorities established a two-tiered pricing
system for urban water consumption. That policy direction was extended in New South
Wales in 1982 when Dr. John Paterson, the assertive director of the Hunter District Water
Board, introduced “user pays” pricing in Newcastle and later in the entire Hunter Valley


Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                          11
     when it too was confronted with potentially serious water shortages and simultaneous
     financial pressures (AWA 2012; NWC 2011).
       While water pricing reform is a difficult undertaking, pricing reform initiatives extended to
     Melbourne in the mid-1980s and to Sydney shortly thereafter when it was seen that the
     change could be acceptable to stakeholders and communities. By 1994, there had already
     been substantial urban water pricing reform in most states and territories, a process that was
     well underway before COAG enacted a series of national reform planning agreements in the
     1990s. While much progress in pricing reform was achieved prior to national government
     interventions, the COAG water reform policy framework and the NCP provided an enabling
     environment to a nationwide action of water pricing. This iterative process is also indicative
     of the long time frame involved in such reform agendas: the 15 years involved in working
     price reform through the system was, in effect, a proving ground for the major set of national
     reforms that followed.


     2.5. Second Wave of Reforms
     The Hawke and Keating national governments exhibited a strong need to reform the pro-
     ductivity of all core economy-supporting services under government control: not only
     water but also other utility-related or infrastructure-related services in the energy, commu-
     nications, and transport sectors (e.g., electricity, gas, ports, roads, and telecommunications).
     The agenda, which started with the NCP in the mid-1990s, was focused on productivity
     and economic returns. In the late 1990s, one of the most severe droughts hit modern
     Australia—the Millennium Drought (late 1996 to mid-2010). This triggered a second wave of
     reforms focused on supporting broad environmental goals along with achieving water
     security for urban areas.


     2.6. Summary Lessons
     The urban water sector in Australia leading up to the 1980s was characterized by state-owned
     or local government-managed utilities and entities that were unprofitable, often unreliable
     and underresourced, and acting in isolation. Structural reforms to the urban water sector
     were initiated by state-level governments keen to tackle indebtedness, ineffective water pric-
     ing and service delivery, and environmental impacts. These reforms were then broadened
     and intensified through national economic reforms, introduced by the federal government
     with state consent in the 1990s (see table 2.1). New challenges associated with drought and
     increased demand for better management of water as a finite resource triggered a second
     wave of reforms.

14   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
Chapter 3   Drivers of Reform and Responses

               Australia has a strong recent history of successful water reform, through policy devel-
               opment, implementation and institutional governance. The 1994 Council of Australian
               Governments Water Reform Framework, and the subsequent 2004 National Water
               Initiative, have driven valuable reforms from a national perspective for the past two
               decades. The NWI has delivered on a shared commitment to improve Australia’s water
               management through better security of supply, efficiency, and productivity as well as
               substantial environmental benefits. It has been recognised around the world as a
               leading-edge reform program. (AATSE 2014, 1)


            In Australia, reform of the water supply and sanitation sectors gathered momentum from
            the 1980s with two major waves in the mid-1990s and early 2000s (see table 3.1, further
            details in table B.1). These two waves are described in chapter 2, while this chapter considers
            the drivers of reform along with resulting responses at utility, state, and national levels.
              With increasing demand for water from competing commercial and domestic interests,
            governments across Australia by the early 1990s were aware that, in general, the urban
            water service and supply industry was providing suboptimal contributions to the
            national economy—and to state economies. Moreover, inadequate natural resource man-
            agement practices were causing lasting damage to ecosystems, encouraged by a pervasive
            view that water was an unlimited public resource. Policy makers and others eventually
            realized that inefficient resource use and unsustainable environmental degradation would
            soon result in economic and social costs that future administrators would struggle to
            reconcile. It was widely agreed that change was required on a national scale, and that
            national and state leaders needed to publicly acknowledge the need for more efficient and
            effective management of the increasingly scarce and contested stocks of the country’s
            “most precious natural resource.”


            3.1. Fiscal Pressures
            Initially, though, it was economic pressure resulting from the fiscal realities of recognizably
            inefficient and, arguably, unsustainable models of service delivery and utility operation in
            most jurisdictions that largely drove the early moves toward sectorwide reforms. As summa-
            rized in a National Water Commission analysis of pricing reform (NWC 2011, 10):1


               Before the first national water reform package in 1994, governments were using water
               pricing as an instrument to achieve their prevailing equity, social development and

               political expediency often prevailed over commercial good sense in delivering water
               services. This approach to pricing led to problems in rural and urban areas. The 1992

        reports by the [then Industry Commission and a report for COAG on water resources
        policy, chaired by Sir Eric Neal] identified the following issues:

        •	 Use of water without regard to its cost of supply, leading to excessive consumption
            and the need for costly investments in new supply capacity … [giving] little finan-
            cial incentive for customers to limit their consumption;

         •	 service delivery inefficiencies and lack of incentive to provide reasonable levels of
            service at lowest possible cost … [given] there was no independent regulation of
            prices or service standards in most rural or urban sectors;

         •	 commercial and industrial water users often paying far more than the costs of service
            provision (and cross-subsidising domestic water customers), e.g. in Melbourne in
            1990–91, households were paying the equivalent of $A 0.66 per KL of water while
            suburban shops were paying $A 4.27 per KL and office towers in the CBD were paying
            $A 10.16 per KL. Disparities were even more pronounced in Perth and several other
            cities. Similarly, the cost of Customer Service Obligations (e.g. pensioner rebates) was
            high – approximately $A 30 million per year in Sydney – and these were often not fully
            funded by government, and thus being subsidized by the rest of the customer base.

       These commonly experienced issues and cost pressures provided impetus for a national
     approach to water pricing reforms, which ultimately formed part of the 1994 COAG Water
     Reform Policy Framework. An indication of the high operating costs to governments and
     water utilities of water service provision prior to reforms, and of the marked improvement
     in efficiency in the first decades afterward, is displayed in figure 3.1. It shows a clear decline
     in real operating costs per property for urban water services from the late 1980s to early
     2000s, by which time the next phase of reforms would be designed in response (in many
     cases) to different pressures and drivers.

                                                             Urban water sector reforms certainly did not start (or end) with the 1990s COAG agenda:
                                                           the states, government agencies, and public utilities had been implementing changes for
                                                           some years already (though mostly in isolation, in major centers, and capitals in Victoria,
                                                           New South Wales, and Western Australia). The achievements of state governments in their
                                                           respective jurisdictions sent clear signals that reform was possible and desirable in both the
                                                           short and long term. It became clear that a more concerted and consistent approach to
                                                           engender broad change would be required. Such a shift at the national scale required a
                                                           departure from the ad hoc, public-funded, “build and supply” approach of so many decades
                                                           previously. Rather, a coordinated and nationally agreed reform agenda was required to tran-

                                                           tainable footing, while still yielding social returns to local communities. Table 3.1 highlights

     Water Act in 2007 establishing the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, basically the com-
     monwealth does not have formal authority to legislate on behalf of the states; however, it
     can indirectly oblige the states to act in certain ways regarding water management through
     agreements and financial incentives. The National Competition Policy (NCP) and its associ-
     ated incentive payments (or NCP payments)2 established by the commonwealth in the mid-
     1990s became critical in the process of developing and promulgating a national water reform
     agenda. The Keating government’s review of competition policy, begun in 1992 under the
     direction of Prof. Fred Hilmer, became the policy driver behind the move toward a national
     water reform agenda. The 1994 water reform framework, building on a report produced the
     year before by Sir Eric Neal’s Working Group on Water Resource Policy, took the form of a
     Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreement. In effect, the commonwealth and
     the states agreed on strategic directions and that the commonwealth would provide incen-
     tives for the states’ adoption of water reforms.
       In a deep-dive analysis of the path of urban water reforms in New South Wales, Eric Groom
     outlines the specifics of the National Competition Policy package by stating that


        The key elements of the NCP were


        •	 Commercialization and, where appropriate, regulation of government-owned utili-
           ties and other government-owned businesses;

        •	 Creation of a ‘level playing field’ for government-owned and privately-owned
           business – for example, equal treatment for tax and competition policy;

        •	 Establishment of independent price regulations and price reform;

        •	 Promotion of competition where possible, facilitated by access to essential monop-
           oly facilities (such as ‘pipes and wires’) where necessary; and

        •	 Competition payments to the State Governments conditional on compliance with
           the requirements of the NCP.


        The NCP provided for the creation of the Australian Competition and Consumer
        Commission (ACCC) and the National Competition Council (NCC). Regulatory responsi-
        bilities were split between the ACCC, the national regulator, and State and Territory reg-
        ulators, such as the already established IPART and ESC (Victoria). The ACCC was the
        regulator under national access regimes which governed regulated access to essential
        infrastructure and regulation of the national facilities, such as telecoms and airports
        that were within the Commonwealth’s jurisdiction. Water and electricity (and other ser-
        vices traditionally within the governance of the States) were regulated by State-based
        regulators, but: regulation of terms and conditions for access to essential infrastructure
        (e.g. pipes and wires) for competitive supply of electricity had to be consistent with the
        national access regime; regulation of final prices was to be consistent with the principles
        set out in the NCP. (See Box 3.1 for details on how competition payments worked.)


18   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
      BOX 3.1.   How Competition Payments Work


      The Australian Government provided competition payments to the states and territories
      to reward them for satisfactory progress in implementing their reform commitments.
      The payments were a recognition by COAG that all governments should share in the
      benefits of economic growth and the associated higher taxation revenue resulting from
      the reform program and that, with the high degree of vertical fiscal imbalance, much of
      the increase in tax revenue would initially accrue to the commonwealth. The Australian
      Government allocated funds totalling about $A 5.7 billion for competition payments
      over the period 1997–98 to 2005–06.

      The NCC assessed each state’s progress of reform and made recommendations to the
      Australian treasurer on any penalties that would need to be applied. In assessing the
      nature and size of any penalties that it recommends, the NCC took into account the
      significance of the compliance breach, the extent of the state or territory government’s
      overall commitment to NCP implementation and the effect of that jurisdiction’s reform
      efforts on other jurisdictions. Penalties fell into three categories:

      •	 Permanent deductions, for specific compliance failures

      •	 Specific suspensions, which applied until predetermined conditions were met

      •	 Pool suspensions (which could be recouped), which applied to groups of compliance
        failures in nonpriority areas of the legislation review program, but did not warrant an
        individual penalty




   Overall, the sector reforms and operating and regulatory structures would have been
   less consistent across the states and territories. This is particularly important for sec-
   tors that span states, such as the electricity market and Murray-Darling Basin. A com-
   ponent of NSW competition payments in 2003–04 and 2004–05 were withheld in
   response to the NCC’s assessment that there were shortcomings in the water resource
   sharing plans. In 2005, the NCC assessed that NSW had met the resource planning
   requirements under the National Water Initiative (NWI) and withheld payments were
   released. Although causality cannot be shown, this demonstrates the competition
   payments and compliance assessment scheme apparently working as intended.


  Thus, the fundamental change at the national level that drove good governance in
Australia’s water sector was the 1994 COAG reform agenda. These reforms were linked to
competition policy efficiency principles, and each of the states was required to separate its
operational delivery bodies from its policy and regulatory bodies (a process begun in piece-
meal fashion in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales, in the 1980s). This impetus for change
came at the same time that public entities began to become corporatized (or in some
cases privatized) and were being restructured along the lines of commercial entities with

     appropriate governance arrangements including independent boards, robust strategic plan-
     ning, and reporting arrangements. As with other elements of the 1990s COAG agenda, there
     were precursors to this national move toward requiring agency corporatization. The conser-
     vative Greiner state government in New South Wales in the late 1980s had successfully
     moved several government agencies to a commercial footing ahead of other jurisdictions,
     and its initiatives appear to have informed the nationwide push to do the same in the follow-
     ing decade.


     3.3. Corporatization of Water Utilities
     Around the time of the 1990s COAG reforms, the costs to the urban water industry of asset
     enewal were escalating, so the governments collectively set up a system to benchmark those
     economic costs. They also began considering corporatization of the utilities and establish-
     ing  independent regulators to oversight quasi-monopolies. COAG was instrumental, for
     instance, in accelerating the broadening of the role of the Independent Pricing and Regulatory
     Tribunal (IPART) in New South Wales and the corporatization of Sydney Water. These
     national reforms flowed to many other large utilities such as those in Melbourne, Perth, and
     Brisbane; it occurred to a lesser extent in Adelaide, and in Victoria there was a strong interest
     in privatization of government businesses (other than water). There was a “wave” of corpo-
     ratization, setting up these organizations as if they were privately owned, while remaining
     in government ownership; in other words, making them more commercial and more cus-
     tomer service-focused than they had been in the past, which was congruent with the decline
     in their primary role as infrastructure developers up until the end of the 1980s.
       Once these organizations were corporatized, they started paying regular dividends to state
     governments, and the considerable amounts of money flowing into state coffers prompted a
     much closer interest in the urban water authorities. When a drought phase emerged period-
     ically, this would further prompt state governments to take more interest in their urban
     water authorities. Part of this drive toward reform came from the states, but also from the
     individual water utilities, in which many of the senior leaders were seen to be reform-minded
     (possibly as a result of an increasing number of “managerial-style” utility leaders, as opposed
     to the earlier norm of engineer-technocrats). A number of the reform initiatives came from
     the utilities themselves: urban pricing reform had begun with the Hunter District Water
     Board and Perth’s Metropolitan Water Board, because their CEOs could see more efficient
     ways of managing their businesses. In the case of the Hunter Board, its CEO (from a nonengi-
     neering background) successfully challenged the supply-oriented norm of that organization
     and effectively spread the word as to the effectiveness of microeconomic reform.
       Hence, from the mid-1990s onward there were newly corporatized utilities and emerging
     regulatory offices in most states, although to varying degrees (see map 3.1). The COAG
     reforms attempted to promote and strengthen the notion of independent professional regu-
     lators, not only of water but also of other services (e.g., electricity and gas) and other utilities
     that were still largely in public hands. Increasingly there was performance benchmarking of

                                   these state-owned utilities, many of which were led by activist and competitive CEOs. The
                                   competition driven by comparative benchmarking helped drive the pace of change. While
                                   benchmarking information was not a basis for external rewarding or penalizing of utili-
                                   ties  (or their managers), the annual publication of comparative performance data was an
                                   important indicator—and motivator—of levels of efficient service delivery and successful
                                   management.3 The National Water Commission (NWC), established in the wake of the 2004
                                   National Water Initiative (NWI), oversaw the benchmarking. Since then, benchmarking has
                                   continued to deliver service improvements despite the abolition of the NWC by the Abbott
                                   government in 2014.


                                   3.4. Efficiency Reforms
                                   In the 1990s, the drivers of reform were primarily utility efficiency issues as opposed to
                                   water resource management issues, though there were overlaps. The changes tried to bring
                                   commercial structures and regulatory oversight into an industry in which much of the

     internal operational decision making were responses to political considerations, administra-
     tive fashions, and personalities of leaders. The new efficiency focus was linked to a broader
     agenda known as “microeconomic reform,” based on the need to establish rational regula-
     tory and organizational incentive structures. The water sector seized upon the opportunity
     provided by corporatization (as a legal, institutional, and regulatory framework) to pursue
     improved performance.
       The so-called “corporatization agenda” was a convenient vehicle to overcome a backlog of
     fragmented regulatory layers and lack of organizational coordination that had evolved out
     of  the previous several decades of water sector operations. While corporatization had its
     limitations in terms of improved sectoral and resource management, it gave shape to a
     reform process that required an overarching framework. The previous water supply system,
     with its perceived failings and shortcomings, was primarily designed to avoid supply con-
     straints, but this emphasis had proved to be a weakness. The imperative to merely supply
     one essential commodity, in an unaccountable, “unlimited resource” fashion, meant that
     normal commercial or regulatory frameworks had not been applied.
       The main difficulty facing the water sector during the initial reform agenda was not one
     of resource constraints, supply constraints, or other supply-side concerns. Rather, it was
     more an obvious lack of efficiency (often in utilities’ corporate overheads more than in their
     core functions) and ambiguities about the utilities’ regulatory context. Decision mak-
     ers  recognized that the water utilities needed to provide a “productivity dividend.”
     This  applied in two ways: (a) in straight supply-side efficiencies (applying commercial
     frameworks), and (b) in a more efficient regulatory framework. Corporatized charters and
     frameworks would provide water agencies and authorities with the foundation to better
     understand what they were producing (e.g., levels and types of output) and apply commer-
     cial management structures in which straightforward managerial reforms could lead to
     clear productivity benefits.
       Some managers were careful not to pursue changes at the expense of standards of supply
     or service, at least where those standards were already defined. Principles of service obliga-
     tions needed to be put in place (though not always accomplished quickly in practice), so that
     applying a commercialization agenda was not simply achieved at the expense of the con-
     sumer or the environment. The key was establishing a regulatory structure, though not nec-
     essarily through a separate regulatory authority, in respect of service standards. Efficient
     management could provide greater operational clarity. Utilities developed a rationale or
     framework around which to pursue commercial efficiency reforms, and this perspective was
     largely adopted and embraced by the urban water sector. Some leaders involved in imple-
     menting changes had worked outside the water industry, witnessing those broader reform
     issues in the larger economy. It meant taking many principles that underlay the 1980s micro-
     economic reform initiatives, in areas like reforming industry protection and tariff structures,
     into the water sector. In that sense the reform agenda of the 1990s, while perhaps unfamiliar
     for some managers, was probably not so novel for many others.


22   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
  The final piece of that initial reform phase of the 1990s was to put utilities on more of a
commercial footing through a number of measures that changed their governance model
(see table 3.2), as well as reforming the way they priced their services according to demand.
This latter element involved putting in place independent economic regulations that had not
formerly been an operational feature of public bodies (see chapter 5, table 5.2). Establishing
a regime for economic regulation proved a critical part of this “building block” approach,
attempting to ensure that commercial returns were achieved in those sorts of entities.


3.5. Economic Regulation in the Millennium Drought
In the late 1990s, new drivers for reform emerged and were largely focused on “dollars and
drought.” Managing change is mostly about leadership and timing, and, in general, the
reform initiatives were quite successful when leaders exploited opportunities at the right
time. Prime Minsters Hawke and Keating made their case for economic change in the late
1980s and early 1990s, when recession conditions meant that Australia was in danger of fall-
ing into a productivity crisis and a related economic recession. They used that opportunity
to drive productivity reforms, which became linked to reforms of government business
enterprises. Similarly, a group of state leaders and other key figures pushed hard for strategy
changes in urban water when the Millennium Drought hit its peak in the early 2000s.

       The economic troubles of the late 1980s and the 1992 recession were a major stimulant for
     the COAG reforms of that decade. But even earlier, in 1982, a severe drought across south-
     eastern Australia prompted demand management responses. Some of the “user pays” water
     pricing, such as initiated in the Hunter Valley region or in Western Australia, emerged in part
     as a result of those significant experiences of drought. And the long-term impacts of success-
     ful demand management programs were notable and were recognized in later crises. While
     urban water consumption in the southern capitals had grown by around 2 percent each year
     for nearly a century, from 1982 water consumption plateaued (owing in part to the water
     utilities’ responses) and has remained fairly steady in most major centers, despite rapid
     population growth through later decades (AWA 2012; NWC 2011). This is indicative of the
     power and longevity of effective reform ideas, which emerged in response to pressures and
     challenging conditions.
       In the second wave water reform period, as the nation approached a crisis point in the
     midst of the Millennium Drought, urban water leaders faced an urgent need for reform.
     There was also, however, an uncertainty about which level of government, or which sections
     within government agencies, should be responsible for drought response and, indeed, long-
     term water supply planning. Drought conditions provided the impetus for confirming the
     primary role of state government interventions through a variety of measures, including
     the following:

     •	 Developing new infrastructure enhancement projects

     •	 Exploring alternative water sources

     •	 Introducing demand management programs (from the mid-2000s)


       Interventions were evident in most states but especially in Queensland, which had reacted
     somewhat more slowly than other states to the earlier reform momentum. Drought condi-
     tions, however, drove the government to implement the nation’s strictest regime of water
     use restrictions—and a rapid expansion of ”water security” infrastructure—in the heavily
     populated southeast of that state (Head 2010).



     3.6. From Urban Water Reform to Integrated Resource Management
     In terms of policy and political responses, those recent developments mentioned in the pre-
     vious section are reminiscent of actions taken and priorities established at the beginning of
     the water reform period of the earlier 1980s and 1990s. In the mid-1990s, the NCP formu-
     lated the agenda, which was focused on productivity and economic returns, though in
     respect to water there was a subsequent set of reforms a decade later, in 2004, tailored to
     integrated water resource planning.
       In simple terms, the first period of water reform, 1994 to 2004, was largely about the urban
     water utilities sector. Owing largely to the extended drought from around 2001, the follow-
     ing period focused especially on integrated water resources management at the level of large


24   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
catchments and water basins. Given that the reform of large utilities was largely locked in by
2001, the main focus of the intergovernmental NWI in 2004 was the establishment of the
NWC, which had an important monitoring and evaluation function across the urban and
rural water sectors.
  A specific set of collaborative reforms emerged in 2004 under the guise of the NWI, which
followed the trajectory established by the earlier COAG agreements on reform of govern-
ment business enterprises and the NCP reform program. So while the first reform wave in
the 1990s was clearly about productivity and efficiency, the subsequent water reforms
from 2004 related to integrated water resource management. Some have argued that the
NWI was not a comprehensive water reform agenda (especially in regard to the lesser
attention to the urban water sector), but rather a set of guidelines, principles, and objec-
tives about the more efficient management and overall sustainability of scarce water
resources in rural Australia, primarily across the Murray-Darling Basin. Urban water reform
was seen as a short addition incorporated within the NWI, with a focus on efficient pricing,
demand management, and related matters. As the Millennium Drought continued to inten-
sify after 2004, with major effects in major cities, the need for urban water reform gained
increasing priority.


3.7. Summary Lessons
Australian water utilities have gradually been transformed into demand-responsive commer-
cial entities. The drivers for change spanned economic, social, and environmental factors,
and changed over time. While formal government responses took time, the phased approach
retained a focus on achievable steps. The factors that influenced change, and the rate of
change, can be discerned at different institutional and organizational levels.
  Under the first wave of reforms, restructuring at the utility level followed a three-staged
approach including (a) aggregation (or disaggregation in some cases), (b) separation of
responsibilities, and (c) commercialization. State-level economic regulation proved to be a
“building block” in helping to decouple roles associated with price setting and sustaining
efficiency improvements. Economic regulation also helped to ensure a rational regulatory
approach and lock in organizational incentive structures (both critical to sustainable
improvements).

        National Performance Reports (NPRs), using a nationally consistent framework with benchmarking information supplied
        by each jurisdiction, largely delivered on this outcome. The [National Water] Commission coordinated jurisdictional
        reporting. The urban water utilities NPR [was] produced annually from 2005–06 and represents all utilities with more than
        10,000 connections, providing water to about 18.7 million Australians. Jurisdictions and the urban water industry body,
        the Water Services Association of Australia, identified that the urban NPR is considered to be an example of national and
        international best practice in performance reporting with benefits exceeding costs (NWC 2014a, 47).

26   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
Chapter 4   Reform Framework

            Reform in Australia’s urban water sector has been varied and has occurred at different paces
            in various locations. Previous chapters have explored the timeline of reforms, the drivers,
            and reform responses. Factors that influenced change and reform have included (a) financial
            and legal incentives, (b) technology, (c) business models, and (d) new orientations toward
            achieving good water management and greater water security. This chapter considers how
            those reform measures and approaches translated into actions. Consideration is given for
            the importance of shared direction, the roles of different stakeholders, and institutions for
            enabling effective coordination. The type of incentives and importance of economic regula-
            tion are emphasized.


            4.1. Establishing a Shared Direction
            The Australian example of urban water reform highlights how a set of reform principles was
            used to engage states and territories around a shared focus, but with sufficient flexibility to
            allow different emphases and a variety of institutional arrangements to emerge and persist
            in different jurisdictions (see table B.1). The process for institutional reforms and the types
            of models adopted in different states in Australia highlights the diversity of pathways that
            can be considered within and among different regions when the nationally agreed model
            is based on principles and standards rather than prescriptive solutions. The scope for differ-
                                                                                                 ­ lanning
            ences included the process for (a) decision making around regional versus city-scale p
            models, (b) allowance for vertical integration of service delivery models, and (c) creation of
            regulatory institutions to oversee price setting and performance levels.
              A central goal of the Australian reforms was to transform underperforming utilities into
            demand-responsive commercial entities, increasing the efficiency of service delivery.
            A second factor in building support toward a shared goal was recognition that reforms could
            be achieved only through negotiated outcomes with stakeholders and communities that
            were politically feasible at the time. This had implications for how reforms progressed and
            the pace of reform over time, emphasizing that water reform has been an iterative process:
            when settlement is finally reached on an issue, it becomes another step in the reform ­process,
            with further steps to come.
              Understanding the sequencing of structural and institutional reforms, coupled with tar-
            geted government incentives, is important for understanding how central- and state-level
            decision makers leveraged service delivery improvements. Examples from the Australian
            case underlined the benefits of improved statewide sharing of water resources for more
            responsive regional planning, and how improved modeling could be used to reinforce mes-
            sages about the need for reform. Financial incentives were an important means to bring
            states to the negotiating table, but there were other factors that engaged and motivated
            states through the reform process, such as the leadership role of reform “champions.”
            The twin motivations provided by water scarcity and the need to consider water resource

     planning from a more integrated and systemic perspective also played key roles in how
     reforms unfolded.


     4.2. Role of Champions in Reform
     The success of the mid-1990s COAG reforms in respect of water policy can be linked to the
     strategic work of the COAG Working Group on Water Resource Policy. A leading business-
     man, Sir Eric Neal, was appointed as chair of this working group, and he drew together
     reform-minded leaders in the water sector to produce the COAG Water Reform Policy
     Framework (1994). This group melded the best and most relevant and successful of reforms
     since 1994 from different parts of the country and created a coherent reform strategy.
     The working group, by bringing together influential sectoral leaders, adapted best practices
     from across the country and deepened them by gaining insiders’ perspectives on any
     observed barriers to reform. Under Neal’s leadership the group took the smart approach of
     drawing heavily on existing experience in the water sector, talking often to stakeholders,
     selecting the best reform initiatives from the leading utilities, and molding these into the
     broader COAG reform agenda.


     4.3. Smart Incentives
     The COAG working group recommended financial incentives payable by the federal govern-
     ment (NCP payments) to induce the states to buy in to the agenda and meet commercializa-
     tion targets. This cleverly tied in with the broader reform and productivity agendas being
     promoted by COAG at that time. But the incentives program also reflected the fiscal reality of
     the national government having the lion’s share of finances while the states and territories,
     particularly regarding urban water reform, had the delivery and regulatory responsibilities.
     Using the inducement of financial incentives had a large impact on the state treasuries: as
     one interviewee noted, financial “inducement” was the best approach to ensure that the
     states committed to deadlines and worked toward tightened competition policy settings.
       Over the course of nearly a decade (ending in 2005–06), the commonwealth dispersed
     annually between about $A 400 million and $A 835 million in NCP payments to the states
     and territories.1 Little wonder, perhaps, that National Competition Council assessments of
     competition policy compliance found that the various jurisdictions had largely met their
     commitments to implement policy measures:


        The NCC commented that competition payments (and by extension penalties for
        non-compliance) have been an important contributor to the success of the NCP: “Using
        competition payments to leverage reform outcomes in areas of State and Territory
        responsibility has proven highly effective. … Reform would have been far slower and
        less comprehensive without competition payments. These payments (now at around
        $800 million per year) may not be large relative to State and Territory budgets, but
        nonetheless represent a significant source of incremental funds. (PC 2005, 30)


28   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
  A key learning from this longer reform agenda is that those leading and implementing
reforms must provide adequate time to break down the agenda into feasible steps and then
take people along with them. Reforms cannot be introduced overnight, since several years
may be required from the inception of a strategic reform idea to working through the opera-
tional details and moving to implementation. This is followed by monitoring and evaluating
the effectiveness of the plans have been and determining what the next set of steps might
be. This sequence is underlined by the fact that Australia has had roughly 10-year change
cycles in the water sector, and other sectors such as energy, in the recent past.


4.4. Coordinating Institutions
The NWC played a very important role in the 10 years it was in place, ranging from agenda
setting (in a strategic direction sense), to capacity building (through technical commentary),
to independent monitoring of reform progress. While other agencies, arguably, can now take
over the role of auditing and encouraging progress of these same issues, the NWC provided
an important forum and vehicle through which to focus on and coordinate water reform.
Much of the political and bureaucratic focus of the decade after 2004 was on “fixing” the
water planning framework for the vast Murray-Darling Basin in South East Australia, which
had been marked by cross-jurisdictional conflict and avoidance of decisions on achieving
sustainable water allocations. The federal Water Act 2007 established the Murray-Darling
Basin Authority, which required a transfer of legislative powers and water management
rights from the states to the commonwealth to achieve the legal authority for integrated
planning (Skinner and Langford 2013).
  The role of professional bodies has also been important in Australia. In the last two decades
the Water Services Association of Australia (WSAA)—essentially the water supply industry
association—has played an important role within the urban water sector for information
exchange and lobbying on areas of common ground, and providing a welcome forum for
discussing regulatory and pricing reform. While not principally a shaper of the reform
agenda, the WSAA has benefited its member bodies through interagency comparative mea-
surement and in more fine-grained benchmarking processes. The capacity of the urban
water sector had been pushed in this direction by the oversight and audit functions of the
NWC. Following the demise of the commission, its absence from the national level of reform
planning was lamented by senior industry figures and sectoral stakeholders who had wit-
nessed the advantages of having a distinct and dedicated monitoring and benchmarking
body for the water sector—The commission had possessed the scale and standing to dedicate
considerable resources to strategy and policy thinking, which are otherwise difficult to find.


4.5. Role of Water Utility Leaders
Another key aspect to reform success is that it requires more than restructuring of institu-
tions: it also requires skilled people within or working across them. Most business models
have the potential to work effectively, or at least to be reformed into more effective


Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                         29
     operations, if the right people are in the key roles. Businesses or agencies might have a strong
     balance sheet or sound governance structures, but they also need knowledgeable people in
     key positions. This applies both to key staff members’ technical knowledge and—perhaps
     more important—their understanding of relationships and how to work with stakeholders in
     government, in other sectors, and in their communities. In other words, successfully reform-
     ing institutions is enhanced by having key position holders who understand how to interact
     with the political and the public levels, as well as the paying customers, and know how to
     treat them as stakeholders.
       To have a successful reform agenda, it is important to have key figures, often from inside
     government, with the vision and the skills to communicate the need for change, although
     often not enough thought is given to the roles that each government level should play.
     In Australia, the roles of government were handled well in the NCP reform, in terms of what
     each level did to help meet competition policy targets. The states were then allowed to
     determine how they implemented the NCP reforms, and they in turn gave flexibility to the
     individual agencies about how they went about those tasks. Decision making needs to be
     done at the right level, and all the necessary levels need to be involved and engaged
     appropriately.


     4.6. Economic Regulation
     In the field of urban water, many stakeholders consider that the most successful process for
     enabling reform and embedding the benefits of reform is introducing or strengthening inde-
     pendent economic regulation. Whereas rural water required a combination of catchment
     planning and economic regulation, the urban water sector has responded well to indepen-
     dent economic regulation. Some regard it as the most powerful of all the reforms imple-
     mented over the last few decades—more long-lasting and better understood than
     corporatization. According to such supporters, if the economic regulation settings are sound,
     then business or agency management can properly be separated from government direction,
     which is seen as another positive aspect of such structural rearrangement.
       For some, it is questionable whether Australia would have managed its way through the
     Millennium Drought if all the major utilities had not been reformed and their planning
     capacities and flexibility had not been enhanced. In terms of readiness for climatic and envi-
     ronmental challenges, all levels and forms of government—including water utilities—must
     work together and understand their specialized roles. One of the benefits of the NCP reforms
     was a separation between the policy role (held by government departments) and the deliv-
     ery role (held by utilities) and oversight role (held by independent economic regulator).
       The “business efficiency” reform drivers were to some extent imposed on the urban water
     sector by the demands of state treasuries for greater efficiencies and cost-recovery within
     the corporatized utilities. Some of the traditional water utilities had become bureaucratic
     and inflexible with many layers and entrenched cliques of professional groups performing
     various roles. Many had to be dragged into a different operating environment in which


30   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
efficiency was important and investment funds had to be used as effectively as possible.
But the urban water industry, according to some insiders, is now very much driven by the
new approaches to efficiency and responsiveness. If one or two of the big utilities undertake
successful innovations, most others tend to follow.
  Hence, waves of change can be viewed as moving through all the water businesses, except
perhaps for the small local authority entities that lack the resources, skills, and political impe-
tus to pursue innovation. By contrast, the big water businesses in the capital cities tend to
innovate collectively on the basis of learning and emulation. So whether the issue is cutting
losses from water leakage or extending water recycling operations, or developing new tariff
charges, initiatives can quickly evolve into a widely shared approach across the country. This
suggests that professional confidence can lead toward a more collaborative culture.


4.7. Procurement Practices
In the urban water context in Australia, various forms of public-private partnership—or, more
often, forms of outsourcing (procurement contracting)—provided options for engagement of
the private sector and demonstrated opportunities for piloting innovation. One challenge in
outsourcing to the private sector is how to develop and progress contracts that effectively
incentivize operator performance and optimize capital expenditures, but also build in effec-
tive procedures to address cases of poor contract performance (Jefferies and McGeorge 2009;
World Bank 2014). The Australian urban water sector, like other service delivery sectors, has
occasionally utilized procurement models involving contracts with international companies
to provide specific technological expertise, but in most cases the state governments have
retained public ownership and operation of corporatized utilities. There is a widely held per-
ception that Australia has established pioneering governance structures and public-private
collaborative models that embody the best of both sectors. Many utilities in Australia operate
according to models that encourage water utilities and service agencies to work together in
partnership to solve water supply-related problems (Rouse 2013).
  In the early 1990s many of the urban water businesses let out major contracts to the pri-
vate sector through processes which, according to some accounts, made it difficult for locally
owned businesses to make successful bids for the work. Water treatment plants constructed
and operated by the private sector (e.g., build–own–operate–transfer [BOOT]) emerged in
many parts of the country. The large private water companies that were invited to place bids,
often European and multinational, were seen locally as disregarding the likelihood that local
water businesses had the expertise, experience, and resources to be competent partners.
That apparently caused a great deal of resentment among local private firms for being
excluded from contract tendering, when it could have been an opportunity for local compa-
nies to improve and undertake projects for less cost or to grow their capabilities.
  The initial concerns about international participants held by sections of the local water
industry gradually dissipated, and while in practice the companies that secured the con-
tracts were French, European, or American, the bulk of the staff were locally employed.


Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                             31
     So although some profits would necessarily have been repatriated overseas, the bulk of sal-
     aries still went to local Australian staff. Eventually, the industry moved to ensure that, when
     new projects were contracted out, deals stipulated that a certain percentage of local staff
     would be employed in the new business venture. As in all businesses, the culture of busi-
     nesses in the urban water industry has changed over this time. Longstanding engineer-
     ing-based businesses have gradually morphed into more broad-based, “professionalized,”
     and economically efficient businesses that have a different—arguably more effective—way of
     evaluating projects and adopting reforms.


     4.8. Summary Lessons
     This chapter has described how reform measures and approaches were translated into
     actions. These measures collectively describe the framework in which reform in Australia
     progressed. A wide range of determinants over time contributed to improved perfor-
     mance and outcomes, including financial and legal incentives, political will, leadership,
     skill levels, technology, cost recovery models, and paradigm shifts in business operations
     through an increased customer focus. Collectively, these elements underline the signifi-
     cance of key stakeholders and organizations and their roles at vital stages of the reform
     process.
       Figure 4.1 captures the drivers and determinants for reforms, along with flagging key fac-
     tors that enable leadership through the reform process and adaptability for implementation
     at state levels.

32   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
•	 The role of leadership from individuals and organization has been observed for steering
   reforms over time. Utility managers and service agency leaders played strategic roles in
   disseminating initiatives through sector levels, helping certain reform measures play out
   successfully over the last three decades among water sector bodies, utilities, and
   communities.

•	 The COAG-defined institutional reforms increased the efficiency and cost return of urban
   water utilities, and the way those reforms were worked through the different state water
   sectors helped to increase the generalist skills and “water knowledge” of utility
   management.

•	 Reforms were encouraged by and reinforced increased consumer engagement and public
   “water awareness.”

•	 Organizational response to reform was driven by utilities’ efforts to be efficient and pru-
   dent; follow policy requirements; and enhance customer understanding and willingness
   to pay the full cost of services.

  While each of the preceding factors is important, enabling factors, such as the urban water
sector economic regulation, drive many disciplines and other processes. In fact, some regard
it as the most powerful of all the reforms of the last few decades: more long-lasting and bet-
ter understood than corporatization. Another enabling factor is the receptiveness of the sec-
tor and public at large. Reforms could be achieved only through negotiated outcomes with
stakeholders and communities that were politically feasible. The level of receptiveness to
such consultation has had implications for how reforms progressed and the pace of reform
over time, emphasizing that water reform is an iterative process in which some states could
move faster than others, depend on readiness of stakeholders.


Note
	 1.	“The Australian Government has provided financial incentives to states and territories in order to facilitate national
   reforms. Such payments were widely seen as successful in garnering support for the National Competition Policy (NCP)
   reforms beginning in the mid-1990s. The logic behind the NCP-related payments was that the reforms would have a signif-
   icant pay-off in terms of gross domestic product, leading to additional tax revenue which, because of vertical fiscal imbal-
   ance, would flow disproportionately to the Australian Government. The pool of available funding was developed with
   reference to modelling by the Industry Commission, while the National Competition Council made recommendations on
   competition payments. The NCP-related payments therefore provided both a mechanism for sharing the benefits of
   reform, and an accountability mechanism, with states and territories ‘penalised’ where reform commitments were not
   satisfactorily implemented”(PC 2011, 496).

34   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
Chapter 5   Differentiating Experience of Reforms

            Documentation of Australia’s reform history includes differentiation across the states,
            allowing for varying approaches to reform. In other words, nationally agreed policy
            directions evolved in different settings and with unique challenges among states and territo-
            ries. This analysis of a national case study of Australia’s innovative and wide-ranging reform
            process recognizes the roles of central, state, and local governments in urban water supply
            and sanitation services. The range of reforms and how they occurred at different levels and
            in different locations are summarized in figure 5.1. The analysis of urban water reforms initi-
            ated by national agreements in Australia must therefore account for variable implementa-
            tion by state and local authorities in their respective jurisdictions. It also shows variations
            between the receptiveness to reform of the distinct jurisdictions and variations in approaches
            and the pace of reform at different points in time.
              To reiterate the governance framework in a federation, Australia is a commonwealth, or
            federal union, of six states and two territories, each subnational level having responsibilities
            for water supply in their respective jurisdictions. The governments of the states and territo-
            ries are responsible for water service provision through publicly owned utilities and agen-
            cies (or through a single integrated entity in the case of Western Australia, South Australia,
            and the Northern Territory). Utilities owned by local governments provide water services in
            regional parts of Queensland and in Tasmania. In Victoria, New South Wales, and South East
            Queensland, state-owned utilities provide bulk water that is distributed to consumers by
            corporatized utilities owned either by local or state governments (see table 5.2). Each state
            and territory has a minister responsible for water matters, as is the case at the federal level.
            As of 2015, the federal Department of Agriculture and Water Resources is responsible for
            water policies.
              Water sector reforms over the last few decades were implemented according to conditions
            and circumstances in the different states and regions, not in a “one size fits all” approach.
            Some flexibility was allowed within national agreements for local experts to determine the
            best means and pace of achieving reform targets. The national water reforms in the mid-
            1990s had less impact on similar changes underway or already achieved in major urban util-
            ities (especially the case in New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia), but the
            national agreement prompted larger changes in the “slower” states and in regional-based
            utilities. There were limits to this autonomy, however, in terms of timelines for change
            and for certain efficiency steps, such as the need for modern water metering (which affected
            Brisbane and South East Queensland in the early 1990s).


            5.1. Amalgamation of Regional Water Utilities
            One of the first major sectoral restructuring in the first wave of reforms involved the
            ­
            amalgamation of many smaller water utilities. In states such as Victoria these reforms pre-
            ceded the national level reforms. Other states, such as Western Australia and South Australia,

                                             with  their monolithic single utilities, chose not to follow the Victorian model. Tasmania
                                             underwent an amalgamation process that reduced its number of small authorities. New South
                                             Wales and Queensland still have many smaller utilities operated by local governments, while
                                             the large utilities around Sydney and South East Queensland were corporatized and regu-
                                             lated independently. With regard to water supply services, as with other council-dominated
                                             services, local governments can be a powerful force (and either a barrier or facilitator of
                                             change). This is the case, for example, in Brisbane, South East Queensland, where the city
                                             council is the largest local authority in the nation. It was able to protect its territory more
                                             than other councils; but when reform eventually came, it came rapidly and professionally.

5.2. Restructuring Approaches in Victoria and Queensland
Reforms have often been driven by the need to respond to unexpected or critical condi-
tions. In Victoria at the beginning of the 1990s, the state’s economy was in very poor shape
and reeling from recession. The newly elected premier, Jeff Kennett, instigated a rapid
rationalization program that included privatizing a long list of state assets and utilities.
Water was left to last because of a controversy at the time about the effectiveness of privat-
ization of water in England under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Eventually, while
Melbourne’s water utilities were being corporatized, they avoided privatization owing to
the realization that water is a natural monopoly and a difficult sector into which to intro-
duce competition.
  In comparison, reforms moved slowly in Brisbane. Despite perceptions of a “recalcitrant
attitude” to external reform agendas, there was a good depth of water sector expertise (tech-
nical and organizational) in Brisbane in the 1980s and early 1990s; however, the region
lacked political will or committed leadership to move the sector forward. In the mid-1990s,
nationally agreed upon reforms helped stir interest in improving the sector’s performance in
Queensland, and later, the Millennium Drought and greater water scarcity prompted politi-
cal action at state and local levels.
  Similarly, in the late 1990s, Queensland’s state-wide bulk water infrastructure utility,
Sunwater, was also corporatized and removed from the government department for dam
operations and scheme operations, and separated from the policy function in another gov-
ernment department. The most important reform to the water sector in South East
Queensland was the formation of the Seqwater Board as a joint local/state authority in the
1990s and its restructuring in 2006 as a state-owned corporation. The Millennium Drought
led to significant further restructuring of water sector governance in South East Queensland
(Head 2010).1
  During the reform period of the 1990s, the states were able to do some things relatively
easily, but other tasks were much more difficult, and the reasons for difficulty varied.
The collective learning about which reform areas were most challenging or intractable was
translated into the 2004 Council of Australian Government (COAG) agreement and the
National Water Initiative (NWI), and the journey progressed.


5.3. Pricing Reform and Productivity
Prior to reforms, urban water was primarily delivered by local governments throughout
Australia. The strong role of local government meant that there was a close link between the
cost of local government services (funded by general rates) and the cost of the water supply
services. There was a lack of clarity about the distinction between general rates and water

     charges, about the composition of those water charges, and about incentives to reduce the
     cost of providing water to customers in urban areas. Some regions often had a political focus
     on minimizing costs of local services rather than producing a sustainable risk profile in terms
     of urban water security.
       The financial pressures arising from forecasted increases in water demand, the need for
     further investment in water storage and water security, and the need for accompanying pric-
     ing reforms were not well appreciated in Queensland. Nonetheless, the Brisbane City Council
     restarted a water metering program and transitioned to fully funding asset depreciation,
     which were important reform steps. But the opportunities for pricing reform to have an
     impact on future demand were probably much greater in New South Wales and Victoria,
     because their rates of population growth were lower than that experienced in South East
     Queensland. Pricing reform was very effective in Newcastle (in New South Wales) where the
     Hunter Water Corporation (HWC) board’s pricing reform had a huge effect on its demand and
     future demand forecasts.
       During the NCP reforms in the 1990s, Queensland’s state government decided that
     because water delivery was largely the responsibility of local government, the state should
     pass on the competition policy incentive payments to large local governments that oper-
     ated major water schemes. The NCP also required the removal of cross-subsidies between
     customer groups, and the establishment of pricing reform initiatives and water reform poli-
     cies. Such changes came at a political cost to local government, but the incentives-based
     nature of the competition payments meant that Brisbane City Council would receive its pay-
     ment only if it implemented all the elements of the competition policy.
       Following the introduction of water metering in the 1990s, there was a very significant
     change in consumption over the ensuing period, since consumers began to be charged for
     their volumetric use of water. One of the key changes after 2006 was the introduction of
     standardized requirements for local governments to introduce more urban water security
     planning.
       While COAG provided the initial national reform framework for adaption to different
     regional settings, the reforms of the later reform period were still primarily about productiv-
     ity and cost-efficiency. The main objective was to improve productivity, but this was
     extended after the Millennium Drought to a concern for water security and effective man-
     agement of climate variability.


     5.4. Aggregation or Disaggregation
     Corporate efficiencies were approached in several ways, some involving aggregation and
     others involving devolved approaches (see table 5.1). In some cases, such as Perth and
     Adelaide, the size of the entity remained untouched.
       While Western Australia’s Water Corporation took responsibility for its own efficiency
     reforms, and retains a large independent operating budget separate from the state’s
     Department of Water, it was still subject to the disciplines of external audit, regulatory, and

compliance authorities within other branches of the state government. Owing to its scale,
though, the Water Corporation largely avoided political interference in its approach to
implementing national reform initiatives. Western Australia was similarly well placed to
respond to the NWI agenda of improving water resource management and sustainability,
given the state’s familiarity over recent decades with drought conditions, declining rainfall
and inflows, and increasing demand (and persistently high consumption levels) for water.
Water agencies’ policy responses in Western Australia to these climatic and environmental
challenges were fairly typical of the rest of the country, consisting initially of dam construc-
tion, but more recently desalination technology, together with successful demand manage-
ment strategies. The latter were achieved partly through effective consumer engagement
campaigns, another measure with which the Water Corporation had long experience dating
back to the pricing reforms of the 1980s.
  With responsibility for water supply services for most of Western Australia, the Water
Corporation (a “great big monopoly” in the words of its former CEO) had for a long time been
well placed (in terms of scale) to handle water sector challenges and take a long-term view to
water planning and reform. In the 1990s, when the COAG reform agenda appeared, the Water

     Corporation had already implemented urban reform initiatives over several years (such as
     pricing reform and universal metering), but saw the advantage in improving general effi-
     ciencies in line with the national agenda. Having a close relationship with the Western
     Australian state government, but still large enough in size, scope, and skill to act inde-
     pendently, the utility adapted to the public sector push to streamline and modernize agency
     operations and structures.2 But other states, such as New South Wales, Victoria, and espe-
     cially Queensland, had a strong focus on aggregation.
        The other major reform agenda during the 2000s was separating delivery roles from
     policy and regulation. Previously, large utilities such as Melbourne Water were setting a lot
     ­
     of policy: they were self-regulating and delivering supply. Thus, a big driver of the reforms
     tagged to the NWI agenda was to separate out those operational functions from policy and
     regulation. Table 5.2 highlights the decoupled roles of economic regulators after reforms.
        In the 1990s, the Victorian government introduced comparative competition in which
     Melbourne had a wholesaler, Melbourne Water, and three retail water companies. But in the
     following decades, Melbourne’s water sector was transformed because of the discipline
     imposed by the regulatory regime called the Essential Services Commission (ESC), estab-
     lished in 2002. Henceforth, Melbourne Water had to state publicly, through routine report-
     ing, its intentions and call for submissions from stakeholders concerning those matters.

40   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
In that decade regulators in all states adopted broadly similar reporting requirements for
the agencies and corporatized entities of state governments.
  Victoria’s government (like others) set obligations for utilities in terms of levels of service
and asset maintenance, and utilities had to be publicly accountable for efficient investment
in system maintenance. That was a significant change from earlier ad hoc financial pro-
cesses, so that by the time of the Millennium Drought, states were accustomed to discussing
the need for big solutions. Because leaders had decision-making experience in times of
seeming crisis—and with coordinated planning and response—they were better prepared to
respond when faced with the next crisis or reform imperative.
  In his deep-dive analysis of the path of urban water reforms in New South Wales, Eric Groom
outlines key factors behind models of urban water service delivery in different jurisdictions:


   Each different model [of water business] can be made to work in practice. The Sydney
   Water Corporation (SWC) model needs strong contracts and monitoring of water qual-
   ity to maintain alignment of accountabilities and responsibilities. This has been
   achieved through the strengthening of the licencing arrangements. However, the dif-
   ferent sizes and structures of the metropolitan water agencies regulated by IPART limit
   the value of cross-sectional peer benchmarking. Nevertheless, in past reviews IPART
   has used comparison of trends in costs over time. For its review of the performance of
   the NSW State-Owned Corporations, IPART estimated the trends in productivity of
   time and undertook comparative analysis of these trends for SWC and Hunter Water
   Corporation (HWC), and individually compared the performance of each for various
   cost and service KPIs against their peers in other states. Whilst the NSW model does
   not prohibit benchmarking, one of the strengths of the Victorian model is that it facili-
   tates comparison by competition. According to the National Water Commission (NWC):


   In 2007, the Victorian ESC noted that comparative competition had worked to improve
   performance and in particular to “encourage management teams to innovate to improve
   service delivery relative to other businesses.” Anecdotal evidence (sourced from personal
   correspondence) suggests that the managers of the Melbourne water retailers pay signifi-
   cant attention to their relative performance. The performance data also appears to sup-
   port this contention. In the years following the disaggregation, the performance of
   Melbourne retailers improved significantly on many measurable customer performance
   metrics, including customer complaints, water quality compliance and the speed with
   which unplanned interruptions and sewer spills were rectified.


   The public performance reporting under the Essential Services Commission (ESC)
   focuses on various dimensions of service outputs and quality, rather than measures of
   cost and efficiency. This limits its value in price-setting and in its determinations of
   prices for the three Melbourne water suppliers as the ESC has not used formal compar-
   ative benchmarking. However, ESC is undertaking a review of its approach to

        regulating water prices, and Frontier Economics has recommended that it increase its
        use of benchmarking. In Queensland, the reversals made to previous reform decisions
        reflect the unrest within the industry about the initial reforms, which relied on mini-
        mal consultation with the local government and the community. Hence, it is difficult
        to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the model because the model only
        operated for a short period and the subsequent changes may have reflected deficien-
        cies in the reform process rather than in the model itself.



     5.5. Summary Lessons
     •	 Comprehensive reforms in term of scale (across states) and scope (from restructuring,
        efficiency, and sustainability) could be absorbed effectively only in jurisdictions that were
        ­
        receptive to changes in service operations.

     •	 Government policies and sector-negotiated agreements with state water stakeholders
        and urban communities needed to be politically feasible—or at the least “marketable”—
        and designed to deliver substantial changes in water management arrangements and
        structures.

     •	 Incentives were required to bring on laggard states and regions.

     •	 Given these opportunities and limitations in how changes could be implemented in the
        Australian context, reform agendas needed to be established through collaborative settle-
        ments among senior sector figures and state leaders in the different jurisdictions.



     Notes
     	 1.	See chapter 8.6 for additional structural differences between Melbourne’s and Brisbane’s sectors.

     	 2.	The Water Company’s relationship with the state was another feature that makes it (and the state more generally) some-
        thing of an outlier compared to others in terms of water governance reforms.

42   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
Chapter 6   Key Messages from National-Level Reforms

               Australia has been implementing a program of reform to change the way water is used
               and managed across the country for over thirty years. Australian water reform has
               been an evolving journey, striving to create a water sector that is economically and
               environmentally sustainable, that provides a secure basis for future investment, and
               that yields high returns to the community. … While Australia’s water reform journey is
               far from finished, our experience may provide valuable ideas for other countries as
               they tackle their own water management challenges. (Doolan 2016, 5)


            The type of recent reforms seen in Australia fundamentally changed how water sector poli-
            cies were designed and implemented (OECD 2012). It is important to gauge whether there is
            a consistent appetite for such significant reform, or whether reform is more likely to follow
            an incremental process of refinement over a longer period. However, it is equally important
            to identify differences between the Australian case and other contexts. For example, two
            contextual factors that greatly assisted in the reforms in the Australian water sector were the
            establishment of COAG in the early 1990s, and the relatively small number of states and ter-
            ritories that needed to consent to national strategic agreements. The role of COAG was criti-
            cal for bringing all states on-board for reform in Australia. The style of federalism in Australia
            is sometimes described as “executive federalism,” and is facilitated by negotiations and
            coordinated agreements between the leaders of a relatively small number of jurisdictions.
              This historically focused account of Australian urban water reform will help policy makers
            understand (a) the evolution of contemporary water institutions, (b) their role in shaping
            reform initiatives, and (c) lessons that can be applied to water-related development else-
            where. This report has considered and explained changes in recent decades in different loca-
            tions and levels of urban water sector governance to better understand the following:

            •	 The genesis of reforms and drivers that triggered them

            •	 How and when structural shifts occurred, and the extent that federal and state interven-
              tions (policies or state agreements) and market factors influenced shifts

            •	 The range and role of efficiency measures from governance perspectives (e.g., adoption of
              corporate governance practices, benchmarking, and tariff structures)

            •	 Changes in skills and capacities required by leaders and administrators across the sector
              (typically “managerial” more than technical skills, seemingly a product of commercializa-
              tion and corporatization processes)

            •	 The relevance of different interventions at separate stages in the longer nationwide
              reform process.

              Reform in the urban water sector is an iterative process that comprises progressive steps.
            This process has implications for how water reform can be pursued and can be expected to
            unfold. The process requires a journey of continuous improvement at each of those steps,

     so  that reforms are seen to achieve and build on successes and be reexamined over the
     course of time. This characteristic underlines the importance of the principles underpinning
     the reform process, especially transparency, effectiveness, and engagement, and the need
     for wide acceptance and “buy-in.” Hence, water reform is a long-term undertaking in which
     changes need time to take hold and win support. Leaders need to address and resolve issues
     while working at a pace that can be managed transparently by governments and sustained
     by communities. At each step along the journey:

     •	 Work is built on what has already proved effective.

     •	 The prevailing political context provides opportunities.

     •	 Implementation issues are identified and solutions are framed.

     •	 Stakeholder and community agreement are required and negotiated.

     •	 As community members see benefits of change, the drivers for the next phase of water
       reform are set in place.

       This reform process underscores that there are new challenges emerging (or reemerging)
     in Australia’s urban water sector. An understanding of these—and past—challenges can
     promote an understanding of the breadth of issues relevant to water reform in different
     contexts.
       The World Bank operates in countries with quite different enabling environments and eco-
     nomic contexts than in Australia. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) often face the
     following types of challenges in the water sector:

     •	 Insufficient financial resources to make the investments required to increase access and
       improve service delivery

     •	 Lack of incentives on the part of service providers to improve service quality and
       efficiency

     •	 Inequity in coverage between rural and urban areas

     •	 Challenges with ability or willingness to pay (at least once connected to a network)

     •	 Inability to sustain service level improvements

     •	 In many cases, very constrained water resources, or damaging floods at the other extreme

       Contextual factors that were important in Australia may or may not exist in Bank client
     countries. Nevertheless, being cognizant that there are really no “best practices” (and the
     World Bank World Development Report 2017 encourages development practitioners to
     move away from this notion), and noting that each enabling environment is different, policy
     makers can learn lessons from the reform process in Australia’s water sector. In particular,
     countries organized in the federal–state model can learn from the reform process in Australia,
     which has involved mechanisms and practices enhancing commitment, coordination, and
     cooperation from both the federal and state levels. Further, Australia’s sector is dominated

by corporatized state-owned enterprises; therefore, there are good lessons for LMICs that
rely heavily on publicly owned utilities, including on how to incentivize, regulate, and mon-
itor them. The common process steps observed from the Australian experience are distilled
in this report, and may help inform development practitioners seeking to take a similar
reform journey toward greater efficiency and effectiveness in the urban water sector.

Chapter 7   Summary and Structure
            7.1. The Urban Water Reform Story in New South Wales and Australia
            Part II traces the reform of the urban water sector in New South Wales since the mid-1980s
            in the context of the broader national microeconomic reform agenda in Australia. It is a com-
            plex story illustrating how multiple factors drive reform and affect its progress. The evolu-
            tion of the sector reflects changing priorities and specific political-social factors, and can be
            divided into the following periods:

            •	 Pre-1980s. Water was viewed as a “social service” with poor financial performance, ineffi-
              cient pricing with extensive subsidies, and a tax component

            •	 1980s. Initial reform steps in the water sector were led by the Hunter Water Corporation
              (HWC),1 supported by the initial steps toward commercialization and corporatization

            •	 1990s. The New South Wales government continued its commercialization and price
              reform within a bipartisan national agenda on microeconomic reform to improve
              productivity

            •	 Late 1990s. Focus was on improved financial performance and service standards
              framework

            •	 Mid-2000s. A prolonged drought necessitated an improved security of supply, while the
              reform of the sector entered the next stage: promotion of competition

              The urban water sector was transformed from a heavily subsidized and engineering-­
            focused industry subject to strong political intervention and control, into a competitive and
            financially secure industry, under the management of skilled boards providing services
            focused on customer needs at prices that allow it to recover its costs and achieve a commer-
            cial return on investment (ROI). The complexity comes from the interplay between the
            following:

            •	 Institutions, policies, and regulations that create the environment within which manag-
              ers and organizations operate

            •	 Decisions of managers, policy makers, ministers, and regulators given the framework

            •	 Specific events and challenges (e.g., financial constraints, improving service quality) or
              specific crises (e.g., water shortages or water quality alerts) that influence the develop-
              ment of the institutions, policies, and regulations, and the decisions made within this
              framework

              In practice, reform needs a driver. The early reforms in the 1980s were driven by individu-
            als dedicated to pursuing organizational and economic efficiency despite policies, regula-
            tions, and institutions that provided weak incentives for such goals. The success of these
            individual-driven reforms supported subsequent policy and institutional reforms initiated

     at the state level, which were primarily driven by external events (i.e., perceived financial
     crises) and reform-focused governments. The national reform agenda, and accompanying
     changes to the institutions, policies, and regulations, is best understood in the context of a
     national concern about poor productivity growth and the performance of the national econ-
     omy as a reform driver.
       A focus on national policy frameworks rather than the history of the implementation of
     reforms may create a perception that the Council of Australian Government (COAG) Water
     Reform Framework and the National Competition Policy (NCP) (National Competition
     Policy Review 1993, known as Hilmer Report) led the way. In fact, important aspects of the
     national agenda followed earlier reforms in some states and utilities (e.g., HWC), while
     other aspects preceded reforms in some states and utilities. Indeed, in many respects
     New  South Wales was an early reformer, moving in advance of the agreement on the
     national reform agenda. For example, New South Wales established the Independent Pricing
     and Regulatory Tribunal2 (IPART), an independent pricing regulator, in 1992, prior to the
     agreement on the national reform agenda. These early reforms, in turn, may have facilitated
     the national reform process.
       In summary, the national reform agenda had a very important role in the urban
     water reforms. However, the influences went both ways: from the interplay between util-
     ities and states to the national reform agenda, and from the national agenda to the inter-
     play between utilities and states, with the importance of each varying across states
     and  over time. The other important factor in successful reform is a crisis or sense of
     urgency to mobilize efforts and overcome vested interests, such as the role of the drought
     in promoting alternative water sources and servicing solutions and sharpening focus on
     price signals.


     7.2. Relevance for Other Jurisdictions
     The challenges facing the reform of the urban water sector in New South Wales were differ-
     ent from those facing urban water sectors in many other jurisdictions, especially in low- and
     middle-income countries (LMICs). New South Wales already had almost universal access to
     improved water and sanitation services, and even in the early 1980s the utilities at least cov-
     ered their operating costs. The priorities were price reform, improved efficiency, and the
     achievement of commercial rates of return. However, there are aspects of the reform process
     that are relevant to a broader range of jurisdictions:

     •	 Importance of specific events and individuals in the reform process

     •	 Role of national government in a federal system to reinforce and promote reform through
       the use of its coordinating powers and fiscal rewards and sanctions

     •	 Importance of separating and clearly delineating service delivery, policy, and regula-
       tory functions, and establishing appropriate institutional arrangements. Crucial to this is
       enhanced transparency of objectives and instruments. New South Wales ­

                                                                                                            these key elements:

                                           •	 Commercialization and, where appropriate, regulation of government-owned utilities
                                              and other government-owned businesses

                                           •	 Creation of a level playing field for government-owned and privately owned business
                                              (e.g., equal treatment for tax and competition policy)

                                           •	 Establishment of independent price regulation and price reform



52                                         Australian Urban Water Reform Story
•	 Promotion of competition where possible, facilitated by access to essential monopoly
  facilities (e.g., pipes and wires) where necessary

•	 Competition payments to the state governments, conditional on compliance with the
  requirements of the NCP

  Competition payments were an important part of ensuring the effective implementation
of NCP on a national basis. These are payments by the commonwealth to states and territo-
ries that make satisfactory progress with the implementation of the NCP and the related
reforms in electricity, gas, water, and road transport. The progress in implementing the
reforms is assessed by the National Competition Council. Within the NCP, water-specific
obligations and guidelines were established that covered, for example:

•	 Reform of the sector and its commercialization

•	 Asset valuation, commercial targets for revenue, and regulation of water tariffs

•	 Resource planning and water sharing rules

•	 Quality standards for water and wastewater discharges

  Within New South Wales, the framework for setting and monitoring compliance with
health and environmental standards has become more robust. Licenses have been used to
(a) bring together and strengthen the requirements for, and monitoring of, compliance
with the health and environmental standards; (b) specify requirements for stronger
asset management planning; (c) set customer service standards such as supply continuity,
water supply pressures, and overflows; and (d) specify other policy requirements regard-
ing connection of unconnected customers, water efficiency targets, and greenhouse gas
emissions
  IPART was given responsibility for monitoring compliance with the licenses in 20003 and
has established a risk-based approach to monitoring and auditing compliance. Tension has
emerged at times as to (a) whether environmental standards are moving ahead of the com-
munity’s willingness to pay for these higher standards, (b) whether environmental goals are
being achieved through the most efficient means (e.g., are higher standards on discharges by
the major water utilities being used when there are more cost-effective options to improve
water quality in the receiving waterways).


7.4.2. Commercialization and Corporatization
The New South Wales government began developing a more commercial policy framework
for its businesses in the mid 1980s. Commercialization and corporatization was underpinned
by five key principles for government-owned businesses:

•	 Clear objectives. Providing management of government businesses with clear commercial
  objectives (i.e., removing or isolating social and regulatory objectives that may conflict
  with the commercial objective)



Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                       53
     •	 Managerial authority. Ensuring key internal operating decisions are made by managers
       with incentives to maximize the value of the firm (rather than through externally imposed
       controls)

     •	 Performance monitoring. Subjecting government businesses to rigorous, independent
       monitoring and assessment of financial performance

     •	 Rewards and sanctions. Establishing performance-related managerial rewards and
       sanctions

     •	 Competitive neutrality. Removing special advantages and disadvantages that apply due to
       government ownership, and preventing the abuse of any market power

       Initially this involved (a) setting commercial dividend and rate of return targets,
         establishing the government guarantee fee to equalize the cost of debt for government
     (b) ­
     businesses with their private equivalents, and (c) increasing the autonomy and accountabil-
     ity of the businesses. The process accelerated following the Commission of Audit established
     by the Greiner government in 1988, and HWC was corporatized in 1991. It was further com-
     plemented by other policies such as the following:

     •	 A more comprehensive shareholder monitoring and reporting framework, including
       agreement on a Statement of Corporate Intent establishing the performance contract
       between the shareholding ministers and the state-owned corporation (SOC)

     •	 Financial distribution and capital structure policies that set the framework for the finan-
       cial management of the SOCs

     •	 A tax equivalent regime that required the SOCs to pay to the New South Wales government
       the equivalent of the company tax payments a private sector business would have had to
       pay to the commonwealth government if they were a private company4

     •	 The Community Services Obligations Policy (1994) that provided for the separation of
       commercial and policy objectives and the transparent delivery of social policy objectives
       on a commercial basis (New South Wales Treasury 1994)

       There are two key issues in the integrity of the SOC model—the strength and respect for the
     barriers to ministerial and department interventions, and the strength of the ownership
     supervision and monitoring. Corporatization seeks to do the following:

     •	 Mimic the incentives and governance structures of private firms so as to strengthen the
       incentives for management and staff to pursue efficiency and financial goals

     •	 Better align the incentives of management with that of the government as owner of the
       businesses on behalf of the community

       However, there are practical limits to this. Remuneration for senior executives contin-
     ued to be lower than that of private sector equivalents. While bonuses are paid, they are
     smaller than the private sector equivalents, and managers cannot participate in share



54   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
schemes that allow alignment to the longer term interest of the firm. Finally, most senior
executives and CEOs were appointed from within the public sector, which is indicative
of a segmented market for managers. Hence, the incentives for managers of SOCs to
improve financial performance and efficiency are not as strong as for their private sector
counterparts.
  In its 2010 Review of the Productivity Performance of State Owned Corporations, IPART con-
cludes that “the current framework addresses or seeks to address the most important factors
considered necessary to ensure that state owned businesses have the incentives and condi-
tions to operate efficiently, and is based on sound principles.” Yet “the current arrangements
for implementing this framework are not always consistent with these principles” (IPART
2010b, 67). IPART found shortcomings in the practical implementation of the SOC model in
regard to both the strength of the ownership supervision and monitoring and the barriers to
intervention. These findings illustrate one of the key learnings from corporatization: the
principles are sound and increase the probability of better performance if well implemented,
but good implementation is challenging, and continued effort is required to avoid the grad-
ual erosion of the model.


7.4.3. Structure of the Urban Water Sector
Historically, urban water businesses in New South Wales were vertically integrated, per-
forming functions of catchment management, storage operation, trunk transmission, distri-
bution, and supply to end customers. The past 20 years has seen changes in the structures of
urban water suppliers in a number of regions and states, including Sydney Water Corporation
(SWC). The models for the structure of the sector vary between and within states, and the
evolution of sector structures is, to a degree, specific to the circumstances and history of
each utility.
  In SWC’s case, bulk supply was separated out to increase the clarity of responsibility and
accountability for the water quality. This action took place as a result of a problem with water
quality that meant SWC’s customers were required to boil their drinking water for an
extended period. Subsequently, the Sydney Desalination Plant (SDP) was initially con-
structed by SWC and then privatized (see Box 7.1). The earlier separation of bulk water in
Melbourne was, in part, driven by the desire to create comparative competition between
retail suppliers and, in the longer term, possibly promote actual competition. The restruc-
ture in Queensland had the objective of improving the security of water supply. Thus, the
structures can be seen to reinforce and strengthen incentives to address aspects of quality,
efficiency, and security of water supply.


7.4.4. Increasing Role for the Private Sector
After a false start with a proposal for third-party access to SWC’s sewerage network to
allow a new entrant (Services Sydney) to provide retail sewerage services to end custom-
ers,5 the role of the private sector and the scope for competition has increased since 2008,



Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                          55
           BOX 7.1.   Managing Water Scarcity and the Sydney Desalination Plant (SDP)


           During the early 2000s, a severe drought (the “Millennium Drought”) affected most of
           South East Australia, creating concerns that Sydney could face severe water shortages.
           The options to address this included the following:

           •	 Scarcity pricing (i.e., higher usage charges as water scarcity increases)

           •	 Water restrictions and water efficiency programs and subsidies

           •	 Investment in new capacity such as desalination plants

           Water restrictions were commonly used to help manage water supplies during
           drought periods and had strong community support. Economists correctly pointed
           out the substantial welfare losses from the use of restrictions rather than scarcity
           pricing, but New South Wales (and other governments in South East Australia)
           committed to new desalination plants as “insurance” for water security.

           The construction of the SDP has been a controversial issue, especially as the drought
           broke very soon after the government committed to its construction. Planning for
           the construction of the SDP was taken to the point of commitment to build, and this
           commitment was not to be made until dam levels fell to 30 percent. However, the
           government committed to building the plant when dam levels fell to 38 percent.
           Desalination is expensive, and the construction of the plant resulted in significant
           increases in water charges, but the SDP is now in long-term shutdown because of
           ­
           high dam storage levels. This raised questions about the decisions to build the plant.




     when the licensing framework under the Water Industry Competition Act (WICA) was
     established.6 WICA provided for the licencing of new suppliers of water and wastewater
     services within the operational territories of SWC and HWC, and the establishment of a
     “negotiate and arbitrate” third-party access regime for declared transportation infrastruc-
     ture (or infrastructure subject to an approved voluntary access undertaking). Under this
     regime, prices are not established upfront, but negotiated subject to access pricing
     principles.
       The government required that the pricing of access to existing infrastructure had to be
     consistent with the maintenance of postage stamp pricing (i.e., retail prices for the incum-
     bent that were the same across its service territory). In its current review of wholesale prices,
     IPART has indicated it prefers retail minus prices (in which the minus equals the costs of a
     reasonably efficient competitor of providing the services from wholesale purchase to end
     use consumers) (IPART 2016a).
       Most of the 22 private service providers licensed under WICA provide recycled water
     for  commercial and residential developments. These are mostly small local systems




56   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
serving  new developments within existing commercial or urban areas and new green-
field  developments on the fringe of Sydney. The largest increase in private participa-
tion in the sector came from the sale of the SDP to the private sector. The easing of the
risk of water scarcity indirectly led to the review and proposed removal of the require-
ment in  WICA for new entrants to source their water from new additional sources.
This  may increase the opportunities for larger scale private sector participation in the
future.


7.4.5. Independent Price Regulation
New South Wales was the first state to establish independent price regulation in 1992,
when it established the Government Pricing Tribunal (renamed the Independent Pricing
and Regulatory Tribunal [IPART] in 1996) to regulate the prices of the government-owned
electricity, water, and transport businesses. This preceded the national reforms, and its
objectives were to (a) depoliticize utility pricing and reduce or remove cross-subsidies,
and (b) promote efficiency improvements and support the commercialization of the
utilities.
  Regulation can help improve efficiency by (a) ensuring prices better reflect costs and pro-
mote efficient use of scarce resources, (b) setting efficiency benchmarks that provide a trans-
parent target for more efficient service delivery, and (c) setting a “hard” budget constraint
that reinforces the incentives within the governance regime for more efficient service
delivery.
  IPART established its first multiyear price control for SWC in 1993. The prices are adjusted
annually using a CPI-X formula, in which X is set to equate expected revenues to forecast
efficient costs. The earlier reviews focused on removing cross-subsidies, establishing usage-
based pricing to better signal the economic value of water resources, and setting firm cost
reduction targets. These reviews were based on strong economic principles but relatively
high-level, simple analysis. Over time, the basis for setting prices became more transparent
and certain with the adoption of the “building block” approach to the determination of rev-
enue requirements.7 It also saw the development of more sophisticated and complex analy-
sis, and the more thorough application of the pricing principles established in the early
review to all areas of pricing.
  IPART has made its approach to price regulation clearer through publications on the con-
sideration of the equity, environmental, and financial objectives (IPART 2010b; 2011a; 2013.).
While IPART has been conscious of removing impediments to better environmental out-
comes consistent with economic efficiency, it has not sought to intrude into environmental
regulation. IPART has, however, expressed the view that environmental standards set by the
environmental regulator should be consistent with the community’s willingness to pay.
IPART sought to set clear limits to the role of price regulation in the pursuit of equity objec-
tives, arguing that in many cases instruments directly within the scope of government policy




Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                          57
     provide better means of achieving these objectives. For example, rebates to reduce the cost
     of water services for vulnerable households are set by the government, rather than IPART,
     and are funded from the government’s budget, rather than cross-subsidies from other
     customers.




     7.5. Reform Outcomes
     While difficult to define and measure, the cultures within HWC and SWC have changed fun-
     damentally from engineering-focused organizations to commercially oriented businesses
     concerned with delivering not only essential services but also economic and financial out-
     comes. An example of this is the more sophisticated and dynamic, risk-based approach to
     CAPEX (capital expenses) planning adopted by SWC. Both SWC and HWC now place greater
     emphasis on understanding their customers’ expectations and preferences in investment
     and service decisions as well as pricing proposals. More directly measurable outcomes are
     pricing reform, improvement in profitability and the capacity to finance investment, and
     improvements in efficiency.
       Property tax components of charges and free water allowances have been eliminated, and
     cross-subsidies between and within customer classes have been largely removed. Virtually
     all customers8 pay the same usage charge, which reflects marginal costs, providing appropri-
     ate economic signals for the use of water. Fixed charges, which ensure that the revenues
     match the total efficient costs of supply, are set on a common basis for all customers and
     ensure that significant cross-subsidies have been eliminated. When the government com-
     mitted SWC to the construction of the SDP to improve water security, prices were able to be
     increased by 40 percent over four years to ensure that water consumers paid the efficient
     costs (including a commercial return on investment) of the improved security of supply.
       The level of profitability and dividend payments to the government have increased, dou-
     bling for SWC over the 10 years to 2014–15. In setting prices, IPART includes a commercial
     return comparable to that of a private firm facing similar risk, and assesses the financability
     of the utilities using commercial benchmarks. In 2015, the stand-alone credit rating for SWC
     was increased from Baa2 to Baa1 (equivalent to BBB+). While consistent, reliable estimates
     of the efficiency of SWC and HWC covering the whole period are not available, various indi-
     cators show the following:

     •	 HWC and SWC have achieved substantial increases in labor productivity. For example, in
       the period 1996–2009 both businesses achieved improvements in labor productivity of
       around 100 percent.

     •	 Reflecting this significant reduction in OPEX, benchmarks have been achieved, and both
       businesses now compare well with their peers.

       Estimates of total factor productivity (TFP) do not provide a clear trend. While measured
     TFP declined by 14 percent in the period to 2009, this did not take into account the


58   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
improvements in the quality of the services flowing from investments to meet higher efflu-
ent standards or the increase in security of supply of water.


7.6. Structure of Part II
The remainder of part II is set out as follows. Chapter 8 provides context for the study and
sets out the sector objectives and current structure. Chapter 9 outlines the framework
for  improving performance in the sector. There are four key elements to this: (a) clearer
policy and operating framework, (b) clearer objectives for service providers and their corpo-
ratization, (c) sector restructuring and strengthening the role for the private sector, and
(d) de-­
       politicization and reform of pricing. This has evolved over time, and the sequencing
responded to specific circumstances.
  Chapters 10–15 examine the evolution of the framework elements set out in chapter 9 over
time. Chapter 10 sets out the current policy and operating framework, how it has evolved
over time, and the key issues for the future. Chapter 11 sets out the objectives and commer-
cial operating framework for the government-owned service providers, how it has evolved
over time, and the key issues for the future. Chapter 12 discusses the increasing role of the
private sector and competition in New South Wales, how it has evolved over time, and the
key issues for the future. Chapter 13 discusses the management of scarcity, including through
pricing, and the decisions to invest in desalination plants as insurance against scarcity.
Chapter 14 sets out the approach to regulating prices, how it has evolved over time, and the
key issues for the future. Chapter 15 summarizes the current performance of the sector and
the extent to which it has improved over time. Chapter 16 provides concluding comments on
the lessons from the reform of the sector.


Notes
	 1.	 The Hunter Water Board (now Hunter Water Corporation) was the first water supplier to prioritise usage-based pricing in
    the mid-1980s, and was the first water business corporatized in New South Wales.

	 2.	 Originally established as the Government Pricing Tribunal (GPT) of New South Wales, it was subsequently renamed IPART
    when its functions were extended to cover privately owned gas utilities in 1996.

	 3.	 On November 1, 2000, the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2000 came
    into effect. The Act conferred on IPART regulatory (e.g., making recommendations on licenses) and license auditing func-
    tions. Prior to that time the license regulator administered the regime.

	 4.	 Under the Australian Constitution, state-owned entities such as the SOCs were exempt from company tax.

	 5.	 Services Sydney proposed to provide a sewerage retail, collection, and disposal service to end use customers, using SWC’s

Chapter 8   Context

            Chapter 8 provides the context for this review by describing the objectives and structure of
            the New South Wales water sector and the environment in which it operates. The basic
            objectives (the supply of safe and secure water and wastewater services that manage a scarce
            resource and contribute to economic and social development) are common across countries,
            but there are important differences in priorities and context. Resource and environmental
            management is particularly important in Australia, given its dry climate, frequent extended
            droughts, and sensitivity of receiving waters. However, access to water and sewerage
            services is less important than in other countries, given the existing near universal access to
            water in inhabited parts of Australia.1
              Australia has a federal government structure, yet the state and local governments hold
            primary responsibility for the provision of water and wastewater services. In recent years
            the commonwealth has taken a stronger policy reform and coordination role in the water
            sector, primarily through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG)2 and subsidiary
            intergovernmental entities. Drivers for this were the need to better manage resources shared
            across states and to improve economic performance. The Murray-Darling Basin covers much
            of South East Australia and spans four states, and coordination of the management of this
            key resource is essential. However, improving the performance of urban water suppliers was
            also an important part of the microeconomic reform agenda.
              Historically, urban water businesses were vertically integrated, performing the functions
            of catchment management, storage operation, trunk transmission, and distribution to end
            customers. Over the past 20 years this structure has changed in Australia, yet there is no
            standard model in place. Instead, the evolution of the structure is to a degree specific to the
            circumstances and history of each utility. One important element in recent sector structure
            evolution has been the need to develop additional supply sources or promote reuse and
            water conservation to enhance security of supply.
              This circumstance-specific evolution resulted in a mixture of organizational and owner-
            ship structures in the sector. In some areas, such as Newcastle (the second largest city in
            New South Wales), the utilities are vertically integrated from dams to wastewater discharges.
            In other areas, such as Sydney, bulk water supply function is separate from distribution and
            retail supply of water, and there is significant, and growing, private sector involvement.


            8.1. Sector Objectives
            Objectives of the water sector in New South Wales are to (a) ensure the security and quality
            of water supply for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use, and ensure affordable access
            to water and wastewater services; (b) ensure the sustainability of water resources (extraction
            and supply, and discharge into receiving waters); (c) promote efficient supply and use of
            water and sanitation services; (d) ensure the provision of water and wastewater services is

     financially sustainable, including a commercial return on assets for the state-government
     owned utilities (Sydney Water Corporation [SWC] and Hunter Water Corporation [HWC]);
     and (e) support economic and social development, including efficient urban development.
       While there are common elements in sector objectives across nations, both low- and
     middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs), there are also important
     differences that must be remembered when considering case studies such as this.
       The broader health and community development benefits of improved water and sanita-
     tion services are widely recognized. Therefore, focus is put on achieving high levels of
     access to these services, and ensuring that the water provided meets minimum health stan-
     dards and receiving waterways are protected. In New South Wales, very high levels of
     access to water services do not provide the challenge for the sector that a lack of access does
     in other countries.
       While security of supply of water is a common international objective, it has been a more
     pressing objective in New South Wales and across Australia. Not only is Australia a very dry
     continent but it is also susceptible to additional long droughts lasting for several years.
     Furthermore, rainfall appears to be reducing and droughts becoming more frequent. Hence,
     security of supply is a major challenge.
       Efficient and financially sustainable provision of the water and sanitation services is also a
     common international objective. However, the starting position on cost recovery and
     perceptions of what “financially sustainable” means both vary between countries.
       In New South Wales, the major urban water utilities not only cover operating costs but
     they also cover depreciation of assets, earn a return on assets (ROA), and pay dividends to
     the government. Thus in New South Wales, the question of financial sustainability revolves
     around whether, irrespective of ownership, the utilities are earning a commercial ROA given
     the risks involved. In contrast, according to IBNET, 37 percent of water utilities did not cover
     their basic operating and maintenance costs (Denilenko et al. 2014). Such utilities would
     require external funding to cover operating costs, and cannot contribute to the funding of
     new and replacement assets from their own resources.


     8.2. Structure of Government in Australia
     There are three levels of government in Australia. The commonwealth (national) government,
     which is responsible for the whole country and covers issues like immigration, trade, compe-
     tition policy, communications, taxation, defense, and foreign affairs. State government, com-
     prising Australia’s six state and two territory parliaments, which are responsible for the
     delivery of services such as schools, hospitals, roads, railways, electricity, water, mining, and
     agriculture. Local government, made up of around 5003 councils across Australia. Councils
     are responsible for local services and matters, such as local roads, parks, rubbish collection,
     library services, street signage, and pet control.
       The state and local governments are responsible for delivering services to the community,
     while the commonwealth has a stronger role in policy formulation and coordination rather


62   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
than service delivery. Arguably, government has become more complex, especially with
increasingly national and international markets, and the need for coordination and cooper-
ation between governments has increased.
  As a result, there has been a strengthening and expansion of mechanisms for a federal
approach to decision making involving commonwealth, state, and sometimes local
governments. COAG has played a key role in this. COAG is the peak intergovernmental forum
in Australia, and its members are the prime minister, state and territory premiers and chief
ministers, and the president of the Australian Local Government Association. COAG is sup-
ported by its own secretariat and underneath COAG are various parallel councils and
committees of portfolio ministers, such as the Transport and Infrastructure Council and the
Energy Council. In addition to COAG, new agencies have been established with governance
arrangements that ensure accountability to both commonwealth and state governments. For
example, while the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is part of
the commonwealth government for administrative purposes, its commissioners are jointly
appointed by the state and commonwealth governments.
  The “power of the purse” has been the other key means of strengthening coordination and
advancing the reform agenda. There is a long history of fiscal transfers from the common-
wealth to the states, in some cases for specific purposes with conditions attached. The fiscal
transfers have grown over time, with an increasing imbalance between the revenue bases of
the commonwealth and state governments and their respective service delivery functions
and costs. These transfers have been used to expand the commonwealth government’s role
in both setting the policy frameworks within which state and local governments deliver ser-
vices, and encouraging improvements in efficiency of service delivery. For example, in the
mid- to late 1990s, the commonwealth government used competition payments to encour-
age compliance with the COAG Reform Framework. In the same way that payments are
made from the commonwealth to states, states make payments to local governments (e.g.,
funding the Country Towns Water and Sewerage Scheme) and provide subsidized loans to
local governments.
  Since local government is not recognized under the constitution, the commonwealth
government could not make payments directly to local government. Thus the competition
payments were made to the states, and questions were raised about the extent to which
these payments were ultimately transferred to local government.


8.3. Geographic Context for the Water Sector in New South Wales
Australia’s population is mostly distributed along the coastal regions in the southwest
(Western Australia), south (South Australia), and east and southeast (Victoria, New South
Wales and Queensland); map 8.1. New South Wales is the most populous state in Australia,
with most of its population in the Sydney region, Sydney being the most densely populated
region in Australia. Newcastle, some 200 km north of Sydney, is the second most populous
region in New South Wales.

                                              government-owned entities. Coastal areas have discrete basins (see map 8.2) and relatively
                                              higher rainfall. In these areas there is limited competition between urban and rural water use.
                                                In the inland areas there are numerous country town water utilities in each basin. These
                                              areas are much drier than the coastal regions, and there are limited amounts of water avail-
                                              able each year. Much of this inland area is within the Murray-Darling basin, where a major
                                              issue is the balance between water for environmental flows and water for agriculture.

                                           The key issues in this structure are the allocation of responsibilities and ownership. The
                                           various responsibilities in the water sector are (a) water resource planning; (b) bulk water
                                           storage and supply; (c) distribution and supply of water; (d) transfer, treatment, and dis-
                                           charge of wastewater; (e) management of stormwater; and (f) regulation of water quality,
                                           discharge standards, service standards and prices.
                                                 The vast majority of organizations are government-owned entities. These operate as a
                                           state government department, a commercial business (statutory authority), state-owned
                                           corporation (SOC) or a local government organization. The allocation of responsibilities
                                           within the Sydney-Central Coast-Hunter region is shown in table 8.1. The allocation of
                                           responsibilities in other New South Wales regions is shown in table 8.2.

66                                            Australian Urban Water Reform Story
                                 principles and frameworks overseen by the Department of Primary Industries (DPI). A 2009
                                 review considered a number of options for the structure and regulation of these local water
                                 utilities. The option of bringing local water utilities under the regulation of IPART was con-
                                 sidered but not supported. It would not be feasible to separately regulate each of the 105
                                 utilities with the same approach used for the major metropolitan water agencies. The
                                 approach of centralized (statewide) principles with local responsibility and accountability
                                 would be more efficient and consistent with the existing system of accountability through
                                 local councils that are responsible for the delivery of the services. However, the require-
                                 ments for compliance were strengthened, as were the principles and frameworks, in line
                                 with the national water framework.

                                           However, due to industry reform, SWC is no longer responsible for bulk water storage and
                                           supply. It now purchases water from the government-owned WaterNSW and the privatized
                                           Sydney Desalination Plant (SDP).6
                                                SWC is an SOC and Australia’s largest water utility. As map 8.3 illustrates, SWC is among
                                           the world’s largest government-owned water utilities. It was corporatized in 1994 with com-
                                           mercial objectives. The government appoints SWC directors, who have the normal obliga-
                                           tions of directors of private companies. SWC pays dividends of around $A 250 million per
                                           annum (approx. 10 percent of revenue) (SWC Annual Reports (various). The Portfolio minis-

                                           these directions.
                                                SWC’s assets are valued at $A 15.9 billion (SWC 2015).7 SWC manages over 21,635 km of

8.6. Comparison with Urban Water Structures in Other States
8.6.1. Melbourne
Melbourne has one bulk supplier (Melbourne Water, which is also responsible for the trans-
mission network) and three retailer-distributors (City West Water, South East Water, and
Yarra Valley Water, which each service a different area of Melbourne). The current Melbourne
water industry structure was implemented in January 1995. As stated by the Department of
the Treasury, the key structural reform separated wholesale from retail functions, with the
creation of separate retail utilities that “compete by comparison, thus stimulating the sorts
of efficiencies in service and cost management that are witnessed between competing
private sector businesses” (Yarra Valley Water 2007, 4). Melbourne Water manages the
wholesale function (comprising headworks and major sewage treatment works) (Yarra Valley
Water 2007).
  The separation of the wholesale and retail functions in Melbourne provides additional
clarity on cost allocation, and the creation of three retailers allowed for influence through
comparative competition. The Essential Services Commission (ESC) Performance
Reporting Framework for the metropolitan water suppliers focuses on service perfor-
mance measures rather than cost-efficiency measures. To date, the price determinations
have not used formal cost-efficiency benchmarking, although Frontier Economics

8.6.2. Queensland
In 2007, the state government began major water reforms to “drought-proof” South East
Queensland. The first stage of the water reform was completed in July 2008, when the state
centralized South East Queensland bulk water assets through the establishment of four new
state government-owned organizations that provided wholesale water to local government
water retailers:

•	 Seqwater (bulk water dams and treatment plants) owns, operates and maintains all South
  East Queensland dams (including the Hinze Dam), bulk supply reservoirs, and water treat-
  ment plants

•	 WaterSecure (manufactured water) owns, operates, and maintains the Gold Coast
  Desalination Plant and Western Corridor Water Recycling Scheme

     •	 LinkWater (bulk transport) owns, operates, and maintains the bulk water transport infra-
       structure (South East Queensland water grid pipelines and mains)

     •	 Water Grid Manager is responsible for managing contracts and flow of water around the
       South East Queensland water grid. South East Queensland councils purchase bulk water
       from the water grid manager to supply to customers through council-owned distribution
       networks


       Three local government-owned retailer-distributors, Allconnex Water, Queensland Urban
     Utilities, and Unity Water, serve different areas of South East Queensland. Allconnex Water
     was jointly owned by the city councils of Redland, Gold Coast, and Logan. In 2011, the
     Queensland government repealed sections of the legislation establishing the retailer-­
     distributors, allowing local governments to return to the previous structure of local govern-
     ment directly providing services. As a result, the city councils of Gold Coast, Logan, and
     Redland resumed responsibility for water and sewerage services on July 1, 2012.
       A revised Seqwater was formed on January 1, 2013 through a merger of the three state-
     owned nonretail water businesses, the SEQ Water Grid Manager, LinkWater, and the former
     Seqwater. It is now also responsible for the long-term planning of the region’s future water
     needs, a function that was formerly undertaken by the Queensland Water Commission.
       Currently there is one bulk water supplier (Seqwater), and five water retailers in South East
     Queensland. Retail suppliers responsible for water distribution and sewage collection, treat-
     ment, and disposal include the following:

     •	 Queensland Urban Utilities, servicing the local government areas of Brisbane, Ipswich,
       Somerset, Scenic Rim, and Lockyer Valley

     •	 Unitywater, servicing Moreton Bay and Sunshine Coast

     •	 Gold Coast City Council

     •	 Logan City Council

     •	 Redland City Council


     8.6.3. Factors behind Different Models
     Prior to 1998, SWC was a vertically integrated water business. However, in 1999, the bulk
     water functions were separated out following a protracted boiled water alert that raised
     questions about catchment management and quality of water. Separating the bulk water
     function from the distribution and supply functions was seen as way of strengthening
     responsibilities and accountabilities. It was argued that this would provide a clearer focus on
     catchment management and water quality by establishing a single entity with its primary
     responsibility being the supply of bulk water. An important part of these reforms was
     increased requirements for testing, monitoring, and reporting on the quality of water sup-
     plies. However, the government did not extend this separation of bulk water from distribu-
     tion and supply to HWC.


70   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
  There were strong similarities between the structures of SWC and HWC at the time. Both
were vertically integrated water and wastewater utilities that relied on one large dam as the
primary source of bulk water. The key distinguishing features are that the same issues in
regard to the quality of bulk water supplies had not arisen in the Hunter and that HWC was
considerably smaller than SWC, with an asset base less than one-fifth of that of SWC. The
smaller size of HWC raised questions about the economic viability and cost of a separate
bulk water agency, although this function could be transferred to WaterNSW (as has now
occurred in Sydney).
  The Central Coast model is the result of local council ownership of the water and wastewa-
ter networks within their local government area. Historically, the two councils had their own
water storages. However, as the communities grew there was limited capacity for new dams,
and there were benefits in sharing dams and bulk storages. To supplement supply, a pipeline
was built in 2006 from the Hunter Valley to the Central Coast. This pipeline supplied about
35 percent of the Central Coast’s daily water use in 2006.9 Initially built to provide the Central
Coast with water during the drought, the pipeline has the capacity to transfer water back to
the Hunter Valley when needed.
  While bulk water supply was a shared function between the two councils, each council
owned and operated its own water distribution and wastewater systems. The costs for these
functions were allocated and tracked, but otherwise there was limited separation of the
water and wastewater functions from the other activities of council. The next reform origi-
nally proposed for the Central Coast was the establishment of a separate, jointly owned util-
ity providing water and wastewater services to both councils. The utility would be a
corporatized entity and its prices would be regulated by IPART, as are the councils’ current
water and wastewater charges. With the recent amalgamation of the two councils, the estab-
lishment of a corporatized authority is unlikely and IPART continues to regulate the com-
bined council’s water and wastewater charges. The Victorian model reflects a number of
possible factors, including benefits of benchmark and comparative competition; skepticism
regarding economies of scale in distribution and retail, and longer term vision of privatiza-
tion and competition
  The Queensland reforms in 2008 were intended to drought-proof the state by placing
the bulk water functions within central control; prior to this, the local councils were respon-
sible for their own dams, bores, and other water sources. In principle, this can facilitate coor-
dination of the various water sources to maximize the security of supply.


8.6.4. Assessment of Models
Each different model can be made to work in practice. The SWC model needs strong con-
tracts and monitoring of water quality to maintain alignment of accountabilities and
responsibilities. This has been achieved through the strengthening of the licensing arrange-
ments. However, the different sizes and structures of the metropolitan water agencies
regulated by IPART limit the value of cross-sectional peer benchmarking. Nevertheless,


Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                            71
     in past reviews IPART has used comparison of trends in costs over time. For its review of
     the performance of the New South Wales SOCs (IPART 2010b), IPART estimated the trends
     in productivity of time and undertook comparative analysis of these trends for SWC and
     HWC, and individually compared the performance of each for various cost and service key
     performance indicators (KPIs) against their peers in other states.
       While the New South Wales model does not prohibit benchmarking, one of the strengths
     of the Victorian model is that it facilitates comparison by competition. According to the
     National Water Commission (NWC):


         In 2007, the Victorian ESC noted that comparative competition had worked to improve
         performance and in particular to “encourage management teams to innovate to
         improve service delivery relative to other businesses”. Anecdotal evidence (sourced
         from personal correspondence) suggests that the managers of the Melbourne water
         retailers pay significant attention to their relative performance. The performance data
         also appears to support this contention. In the years following the disaggregation, the
         performance of Melbourne retailers improved significantly on many measurable cus-
         tomer performance metrics, including customer complaints, water quality compliance
         and the speed with which unplanned interruptions and sewer spills were rectified.
         (LECG Limited Asia Pacific 2011, 26)


       The public performance reporting under the ESC focuses on various dimensions of service
     outputs and quality, rather than measures of cost and efficiency. This limits its value in
     price  setting and in its determinations of prices for the three Melbourne water suppliers
     since the ESC has not used formal comparative benchmarking. However, the ESC is under-
     taking a review of its approach to regulating water prices, and Frontier Economics has
     recommended that it increase its use of benchmarking.
       In Queensland, the reversals made to previous reform decisions reflect the unrest within
     the industry about the initial reforms, which relied on minimal consultation with the local
     government and the community. Hence, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the effec-
     tiveness of the model because the model operated only for a short period and the subse-
     quent changes may have reflected deficiencies in the reform process rather than in the
     model itself.

Chapter 9   Framework for Improving Performance

            This chapter explains the framework that has been adopted in New South Wales and Australia
            for improving the performance of the sector. The framework separated policies on commer-
            cial operation from actual policy function and tried to improve the incentives for commer-
            cially sustainable and efficient delivery of services. It has evolved over time in response to
            specific circumstances, with individual “champions” playing an important role in imple-
            menting innovative reforms in advance of changing framework requirements and influenc-
            ing others in the sector to also create change. Thus, it was not a straightforward reform
            pushed by central policy makers.


            9.1. Framework Adopted
            The framework for improving performance has revolved around (a) a clearer policy and
            operating framework for the sector; (b) clear commercial objectives for the service providers
            aligned to the framework; (c) sector restructuring, a stronger role for the private sector, and
            facilitation of competition; and (d) depoliticization and reform of pricing and its regulation.
            Conceptually, this is a coherent package that strengthens the incentives of service providers
            and aligns these to the objectives for the sector. However, it has evolved nonlinearly over a
            period of more than 30 years rather than as a straightforward, planned process.


            9.2. Evolution of the Framework and Its Implementation
            The sequence of reforms is summarized in Figure 9.1. A focus on national policy frame-
            works rather than the sequence of reform implementation may create a perception that
            both the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Water Reform Framework and the
            National Competition Policy (NCP) (Hilmer Report) led the way. However, both followed
            earlier reforms in some states and utilities, such as Hunter Water Corporation (HWC) and
            Sydney Water Corporation (SWC). The history of this reform demonstrates the need for
            push from more than one party to drive change. Some champions will act in advance of
            national agreements, testing different approaches, demonstrating progress, and provid-
            ing pathways for reform. In the case of water reform in Australia, HWC is widely recog-
            nized as the key innovator and champion of reform through the 1980–2000 period.
              This is recognized in the submission of the Australian Water Association (AWA) to the
            review of the NWC in 2010, which stated:


               The Australian water industry has a very successful history of reform. Through the
               mid-to-late 1990’s, these were stimulated by the National Competition Policy (NCP),
               but are not merely a response to it. Indeed, reform paralleling the notion underpin-
               ning  the NCP – that “competitive markets will generally best serve the interests of

76                                         Australian Urban Water Reform Story
  Reform evolution reflects changing priorities and specific political-social factors, and for
the major urban service providers can be usefully broken into the following periods:

•	 Pre-1980s. Water was viewed as a “social service” with poor financial performance, ineffi-
  cient pricing with extensive subsidies, and a tax component

•	 1980s. Initial reform steps in the water sector led by HWC,1 supported by the initial steps
  towards commercialization and corporatization

•	 1990s. Commercialization and price reform, which was part of a bipartisan national
  agenda on microeconomic reform to improve productivity

•	 Late 1990s. Improved financial performance and service standards framework

•	 Mid-2000s. Security of supply and competition

  Reform of the 105 country town water supply authorities substantially lagged behind that
of the major urban suppliers, in regards to price reform and commercial orientation. For
example, although the COAG Water Reform Framework of 1994 required councils to intro-
duce usage charges, it was well into the 2000s before most councils followed through (COAG
1994). The issue in this case was the time lag in implementation. In practice, the various
principles developed under the national water agreements have been incorporated in the
frameworks and principles for country town water authorities, and the requirements for
compliance with these have been strengthened.
  By contrast, reforms had already commenced in SWC and HWC prior to the national agree-
ments, with substantial progress achieved, especially by HWC. Hence, in practice, the
national agreements had less effect initiating the reform of the major urban suppliers in New
South Wales. However, the National Agreements did the following:

•	 Promoted the extension of these principles to the reform of country town water supply
  schemes in New South Wales and other urban water suppliers that had not yet began
  reform processes

•	 Reinforced the commitment to, and continued implementation of, these reforms

  The latter point is significant. As is argued below in regard to corporatization, these reforms
require constant vigilance and effort, particularly the separation of political and commercial
goals in regard to service delivery and pricing. Table 9.1 provides a summary of the reform
process across the sector.
  Objectives of governance and pricing reform were to (a) encourage more efficient and com-
mercially sustainable delivery of services; (b) ensure the government (and the public) obtained
an appropriate return on the assets invested, and to contribute to an improved fiscal position
for the state; (c) depoliticize the management and operation of the water state-owned corpo-
rations (SOCs), and to separate commercial and non-commercial objectives and instruments;
and (d) ensure more transparent pricing that is depoliticized, more cost-reflective, and
provides a sound basis for the provision of the services the community needs.

78                                         Australian Urban Water Reform Story
  The challenge has been to design institutions and structures to achieve this goal within the
constraints of existing governance and political frameworks. For example, better progress
was made on the fourth bullet point because of stronger institutional arrangements. Key
points from the reform process:

•	 The design of regulatory frameworks and institutions is context specific. The establish-
   ment of Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) reflected the circumstances
   and political structures in New South Wales, especially the commitment of the then-­
   government to long-term improvements in public policy.

•	 The subsequent binding commitment of all governments in Australia to a national compe-
   tition reform agenda (National Competition Policy Review 1993), which includes indepen-
   dent regulation of network monopolies, has supported IPART’s continuation and its
   independence.

  IPART (then called the Government Pricing Tribunal or GPT)2 was established in 1992 as an
independent transparent body to regulate government-owned businesses. Regulating gov-
ernment utilities was not new in New South Wales or Australia. The government businesses
had not previously been allowed to simply set their own prices unconstrained. Instead, the
regulatory function had been performed by the cabinet, ministers, departments, or ad hoc
review committees. However, independent regulation of government-owned utilities was
unusual. U.S. regulators had largely overseen privately owned utilities, while prices for
government-owned businesses were set by governments. In the United Kingdom, regulators
were established to support privatization and regulate private businesses.
  In delegating the control of prices to an independent regulator, such as IPART, the
government recognized that there were problems in the pricing of utility services such
as  water, and that political control was a key cause as it was difficult for politicians to
“depoliticize” pricing.

Chapter 10   Current Policy and Operating Framework

             Sydney Water Corporation (SWC) and Hunter Water Corporation (HWC) operate under a
             mature policy and licencing framework that reflects their economic, social, and environ-
             mental importance. The framework is consistent with, in principle, strong separation
             between commercial and social policy goals. While initiatives at the utility and state levels
             preceded the national reform agenda, the national changes have supported its ongoing
             development, entrenchment, and expansion beyond the major urban areas. Similarly, the
             framework for setting and monitoring compliance with health and environmental standards
             has become more robust. Continuing tension or concern remains around:

             •	 Whether environmental standards are moving ahead of the community’s willingness to
               pay for these higher standards,

             •	 Whether environmental goals are being achieved through the most efficient means (e.g.,
               whether higher standards on discharges by the major water utilities are being used when
               there are more cost effective options for reducing diffuse sources of pollution in receiving
               waterways).

               This section discusses (a) national microeconomic reform and the water sector, (b) water
             resource planning, (c) drinking water standards, (d) wastewater and receiving environment
             standards, and (e) subsidy and access policy.
               The next section discusses the state’s corporatization and governance frameworks that
             govern the operation of SWC and HWC, consistent with the national microeconomic reform
             framework.


             10.1. Overview of the Policy and Operating Framework
             SWC and, to a lesser degree, HWC are substantial businesses in their own right, which pro-
             vide important services for the economic and social development of the community. A key
             objective of the bipartisan microeconomic reform agenda of the 1990s was to lift the overall
             productivity of the nation by more efficient delivery and use of key infrastructure services.
             The NCP agreements and specific water policy initiatives, as well as the state’s corporatiza-
             tion and governance policies, provided the economic framework within which SWC and
             HWC now operate. The key elements of the approach were to separate out commercial and
             policy goals and to promote competition where possible. Competition was seen to be the
             best means of promoting efficient delivery and use of services, but this has gone further in
             the energy sector than the water sector. Where competition was not possible, a framework
             was to be established to promote the efficient provision of monopoly services on a commer-
             cial basis with cost-reflective pricing.

       Improving the efficiency and productivity of key infrastructure businesses, such as water
     utilities, was critical not only because it improved productivity of a large sector of the econ-
     omy but also because of resulting benefits to other sectors that use infrastructure services.
     This focus on the commercial importance of the sector was not intended to overshadow the
     contribution of the sector to health and environmental outcomes, and the broader economic
     and social benefits of this. To this end, SWC and HWC must comply with their operating
     licenses, which are supervised by IPART. The operating license outlines requirements for
     compliance with drinking water and environmental standards, service quality standards,
     water resource management, and asset management and planning.
       Quality of water supplies was overlooked until the “boiled water” warnings in Sydney of
     1998, which arose due to the concern about the presence of cryptosporidium and giardia in
     the water. This issue led to a strengthening of the regulation and monitoring of water quality.
     It also resulted in the separation of catchment management and bulk water supply from
     water treatment, distribution and retail services, and thus the creation of the Sydney
     Catchment Authority (SCA) as a separate entity to SWC.
       More recently, concern has focused on the security of water supply. This led to strength-
     ened license conditions on water efficiency and target levels of consumption per head as
     well as investment in a large desalination plant.1 These strengthened license conditions have
     been replaced in the latest version of the SWC operating license with the concept of an
     Economic Level of Water Conservation.2
       Concerns about cost and efficacy of water efficiency and reuse programs, water resource
     planning, and the environmental discharge standards can create tension between the eco-
     nomic regulator and the water resource planners (the Metropolitan Water Directorate within
     DPI Water) and the Environment Protection Authority (EPA). The separation of these func-
     tions is helpful as it explicitly handles these tensions and trade-offs, rather than internaliz-
     ing tensions within the decisions of a single regulator. If each regulator follows best practice
     regulatory or policy principles, there should not be any inherent tension between the respec-
     tive roles.
       SWC and HWC operate in sensitive environmental areas. They discharge wastewater and
     stormwater into environmentally sensitive waterways and beaches. At the commencement
     of regulation by Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) (then the Government
     Pricing Tribunal [GPT]), SWC had a proactive approach to environmental issues. For exam-
     ple, it used trade waste charges as a tax on-paid into an environmental trust to fund research,
     education and environmental repairs activities not limited to trade waste. However, IPART’s
     first report raised concerns that the framework for setting environmental standards was not
     clear, with SWC leading environmentally driven investments that may have exceeded the
     community’s willingness to pay. Subsequently, the role of the EPA has strengthened and
     SWC has resisted proposals for higher environmental standards where costs would exceed
     benefits or not be the most efficient means of protecting the environment. It would be naïve
     to link this directly to the commercialization of SWC. While IPART continues to pass through


82   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
the efficient costs of meeting mandatory standards, these standards do not threaten the
long-term financial viability of the utility.
  IPART’s initial response to concerns about the costs of rising water quality and environ-
mental standards was to establish a transparent “cost of quality” review in 1993, which
established the costs of meeting various scenarios for water quality and environmental stan-
dards (GPT 1993b). While not determinative, it sought to influence policy choice through the
transparent disclosure of costs and bill impacts. More recently, IPART has explicitly raised
the prospect of not passing through the full efficient costs of legally enforceable standards if
it considers those standards are not reasonable (IPART 2015).
  During IPART’s consultation on the 2016 SWC price review, livability (the quality of life
enjoyed by a city’s populace) became a major theme (IPART 2016b). This draws together
environmental, water security, and customer affordability concerns.
  In relation to environmental standards, IPART’s current approach is based on the premise
that the EPA sets environmental standards consistent with the government’s requirements,
and imposes those standards on SWC through its regulatory instruments. IPART then sets
prices at a level that allows the utility to recover the prudent and efficient cost of meeting
those environmental standards (IPART 2016b). Should stakeholders wish to improve live-
ability, achieving higher standards than those mandated by government, IPART considers
what specific outcomes stakeholders want to achieve, and who is responsible for regulating
that outcome. In this case, IPART would require clear evidence that it would be prudent and
efficient for customers to pay to exceed the mandated standards, and whether SWC’s cus-
tomers have both the capacity and willingness to pay for the higher standard. IPART would
also examine whether the government had already considered the higher standards when it
set the existing standard (IPART 2016b).


10.2. Microeconomic Reform and the Water Sector
The COAG Water Reform Framework and the NCP have been the key national policies stim-
ulating reform of the water sector.

10.2.1. National Competition Policy
The National Competition Policy (NCP) was the package of reforms set in 1995, based on the
recommendations of a committee of inquiry chaired by Professor Fred Hilmer (National
Competition Policy Review 1993). The NCP reforms built upon earlier microeconomic reforms,
such as the COAG Water Reform Framework, to establish a national framework for microeco-
nomic reform to improve productivity. The key elements of the NCP were the following:

•	 Commercialization and, where appropriate, regulation of government-owned utilities
  and other government-owned businesses

•	 Creation of a level playing field for government-owned and privately owned business
  (e.g., equal treatment for tax and competition policy)



Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                          83
     •	 Establishment of independent price regulations and price reform

     •	 Promotion of competition where possible, facilitated by access to essential monopoly
       facilities (e.g., pipes and wires) where necessary

     •	 Competition payments to the state governments conditional on compliance with the
       requirements of the NCP

     Competition Payments and the NCC

     The NCP provided for the creation of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
     (ACCC) and the National Competition Council (NCC).

     •	 Regulatory responsibilities were split between the ACCC, the national regulator, and state
       and territory regulators, such as the already established IPART and ESC (Victoria).3
       The ACCC was the regulator under national access regimes that governed regulated access
       to essential infrastructure and regulation of the national facilities, such as telecoms and
       airports that were within the commonwealth’s jurisdiction. Water and electricity (and other
       services traditionally within the governance of the states) were regulated by state-based
       regulators, but regulation of terms and conditions for access to essential infrastructure
       (e.g., pipes and wires) for competitive supply of electricity had to be consistent with the
       national access regime, and regulation of final prices was to be consistent with the princi-
       ples set out in the NCP.

       Over time, the role of the ACCC and the Australian Energy Regulator (AER)4 has
     expanded. Regulation of the National Electricity Markets that covers all states except
     Western Australia5 and the Northern Territory has largely moved to the AER, and the ACCC
     has taken on an increased role in regulating water where there is a national or cross-juris-
     dictional market (i.e., the Murray-Darling Basin), and retail prices outside urban areas.
       An important feature of the institutional framework has been the financial incentives (com-
     petition payments) made by the Australian government to the states and territories to com-
     pensate for the fiscal dividend from their implementation of the agreed reform commitments
     (see Box 10.1). The role of the NCC was to advise on the declaration of facilities under the
     national access regime, review compliance of the state and territory governments with the
     NCP requirements, and advise on competition payments to be made or withheld based on
     the compliance assessment.
       The NCC commented in its submission to the Productivity Commission (PC 2005) that
     competition payments and penalties for noncompliance, have been an important contribu-
     tor to the success of the NCP:

        Using competition payments to leverage reform outcomes in areas of state and
        Territory responsibility has been effective in increasing the consistency and commit-
        ment to implementing national reforms. … Reform would have been slower and less
        comprehensive without competition payments. (NCC 2004, 35)




84   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
      BOX 10.1.   How Competition Payments Work


      The Australian government provided competition payments to the states and territo-
      ries to reward them for satisfactory progress in implementing their reform commit-
      ments. The payments were a recognition by COAG that all governments should share
      in the benefits of economic growth and the associated higher taxation revenue result-
      ing from the reform program and that, with the high degree of vertical fiscal imbal-
      ance, much of the increase in tax revenue would initially accrue to the Commonwealth.

      The Australian government allocated funds totalling about $A 5.7 billion for com-
      petition payments over the period 1997–98 to 2005–06. The NCC assessed each
      state’s progress of reform and made recommendations to the Australian Treasurer on
      any penalties that would need to be applied. In assessing the nature and size of any
      penalties that it recommends, the NCC took into account the significance of the com-
      pliance breach, the extent of the state or territory government’s overall commitment
      to NCP implementation and the effect of that jurisdiction’s reform efforts on other
      jurisdictions. Penalties fell into three categories:

      •	 Permanent deductions, for specific compliance failures

      •	 Specific suspensions, which applied until predetermined conditions were met

      •	 Pool suspensions (which could be recouped), which applied to groups of compliance
        failures in nonpriority areas of the legislation review program, but did not warrant an
        individual penalty.




   Overall, the sector reforms and operating and regulatory structures would have been
   less consistent across the states and territories. This is particularly important for sec-
   tors that span states, such as the electricity market and Murray-Darling Basin.


  A component of New South Wales competition payments in 2003–04 and 2004–05 were
withheld in response to the NCC’s assessment that there were shortcomings in the water
resource sharing plans6 (see box 10.2). In 2005, the NCC assessed that New South Wales had
met the resource planning requirements under the National Water Initiative (NWI) and with-
held payments were released. Although causality cannot be shown, this demonstrates the
competition payments and compliance assessment scheme apparently working as intended.

10.2.2. Water-Specific National Reform Agenda
The NCP was not specific to the water sector. Rather, it set a general framework for improv-
ing the contribution of infrastructure to the growth and competitiveness of the national
economy. However, its focus on competition and commercialization was more immedi-
ately relevant to the major urban water suppliers. While SWC and HWC had already com-
menced reform prior to this, the COAG Framework and the NCP reinforced and




Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                               85
           BOX 10.2.   National Competition Council Assessment of Water Sharing Plans


           Over several assessments, the NCC sought evidence that New South Wales’ environ-
           mental allocation arrangements for water in rural and inland basins were based on
           the best available science and that robust socioeconomic evidence supported depar-
           tures from the science-based levels. Under the COAG water reforms, governments
           were to allocate appropriate water to the environment in the stressed and overallo-
           cated rivers. Governments were to substantially complete allocations in all rivers and
           groundwater systems by 2005.

           New South Wales had gazetted 36 water sharing plans that allocated water for
           environmental purposes in the state’s major rivers and groundwater systems. The
           NCC wanted evidence from New South Wales showing it had set extraction limits and
           environmental allocations using the best available science, and that departures to
           recognize the existing rights of other water users were supported by robust socioeco-
           nomic analysis. The NCC judged that New South Wales had not provided the robust
           information required to show its water sharing plans allocate appropriate water to
           the environment.

           The NCC regarded the obligation to make appropriate allocations to the environment
           as a significant aspect of the COAG water reform program. Recognizing that New
           South Wales had deferred some of its plans and that substantial completion of alloca-
           tions was due in 2005, the NCC recommended that 10 percent of the state’s 2004–05
           competition payments be suspended. The suspension was recoverable if New South
           Wales provided (a) robust information to support its current arrangements, or (b) en-
           vironmental allocations within a range of outcomes that could reasonably be reached
           on consideration of the best available science and robust socioeconomic evidence.

                                                                                    ­ ustralian
           In response to the NCC’s recommendations in its 2003 NCP assessment, the A
           government applied a range of penalties to governments’ 2003–04 competition pay-
           ments. The penalties included permanent (irrevocable) deductions and suspensions
           of payments. In response to the NCC’s recommendations in its 2004 NCP assessment,
           the Australian government released most of the suspended 2003–04 payments, in
           addition to applying a range of new penalties to governments’ 2004–05 competition
           payments. In the case of New South Wales, the government suspended payment of
           $A 26 million for noncompliance in water.

                                                                                  box continues next page

      BOX 10.2.   continued


      For the 2005 NCP assessment, New South Wales provided a report and additional
      information, to demonstrate it had addressed its COAG commitments. The NWC
      assessed New South Wales in reference to both: the 2004–05 suspended payments
      based on the evidence it had provided to meet the requirements for recouping these
      payments; and New South Wales’s ongoing water planning activity and consistency
      with COAG commitments as set out in the 2005 NCP Assessment Framework.

      New South Wales was assessed as meeting the majority of its obligations and there-
      fore received its full entitlement for 2005–06. Also the suspended payments ($A 26
      million) were reimbursed to New South Wales in the 2005–06 competition payments
      (total payment of $A 292.5 million).




strengthened these initiatives. There have also been a number of national policies and
frameworks that have guided the development of the policy framework for the sector:

•	 COAG Strategic Framework for Water Reform, 1994

•	 National Water Initiative, 2004,

•	 Australian Drinking Water Guidelines, 2011

•	 National Water Quality Management Strategy, 1994

•	 National Performance Reporting, 2014

•	 National Sewage Quality Management Framework, 2012

•	 National Urban Water Planning Principles, 2008

•	 Enhanced National Urban Water Reform Framework, 2008

•	 National Water Initiative Pricing Principles, 2010


10.2.3. Council of Australian Governments Water Reform Framework 1994
The COAG Water Reform Framework was a strategic framework for the efficient and sustain-
able reform of the Australian water industry. The report was commissioned by COAG at its
June 1993 meeting. Compared to the broader NCP Framework, it was more immediately rel-
evant to the supply of water services outside major urban centers. The report noted that,
while progress is being made on a number of fronts to reform the water industry and to
minimize unsustainable natural resource use, there were these concerns:

•	 Approaches to charging that often resulted in commercial and industrial users of water
  services paying more than the costs of service provision

•	 Major asset refurbishment needs in rural areas for which, in general, adequate financial
  provision had not been made


Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                        87
     •	 Impediments to irrigation water being transferred from low-value broad-acre agriculture
       to higher value uses in horticulture, crop production, and dairying

     •	 Service delivery inefficiencies

     •	 A lack of clear definition concerning the role and responsibilities of a number of institu-
       tions involved in the industry

       The purpose of the water sector reforms was to achieve efficient and customer-oriented
     service through restructuring and reorienting public water utilities. In the New South Wales
     urban water sector, many of these reforms were already independently underway. Not only
     had the New South Wales businesses initiated reforms, but the GPT’s (now IPART) report on
     Water and Related Services (1993) had addressed many of these issues and laid down a set of
     pricing principles and reforms consistent with the COAG Water Reform Framework (GPT
     1993b).7 As such, New South Wales was a leader in the reform process rather than a
     follower.
       The framework embraced pricing reform based on the principles of consumption-based
     pricing and full-cost recovery, the reduction or elimination of cross-subsidies, and making
     subsidies transparent. The framework also involved the clarification of property rights, the
     allocation of water to the environment, the adoption of trading arrangements in water, insti-
     tutional reform, and public consultation and participation.

     10.2.4. National Water Initiative Pricing Principles 2004
     COAG agreed to the NWI as the national blueprint for water reform. The NWI represented a
     shared commitment by governments to increase the efficiency of Australia’s water use, lead-
     ing to greater certainty for investment and productivity, for rural and urban communities,
     and for the environment.
       The NWI sought to revitalize the reforms previously proposed in the NCP in the urban
     water sector. It also signaled a greater commonwealth government role in water policy.
     While much of the focus of the NWI was on rural water issues, for urban water the NWI
     largely focused on completing already agreed reforms. Under the NWI, governments made
     commitments to best practice water pricing including to do the following:

     •	 Promote economically efficient and sustainable use of water resources, water infrastruc-
       ture assets, and government resources devoted to the management of water

     •	 Ensure sufficient revenue streams to allow efficient delivery of the required services

     •	 Facilitate the efficient functioning of water markets, including interjurisdictional water
       markets, in both rural and urban settings

     •	 Enact the principle of “user pays,” and achieve pricing transparency regarding water stor-
       age and delivery in irrigation systems as well as cost recovery for water planning and
       management

     •	 Avoid perverse or unintended pricing outcomes



88   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
  The NWI pricing principles were developed jointly by the Australian government and state
and territory governments to provide a set of guidelines for rural and urban pricing prac-
tices, and to help jurisdictions implement the NWI water pricing commitments in a consis-
tent way.
  By the time that the NWI was established, New South Wales and Victoria8 had been
well  into their reform processes. Both had economic regulators for pricing and had well-­
established “user pays” pricing structures. The water businesses were operating more effi-
ciently, recovering costs, and achieving a return on assets (ROA). The NWI pricing principles
are comprised of four sets of principles, including the following:

•	 Principles for the recovery of capital expenditure, to provide guidance to water service
  providers on asset valuation and cost recovery for urban and rural capital expenditure

•	 Principles for urban water tariffs, to provide guidance for price setting in situations where
  there are monopoly providers and the absence of competitive pressures

•	 Principles for water planning and management, to provide guidance for urban and rural
  water service providers in identifying and allocating the costs of water planning and man-
  agement activities between government and water users

•	 Principles for recycled water and stormwater reuse, to provide broad policy guidance to
  stimulate efficient water use in urban and rural settings no matter what the water source

  The NWI pricing principles draw on the provisions in the 1994 COAG Water Reform
Framework, the 1999 Tripartite agreement, and the NWI as well as the report of the Expert
Group on Asset Valuation Methods and Cost Recovery Definitions for the Australian Water
Industry (the Expert Group). The principles do not prohibit government intervention in
price setting, but require that it be transparent.
  An important feature of the asset valuation recommendations and associated pricing prin-
ciples was the distinction between legacy assets (i.e., pre-existing assets) and new assets.
While full cost recovery of new assets was considered standard, it was accepted that for
various reasons—including use of grant funding, contributions, and inefficient investment
decisions—existing assets could be written down or valued at less than depreciated opti-
mized replacement costs. One way of doing this is to value the assets on the basis of deprival
value, calculated by the net present value of the assets at current earnings. In practice this
has been an important means of managing price impacts of the reform process, without
damaging forward-looking principles of economic efficiency and the financial sustainability
of new investments. One point the guidelines were very clear on was that to avoid double
counting either (a) assets funded by customer contributions (or provided free of charge)
should not be included in the asset base for the determination of prices, or (b) the customer
contributions (in money or kind) should be offset against the allowed regulated revenue.
  The principles for price structures were simple, direct, and based on economic principles.
There should be a two-part price, with a fixed charge and a usage charge. The usage charge

     should be based on the estimate of long-run marginal costs (LRMC), although the methodol-
     ogy for determining LRMC was not specified. The fixed charge should be set to recover the
     difference between the total revenue requirement and the revenue collected from usage
     charges. Locational differences in costs can be signaled in annual charges or up-front capital
     contributions at the time of connection.
       A review of the NWI pricing principles was undertaken in 2010 to ensure consistency
     between the pricing principles and the Commonwealth Water Act 2007, as well as take into
     account any further changes required as a result of COAG water reforms. The Natural Resource
     Management Ministerial Council endorsed the NWI pricing principles on April 23, 2010.

     10.3. Water Resource Planning
     As private participation in the water sector increases, it is important to separate the role of
     water resource planning from the service delivery function. DPI Water is the water resource
     manager in relation to water sharing plans as the water entitlement (property rights) system
     across New South Wales.
       The New South Wales Metropolitan Water Directorate within DPI Water leads a
     whole-of-government approach to water planning for greater Sydney and the lower Hunter,
     and provides policy advice on water industry competition and reform.9 Underpinning this
     approach, the Directorate has developed water plans for Sydney and the lower Hunter.10
       The Sydney Metropolitan Water Plan was first developed in 2004 in response to indica-
     tions the drought was taking hold. The Metropolitan Water Plan intended to balance the
     water use and supply in Sydney over a 25-year period. The Plan was updated in 2006 due to
     deepening drought, and again in 2010 as part of the review cycle. The Plan recognized that
     Sydney faces four significant factors in planning for future water management: population
     growth, drought, climate change, and river health. The Plan is reviewed periodically.11 These
     reviews enable the government to adapt to challenges such as a highly variable climate,
     droughts, climate change, and a growing population, and to update the plan incorporating
     the latest data, techniques, and research. The mix of supply and demand measures is
     adjusted through these reviews to ensure that growth and drought needs are met while min-
     imizing costs to the community. The current plan (2010 Metropolitan Water Plan) concen-
     trates on four major areas: dams, recycling, desalination, and water efficiency. Key initiatives
     from the Plan include:


     •	 27 Recycling. 70 billion liters of water to be saved through reuse projects by 2015

     •	 Desalination. The Sydney plant commenced supplying water on January 28, 2010

       •	 Current capacity to supply up to 15 percent of Sydney’s current needs (90 billion liters a
         year)

       •	 New operating rules have been established for 2012; the plant will operate at full capac-
         ity and supply desalinated water when the total dam storage level is below 70 percent
         and will continue to do so until the total dam storage level reaches 80 percent


90   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
•	 Water efficiency. Reducing demand for water by households and business (145 billion liters
  a year by 2015)

•	 Water restriction. Simplified water restriction regime for periods of drought

  A major goal of the review of the Metropolitan Water Plan was to analyze the cost-­
effectiveness of various portfolios of water supply and demand options. Several portfolios of
options (under different rainfall and inflow scenarios) were presented to the community and
stakeholders. The findings of the consultation were considered in combination with the
cost-effectiveness analysis, which compared the portfolios based on the cost of providing
water security. The Metropolitan Water Directorate is currently reviewing the 2010
Metropolitan Water Plan.12 Key issues for the current review include the following:

•	 The impact of changes to the information and policies underpinning the 2010 portfolio,
  regarding water supply and demand measures

•	 Identifying the optimal portfolio of water supply and demand management measures to
  secure water in drought and for growth over the next 50 years

•	 Impacts of flood management options at Warragamba Dam on water security

•	 Potential impacts of climate change on long-term water supply

•	 Identifying the community’s values and preferences for securing a sustainable water sup-
  ply system for people and the environment

•	 An assessment of the benefits and costs of a potential variable environmental flow regime
  from Warragamba Dam, to help protect and improve the condition of the Hawkesbury-
  Nepean River

  Historically, HWC has undertaken the water resource planning in the lower Hunter. However,
the Metropolitan Water Directorate has taken over that function and developed the Lower
Hunter Water Plan in close consultation with HWC, government agencies, stakeholders, and the
community. The plan was released in 2014. The Lower Hunter Water Plan sets out a strategy to
ensure sufficient water to supply the people and businesses of the region. The plan proposes to
use water efficiency, demand management options, recycled water, rainwater and stormwater,
and temporary desalination to address water security during severe drought conditions.
  An annual monitoring and evaluation process supports reviews of the Lower Hunter Water
Plan. This ensures it can adapt to changing circumstances and meet the ongoing needs of the
lower Hunter community, providing water security during drought and reliable water sup-
plies for business and population growth.
  Through these water plans, the New South Wales government has developed a compre-
hensive policy for managing urban water in Sydney and the lower Hunter. It is using an adap-
tive planning approach, with a major review including stakeholder consultation undertaken
by an expert panel every four years. IPART, as the economic regulator, will need to consider
the implications of this Plan in upcoming price reviews for SWC, WaterNSW (for the Sydney
catchments) and HWC.

     10.4. Drinking Water Standards
     The SCA (now part of WaterNSW, the major statewide owner and manager of bulk water
     storage and supply) was established in 1999 following a series of boiled water alerts in
     Sydney during 1998. The SCA was responsible for the bulk water function. At the time, there
     was debate as to whether this would confuse accountabilities, but the separation is now
     accepted. Drinking water standards currently provide a catchment-to-tap approach to pro-
     viding safe drinking water. The standards in New South Wales are set and monitored by the
     Department of Health. SWC and HWC manage water quality through their regulatory frame-
     works, drinking water quality results, Drinking Water Quality Monitoring Program, and inci-
     dent and enquiry process.
       The operating licenses establish the monitoring, reporting, and incident management
     requirements for the utilities. Under their operating licenses, SWC and HWC are required to
     comply with the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines 2011 (published by the National Health
     and Medical Research Council and the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council).
     These guidelines ensure drinking water quality by specifying health-based and aesthetic cri-
     teria for assessment, as well as a multiple barrier approach for preventative measures from
     catchment to tap to ensure safety of the water.13
       Both SWC and HWC work closely with New South Wales Health through a Memorandum
     of Understanding (MOU) to ensure that all current and emerging issues associated with
     drinking water quality are identified and assessed.14 The MOU defines the cooperative and
     regulatory relationships and the performance obligations of each party. SWC’s and HWC’s
     compliance with these drinking water standards is reported through their annual report of
     compliance with the operating license.15


     10.5. Wastewater Discharge Standards
     Wastewater and receiving environment standards are set and monitored by the EPA. It issues
     SWC and HWC with a license for each of its sewage treatment plants. The objectives of this
     license are to require the following:

     •	 Practical measures to be taken to protect the environment and public health from sewage
       treatment plant effluent and sewer overflows

     •	 Proper and efficient management of the sewage treatment system to minimize harm to
       the environment and public health

     •	 No deterioration and continuing improvement in the sewage treatment system’s environ-
       mental performance relative to existing conditions, and minimize the frequency and vol-
       ume of overflows and sewage treatment plant bypasses16

       Compliance with these requirements is reported through the licensing requirements. Key
     issues with the wastewater discharge standards are the cost of carrying out the standards,
     the community’s willingness to pay, and how these two factors align. Increased standards


92   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
may have a significant impact on a utility’s costs. In setting prices, IPART has allowed the
utilities to earn sufficient revenue to enable recovery of efficient costs of complying with the
requirements of environmental regulators. This approach recognizes the role and expertise
of environmental regulators, as well as the suite of regulatory instruments and approaches
potentially available to these regulators and the government in general.
  In 1993, when IPART was concerned about the impact of rising water quality and environ-
mental standards on the costs of services, it established a Cost of Quality Review (GPT
1993b). This inquiry did not have determinative powers, but IPART sought to bring together
various stakeholders to focus on alternative scenarios for water quality and discharge stan-
dards and their implications. One objective was to better determine the costs of meeting
various quality levels, since at the time, SWC felt that the cost of meeting higher standards
was significantly greater than EPA had estimated. The second objective was to make public,
and promote discussion about, the cost of higher standards. The review estimated that the
anticipated standards could result in prices increasing by 25 percent to 30 percent, and rec-
ommended clarifications of the institutional arrangements to set standards based on sound
cost-benefit studies and assessments of willingness to pay (GPT 1993a). The review’s practi-
cal impact is difficult to assess, but arguably the risk of excessive standards was reduced.
  In its review of SWC prices from 2003, IPART did not allow $A 16 million for an upgrade at
the North Head Sewage Treatment Plant, since this was not in line with priorities set by the
EPA of New South Wales. IPART’s consultants expressed concerns that this project did not
meet the EPA’s environmental priorities, and recommended that funds not be allowed for
this project. The review also indicated that SWC did not provide evidence that customers
were willing to pay for the additional environmental improvements associated with this
project.
  IPART considered that SWC had not provided sufficient justification for the expenditure.
IPART acknowledged that the upgrade could facilitate renewal and maintenance of existing
standards, but that these upgrade benefits were not separately identified in the project,
making it difficult for IPART to decide what customers should be expected to pay. In addi-
tion, there appeared to be little evidence that customers viewed these upgrades as a priority,
compared with alternative environmental improvement projects under consideration
by SWC.
  In its recent issues paper for the review of SWC prices, IPART stated that it would not guar-
antee the pass-through of the costs of environmental standards if it didn’t think that they
were reasonable (IPART 2015a). This may strengthen SWC’s resolve to argue against stan-
dards that may impose excessive costs or are not the most cost-effective means of achieving
the desired outcome. This potential financial risk may also stir the interest of Treasury as the
manager of the government’s ownership interest. However, it will create a significant chal-
lenge for IPART if the EPA does raise standards to levels that IPART does not consider appro-
priate. If IPART does not pass through the costs of legally enforceable standards set by the
responsible regulator, it may raise questions as to whether IPART is exceeding its powers and


Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                            93
     seeking to become the de facto environmental regulator, and whether IPART is having due
     regard to the reasonable commercial interest of the service providers.


     10.6. Subsidy Policy
     The delivery of social programs through government businesses is often seen to be a poor
     outcome in policy and commercial terms, since delivery may be impaired by the lack of
     transparency and direct policy supervision. There is no “budget holder” responsible for
     ensuring that the delivery is cost-effective. The focus of a commercialized government busi-
     ness should be on its commercial performance while complying with transparent service
     obligations and standards. Non-costed, non-transparent policy obligations become a conve-
     nient excuse for poor performance. In addition, the misalignment of commercial and policy
     objectives means there is no assurance that programs would continue to be relevant to the
     needs of beneficiaries and to the government’s social priorities. Finally, the approach is inef-
     ficient because the social programs are funded through cross-subsidies, which distort the
     business’s production and investment decisions and consumers’ consumption decision.
       Important progress began when the New South Wales government established the
     Community Service Obligations (CSO) policy in 1994 and required that any non-commercial
     directions to corporatized government businesses must be in writing. Together, these moves
     ensure that any policy direction is transparent and explicitly funded, and that the cost of
     meeting policy directions falls on the government’s budget rather than the water service
     provider. Box 10.3 summarizes the CSO policy framework.
       Under the CSO policy, the New South Wales government should fund the utilities for the
     cost of noncommercial obligations imposed by the government, such as rebates for custom-
     ers on pensions and welfare payments.
       Importantly, the existence of the CSO policy and the classification of rebates for disadvan-
     taged customers as a CSO has meant that IPART’s role has not extended to “social pricing.”
     The New South Wales government, not the regulator, has the role of determining policy
     relating to social programs and any assistance for disadvantaged customers. This is a sound
     principle, but it contrasts with common regulatory practice.


     10.7. Access and Postage Stamp Pricing
     Two key, related issues regarding urban water supply on which the state government has a
     clear and strong policy position are that there should be postage stamp pricing, and there
     should not be any developer charges. Postage stamp pricing means that for all customers in
     the service territory of the utility should pay the same charges. This has been a policy for
     many years under successive governments and was a transparent requirement by the
     government for inquiries into access to SWC’s networks.
     ­
       The policy requires that all residential customers served by SWC pay the same service and
     usage charges, even though the costs of servicing may vary. This is particularly the case for
     wastewater services, in which the costs of treatment depend on the size of the area served


94   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
      BOX 10.3.   Summary of Community Service Obligations Policy


      What are CSOs? CSOs (or social programs) are noncommercial activities with social
      objectives delivered by SOCs. From the government’s perspective, the focus should
      be on achieving desired social objectives, regardless of whether the SOC is the pre-
      ferred delivery vehicle or not.

      Why is a CSO policy important? The CSO policy is a critical component of the strategy
      of commercialization and corporatization. It separates the roles of “purchaser” and
      “producer” of services to the public; ensures competitive neutrality and use of the
      most efficient policy delivery modes; and preserves and reinforces the commercial
      objectives of the SOC.

      What is the process for identifying and approving CSOs? CSOs are identified and costed
      by SOCs and reviewed by the relevant purchasing minister. If the minister considers
      that an existing or new activity or requirement meets the criteria of a CSO, it may be
      assessed for funding through the budget. Approved CS0s will then be subject to the
      same political, parliamentary, and budget scrutiny as all other expenditure proposals.

      How are CSOs funded? Funding will depend on the government’s prioritization and
      budget constraints. If a proposed CSO does not have clear social policy objectives,
      if the objectives are not a government priority, or if it fails to adequately address its
      objectives, it will not be implemented and funding will not be provided.

      How are CSOs implemented? CS0s are specified through formal contracts between the
      Government Trading Enterprise (GTE) and the relevant portfolio Minister to increase
      the transparency and accountability for specification of policy objectives, evaluation
      of options, and delivery of the CSOs.

      How are CSOs costed? CSOs that require additional services to be provided or services
      provided to a higher standard are costed on the basis of avoidable costs (i.e., the
      costs that would be avoided if the services were not provided, including a commercial
      return on incremental capital requirements). Pricing concessions are costed on the
      basis of the foregone revenue or rebate payments.

      How are CSOs reported? In order to ensure adequate public and parliamentary scru-
      tiny, details of all CSOs are required to be published in the annual reports of SOCs.




and the sensitivity of the receiving waters (which impacts on the level of treatment required).
IPART has accepted this policy requirement, and consequently there are cross-subsidies,
predominantly from customers in coastal and inner suburbs to customers in the western
areas of Sydney including areas of new development.
  There are two consequences of this. First, existing customers are subsidizing new custom-
ers on the urban fringe where typically the costs to serve are higher. Second, there are no


Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                               95
     signals of which areas are more expensive to serve. This becomes important in the context of
     new greenfields development on the urban fringe. There are no clear signals that it is more
     economic to develop new housing within areas already serviced or that some new areas are
     more expensive to service than others. Out-of-sequence development can result in invest-
     ment in more infrastructure, such as longer networks or new wastewater treatment facilities
     that will be underutilized for longer periods. Alternatively, it could be that terrain or other
     features make the area inherently more expensive to service. In any case it adds to the costs
     borne by other customers.
       In the mid-1990s IPART created a developer charges policy to address these concerns.17
     Under the policy, developers would be charged an up-front fee for each equivalent lot being
     developed (calculated by the net present value of the cost of assets required to serve the
     development divided by the lots to be served, less the net present value of the net operating
     revenue per lot). Net operating revenue was the difference between annual revenues at the
     standard charges and the operating costs of the water and wastewater infrastructure serving
     the development. This signaled the costs of serving various new development areas, to
     encourage development in areas that are less expensive to serve. Developer charges were
     close to zero for infill development in some existing areas and ranged from $A 15,000 to
     $A 29,000 per lot for major new development areas on the urban fringe. However, following
     concerns about the impact of these charges on the cost of housing in Sydney, the govern-
     ment initially capped the developer charges in 2007 and then eliminated developer charges
     in the Sydney-Hunter regions in 2008.18 This was a transparent policy made to pursue the
     government’s urban development policy objectives, and was implemented via an instruc-
     tion to SWC and HWC to not charge developer charges. In response, IPART allowed the costs
     previously recovered by developer charges to be recovered from annual charges for all cus-
     tomers from the next determinations.
       Aside from the pricing issue, access to improved water and sanitation services is not a sig-
     nificant policy issue in New South Wales. There is virtually 100 percent connection of cus-
     tomers that could feasibly be connection in the major urban areas, and the issues of servicing
     remote communities (especially indigenous communities) is a much more significant issue
     in other states and territories, such as Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern
     Territory. A recent review examining the provision of improved water supply in small (less
     than 150 persons) remote towns in South Australia highlighted these challenges (Willis et al.
     2015). The provision of sustainable water services to remote communities in South Australia
     and elsewhere has been constrained by high delivery costs, low levels of cost recovery, inad-
     equate local capacity or an unwillingness to pay for “improved” levels of service. Two key
     decisions are how services are provided and how they are funded (assuming the services
     cannot be fully funded from user charges paid by the customers served due to small popula-
     tion levels).
       A range of service delivery models are used across and within the states, such as state-
     wide water authorities, local governments, special purpose remote area service providers,


96   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
or specialized providers for indigenous communities, and the local communities. Where
stat-wide, regional, or local government providers are used, services may be funded from
subsidies generated from customers or ratepayers in other communities. The NWI (2004)
recognized that it may not be feasible to service remote communities without some form
of subsidy, and provided support for subsidizing services to these towns through a trans-
parent, budget-funded CSO. However, the guidelines suggest (perhaps optimistically) that
such CSOs should be temporary, where practicable, while governments pursue alternative
service delivery and management arrangements.

Chapter 11   Commercialization and Corporatization

             The New South Wales government began developing a more commercial policy framework
             for its businesses in the mid-1980s. Initially this involved setting clear commercial targets
             and dividends, establishing the government guarantee fee to equalize the cost of debt for
             government businesses with their private equivalents, and increasing the autonomy of the
             businesses. The process accelerated following the Commission of Audit commissioned by
             the Greiner government in 1988, and Hunter Water Corporation (HWC) and Sydney Water
             Corporation (SWC) were corporatized in 1991 and 1994, respectively. Reform was further
             complemented by other policies such as the community service obligations (CSO) policy
             (1994), which provided for the separation of commercial and policy objectives and the
             transparent delivery of social policy objectives on a commercial basis (New South Wales
             Treasury 1994).
               New South Wales drew from New Zealand’s earlier experience with the corporatization
             of its state-owned corporations (SOCs), and from the concurrent commercialization and
             corporatization policies of the Commonwealth and Victorian governments. However,
             unlike New Zealand, New South Wales did not establish a separate shareholding monitor-
             ing unit, and did not separate the policy and shareholder monitoring functions with
             Treasury as cleanly as the New Zealand Treasury did. Furthermore, shareholding ministers
             sometimes also held the relevant policy portfolio, muddying the separation of the owner-
             ship and policy roles.
               The Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) report on the performance of
             the SOCs in 2010 raised these issues and questioned whether the corporatization model
             had  become diluted, recommending a strengthened ownership monitoring function
             (IPART 2010).There are well-founded concerns that corporatization is a potentially unsta-
                  ­ second-best” option requiring constant vigilance. Otherwise, the natural incentives
             ble, “
             will either see it move to full privatization or slip back into less commercial and more politi-
             cally driven modes of operation. Nonetheless, corporatization is more desirable than the
             option of a noncommercial, politically driven entity.


             11.1. Commercial Policy Framework
             The framework was underpinned by five key principles for government-owned businesses:

             •	 Clear objectives. Providing management of government businesses with clear commercial
               objectives (i.e., removing or isolating social and regulatory objectives, which may conflict
               with the commercial objective)

             •	 Managerial authority. Ensuring key internal operating decisions are made by managers
               with strong incentive to maximize the value of the firm (rather than through externally
               imposed controls)




             Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                          99
      •	 Performance monitoring. Subjecting government businesses to rigorous, independent
        monitoring and assessment of financial performance

      •	 Rewards and sanctions. Establishing managerial rewards and sanctions related to
        performance

      •	 Competitive neutrality. Removing the special advantages and disadvantages that apply
        due to government ownership and preventing the abuse of any market power1

        The Commercial Policy Framework arose out of the New South Wales Commission of Audit
      (Curran Report) of 1988. The commission considered that there were major problems with
      New South Wales’s ability to fund services, including that (a) the state had very large unrec-
      ognized and unfunded liabilities for superannuation and other employee entitlements; (b)
      there were rising levels of debt, and servicing this debt placed a drain on the state’s ability to
      provide services to the community; (c) there were rising levels of debt, and servicing this
      debt placed a drain on the state’s ability to provide services to the community; and (d) the
      assets of the state were poorly managed and yielded a low return on investments.
        The Curran Commission of Audit recommended a review of functions to eliminate non-
      core activities, a reduction in debt through asset sales, and increased emphasis on balance
      sheet management. For government businesses, this was to happen through corporatiza-
      tion in order to improve returns from operations. Key messages are that commercial inde-
      pendence in practice falls short of the theory and legislated independence, and good
      monitoring and supervision of corporatized entities requires constant vigilance and a high
      level of skill. Part of the challenge is to protect and maintain a commercial focus and
      independence.
        The primary aim of the policy was to improve the efficiency of government-owned busi-
      nesses. The policy had two stages for improving efficiency. The first stage, commercializa-
      tion, involved administrative changes to the operation and management of businesses along
      the lines of the first four principles. The second stage, corporatization, involved the estab-
      lishment of a corporate governance structure, which paralleled that of a publicly listed
      ­
      company. All five principles of the framework, including competitive neutrality in input and
      output markets, must be satisfied prior to corporatization.
        Corporatization involves the establishment of a legislative framework and corporate gov-
      ernance structure, which mirrors as far as possible that of a publicly listed com-
      pany. This creates the basis for a more separated relationship between the SOC board and
      management, and the government as owner or shareholder. SOCs are incorporated under
      the State Owned Corporations Act 1989. The Act establishes two classes of SOC: company
      SOCs and statutory SOCs. Currently all New South Wales SOCs are statutory SOCs.2
        Statutory SOCs are not subject to the Corporations Law, but the key provisions of the
      Corporations Law have been included in the SOC Act. A statutory SOC is established by an
      Act of Parliament (that is, its enabling legislation). HWC was established by the Hunter Water
      (Corporatisation) Act 1991 and SWC was established by the Sydney Water (Corporatisation)



100   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
Act 1994. The commercial policy framework replicates the disciplines and incentives that
promote efficient commercial practices in nongovernment businesses. It includes the
following:

•	 Governance policies. Guidelines for Boards of Government Businesses; CEO Contract
  Guidelines for Government Businesses; State Owned Corporation Indemnity Policy

•	 Performance policies. Reporting and Monitoring Policy; Capital Structure Policy for
  Government Businesses; Financial Distribution Policy for Government Businesses

•	 Competitive neutrality policies. Government Guarantee Fee Policy for Government
  Businesses; Tax Equivalent Regime Policy for Government Businesses; Social Program
  Policy for New South Wales Government Trading Enterprises

•	 General policies. Guidelines for Assessment of Projects of State Significance; Characteristics
  of a Fully Corporatised Government Trading Enterprise, Community Service Obligations
  Policy

  The fundamental objective of corporatizing the HWC Board and SWC Board was to set clear
objectives, separate social and other responsibilities to be undertaken by the relevant arms
of government, and focus the SOC on providing efficient services for the benefit of consum-
ers and taxpayers (as the beneficial owners). (See Figure 11.1.)
  HWC and SWC were originally corporatized as company SOCs. In 1998, they were made
statutory SOCs under the Water Legislation Amendment (Drinking Water and Corporate
Structure) Act 1998 (New South Wales).
  The key outcome of this change was that the portfolio minister held more power to get
information from, and to direct, a statutory SOC than for a company SOC. While it increased

      the power for the portfolio minister to make such directions, the directions must be in writ-
      ing and made public, making the minister more accountable for the actions of SOCs. One of
      the tensions in the SOC model is the reconciliation of commercial autonomy for the SOC
      with the minister’s accountability to Parliament for the SOCs actions.
        At the heart of the framework is the establishment of clear commercial objectives and bet-
      ter incentives, and monitoring of the corporation’s performance against these objectives.
      One key principle underlying corporatization is a clear distinction between the minister’s
      role in setting broad frameworks within which the corporation should operate, and the role
      of the board.
        The Sydney Water Act requires that the directors have, between them, expertise in busi-
      ness management, protection of the environment, and public health.3 The Hunter Water Act
      provides that, of the eight board members, seven are to be appointed “for their relevant
      expertise” (the eighth is the chair). The legislative framework is intended to provide a level
      playing field for government-owned and private businesses.4 Requiring, for example, envi-
      ronment and public health expertise on SWC’s board in which the equivalent is not required
      for private utilities (or even all public utilities) is inconsistent with that intent. It may be an
      impediment to the SOC’s commerciality if the voting shareholders are hampered in a way
      private sector shareholders are not (IPART 2010). On the other hand, it is important to note
      that the directors are not intended as representatives of any particular interest group, such
      as employees or customers. Their duty is to ensure that in pursuing its charter the SOC is a
      good corporate citizen, and to protect and enhance its commercial interests. Furthermore, a
      private water utility would want to have board members with similar qualifications given
      that failure to comply with health and environmental standards or failure to understand the
      nature of the risks of noncompliance is an existential risk for a water utility.


      11.2. Financial Framework for State-Owned Corporations
      The New South Wales Treasury is responsible for ownership monitoring and establishing the
      financial framework for SOCs. Central to this is the monitoring and reporting framework
      providing agreement on the Statement of Corporate Intent (SCI) between the shareholding
      ministers and the SOC’s Board. The SCI sets out the agreed financial and operational perfor-
      mance targets from an ownership perspective, and includes agreed targets for the return on
      assets and dividends, as well as the financing strategy to ensure the business is financially
      sustainable and provides a commercial return. This is supported by policy statements on
      guidelines for boards and CEOs, financial distribution policies, tax equivalent payments,
      financing and capital structure, and loan guarantee fees.
        The focus is on providing a framework that mimics as closely as possible the governance
      and operating framework of a private sector firm, while protecting the ownership interest
      of the government. As the representative of the shareholding ministers, the Treasury
      agrees on the broad financing strategy with the SOC. Once this is agreed, TCorp (a New
      South Wales government financial SOC) provides debt management services to the SOCs.


102   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
This is comparable to the services provided to private sector firms by banks and financial
intermediaries except that the SOC does not have the choice of who it uses, and must use
TCorp; and TCorp issues debt in its own name, backed by the New South Wales govern-
ment, rather than the name of the SOC.
  As the New South Wales government has an AAA-rating, TCorp can borrow at a lower rate
than the SOCs could if they raised debt in their own name without the benefit of a govern-
ment guarantee (implied or actual). To ensure that the SOCs see the true cost of their debt
and that there is competitive neutrality, the SOC is rated as an independent stand-alone
entity and pays to the New South Wales government a loan guarantee fee equivalent to the
difference between the borrowing cost for an AAA-rated entity and a business with the same
rating as the SOC. Under the monitoring and reporting framework5 the SOC must do the
following:


•	 Prepare a business plan in consultation with New South Wales Treasury that is the basis
  for the annual SCI

•	 Demonstrate a commitment when undertaking corporate planning to achieving financial
  and nonfinancial objectives and targets agreed in the SCI

•	 Sign an SCI, which represents an agreement with the government on the objectives and
  obligations by which the business will operate over the next 12 months and following
  years

•	 Provide quarterly performance reports and other requested information to their relevant
  minister and New South Wales Treasury on behalf of the treasurer

•	 Provide timely disclosure of information which may have a material effect on the value of
  the business, including information which may influence government decisions

•	 Have in place robust internal procedures for capital projects and provide information to
  New South Wales Treasury on major capital projects, including quarterly reports


  The government first established dividend and rate of return (ROR) targets for its ­businesses
in 1986 when it commenced commercialization. The government’s equity in its SOCs has
been built up through initial equity contributions, retained earnings, and asset revaluations.
Dividends provide a return to the government, and taxpayers, in recognition of the opportu-
nity cost of the funds tied up in these businesses. Under the distribution, policy dividends
can be either normal dividends and special dividends, or capital repatriations in exceptional
circumstances.6 The principles underlying the approach in setting the dividend policy are
that: government businesses are expected to make annual dividend payments and the
shareholders’ preference is for a stable stream of annual dividend payments. In addition,
dividend policy is set by negotiation between the shareholders and the board of each
­
business. However, shareholders have the ability to make the final decision on the dividend
policy. The policy is to cover at least three financial years, but is subject to shareholder
approval of the dividend to be declared each year. Dividend target is expressed as a dividend


Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                         103
      payout ratio, i.e., as a percentage of distributable net profit after tax. Finally, the government
      may, from time to time, have specific dividend policy expectations or considerations (includ-
      ing the overall budgetary position) that must be taken into account in setting dividend pay-
      ments for a particular business (or group of businesses). Otherwise a dividend payout ratio
      of 70 percent is used as the initial reference point in dividend policy negotiations.
        A closely related component of the financial framework is the capital structure policy.7
      In regulating the water businesses, IPART assumes a debt to equity ratio of 60:40. This applies
      to government-owned and private sector water businesses, and is in line with the assump-
      tions used by other regulators. However, the actual gearing ratio is a matter for agreement
      between the shareholding ministers and the water utilities.
        The objective of the Capital Structure Policy is to “ensure that Government businesses
      are financed by an appropriate mixture of debt and equity. The policy outlines a commer-
      cially based methodology for determining an appropriate capital structure and a
      minimum-to-maximum capital structure range for a government business. The methodol-
      ogy establishes surrogate mechanisms that replicate the disciplines and incentives of debt
      and equity markets.”8 For private sector firms, if gearing becomes too high debt providers
      will require higher interest rates or limit the debt provided, and if gearing is too low
      shareholders will be concerned that value is being lost. These incentives are not as direct or
      strong for government-owned businesses, and the policy on debt management attempts to
      correct for this. The policy is intended to ensure these businesses do not hold special advan-
      tages over their private sector competitors. Under the policy, the business must undertake a
      comprehensive capital structure study before agreeing the capital structure limits with the
      shareholding ministers.
        The first stage in determining the capital structure for a government business involves a
      cash flow, based-risk analysis in order to determine the debt capacity of the business.
      This risk analysis involves constructing a model to analyze the cash flows, and undertaking
      sensitivity analysis of the impact of key variables on the cash flows. An outcome of the cash
      flow and risk study is a recommendation for an appropriate capital structure within a
      minimum-to-maximum capital structure range that provides for flexibility given the
      ­
      “lumpy” nature of capital expenditure of many government businesses; the government’s
      preference for a relatively stable stream of total dividends from its portfolio of businesses;
      and the need to allow for contingencies. The range will vary for each government business,
      depending on the volatility of its cash flows and the competitiveness of the market in which
      the business operates. The capital structure and range must also be consistent with the
      maintenance of an appropriate investment grade rating, plus the ability to meet key debt
      service criteria and capacity to finance the approved capital expenditure program through a
      mix of internally generated cash flows and debt.
        While the board is responsible for the management of the utility’s capital structure within
      these limits, TCorp is responsible for raising debt and advises the utility on debt manage-
      ment strategies. TCorp raises funds primarily through bond raisings in local and off-shore


104   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
markets backed by the New South Wales government’s AAA rating. Its debt raising covers
the needs of general government and its businesses. TCorp issues debt of various terms, and
in recent years has recommenced issuing inflation-indexed bonds. TCorp also advises the
utility on appropriate debt management strategies, in terms of the portfolio of maturities,
types of debt and timing of debt raising. However, the utility is ultimately responsible for its
debt strategy, and debt is assigned to the utility based on the agreed strategy.
  Government businesses are required to pay tax equivalents and government guarantee
fees. These payments do not constitute financial distributions, since they represent neither
a return on, nor a return of, the government’s equity investment in the business. Rather,
these payments represent expenses incurred by government businesses determined in
accordance with competitive neutrality principles.
  State government-owned businesses are not subject to commonwealth company tax.
The New South Wales government introduced tax equivalent payments by its commercial
businesses in the early 1990s, prior to the requirement for such payments under the NCP.
HWC commenced making tax equivalent payments in 1991/92 and SWC in 1992/93. Over time,
the calculation of tax equivalents has become more sophisticated to better approximate the
payments that would be made by private sector businesses.9
  The Loan Guarantee Fee was introduced in 1987 as part of the initiatives to establish a
more commercial, competitively neutral framework for the government’s businesses.
Its objectives were to (a) ensure the cost of debt to the SOC was comparable to the cost of
debt for a private sector business in a similar financial position, facing similar funding needs
and risks; and (b) strengthen the incentive for better financial management.
                                                                                     ­ tility
  IPART sets a benchmark weighted average cost of capital (WACC) meaning that if the u
can lower its effective cost of capital through better management, it retains the benefit.
However, in the absence of the loan guarantee fee, the utility would get not get the full
benefit of better financial management and performance. A private sector firm’s rating and
­
cost of debt is a function of the quality of its management. The guarantee fee seeks to repli-
cate this incentive for a SOC. The guarantee fee is calculated with reference to the business’
stand-alone credit rating; the credit spread on corporate debt with similar credit ratings; the
notional term of the debt (for regulated businesses, this will depend on the Regulator’s
notional debt allowance tenor); and the amount of debt held by the business. All govern-
ment businesses subject to the guarantee fee must obtain an annual credit rating on a stand-
alone basis. The stand-alone credit rating measures a business’ financial standing
independent of explicit or implicit financial support from the government.
  Credit rating agencies undertake assessments that are forward-looking, and therefore
a credit rating of a government business is an assessment of its ability to meet its current
and forecast debt obligations. Where a business’s credit rating changes, no change will
be made to the guarantee fee on historic borrowings. The changed credit rating will be
applicable from the start of the month following the date of the official downgrade or
upgrade.

        While the policy seeks to replicate the debt incentives of a private sector firm that has been
      replicated by other states in Australia, there may be concerns that it imposes guarantee lia-
      bilities on the government and keeps the utility tied to the government. Firstly, it is difficult
      for the government to avoid having a guarantee liability in regard to the debts of its major
      businesses. When the rating agencies look at the rating of the government they look not just
      at the debts and financial position of the budget-funded activities, but that of the govern-
      ment as a whole, including its trading enterprises such as the water utilities. This was the
      case prior to the establishment of TCorp, when the utilities could borrow in their own name.
      In effect, the ratings agencies assumed an implicit guarantee whether or not there was an
      explicit guarantee. The potential impact of allowing a utility owned by the government to
      default on its debts was viewed as unacceptable due to its impact on financial and political
      reputation.
        Second, the constraints on the utilities’ debt levels occur via the requirements to agree
      capital structure limits and investment levels under the capital structure policy and SCIs,
      rather than the requirement to raise loans through TCorp. In this regard, the relationship
      may more closely parallel that of a tightly owned subsidiary rather than that of a widely
      held stock.


      11.3. Sustainability of the State-Owned Corporation Model
      Successfully managing government organizations for the efficient delivery of services
      perceived to have a mix of economic and social purposes has been a long-term challenge for
      governments. To some extent, corporatization is the reinvention and refinement of the ear-
      lier Morrisonian principles,10 under which there was to be a clear separation of the business
      from the minister, with a board appointed for their technical and business competence.
      The government could provide general directions and broad strategic guidelines but barriers
      were created to protect against ministerial interventions in the business. The failure of this
      model in the United Kingdom led Prof. George Jones to advise New Zealand that:


         Britain for over a generation we have experienced corporatization and my conclusion
         is that it does not work… and that NZ really faces a critical choice. It can go in two
         directions. In one direction it can say we need full political accountability for these
         activities, in which case the functions should be put in a department or local govern-
         ment, with the responsibility focused on politicians. If you’re not prepared to select
         that solution, the only choice is the market – full privatisation. E Groom, The Curran
         Report and the Role of the State, Australian Journal of Public Administration, Vol 49,
         No. 2, June 1990, p149.


        In practice, there will be internal pressures to move to privatization. If successful, corporati-
      zation will change the culture within the organization. However, this new culture will conflict
      with the remaining constraints from public ownership. For example, the constraints on



106   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
diversification and the inability to offer share issues and practical constraints on bonuses
may cause internal pressure for privatization. Furthermore, while corporatization seeks to
replicate the governance incentives and performance monitoring systems for private com-
panies, it cannot fully do so. Governments, as owners, are generally poor managers of risks
and the “market” for performance monitoring is far shallower: it is left to Treasury and
Finance, rather than a pool of market analysts competing to provide advice. There is not
the same threat from takeovers to motivate efficient financial management and opera-
tional efficiency. Notwithstanding the efforts to replicate the pressures from debt markets,
lenders may be less vigorous in monitoring the performance of the SOCs because of the
perceived implicit government guarantee. In practice, remuneration of the senior manage-
ment, especially CEOs, is lower in SOCs and will not include share bonuses that are used in
private sector firms to try to better align incentives to the longer term financial interests of
the firm.
  On the other hand, there are always informal channels for actual or implied intervention and
influence by ministers and policy agencies that the SOC may find difficult to resist. The public
often infers a public purpose for businesses such as water utilities, which leads to pressures for
intervention. There will always be groups that disagree with aspects of the SOC’s operation,
leading to political problems. The incentives for interventions also remain, and there will be
opportunities where it is perceived that the SOC could be nudged to deliver better social or
political outcomes at only a small economic or financial cost. Perversely, if the corporatization
is successful in improving performance, the perceived costs of intervention may diminish over
time as memories of past poor performance and its consequences fade.
  This suggests that maintenance of the SOC model requires the establishment of very
strong, well-resourced systems for monitoring and reporting ownership interest, and strong
and effective barriers to ministerial or departmental interventions in the operation of the
SOCs. Even so, while the stability of the model cannot be assured, imperfect implementation
of the SOC model is currently better than its predecessors.
  In New Zealand, most of the government’s businesses were fully or partially privatized.
The government retains a minority interest in Air New Zealand and three energy companies
(Might River, Genesis, and Meridian). The major SOCs it still wholly owns are NZ Post,
Transpower (the transmission grid owner), and KiwiRail. Reviewing evidence on the
performance of the New Zealand SOCs, Irwin and Yamamoto note that “Concerns are often
expressed, however, that the benefits of corporatization are somewhat fragile and that
reforms have not brought all the benefits that privatization would.” (Irwin and Yamamoto
2004, 29) Despite this, they conclude that there is no strong evidence of declines in perfor-
mance of the SOCs over time. This may reflect the resources and rigour applied to supervi-
sion of the SOCs in New Zealand in particular, as Kikeri, Nellis, and Shirley concluded from
a broader international review that “performance improvements have proved difficult to
sustain once the crisis that instigated the reforms has dissipated.” (Irwin and Yamamoto
2004, 19)

      11.4. Status of the State-Owned Corporation Model in New South Wales
      In its 2010 Review of the Productivity Performance of State Owned Corporations, IPART
      found that “the current framework addresses or seeks to address the most important fac-
      tors considered necessary to ensure that state owned businesses have the incentives and
      conditions to operate efficiently, and is based on sound principles. ... [Yet] the current
      arrangements for implementing this framework are not always consistent with these
      ­principles.” (IPART 2010, 67) There are two key issues in the integrity of the SOC model: the
      strength and respect for the barriers to ministerial or department interventions, and the
      strength of the ownership supervision and monitoring.


      11.4.1. Strength of Ownership Supervision and Monitoring
      New South Wales Treasury, on behalf of the shareholders, plays a critical role in monitoring
      and assessing the performance of the SOCs, reviewing short- and long-term business plans
      to maximize business value, and applying managerial rewards and sanctions for perfor-
      mance. How effectively and thoroughly it performs this role, and follows up on poor perfor-
      mance, determines whether this monitoring acts as an effective incentive for SOCs to
      improve. IPART noted that recent structural changes within Treasury had separated its pol-
      icy and budget advisory roles from its shareholder advisory role in relation to the SOCs.
      IPART supported these changes, noting that they would help in accounting for, and prioritiz-
      ing, the conflicting objectives of government as SOC owner (IPART 2010).
        However, to translate these structural changes into improved SOC performance, it is vital
      that Treasury performs both roles thoroughly and actively. For example, in performing pol-
      icy and budget advisory roles, Treasury should focus on the impact of the SOCs’ perfor-
      mance on the state’s finances and economic efficiency. This ensures that regulatory or policy
      proposals involving SOCs and impacting the budget or broader economy are scrutinized in
      the same way as any other proposal affecting other businesses.
        The shareholder monitoring function ensures that all relevant legislation, policies, and
      shareholding ministers’ expectations are clearly communicated, and SOC boards have
      appropriate regard for them. Currently, shareholder monitoring focuses primarily on the
      SOCs’ financial performance. While important, this focus may not adequately capture pro-
      ductive efficiency and additional requirements that SOCs are asked to fulfill. IPART consid-
      ered that productivity and benchmarking analysis should be incorporated into management
      and supervision of the SOCs, by their management or board and New South Wales Treasury
      and shareholders.11 This would require the systematic collection of data on the SOCs’ out-
      puts and inputs, and effort to improve the specification and measurement of these.
      Improved quality of data over time would help SOC management, the board, and share-
      holding ministers agree on what should be produced and how, set practical performance
      targets, and consider the impact of policy requirements and standards on outcomes, costs,
      and performance.

11.4.2. Strength of Barriers against External Interventions
While the barriers to ministerial or departmental interventions have been established, there
are questions as to whether they are fully effective. However, this is difficult to test as the
directions and influences that contravene the SOC principles are unobservable—or at least
intended to be.
  Clear policy directions, such as directions to build the desalination plant, provide rebates
to customers on social welfare benefits, or extend sewerage services to remote customers,
do not contravene the SOC principles as long as the directions are transparent and properly
made, and the costs of delivering these outcomes for the government are fully funded on a
commercial basis. If these conditions are fulfilled, the government becomes another cus-
tomer purchasing services from the utility.
  In relation to rebates to customers on social benefits, these were fully funded by the
government. In the case of the SDP, as provided under the IPART Act, the government
publicly instructed IPART to pass through the efficient costs of building and operating
the SDP. Since all customers of SWC benefitted from the increased water security, it was
appropriate that the customers bear the costs rather than taxpayers. However, the pro-
cess removed the evaluation of the appropriateness of this decision from regulatory
scrutiny.
  In its early operating license for SWC, the government included a license obligation for
SWC to connect to reticulated wastewater services customers that were expensive to service
in this way.12 Alternative systems for managing wastewater were often feasible but less well
accepted by the government and the community. Unlike as it did with the Sydney Desalination
Plant (SDP), the government did not provide a direction13 to IPART to pass through these
costs, and it could be argued that the costs of connecting the uneconomic customers should
have been funded by the government as a CSO. IPART could have chosen not to pass through
the costs on the grounds that the costs of connection were excessive to the benefits. However,
as it was a transparent license obligation that SWC had to comply with, IPART allowed the
costs to be recovered as part of the wastewater charges for all SWC’s customers. The alterna-
tive of requiring connecting customers to pay the full cost of connection, while within the
power of IPART, would have been inconsistent with a transparent policy of the government
on up-front contributions for connecting customers.
  The costs of connecting these customers were small relative to SWC’s total costs, but is
an example of an often difficult and challenging issue for regulators. That is, should the
regulator accept transparent and legitimately made policies of government in setting
prices, even where they may intrude on the discretion provided to the regulator in the
exercise of its power? While not explicitly stated, IPART’s actions in this and other cases
are consistent with its high degree of independence as an unelected delegated decision
maker that should not override transparent legitimately made policies of the elected
government.

        Of greater concern are the nontransparent directions and influences. Although IPART did
      not document specific examples in its report on the performance of the SOCs in 2010, it did
      comment that:


         At a roundtable discussion in December 2009, the SOCs asserted that several addi-
         tional factors affected their productivity. These included government decisions that
         influenced their production choices; internal constraints on improving labor pro-
         ductivity; and the New South Wales Public Sector Wages Policy, which while provid-
         ing overall benefits also constrains the sources from which productivity savings to
         fund wage increases can be found. (IPART 2010, 9)


         Most of the SOCs (excluding those in the energy sector) raised concerns about decisions by
         the Government that affect their production choices and autonomy. Examples include
         procurement and wage policies, and directions issued under the State Owned Corporations
         Act 1989 (the SOC Act). Some SOCs indicated that it was not uncommon for them to receive
         instructions from portfolio ministers on how they should undertake their functions. Such
         occurrences were considered to create tension between the SOC’s accountability to share-
         holding ministers and the portfolio minister …. Some SOCs also asserted that there are
         government constraints and interventions on hiring and firing (including a ’no forced
         redundancies’ policy), and on out-sourcing and in-sourcing, and the conditions and
         types of employment offered. However, this was not the experience of all SOCs, and
         some seemed to be more subject to government involvement than others. These SOCs
         put the view that any substantial improvements in productivity are contingent on being
         able to make decisions on such matters. For example, outsourcing may not only provide
         a way of managing skills shortages and reducing costs, but it facilitates changes to busi-
         ness practices and allows internal staff effort to be re-directed towards strategy and
         planning, rather than on service functions that could equally be undertaken by others.
         Crucially, they considered that such constraints on authority made it difficult to create
         high performing cultures. (IPART 2010, 66–67.)


        Anonymous reporting reinforces the nature of the problem, and this issue is not unique to
      New South Wales. IPART identified this as a weakness in the implementation of the SOC regime
      and recommended that the government strengthen the autonomy of the SOCs. An important
      element was the recommendation that the government establish a minister for SOCs who
      would be on the board of all the SOCs, and who had joint responsibility with the treasurer for
      monitoring the performance of the SOCs and protecting the government’s ownership interest.

Chapter 12   Increasing Role for the Private Sector

             Private sector participation in the water sector is increasing, initially sparked by an unsuc-
             cessful proposal for access to Sydney Water Corporation’s (SWC’s) wastewater network,
             which gave rise to the Water Industry Competition Act (WICA). This act set out the rights and
             conditions for private suppliers of water and wastewater services, and most of the 22 private
             service providers licensed under WICA have revolved around the provision of recycled water
             for commercial and residential developments. The largest increase in private participation
             in the sector came with the sale of the SDP to the private sector. This sale may increase the
             opportunities for greater private sector participation in the future, since it has removed one
             of the important barriers: constraints on access to bulk water supplies.


             12.1. Development of Private Participation and Competition
             In 2004, Services Sydney, a private company, sought to become a competitor with SWC as
             a provider of sewage collection and treatment services.1 Services Sydney planned to provide
             a sewerage retail, collection, and disposal service to end use customers, using SWC’s net-
             work, and extract the sewage before the sewage treatment plants to use in its production of
             recycled water.
               In 2005, under the Trade Practices Act, Services Sydney successfully applied to have the
             North Head, Bondi, and Malabar sewerage networks declared.2 This meant that SWC was
             compelled to allow Services Sydney and others to seek access its reticulation networks.
               SWC and Services Sydney could not reach an agreement on the access-pricing methodol-
             ogy, and it was referred to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)
             for arbitration in 2006 (ACCC 2007). The ACCC determined largely in favor of SWC’s proposed
             retail, minus avoidable cost approach to determining access prices (ACCC 2007). This access
             pricing approach was consistent with the retention of postage stamp pricing. Services
             Sydney has since abandoned its plans to compete with SWC.
               Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal’s (IPART’s) role in the Services Sydney pro-
             cess was limited. Under the legislation at the time,3 Services Sydney made its applications to
             federal bodies: the National Competition Council (NCC), the Australian Competition Tribunal,
             and the ACCC under the National Access Regime. However, in 2005, IPART was directed by
             the New South Wales government to review and provide advice on pricing principles and
             alternative arrangements for the delivery of water and wastewater services in the greater
             Sydney region, including possible private sector involvement (IPART 2005a).
               This review was conducted in the context of the Services Sydney access application. It was
             also carried out amidst concerns about Sydney’s water supply and demand balance. IPART
             recommendations from this review were aimed at increasing the scope for competition, pri-
             vate sector involvement, and innovation in the water industry. IPART was particularly
             focused on the potential for competition to promote innovation in the development of new
             water supply sources (IPART 2005a).


             Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                       113
        IPART reported on the alternatives for the provision of water and waste water services in
      the greater Sydney region. IPART found efficiency could be enhanced and more innovative
      solutions forthcoming if more work was contracted out by SWC, and if third parties were
      encouraged to access the trunk network to supply competitive services (IPART 2005a).
      IPART also considered how private sector involvement might affect the present system of
      uniform pricing for water across the Sydney region, and whether the access regime might
      lead to selective service whereby the private sector had an incentive to service only those
      clients whose service costs were relatively low.
        There were two key elements of IPART’s recommendations. First, IPART recommended
      greater and more effective use of outcomes-based competitive procurement by water
      authorities, particularly in relation to additional water supplies. Second, IPART recom-
      mended a regime allowing open access to monopoly infrastructure. Under this regime, new
      entrants could seek access to the incumbent’s monopoly water or wastewater transportation
      networks in order to compete in upstream or downstream services (e.g., wastewater treat-
      ment and retail services) (IPART 2005a).
        The New South Wales government responded to that IPART report; the new WICA 2006
      requires the natural monopoly elements of the major water utilities to be opened up and
      accessed by other parties, and provides a licensing regime for nongovernment utilities.
      These other parties, subject to certain conditions being satisfied, are then free to market a
      range of services to their customers, and customers will be free to choose their water service
      provider. The water service providers will have to pay for any transportation services pro-
      vided by the incumbent infrastructure owner, but will be free to develop products and ser-
      vices desired by consumers, subject to regulatory requirements. The increment earned on
      the value added services will, of course, be retained by the new service provider.
        WICA commenced on August 8, 2008,4 and allows private operators to provide services in
      competition to SWC. To date there has been no third-party access, and competition has been
      limited to a number of small-scale schemes, as was expected.
        WICA seeks to harness the innovation and investment potential of the private sector in the
      water and wastewater industries, while also ensuring the continued protection of public
      health, consumers and the environment. The purposes of the act are to establish (a) a third-
      party access regime, to enable new entrants to access existing water and wastewater infra-
      structure; and (b) a licensing regime, to ensure that private providers of water, wastewater, and
      recycled water services protect public health, the environment, and consumers.5
        The licensing regime is complementary to, but distinct from, the access regime. That is, it
      is possible for a new entrant to be licensed to operate infrastructure or provide retail services
      without necessarily requiring access to the incumbent utility’s infrastructure services (e.g.,
      through operation of a standalone wastewater treatment or recycled water supply system).
      To date, many of the WICA licensees have relied on purchasing “wholesale” water or sewer-
      age services from SWC and Hunter Water Corporation (HWC). That is, they are purchasing
      a  bundled product, for example a bulk water, treatment and transportation package


114   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
(rather than just transportation, which would occur under access), to then on-sell to end-
use consumers. The access regime has thus been by-passed, to date. According to the pricing
principles for the access regime for any infrastructure service, the price of access should do
the following:

•	 Generate expected revenue for the service that is at least sufficient to meet the efficient
  costs of providing access to the service, and include a return on investment (ROI) com-
  mensurate with the regulatory and commercial risks involved

•	 Allow multipart pricing and price discrimination when it aids efficiency

•	 Not allow a vertically integrated service provider to set terms and conditions that discrim-
  inate in favor of its downstream operations, except where the cost of providing access to
  other operators is higher

•	 Provide incentives to reduce costs or otherwise improve productivity6

  These principles must be implemented in a manner that is consistent with any relevant
pricing determinations for the supply of water and the provision of sewerage services,
including where applicable the maintenance of postage stamp pricing (that is, a system of
pricing in which the same kinds of customers within the same area of operations are charged
the same price for the same service).7 A corporation (other than a public water utility) must
obtain a license to (a) construct, maintain, or operate any water industry infrastructure;
(b) supply water (potable or nonpotable); or (c) provide sewerage services by means of any
water industry infrastructure.
  The Metropolitan Water Directorate has undertaken a periodic review of the WICA
(2006).8 In response to the review, extensive changes to the WICA licensing framework
were recommended and passed by the New South Wales Parliament in October 2014, pub-
lished as the WICA (Review) Act 2014. The amended act will focus the licensing regime of
utility-like schemes, provide entity-wide licensing, remove barriers to entry for the private
sector, strengthen customer protections, ensure penalties reflect activities being regu-
lated, and provide review and appeal provisions.9 The amended WICA was scheduled to
commence in mid-2016, however this has been delayed.10 The Water Industry Competition
(General) Regulation 2008 (WIC Regulation) is currently being revised to reflect amend-
ments to the WICA.


12.2. Benefits of Competition
Competitive markets deliver better outcomes for customers than regulated markets. In a
competitive market, suppliers strive to win customers by lowering costs or providing a bet-
ter product, in terms of quality, price and timeliness. Where the market is not open to com-
petition, economic regulation can restrict the power of suppliers by limiting their ability to
extract monopoly rents from customers, and drive ongoing productive efficiency. However,
it is difficult for regulators to achieve the allocative and dynamic efficiency and innovation


Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                        115
      of competitive markets. That said, competition should not be introduced without reason.
      It should occur only where competitors are more innovative or have lower cost structures
      than the incumbent.
        There are a number of benefits of allowing for competition in the water sector. These
      include technological innovation, and new solutions and business models; reduced capital
      expenses (CAPEX) requirements for SWC; and accelerated development and connection of
      new areas, and reduced costs.
        Increasing the scope for competition, private sector involvement and innovation in the
      industry will create a more dynamic market, in which private sector participants compete to
      provide innovative water and wastewater services that meet customers’ needs.


      12.3. Challenges Arising from Competition
      Establishing a regime to facilitate competition also creates a number of challenges.
      Impediments to establishing a competitive environment include variations in license condi-
      tions and noncommercial obligations, postage stamp pricing and cross-subsidies,11 and
      absence of an adequate access pricing regime.


      12.3.1. License Conditions and Noncommercial Obligations
      Distortions or barriers to competition can arise from differences in license conditions and
      noncommercial obligations that may be imposed on government-owned utilities. Where
      this imposes costs on or creates opportunities for the utility that the private provider would
      not also face, it distorts competition and can result in inefficient entry of new service
      providers.12 For the government, new entry can reduce its capacity to achieve its policy
      objectives. In principle, the license conditions for public and private service providers
      should minimise disadvantage for one provider type over another. In practice this can prove
      to be very difficult.
        For example, previous license conditions on SWC included obligations on water efficiency
      and greenhouse gas reductions that would not apply, or would be difficult to apply, to mul-
      tiple smaller-scale service providers.13 There are also obligations for supply that apply to the
      government water utilities but not to new private entrants. With the framework elements of
      competitive neutrality in place (a sound Community Service Obligations [CSO] policy and
      transparent, independently administered licencing arrangements), the challenge is to ensure
      that (a) the license conditions are comparable for all providers, notwithstanding the differ-
      ences in size and market position or the incumbent government-owned utility and the new
      entrants; and (b) that the CSO policy covers all relevant noncommercial obligations, and CSO
      payments are equally available to the incumbent and new entrants.


      12.3.2. Postage Stamp Pricing
      Traditionally, water and related services have been charged on a postage stamp basis, under
      which all customers of a water supply authority are charged for services at the same price


116   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
regardless of location. A common price for essential services is commendable from a social
equity viewpoint. Postage stamp pricing is generally preferred because it is transparent,
ensures equity to all similar customers, and is simple to administer. However, postage stamp
pricing also hides the true costs of providing service to different customers and thereby
gives rise to hidden cross-subsidies (Frontier Economics 2008).
  Postage stamp pricing is current government policy. This is reflected in the WICA, where the
principles of access pricing must be consistent with maintaining postage stamp pricing.14
However, IPART has suggested that postage stamp pricing, combined with the removal of
cost-reflective developer charges for water and sewerage services in Sydney and the Hunter, has
impeded competitive entry (IPART 2014). This is because most areas of potential entry are on the
urban fringe and have higher than average costs of service. The incumbent is able to service
the growth area at the postage stamp price, using its large customer base to subsidize growth
expenditure, while new entrants must recoup all their costs through charges to new customers.
  The challenge for IPART is to maintain postage stamp pricing while limiting exploitation of
resulting arbitrage opportunities. IPART proposed to price regulation for wholesale services
provided by public water utilities to wholesale customers who then on-supply services to their
own end customers through a retail minus approach (IPART 2016a). This approach is also called
the “efficient component pricing rule,” and in principle addresses the problem where access to
the existing network is required. However, it does not prevent distortions of postage stamp
pricing where the alternative solution does not require access to existing infrastructure.

12.3.3. Access Pricing Regime
Competition requires an effective access regime, as in many cases the competitor will require
access to existing water or wastewater networks. Pricing arrangements under this regime
need to be clear, so potential competitors can assess their opportunity to compete in the
market. Access pricing, which allows new entrants and existing public utilities to compete on
equal terms, is only one part of the solution for facilitating competition in the water industry.
The WICA prescribed a number of principles for access pricing in which the price of access
should the following:15

•	 Generate expected revenue that is at least sufficient to meet the efficient costs of provid-
  ing access to the service, and include a ROI commensurate with the regulatory and com-
  mercial risks involved

•	 Allow multipart pricing and price discrimination when it aids efficiency

•	 Not allow a vertically integrated service provider to set terms and conditions that discrim-
  inate in favor of its downstream operations, except where the cost of providing access to
  other operators is higher

•	 Provide incentives to reduce costs or otherwise improve productivity

  To retain the current postage stamp pricing arrangements for retail services, and provide a
relatively simple and inexpensive approach to facilitating access, IPART recommended in

      2005 that access to water and wastewater infrastructure be priced according to the Efficient
      Component Pricing Rule (ECPR) (IPART 2005a).

      12.3.4. Privatization of the Sydney Desalination Plant
      In 2011, the government decided to privatize the Sydney Desalination Plant (SDP). This pro-
      vided an opportunity to promote competition by enabling SDP to sell to other suppliers. The
      key risks for potential buyers were the recovery of energy costs and the impact of the oper-
      ating rules. Potential buyers needed certainty on the recovery of costs if not operating, and
      recovery of shutdown and start-up costs. This would have been more accurate through the
      contract with SWC, but the government asked IPART to set the price. IPART’s Terms of
      Reference for the review of the price required it to ensure that the SDP was indifferent to
      whether it operated or not (if it is available). This was controversial, but reasonable and
      sensible. It reflected the contractual basis for similar privately owned facilities, such as the
      power purchase agreements for independent power producers. It meant that the SDP did not
      bear climate risk or the risks of changes to the rules established by the government for when
      it should operate.
        IPART undertook its standard building block cost analysis to set the Annual Revenue
      Requirement (ARR). Setting the regulatory asset base (RAB) was not controversial, since
      IPART used actual cost rolled forward. With the exception of electricity costs, operating
      expenditures (OPEX) were also not controversial.
        Benchmarking of existing electricity contract costs led to a small reduction in costs. This
      left the SDP subject to benchmarking risks in future. Initially the decision also left the SDP
      fully exposed to price risk when reselling electricity back to the market in periods of
      shutdown. This was unsustainable, since it exposed investors to too great a risk so, in accord
      with the terms of reference for the SDP price review issued to IPART by the New South Wales
      government, IPART added a mechanism to carry-forward 90 percent of gains and losses in
      excess of 5 percent of energy contract values to the next determination. The calculation of
      the WACC was also controversial. Declining interest rates had reduced the WACC relative to
      normal long-term levels and investor expectations. IPART set the WACC at 6.7 percent (real
      pretax), which was near top of range and closer to long-term averages. The WACC and risk
      allocation was acceptable but not overly generous for bidders. The SDP was sold for
      $A 2.3 billion, which, at 1.15 times the RAB, was consistent with other successful privatiza-
      tions.16 Following the sale, SWC retired $A 1.8 billion in debt17 and made a special dividend to
      government of $A 126 million (SWC 2013).

Chapter 13   Water Scarcity and the Construction of the
             Sydney Desalination Plant

             Australia’s relatively low rainfall and prolonged periods of drought create concerns that
             major urban areas may face water shortages. During the Millennium Drought of the early
             2000s, storage levels in Sydney fell to below 40 percent.
               The major reform in water security came through the construction of the Sydney
             Desalination Plant (SDP) in 2010 as an insurance scheme to provide additional water when
             dam levels fall below designated levels during extended droughts.1 This has substantially
             reduced the risk of severe water scarcity and provides a potential source of bulk water for
             new retailers. It also directly and indirectly increased the private participation in the sector
             and the scope for competition. The SDP was subsequently privatized, with the option of
             supplying water to bulk customers other than the Sydney Water Corporation (SWC). The
             easing of water scarcity risks indirectly led to the review and proposed removal2 of the
             requirement in the Water Industry Competition Act (WICA)3 for new entrants to source their
             water from new additional sources (Metropolitan Water Directorate 2014).
               This section discusses the water scarcity issue and the government’s response, which ulti-
             mately led to the construction of the SDP. Other states, such as Western Australia and
             Victoria, also built desalination plants in this period, and the decision to commit to desalina-
             tion options are compared. It also considers alternatives such as scarcity pricing. The
             increased role for the private sector is discussed in the next section.


             13.1. Water and Scarcity
             Average water consumption in Australia is among the highest in the world, with total con-
             sumption growing, while rainfall is relatively low and variable. In periods of drought,
             water levels fall and the probability of water shortages rises, thus the scarcity value of
             water increases. Periodic droughts are a feature of Sydney’s climate and have helped to
             shape the current water supply system. Over the past 130 years, Sydney has experienced
             three severe droughts: in the 1890s, the 1940s, and the early 2000s. The most recent
             drought has been referred to as the Millennium Drought and lasted from late 1996 to mid-
             2010 (see figure 13.1).4
               Despite large water storages, water security remains vulnerable. The water storages that
             provide water to Sydney are 2,581,749 ML.5 At an average annual consumption of 515,834 ML
             (SWC 2015), Sydney could survive only five years without rain. Sydney has experienced sig-
             nificant droughts in recent years that have put stress on the supply system, resulting in
             increasingly tight restrictions on water use.
               Setting usage charges at Long-run marginal cost (LRMC) provides the right long-term sig-
             nal, but not necessarily the best short-term signal. Possible responses to the threat of water
             scarcity due to droughts include one or more of the following: usage restrictions and

                                                             In principle, the price of water should be the greater of the cost to produce the water or its
                                                             scarcity value. The scarcity value is the cost consequence of a shortage of water times the
                                                             probability of shortage. As water storage levels fall, the probability of water becoming scarce
                                                             rises; hence the price of water should rise as dam levels fall. Grafton and Kompas (2007)

      are skeptical about the short-term demand response; (c) customers prefer water restrictions
      over scarcity prices; and (d) questions over whether water scarcity is a problem given the
      desalination plant is available but not being used. It is also worth noting that, in the absence
      of tradable water entitlements or setting a price to achieve a given outcome, any scarcity
      price  would be administratively set (i.e., not set by the market), which undermines the
      benefit and rationale of scarcity pricing.
        The problem of what happens to surplus revenue can be resolved. WaterNSW,8 the main
      bulk water supplier to SWC, proposed an approach that would address these concerns:
      WaterNSW would sell water to SWC on a two-part rate, a fixed plus a variable charge, with
      the variable charge set at their small marginal operating cost. An additional variable scarcity
      premium would be triggered when dam levels fall below a predetermined level. Furthermore,
      the funds from this scarcity premium would not be retained by WaterNSW. Instead, the
      funds could be transferred to the government to fund water efficiency programs or trans-
      ferred to SWC to offset the effects on customers’ prices while retaining the price signal on the
      value of water.
        IPART did not accept this proposal, due to concerns about customer acceptance of scarcity
      prices and if demand would respond in the short term (IPART 2008). The decision to build
      the SDP further reduced the need for scarcity pricing by reducing the risk of severe water
      shortages. As a result of IPART’s 2016 determination of SWC’s prices, its prices to end-use
      customers will increase when SDP is “on” (and hence will vary to some extent with dam
      levels and scarcity) (IPART 2016b).


      13.1.3. Decision to Build the Sydney Desalination Plant
      In the early 2000s, the South East of Australia experienced a long period of drought. Even
      though Australian cities relied on large dams for their water supply, this long drought meant
      that water suppliers still struggled to meet the demand for water. As a result, most of the
      major urban cities in Australia committed to desalination plants to supplement water
      supply. In 2005–06 the New South Wales government reviewed Sydney’s water supply
      (Institute for Sustainable Futures 2006). The underlying demand for water was rising.
      Droughts were growing longer and rainfall was more variable and lower than the long-term
      average. This was consistent with the expected outcomes of climate change. Hence, secu-
      rity of supply was falling and extra capacity was needed. The review recommended a
      desalination plant as part of a diversified approach to supplying water to Sydney. The
      review recognized that Sydney dam levels were down to 40 percent to 45 percent for much
      of 2005–06. However, no commitment should be made to constructing a desalination plant
      until storage levels fell to 30 percent.
        Figure 13.3 shows the dam storage levels from 2001 to 2010. In November 2006, water stor-
      age fell to 38 percent of capacity. Although this was historically low, it was still above the
      specified trigger point of 30 percent. However, at this point the government directed SWC to
      build the SDP. Construction began in 2007 and SDP’s first drinking water was delivered in

                                            ate  water security risks: an insurance policy for water security, intended to be used
                                            ­occasionally.10 Ironically, once the commitment to this large and somewhat inflexible insur-
                                            ance policy was made, the rains came and dam levels rose to over 50 percent.
                                              Although initially owned by SWC, the SDP contracted Veolia to operate and maintain the
                                            plant. In 2012, the SDP was privatized under a 50-year lease on the plant backed by a 50-year
                                            water supply contract with SWC for $A 2.3 million. The SDP operates only when water levels

      13.1.4. Comparison with Perth and Melbourne
      The decision to build a desalination plant contrasts with the approaches adopted in Perth
      and Melbourne; arguably, it falls between the two in terms of cost to the community and
      value as a water security insurance policy. Perth delivered two smaller scale plants on time
      and on budget, while a plan for desalination in Melbourne was developed within four months
      and led to issues. Porter (2013) identified three related factors in the two experiences: the
      approach to planning, institutional structures, and political involvement.12
        Plans for desalination in Perth commenced in 1999. Originally it was intended to be built as
      a contingency option if inflows were low enough to trigger an emergency drought response.
      The Water Corporation of Western Australia developed a plan for desalination employing trig-
      ger points and contingency planning for both the scale and timing of the implementation of
      desalination. In Western Australia, there was strong evidence of trending decline in inflows.
      On the other hand, Porter (2013) argues that inflows in Melbourne appeared to be random,
      yet Melbourne responded to declining storage levels before there was adequate evidence of
      a long-term decline in resources. The Melbourne plan to build the desalination plant was
      developed quickly over four to six months. This resulted in inaccurate cost estimates, lengthy
      delays, and significant budget overruns.
        The Water Corporation’s approach, based on trigger points and contingency planning, gave
      it time to adjust the plan prior to construction and as further flow information became avail-
      able. As a result, the plant was increased from 30 GL to 45 GL. This approach also meant that
      planners were not responding to record low inflows until more information on the continuity
      of those inflows was available.
        The Water Corporation in Perth is a vertically integrated utility, while the water utilities in
      Melbourne comprise Melbourne Water and three disaggregated businesses. Porter (2013)
      argues that the vertical integration in Western Australia made water planning easier. In con-
      trast, the disaggregation in Victoria meant that no single organization took responsibility for
      water planning. This created an opportunity for greater trading of water across different
      sources to optimize usage, however this opportunity was not tapped.
        The varied structure of the industry also led to differences in political involvement in
      water planning. Under the delegated planning framework in Perth, Water Corporation initi-
      ated plans for desalination with advice and briefings to the premiers. Whether it be the
      structure or level of confidence in the agency undertaking the planning, there was less polit-
      ical involvement in the decision making in Western Australia. Triggers were established
      through the planning process, and decisions reflected these triggers. In contrast, there was a
      high degree of political involvement in Melbourne, at all stages of the planning process.
        The experience in New South Wales shares some aspects of both the Perth and Melbourne
      experiences. SWC was not vertically integrated, with the bulk water supply separated,


126   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
but  the Water Directorate was responsible for planning. The planning process was more
extensive than in Melbourne and resulted in clear trigger points for decisions, as in the
Western Australia planning process. However, in the face of declining dam levels, Cabinet
committed to the SDP prior to the trigger points being reached.


13.1.5. Implications for Prices
The SDP had important implications for prices: (a) average prices increased to cover the
costs of the plant; (b) use of scarcity pricing was diluted, but prices now vary to a small
degree with dam levels; and (c) the long-run marginal cost (LRMC), used to set the usage
charge for water, has been reduced, raising questions as to whether long-term rising usage
charges should be reversed. The SDP has different costs to water provided to SWC by
WaterNSW. Unless catered for in SWC’s water prices, this can have an effect on SWC’s
profitability.
  In normal circumstances, the question of whether to pass through the costs of the SDP into
prices would have been a difficult one for Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal
(IPART). It would have had to consider whether the decision to commit to the plant was best
given the information available. Commitment to the SDP was a controversial decision, and for
many people the near-immediate and enduring increase in dam levels was evidence of a
flawed decision. However, the regulator cannot use hindsight; at the time of the decision there
were genuine concerns about the security of supply. The other complicating factor for IPART
was that the New South Wales government controlled the decision to invest, rather than SWC.
The regulator cannot hold the utility accountable for a decision made by another party.
  However, IPART was spared from these issues, and the public was not able to examine the
merits of the decision through the price review process. In June 2007, the New South Wales
premier and minister requested IPART to reopen the existing price path to include the efficient
costs of the SDP and recycling schemes. The New South Wales premier used his powers under
section 16 of the IPART Act to direct IPART that it could test the efficiency of costs in the review,
but not examine the decision to invest nor the timing and scale of the desalination plant.
  IPART revised the building block analysis, adding in the cost of the plant and updating
parameters such as weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and demand forecasts. IPART
engaged Halcrow to review the efficiency of costs, and subsequently assessed the costs asso-
ciated with the SDP plant as efficient (IPART 2008). Initially, IPART did not establish a sepa-
rate price for SDP. Instead it rolled the costs into general water service costs, recovered by a
higher usage charge. As a result, the average residential bill increased by $A 275 (more than
33 percent) over the four years to 2011–12, with $A 118 attributed to the SDP (IPART 2008).
Since 2012, SDP prices have been separate.
  The SDP has not eliminated the risk of water shortages or the need for restrictions, but it
has reduced the probability of these events and, in particular, the probability of high levels
of restrictions with higher welfare losses. This reduces the benefits and the extent of scarcity
pricing. Furthermore, the structure of prices for the SDP (a fixed charge and a variable charge,


Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                              127
      where the variable charge is higher when the plant is operating) means that the cost of bulk
      water is higher for SWC when the SDP is operating. Initially this variation was not reflected
      in usage charges for end-consumers, but IPART’s 2016 determination provides for usage
      charges to vary depending on dam levels and the operational status of the SDP. IPART
      allowed the pass through of variable costs of $A 0.12 per kiloliter (in 2015–16 dollars) if the
      SDP is operating. IPART estimated this would add an additional $A 26.40 to a typical annual
      residential bill.
        With the construction of the SDP, the estimated LRMC of water supply has fallen, as is
      common in infrastructures with irregular large capacity increments. Construction of
      the SDP was the next step in capacity required, projected to be required in the near term.
      The next increment of capacity required is the expansion of the SDP further into the future.
      Hence, the cost today is lower. This is one of the factors resulting in the lower estimate of the
      LRMC in the 2016 determination. The range for IPART’s estimates of the LRMC was $A 1.11
      per kL to $A 1.62 per kL Prior to the SDP build, the midpoint estimate LRMC was around
      $A 1.90 per kL (2007–08 dollars).
        The lower estimates of the LRMC resulted in some tension between the preferences of con-
      sumers to pay a larger proportion of their bill through usage charges (rather than fixed charges)
      and the strict application of the LRMC pricing rule. In its 2016 determination, IPART chose to
      reduce the usage charge by a smaller amount (from $A 2.28 per kL to $A 1.97 per kL) after con-
      sidering both the preferences of consumers and the uncertainty in the LRMC estimate.


      13.1.6. Lessons for the Future
      It is widely recognized that water security is critically important, particularly for large mod-
      ern cities. One of the lessons from Sydney and Melbourne is that political decision makers
      are less willing to take risks on water security during severe water shortages than assumed
      in the models of economists or planners. Rational planning rules can be established but
      these do not appear to meet the political concerns for absolute water security.
        Reflecting this, the economic merits of the decision to invest in the desalination plants are
      questionable. The indicative figures suggest that, looking across Australia, the total cost of
      desalination exceeds that of the previous restriction’s approach. At the time, decisions were
      made to also build desalination plants in Queensland and Adelaide. The total investment in the
      desalination plants was $A 10 billion (Porter 2013). Assuming a 6 percent real rate of return
      (ROR) and 40-year life, the capital costs alone are $A 850 million dollars. This excludes the oper-
      ating and maintenance costs, costs of electricity when the plants are running, costs of periodic
      replacement of membranes, and costs of shutting down and starting up the plants. By compar-
      ison, the welfare costs of water restrictions had previously been estimated at $A 900 million per
      annum across Australia. Furthermore, although desalination plants reduce the likelihood and
      severity of water restrictions, they do not avoid the need for restrictions entirely.
        One of the key arguments against scarcity pricing is that the community would find it
      controversial and would not accept it. However, the impact of the desalination plants on

prices has also been controversial, considering consumers are paying the costs of these
plants in a long-term shutdown. The analogy of the plants as insurance policies has not been
well communicated to nor accepted by the community.

Chapter 14   Approach to Price Regulation and Licensing

             The Government Pricing Tribunal (GPT) (now Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal
             [IPART]) was established in New South Wales in 1992 to remove politics from pricing elec-
             tricity, water, and transport services provided by the government’s businesses, and to rein-
             force the strategy of commercialization and corporatization directed at improving these
             businesses’ efficiency. Independent economic regulation of utilities subsequently became a
             key part of Australia’s pro-competition microeconomic reform program following the Hilmer
             Report (National Competition Policy Review 1993).1 This led to the strengthened role of the
             ACCC as the national regulator, the establishment of similar bodies in other states, and the
             establishment of a separate national energy regulator, the Australian Energy Regulator
             (AER). IPART’s role became both broader and narrower; broader in that it covered privately
             owned businesses as well as government-owned businesses, and narrower in that a key
             objective was to increase competition and narrow the scope of the core regulated monopoly
             facilities. This section discusses the development of the economic regulation of the water
             sector in New South Wales.


             14.1. Establishment of Independent Price Regulation
             14.1.1. Why Establish Independent Regulation of Government Businesses?
             Almost 25 years ago, the New South Wales government established the first independent
             economic price regulator in Australia. Perhaps the boldness of that step is not fully
             appreciated. IPART was established prior to the Council of Australian Governments (COAG)
             Water Reforms and the Hilmer Report, with their recommendations for the establishment
             of independent price regulation. Importantly, IPART’s focus was on the regulation of prices
             of government businesses, which contrasts with the regulatory environment overseas at
             that time. For example, the United States had a long history of regulation of privately owned
             utilities while Chile and the United Kingdom separately established independent utility reg-
             ulatory bodies as they privatized their utilities. In these cases, taking ministers out of price
             setting was considered necessary for establishing investor confidence.
               The New South Wales government did not link independent price setting to privatization.
             Rather, it sought to remove the abuse of monopoly power and provide incentives for price
             reform and efficiency.2 In effect, the government was saying:

                We (the government) have previously set utility prices and the outcomes have been
                poor. Prices have been highly politicised and under-recovered costs, and the busi-
                nesses have not performed well. We need to take the politicians out of the price setting
                process and entrust the function to an independent agency operating transparently.
                Our role is to set the broad objectives that this regulator must consider. (Cox 2012, 1)

               Independent regulation supported the commercialization and corporatization policies
             aimed at improving the performance of the government’s businesses. By determining prices

             Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                           131
      independently, the regulator would set a hard budget constraint within which the utility
      would have to operate. Furthermore, the utility would keep the benefits of exceeding the
      estimated efficiency savings (at least until paid to the government in increased dividends) or
      bear the losses if it fell short.
        Subsequent to IPART’s establishment, some form of independent economic regulation of
      government utilities has become the norm in Australia, although the roles and powers vary
      between sectors (Frontier Economics 2014). Regulators in the energy sector have had stron-
      ger determinative powers, while the extent of regulation in the transport sector is mixed
      (e.g., airports are subject to price monitoring only). While regulation of access to rail lines
      and ports for commercial transport is common, independent regulation of public transport
      is less common. In the urban water sector, all states other than Queensland3 have some form
      of price regulation for urban water. The jurisdictional regulators in Victoria (Essential
      Services Commission [ESC]) and New South Wales (IPART) have strong determinative
      powers. However, the regulator in Western Australia has merely an advisory role in water.
      This is an area where there is scope for improvement.
        Independent regulation of government monopolies has also become far more common
      overseas, often with the encouragement of international development agencies such as the
      World Bank. One of the expected benefits of this independent regulation is that it is more
      likely to result in pricing decisions that are evidence-based, are consistent through time, and
      promote economically efficient delivery and use of utility services. The community’s expec-
      tations of price regulators can be expressed in simpler, but more demanding terms: fair and
      balanced decisions.


      Price Reform Priorities in Water

      Prior to IPART’s establishment, water pricing had largely been based on property taxes, with
      a free water allowance after which the customer paid a relatively small usage charge. It was
      inefficient from a resource allocation perspective, as customers were not given the incentive
      to manage their water usage. Although HWC introduced usage pricing in the mid-1980s, this
      form of pricing had not been introduced for SWC. Indeed, SWC was a key supporter of the
      establishment of IPART because it had been unsuccessful in past efforts to reform its water
      prices. Thus, among the problems that needed to be addressed were inefficient politicized
      price structures based on a property tax, and usage charges that were too low. As a result,
      small businesses were subsiding households and large businesses. An owner of a small shop
      in Sydney told the Tribunal that it would be “cheaper for me to buy champagne.” In addition,
      there were low levels of cost recovery and inefficiency. SWC covered its operating costs but
      its profits were small. But SWC’s costs were suspected to be higher than necessary. Finally,
      no signals of the regional differences in costs, resulting in cross-subsidies between regions
      and cross-subsidies from existing customers to new customers.
        The context for SWC’s problems was a governance framework that was improving but still
      weak. SWC was more commercial than it had been (e.g., reporting returns and paying dividends),

                                           but it was not yet corporatized with clear commercial objectives. Hence, its efficiency incen-
                                           tives were still weak. Furthermore, the licensing and service standards were not formalized
                                           and the environmental regulatory framework was uncertain.


                                           14.2. IPART’s Powers and Independence
                                           IPART is established under its own act, the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Act 1992,
                                           which replaced the earlier Government Pricing Tribunal Act 1992. Tribunal members are
                                           appointed for fixed five-year terms and appointments can be renewed, but tribunal members
                                           cannot be dismissed except in extraordinary circumstances such as a criminal conviction.
                                           IPART’s employees are employed under the IPART Act with terms and conditions compara-
                                           ble to the New South Wales Public Service.
                                             IPART has a standing responsibility for the regulation of the prices of the major urban
                                           water suppliers, transport service providers, and retail gas suppliers. It is also the license
                                           administrator for the water sector and electricity networks. In addition to these utility regu-
                                           lation functions, it sets local government rates, administers an energy efficiency scheme,
                                           and undertakes other reviews as requested by the government.
                                             IPART’s role in the economic regulation of water is well-defined and relatively narrow.
                                           As shown in figure 14.1, it is largely constrained to the regulation of prices for monopoly
                                           water and sanitation services. While IPART monitors license compliance and advises on
                                                                                 license conditions, it does not set drinking water standards,

      sees water services as having a public purpose, and the pricing of an essential service, such
      as water, raises sensitivities that the prices of other commodities do not. Inevitably, such
      concerns raise social or political issues (in a longer term, nonparty-political sense) that the
      regulators and regulatory institutions must take into account. As Ehrhardt and colleagues
      argue (2007), the challenge is not to exclude politics completely but to create protections
      against time-inconsistent interventions and politicization of decision making, while provid-
      ing a safety valve for transparent interventions in extreme circumstances.
        Under the IPART Act, the government can provide directions that IPART must consider.
      Most commonly, it has used this power in directing a utility to undertake certain activities for
      policy purposes (as provided for under the State Owned Corporations Act), which requires as
      a matter of policy that the costs of these activities are paid for by consumers. The desalination
      plant was an example of this. Except for such written directions, the government may provide
      submissions to IPART reviews but cannot direct its approach to tasks or its decisions
        IPART’s legislation requires it to adopt accessible and transparent processes. IPART is
      required to act with as little formality as possible, and the minimum requirement for each
      review is that IPART must (a) provide public notice of the inquiry and its processes; (b) call for
      submissions and publish submissions received (subject to consideration of confidentiality
      claims); and (c) hold public hearings. IPART has broad information gathering powers, and
      may require utilities and others to provide information that IPART considers necessary for its
      investigations or to attend hearings.


      14.3. Objectives and Processes for Reviews
      Section 15 of IPART Act sets out of a number of objectives that the tribunal must consider in
      determining prices (see box 14.1). The range of objectives was of concern to some stakeholders,
      such as the utilities, because of concerns it may dilute the focus on economic pricing objectives
      and allow the persistence of social pricing. Others, such as consumer and environmental
      groups, consider the breadth of objectives an important protection. In practice, the range of
      objectives reflected the range of perspectives at the political level, which resulted in the dele-
      gation of decision making to an independent body (IPART) with limited guidance.
        There were differing views on whether and how a regulator can effectively limit its discre-
      tion by structuring and prioritizing objectives given to it by Parliament. One view is that the
      range of objectives creates an undesirable level of uncertainty, and that it is appropriate for
      the regulator to structure and limit its discretion by providing guidance on how it will inter-
      pret and prioritise these objectives. An alternative view is that such guidance cannot be
      binding, and that at each decision the tribunal must consider and evaluate decisions against
      all the objectives of the review. According to this view, if Parliament has given the regulator
      a set of objectives and discretionary powers it is inappropriate for the regulator to try to limit
      or preempt how it may exercise its powers.
        From 2007, IPART issued a range of papers that explained how it would consider these
      objectives in its decision-making. The papers covered affordability and equity objectives

      In making determinations and recommendations, the Tribunal is to have regard to
      the following:

      a)	the cost of providing the services concerned,

      b)	the protection of consumers from abuses of monopoly power in terms of prices,
        pricing policies and standard of services,

      c)	 the appropriate rate of return on public sector assets, including appropriate payment
        of dividends to the government for the benefit of the people of New South Wales,

      d)	the effect on general price inflation over the medium term,

      e)	the need for greater efficiency in the supply of services so as to reduce costs for the
        benefit of consumers and taxpayers,

      f)	the need to maintain ecologically sustainable development (within the scope of
        ­
        section 6 of the Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991) via appropri-
        ate pricing policies that account for all the feasible options available to protect the
        environment,

      g)	the impact on pricing policies of borrowing, capital and dividend requirements of
        the government agency concerned and, in particular, the impact of any need to
        renew or increase relevant assets,

      h)	the impact on pricing policies of any arrangements that the government agency con-
        cerned has entered into for the exercise of its functions by some other person or body,

      i)	 the need to promote competition in the supply of the services concerned,

      j)	 considerations of demand management (including levels of demand) and least-cost
        planning,

      k)	the social impact of the determinations and recommendations,

      l)	 standards of quality, reliability and safety of the services concerned (whether those
        standards are specified by legislation, agreement or otherwise [Independent Pricing
        and Regulatory Tribunal Act 1992, section 15]).




(IPART 2010a), environmental objectives (IPART 2011a), and financability (IPART 2011b).
Key points from these papers:

•	 Pricing decisions are not the only (nor necessarily the best) means of managing social
  impacts and ensuring affordable supplies. These goals may be better achieved through
  government policies, such as rebates or direct financial assistance (see figure 14.2).

•	 Transition paths for prices or alternative depreciation profiles may be an effective means
  of addressing price shocks or recovery of costs of additional capacity provided for future
  customers.

                                             •	 IPART’s primary role in promoting environmental objectives is to provide for recovery of
                                                costs of meeting statutory environmental standards and to ensure the regulatory approach
                                                does not create any perverse incentives or obstacles to better environmental outcomes.
                                                IPART has, however, expressed concerns where it considers environmental standards and
                                                policies inappropriate, and in the last determination of water prices it foreshadowed that
                                                it may not pass through the costs of meeting excessive standards.

                                      IPART has used the same ratios as rating agencies and adopted the benchmarks for
                                      BBB/BBB+ ratings (i.e., investment grade securities).

                                    •	 IPART expects that the building block approach to determining revenues will usually
                                      result in commercially sustainable prices. Any shortfall would be temporary, but IPART
                                      has indicated that it may adjust prices to preserve financability however any adjustment
                                      would be NPV-neutral (i.e., offset by lower prices in future periods).

                                      Figure 14.3 summarizes the processes for IPART’s reviews. The transparency of the pro-
                                    cess and the opportunities for public input are key elements. The role of the draft report is
                                    particularly significant in the absence of merit-based appeals. It provides a mechanism
                                    whereby IPART sets out its analysis and proposals, and the utilities and other stakeholders
                                    have the opportunity to challenge these decisions. The final report responds to submissions
                                    on the draft report, and allows for new information that may become available after the
                                    draft report to be included. Minimum requirements for transparency are set in IPART’s
                                    legislation. In practice, IPART has gone beyond the minimum requirements for transparency.
                                    As Jim Cox, (former CEO and tribunal member) emphasized, “at its heart IPART is a trans-
                                    parency agency.”

        The proposed changes in price structures in early water reviews were highly controversial.
      Hence, IPART made considerable effort to engage with consumers through media releases,
      distribution of leaflets explaining issues in terms relevant to, and easily understood by,
      households and small business, and town hall-style meetings in various regional centers.
      Over time, IPART has increased its use of workshops and roundtables to complement the
      formal requirement for public hearings. It sought to make the public hearings less formal,
      more accessible, and more interactive. This reflects its desire to avoid legalistic processes
      and it has avoided the adoption of U.S.-style legal jargon and processes.
        In its early determinations, stakeholders (particularly utilities) expressed concern that the
      cost and financial analyses underpinning IPART’s determinations were not transparent
      enough. It was referred to as a black box approach. From the late 1990s, IPART’s analytical
      approach became increasingly transparent. It adopted the building block approach to deter-
      mination of the revenue requirement and published its financial model. Consultants were
      used to evaluate efficient costs and the terms of reference, and to draft reports of the consul-
      tants published for consultation. This increasingly transparent and certain approach to the
      setting of the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was an important factor in Moody’s
      decision to increase the rating for SWC in 2015 (Moody’s 2015).
        In 2011–12, IPART initiated a review of customer engagement and its role in regulation. The
      review outcomes not only recommended improvements in IPART’s processes but also
      included stronger requirements on utilities to engage with customers in developing pricing
      and service proposals. This is reflected in the increased focus on customer engagement in
      submissions by Hunter Water Corporation (HWC) and Sydney Water Corporation (SWC) to
      the 2016 water price review, which proved to be influential in IPART’s decision on water
      usage charges for SWC.
        While most of IPART’s engagement with stakeholders has occurred in the context of
      the price reviews, it has commissioned approximately triennial surveys of stakeholder
      perceptions of its performance. It has also held occasional forums with stakeholders
      outside price reviews, to discuss its review and research program and issues for forth-
      coming reviews.


      14.4. Evolution in IPART’s Approach to Regulating Prices
      Regulation has evolved over time from a simple, broad approach to a more detailed and
      complex approach. Initially the priority was on removing cross-subsidies and encouraging
      efficient pricing. In the first two price reviews in 1992/3 and 1995/96, IPART assumed that
      relatively large reductions in costs and staff numbers of 20 percent to 25 percent could be
      achieved in each regulatory period. The judgement was based on relatively high-level
      analysis of indicators of relative costs, such as operating expenses (OPEX) to customers
      and employees per customer, which suggested that SWC was comparatively overstaffed and
      inefficient. SWC’s management was largely able to achieve the assumed efficiency gains.
      Indeed, to some extent the assumption of large reductions in costs was self-fulfilling.


138   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
                                      In negotiating reduced employee numbers and other costs with staff, SWC’s management
                                      cited the reduction in revenues due to IPART’s determinations due to the assumed reduc-
                                      tions in costs. Together, the assumed efficiency gains and cash flow approach to determin-
                                      ing revenue needs resulted in real price reductions, which facilitated the structural reform of
                                      tariffs in the first two determinations. It is easier to remove cross-subsidies if the average
                                      price is going down.
                                        One example of increasing complexity is in the estimation of usage charges based on the
                                      long-run marginal cost (LRMC). The initial priority was to remove the tax component of
                                      charges and free-water allowance. In that context, refining the level of the usage charge
                                      based on LRMC estimates was of second-order importance. However, from its 2005 decision
                                      for SWC (IPART 2005b), IPART placed greater emphasis on estimates of the LRMC as the
                                      reference point for the usage charge, and over time the techniques for estimating the
                                      LRMC have become more sophisticated.6
                                        WACC is another example of increasing complexity of analysis. Prior to 2000, IPART’s
                                      focus had been on the cash requirements of the business and broad assessment of effi-
                                      ciency in setting prices. IPART’s approach to calculating WACC was fairly simple. Post-
                                      2000, IPART placed a greater emphasis on commercial returns and investment incentives.
                                      The RAB was locked-in and rolled forward using a defined procedure. The annual revenue
                                      requirement was set using projected cost building blocks and IPART used more detailed
                                      efficiency review. Table 14.1 summarizes the key decision points in IPART’s successive

                                           14.5. Form of Control
                                           A regulator can regulate the prices of a regulated entity in a number of ways, including spe-
                                           cific prices, weighted average price cap, and revenue cap. In water, IPART has set specific
                                           individual prices, while in other industries (such as electricity), IPART has used a weighted
                                           average price cap (WAPC). A WAPC gives the utility discretion on price structures. In the case
                                           of water, restructuring prices was controversial. IPART chose to set specific prices due to
                                           advantages in having the regulator “take responsibility” for changes in price structure. Both
                                           the government and SWC wanted this. However, this approach is heavy-handed and less
                                           efficient, and a move away from setting specific prices is overdue.
                                              A WAPC and revenue caps differ in incentives and risk allocations. Under a WAPC, the util-
                                           ity bears the volume risk with a disincentive to encourage water efficiency; with the average
                                           prices set, the entity would benefit from increases in sales. In contrast, a revenue cap removes
                                           disincentives to promote water efficiency, but the customers bear the volume risk.

                                           14.6.1. Sydney Water Corporation’s Priorities to Improve Regulation
                                           The basic approach to setting Annual Revenue Requirement (ARR) (building blocks) is well
                                           accepted and understood. In its most recent submission to IPART for the next regulatory
                                           period, SWC has focused on improving the approach through creating stronger incentives and
                                           better risk allocation. SWC is seeking (a) to move from setting specific prices to a WAPC;
                                           (b) stronger incentives to reduce controllable costs through the carry-forward of any efficiency
                                           gains into the next regulatory period cost pass-throughs for uncontrollable costs (e.g., tax
                                           changes or the costs of new environmental standards), and (c) a longer regulatory period.

                                           WAPC

                                           SWC’s current form of regulation involves IPART setting price structures and maximum
                                           price levels for monopoly services that apply for each year of the determination. SWC sought


140                                        Australian Urban Water Reform Story
greater flexibility in its pricing through the introduction of a WAPC. A WAPC approach means
that the utility sets all tariffs within a basket of regulated services each year, subject to a cap
on the overall weighted average of charges and any additional side constraints that the reg-
ulator applies. Each year, the utility can adjust prices for each service as long as they meet
the overall cap. Utilities can apportion costs between services and set prices to reflect costs.
SWC claimed that this year-on-year adjustment (rebalancing) maximizes efficiency. It also
introduces price flexibility that encourages SWC to ensure its prices meet two key aims:
prices will reflect the costs of providing the service, and services can be targeted to particu-
lar customer groups to reflect their preferences (adding value). This would then drive more
efficient allocation of resources to customers (allocative efficiency) during the regulatory
period. Price flexibility would also allow SWC to use prices to respond quickly to changing
supply and demand conditions in the future.
  IPART decided not to introduce a WAPC for this regulatory period, but gave SWC the flexi-
bility of entering into unregulated pricing agreements with its large nonresidential customers
(IPART 2016). IPART considered that if both SWC and a large nonresidential customer are able
to negotiate an arrangement that makes both parties better off, the regulatory framework
should not prevent this. IPART recognized that SWC’s proposed WAPC would provide greater
pricing flexibility during the regulatory period. However, IPART did not introduce a WAPC as
this would also introduce risks that could impact SWC’s customers. The main risks would be
price changes that are not necessarily cost reflective, and excess revenue generation for the
business (IPART 2016).


Incentives to Reduce Controllable Costs

Productive efficiency of monopoly suppliers is a central objective of economic regulation.
Economic efficiency is promoted by delivering services at the lowest efficient cost, where
those costs are within the firm’s control. Given cost-efficiency has a direct impact on prices,
customers are likely to place high importance on its achievement. SWC proposed that IPART
adopt the following cost incentive schemes.
  Efficiency benefit sharing scheme (EBSS). This allows firms to keep gains for a defined period
of time, regardless of the year of the regulatory period in which they achieve the cost-­
efficiency. Being able to carry over the efficiency benefit means there is a continuous and
equal incentive for cost-efficiency in each year of the regulatory period. This corrects the cur-
rent incentive to drive greater efficiencies earlier in the regulatory period, and promotes
delivery of services to customers at the lowest efficient cost. It provides businesses with
greater reward for lowering costs within its control, and penalises businesses for any overruns
in the same costs. Customers will be better off over the long term by the extent to which the
business lowers costs, as they pass the savings in full to customers through lower prices.
  Cost-recovery schemes (CRS). These make sure businesses are not punished for material
increases in costs for events beyond their control. The CRS complements the EBSS, and
operates by the firm agreeing at the price determination to the scope and scale of costs that


Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                            141
      might arise and the triggers that activate the mechanism. If the event transpires, costs are
      automatically passed through to customers. Customers only bear the costs approved by
      the regulator if these events actually occur. They do not pay upfront for costs that do not
      materialize.
        SWC’s current form of regulation allows it to keep profits resulting from cost savings made
      during the regulatory period, referred to as incentive regulation because it provides a finan-
      cial incentive for utilities to deliver cost savings. Cost savings, if they are permanent, can be
      passed on to customers through lower prices in subsequent regulatory periods. A shortcom-
      ing of the current approach is that a saving made in year one of the regulatory period results
      in four years of additional profit, whereas a saving made in year three of the regulatory period
      results in just two years of additional profits. Thus there is an incentive to delay savings from
      the latter years of one regulatory period to the beginning of the next regulatory period. Rather
      than introduce an EBSS, IPART decided to introduce an efficiency carryover mechanism
      (ECM). An ECM allows gains or losses to be held for a specified period of time (e.g., four years),
      regardless of when they are achieved (IPART 2016).

      Pass-Through of Uncontrollable Costs

      The current framework sets efficient allowances for OPEX and capital expenses (CAPEX)
      for the regulatory period with an expectation that costs fluctuate up and down. Where a
      significant cost may be incurred, or not incurred, during a regulatory period and the utility
      has no control over it, there is a case for that cost to be passed through. Cost pass-through
      mechanisms allow the efficient costs of uncertain and uncontrolled events that arise
      during the regulatory period to be passed through to customers within the regulatory
      period. A pass-through arrangement would be better than allowing for costs upfront, due
      to the high level of uncertainty about whether those costs will be incurred. IPART decided
      to allow cost pass-through of Shoalhaven transfers and SDP’s additional costs when it
      operates (IPART 2016). IPART considers that the circumstances under which a cost pass-
      through should apply are the following:


      •	 There is a trigger event (to activate the cost pass-through), which can be clearly defined
        and identified in the price determination.

      •	 The resulting efficient cost associated with the trigger event can be fully assessed, includ-
        ing other factors that may fully or partially offset the direct cost of the event.

      •	 The resulting cost is assessed to exceed a materiality threshold.

A Longer Regulatory Period

SWC proposed that the determination period be increased from three years to four years.
IPART agreed with this proposal because of (a) the level of confidence in forecasts over a
four-year term; (b) the risk of structural change in the sector over the four years is low; (c) the
need for price flexibility and incentives for efficiency; (d) the need for regulatory certainty
and financial stability; and (e) the benefits of aligning the price determination period with
the term of the operating license (IPART 2016).

14.6.2. Future Challenges
Increasing Costs of Connecting New Customers

New houses on the urban fringe, especially if the developments are out of sequence or in diffi-
cult areas to service, are more expensive to service than houses in existing areas. However,
under the government’s policy of postage stamp pricing and no developer charges, prices do
not signal these costs or provide adequate funding for urban expansion on the fringe of the city.
This creates a significant cost risk for SWC, and a consequent price risk for customers.
  While infill growth can currently be serviced using existing infrastructure, servicing green-
field areas requires major network expansions and upgrades to existing plants. In the period
to 2016, SWC plans on servicing 27,000 new lots per annum. The CAPEX to service this
growth will total $A 684 million, or around 25 percent of the total CAPEX spend. Currently,
the cost of servicing greenfield lots is on average five to six times higher than for servicing
infill lots (SWC 2016). In the absence of strong price signals there is a risk that more develop-
ment will occur in areas that are more expensive to serve, further increasing the spending on
growth-related CAPEX to be funded by other customers.
  SWC and IPART have a common interest in ensuring efficient development, but there are
substantial political constraints on using prices to signal costs. One option would be to rees-
tablish the previous developer charges, which signaled costs, but this would be contrary to
the government’s policies on urban development and housing affordability. In the absence
of this, reliance will be placed on stronger planning controls on the sequencing of develop-
ment, possibly supported by institutional and funding changes within government (such as
central budget holders for urban development infrastructure). SWC can manage its risk by
prioritizing the servicing of lower cost areas, leaving more expensive areas to be served by
private service providers if they are to proceed.

Changing Environmental Standards

A government-owned utility is an easy “target” for the environmental regulator. This leads
to concerns about rising standards with large cost and price impacts. SWC and IPART have a
common interest in ensuring new standards are reasonable (i.e., benefits exceed costs).
IPART raised concerns in its first review (1993) regarding the cost and price implication of
higher environmental standards, whereby these standards may not be the most efficient
means of achieving the desired environmental goals or where they may not adequately con-
sider the community’s willingness to pay (GPT 1993c).

        In its 2016 submission to IPART, SWC stated that “any tightening of environmental stan-
      dards, such as the discharge levels into the Hawkesbury-Nepean River, would increase the
      costs of supplying wastewater services, widening the cost gap between greenfield and infill
      developments. It would also mean wastewater becomes an even higher proportion of the
      overall customer bill. In 2016–20, the proportion of the bill for an average customer will be
      52  percent wastewater, 48 percent water.” (SWC 2016, xi) As noted above, IPART is again
      concerned about the potential impact of rising standards on costs and prices, and foreshad-
      owed that it may not pass through the costs of standards it considers excessive. This an
      unusual and high-risk strategy for the regulator, as it leaves the utility unable to recover
      costs it is legally obliged to incur.

Chapter 15   Current Performance and Outcomes

             This chapter examines the current performance and trends over time in terms of prices, cost
             recovery, efficiency, and quality of service. Water prices have become more cost-reflective,
             providing better signals to consumers and a better basis for funding services. Consumption
             charging is now the rule for urban water. Cross-subsidies between different types of users
             have largely been eliminated, and the prices of water and related services now better reflect
             the costs of those services. Prices are now more efficient and fair, and profitability of Sydney
             Water Corporation (SWC) has improved. Prices initially fell and then were stable to 2008 but
             when they needed to rise because costs rose, a 40 percentage points increase over four
             years was achieved.
               While less directly attributable to price regulation in this period, the quality of service has
             improved. In the early period of regulation, the utilities achieved ambitious cost reduction
             targets, primarily by reducing employee numbers. Partial performance indicators support
             the view that there have also been significant improvements in operational efficiency.
             However, from the mid-1990s to 2010, measured productivity did not increase, although
             this does not take quality improvements into account.


             15.1. Prices
             Reform of urban water pricing dates back to the early 1980s. The pricing structures of the
             time resulted in inappropriate use of water, since there was no signal to consumers of the
             cost of using additional water. Prior to reform, water prices were mostly fixed and did not
             provide incentives to consumers to manage their demand. Charges were based on property
             taxes and cross-subsidies were rife. Reforming prices was slow. Initially commenced in the
             Hunter in 1982, it wasn’t until the mid-1990s that prices in Sydney were predominately
             usage-based.
               Two features of the reform process warrant discussion as they demonstrate the how poli-
             tics can affect the reform process. First, Hunter Water Corporation (HWC) was the first water
             utility to introduce usage charges in 1982. It took almost 10 years before SWC was able to
             follow suit. HWC had been able to reform itself in the absence of price regulation, yet SWC
             was not able to until after an independent regulator had been established. Reform of pricing
             for SWC may have been more difficult than for HWC because it was too controversial
             politically. SWC covered a much larger area and a more politically diverse region than in the
             Hunter. When the Hunter reforms commenced there were few seats in the region that were
             tightly contested, whereas the Sydney area contained a larger number of seats including a
             number of key marginal seats. Therefore, the government was less willing to introduce water
             usage charges in Sydney.
               Second, clearly, cross-subsidies were an issue. However, it wasn’t simply a matter of
             the business sector subsidizing the residential sector. There were differences in subsidies
             within the business sector, with small to medium businesses subsidizing large businesses.


             Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                          145
      The  primary beneficiaries of these subsidies were groups with political power, such as
      residential and large business users.
        This section discusses the principles of using two-part tariffs to signal to consumers the
      true cost of water use. It also discusses the process of reform over a number of decades, with
      particular attention to SWC and HWC, describing key outcomes of these reforms.

      15.1.1. Pricing Reform
      Pre-1980s

      Prior to the 1980s, urban water bills were determined by the value of the property using the
      service. Charges for water, wastewater and stormwater are a charge against the property. In
      effect, water was paid for by a system of taxation on property values. Each household was
      given a water allowance determined by the property value. The higher the property value,
      the higher the water allowance. Consumption above the water allowance was considered
      excess, and charged at a usage rate.
        Most ratepayers used less than their water allowance and effectively faced a zero price for
      their additional consumption. Consequently, water agencies were unable to manage water
      demand and responded to increasing water use (partly caused by a zero or low water price) by
      expanding supply, which was then paid for by an increase in water rates. In addition, different
      users’ water allowances varied depending on the rates paid, so that virtually every urban
      water user faced a different average price of water. These different average prices, coupled
      with the fact that properties could be valued on different bases depending on whether they
      were used for residential, commercial or industrial purposes, meant that cross-subsidization
      was an endemic feature between different user groups as well as within user groups.

      1980s1

      HWC introduced pay-for-use pricing in 1982, following a period of drought. HWC wanted to
      address increased demand but was constrained by revenue shortfalls, lack of funding from
      government, maintenance backlog, and management problems. HWC introduced “user
      pays” charges for residential customers by eliminating the free water allowance and intro-
      ducing a two-part tariff schedule. The two-part tariff included an access charge, a usage
      charge, and a property tax component. Despite a strong reaction from the local community,
      the reforms remained. As a result of the reforms, water consumption dropped by 30 percent
      within the first few years.
        In contrast, SWC made slow progress in introducing usage charges. In 1986–87, SWC moved
      from a water allowance based on rating value to a free water allowance (initially 300 kL per
      annum). As the allowance was well above the median water consumption, most households
      did not pay a usage charge.


      1990s

      In 1992, water charges (and hence revenue) were largely dependent on property values and
      fixed service charges. In Sydney, excess water charges generally only applied after water

146   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
usage exceeded overly generous water allowances. As a consequence, ratepayers using less
than their water allowances or whose properties were unmetered did not see price signals
for each unit of water they consumed. Thus, these charging arrangements did little to ensure
the efficient use of water. Underpricing water use encouraged growth in demand with rising
standards of living and population. As Hunter Water Corporation (HWC) had shown in the
1980s when it introduced water meters and usage charges, pricing water better can help
defer the need for major new investment. At the same time, the commercial and industrial
sectors were subsidizing the residential sector. Therefore, Sydney had one of the cheapest
residential water and wastewater bills in Australia and the most expensive nonresidential
bills in the world.
  The residential sector, encompassing 93 percent of properties provided with a water ser-
vice, consumed 66 percent of water and yet contributed just over 50 percent of revenue to
defray the cost of water and sewerage services. At the same time, more than a third of
SWC’s total revenue was derived from property value-based taxes and a further 40 percent
from fixed service charges. Only 20 percent of SWC’s total revenue was generated from
charges that depended on the amount of water consumed or sewerage discharged.
  Following its review of water services in 1992 and 1993, the Independent Pricing and
Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) put in place a program of reforms for the metropolitan water
agencies of New South Wales (GPT 1993). Key elements of the reform process included elim-
inating free water allowances where this had not already occurred, and progressively elimi-
nating property value-based rates as a source of revenue, with priority to be given to the
reform of the nonresidential sector. In addition, the process moved to a simple two-part
tariff with a uniform usage charge to apply to all water used. In recent years the usage charge
has been set in relation to the LRMC of water (the additional cost of making more water
available). The reforms have rigorously pursued efficiency gains by the water supply agen-
cies, accompanied by real revenue reductions over the short to medium term. This was
accompanied with a recommendation that water agencies benchmark their activities against
similar agencies internationally. Finally, the reforms have adopted charging arrangements
for land developers which ensure that costs of infrastructure provision are fully recovered
through a combination of common periodic charges and upfront contributions.
  SWC had the scope to contribute to reforming its pricing regimes through making cost
savings. Over the course of the reform process, SWC was able to reduce staff numbers
substantially. By 2005, it employed less than half the staff it had employed in 1993. However,
the establishment of the then SCA in 1999 took some staff from SWC.2

2000s

Water prices are now based on a two-part tariff (fixed and usage charges), which is considered
to be an efficient approach to water pricing. Both SWC and HWC now have a single usage
charge for all water consumption, however this was not always the case. During the 2000s,
HWC had a declining block tariff structure while SWC, for a short period, introduced an
inclining block tariff.

Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                        147
      Sydney Water Corporation’s Inclining Block Tariff

      In 2005, IPART introduced an inclining block tariff (IBT) with a two-tiered usage charge for
      individually metered residential properties. IPART introduced this because of its consider-
      able potential to reduce demand in the face of drought conditions, as well as the emerging
      imbalance between the supply of water and the demand for water. At the time, there was
      significant community and government support for water conservation. The tier 1 usage
      charge applied to residential volumes up to 100 kL per quarter and reflected the lower end of
      IPART’s LRMC of supply estimate at the time prices were determined. The higher tier 2 usage
      charge applied to volumes in excess of 100 kL per quarter.
        IBTs have both pros and cons. They can be an effective tool for reducing usage, which is
      particularly beneficial when water is in short supply. They may also be desirable from a
      social equity perspective if low-income households pay a relatively low charge to meet basic
      water needs. However, water pricing is done on a per household basis and not a per capita
      basis, so IBTs are unlikely to accurately target discretionary use. Furthermore, IBTs are inef-
      ficient (because at least some consumption is priced at a level higher or lower than marginal
      cost), and are unlikely to balance supply and demand on their own.
        IPART removed the two-tier usage charge for SWC residential customers in its 2008
      Determination (IPART 2008). The tier 2 usage charge was removed by progressively raising
      the tier 1 price to the point where it is equal to the tier 2 price. This resulted in a single price
      for all units of water from July 1, 2009. IPART noted that:


         While support for the retention of an IBT in submissions was mixed, IPART considers
         that an IBT is no longer warranted given the current lack of water scarcity in Sydney.
         It considers that a single usage charge set at the LRMC of supply is more appropriate,
         because it provides efficient price signals to consumers about the long term cost
         consequences of their consumption (IPART 2008, 93)


        Given that IPART adopted the higher tier price for water as the new usage price, it seems
      that the tier 2 price was the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) for water and that water was
      below LRMC at the tier 1 consumption levels. With hindsight, the inclining block tariff was a
      means of transitioning to a significantly higher usage charge.

      Hunter Water Corporation’s Declining Block Tariff

      In July 2001, HWC introduced a third tier to its declining block tariff as a location-based
      water usage charge for industrial customers with very high water consumption (submission
      to IPART, 2000). The location-based charges applied only in areas close to water sources, and
      reflected the lower network costs of supplying water in these areas because less distribution
      infrastructure is used. This lower usage charge only applied to customers who consume
      greater than 50,000 kL per year and only for designated areas close to water sources.
        In the 2005 determination, HWC asked to remove the second tier for usage above
      1,000 kL per annum. This resulted from pressures placed on HWC during the drought.


148   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
HWC  acknowledged that maintaining the declining tariff structure for customers other
than houses would appear inconsistent with the need for stronger price signals to manage
demand. IPART removed the second tier within the 2005 determination period by increasing
the price of tier 2 water at a greater rate than the tier 1 price (IPART 2005).

2010s

IPART’s 2012 determination for SWC restructured water, sewerage, and stormwater prices
to remove some remaining cross-subsidies between customer groups and improve the cost
reflectivity of these prices (IPART 2012b). This price restructuring did not increase the total
revenue SWC receives for services. Rather, it removed inequities and improved the balance
between fixed service charges and variable usage charges to better represent the costs that
customers in all groups impose on SWC.
  This price restructure for SWC followed IPART’s review of the price structures of SWC and
the other metropolitan water utilities it regulates (IPART 2012a). This review found that
under the then-current price structures, the fixed charges that some SWC customers pay do
not reflect the cost of servicing them. At the time, the water service charges paid by houses
were subsidizing the services received by flats and units and as a result, the discounts for
units and flats were removed in the restructure. The price restructuring also ensured that
SWC’s prices sent efficient price signals.

15.1.2. Current Water Prices
Consistent with efficient pricing principles, IPART uses a two-part tariff to charge for water.
IPART has generally set a single water usage price that is consistent with the LRMC of supply
for each of the metropolitan water agencies it regulates. In addition to usage charges, all
properties (residential and nonresidential) pay a quarterly service charge, which is levied to
recover the agency’s remaining revenue requirement. The service charge for commercial
and industrial properties is levied according to meter size, so that properties with larger
meters pay a higher service charge. Table 15.1 provides a summary of water prices for the
metropolitan water agencies for 2016–17.

        Periodic charges reflect the average cost of supply, and are uniform throughout each
      agency’s area of operation. This is known as postage stamp pricing. The use of postage stamp
      pricing for periodic water services results in prices that do not signal the diversity in costs of
      providing these services to different locations. It is worth noting that the fixed charge for
      HWC is much smaller than that for SWC.

      15.1.3. Key Outcomes
      Water prices have become more cost reflective to provide better signals to consumers and a
      better basis for funding services. Consumption charging is now the rule for urban water.
      Cross-subsidies between different types of users have largely been eliminated, and the prices
      of water and related services now better reflect the costs of those services. Over the period
      that IPART has regulated water prices the following changes have occurred:

      •	 Increase in usage charges to reflect marginal costs (encouraging efficient use of water and
        discharge of waste)

      •	 Reduction in cross-subsidies

      •	 Removal of property tax component

      •	 Significant increase in prices achieved to cover cost increases due to investment in water
        security and higher discharge standards

        As a result of the reforms that have occurred over the past 25 years, (a) prices are fairer and
      more efficient; (b) prices fell for much of the period (but when they needed to rise because
      costs rose, a 40 percent increase over four years was achieved); and (c) profitability has
      improved. Other changes less directly attributable to price regulation were achieved in this
      period: (a) quality of service has improved; (b) measured productivity did not improve
      through to 2010 (but this does not take account of quality improvements); and (c) partial
      performance indicators show significant improvements in operational efficiency.


      Prices Are Fairer and More Efficient

      There were real reductions in prices over the first regulatory period (1993–96), which helped
      achieve substantial price reform. First, the property tax was phased out, meaning that busi-
      ness water bills were reduced more than residential water bills. Second, loss of revenue from
      removing the property tax component of charges was offset by a usage charge, providing a
      better signal of the costs of water use. Finally, fixed charges were reduced for households.
      Panels a and b of figure 15.1 show the distribution shift of SWC’s water revenue by customer
      class over this period. By 1997, all property tax charges had been removed and revenue was
      predominantly from usage charges.
        Today, charges for residential and business customers are set on the same basis and
      cross-subsidies have been largely removed. As a result, charges reflect costs, send better
      signals for efficient usage, as usage charges reflect marginal costs of supply, and are cross-­
      subsidy free.

                                           Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                                            151
                                         Average residential water bills are almost 30 percent higher than they were in 1993.
                                       As shown in figure 15.2, over the period that IPART has regulated SWC, average residential
                                       bills have mostly remained constant or declined in real terms. The exception was during a
                                       period of major spending to increase reliability of water supply (the desalination plant) and
                                       improve environmental outcomes (recycling and better stormwater management). This
                                       resulted in a 40 percent increase over four years, a significant achievement for a regulator.
                                         Between 1992/93 and 2008/09, residential water prices have increased in real terms for
                                       SWC customers, with a significant increase occurring in 2008/09. Overall, a residential cus-
                                       tomer of SWC using 220 kL of water each year would have paid 14.2 percent more for water
                                       and sewerage services in 2008/09 than in 1992/93, while a HWC customer would have paid
                                       14.3 percent less (Cox 2010).
                                         The decreases in residential water and sewerage charges over the period from 1993 to 2008
                                       were the result of substantial efficiency gains made possible by the introduction of price
                                       regulation in 1993. SWC’s 2008 determination increased bills in real terms by 32.6 percent for
                                       a typical residential customer over the four years of the determination, in large part to fund
                                       an expanded capital program including new sources of water supply (e.g., desalination).
                                         Similarly, HWC’s 2009 determination increased the annual bill for a typical residential
                                       customer in real terms by 30.7 percent over four years. This price increase funded increases

152                                    Australian Urban Water Reform Story
                                                        in operating expenditure and a large capital program, including initial investments in
                                                        Tillegra Dam and upgrades in the water and sewerage systems. With the decision to aban-
                                                        don the construction of Tillegra Dam, IPART revised the pricing determination to pay back
                                                        the costs of the dam to the consumers.


                                                        Impact of Water Usage Prices on Consumption

                                                        The impacts of increasing prices on water use are difficult to measure during a drought,
                                                        when restrictions are in place. It is likely that a combination of suasion (i.e., water conserva-
                                                        tion programs, education, awareness building), restrictions, and investments in technical
                                                        water use efficiency had a much greater influence than pricing reforms. However, it is likely
                                                        that increases in volumetric prices also played a role.
                                                           The introduction of voluntary restrictions in November 2002 achieved savings of
                                                        3 percent. Following the introduction of level 1 mandatory restrictions in October 2003,
                                                        total savings of 12 percent were achieved. Level 2 restrictions were in place from June
                                                        2004 to June 2005, achieving savings of 16 percent. The introduction of level 3 restrictions
                                                        increased the total savings to 17 percent (SWC 2009). (See Figures 15.3 and 15.4.)

      25 percent in each of the first two regulatory periods; see Table 6 in section 8.4). Under the
      approach adopted by the tribunal in these decisions, which focused on maintaining reason-
      able cash flows, the benefits of these efficiency gains went to customers to facilitate price
      reform and removal of cross-subsidies. From the decision in 2001, IPART included a specific
      WACC in the buildup of prices, and over time the margin in the WACC above the risk-free
      rate increased. Furthermore, after the large efficiency gains in previous years, the expert
      reviews identified less scope for further efficiency gains. The outcome was an increase in
      the return on assets, and in recent years SWC has beaten the efficiency targets set, allowing
      it to exceed the WACC set in the determination.
        Interestingly, HWC’s profit has not increased to the same extent that SWC’s has,
      despite the same approach being used in the determination of revenues, assessment of
      efficiency improvements, and the allowed WACC. One factor has been the timing of the
      determinations, and their impact on the cost of capital. Through the 2000s, the decisions
      for SWC and HWC were made in separate years, and until 2013 the WACC reflected current
      interest rates. In the period after the Global Financial Crisis, the variations in interest rates
      had a significant effect on the allowed WACC. HWC’s determination occurred during  a
      period of low interest rates in 2009, suppressing its WACC compared to that allowed for
      SWC in the previous year. Furthermore, in that determination, HWC proposed operating
      expenses (OPEX) and capital expenses (CAPEX) costs that implied substantial efficiency
      gains in the face of a substantially increased CAPEX program due to the new Tillegra Dam.
      Subsequently, the construction of the dam was cancelled and the revenues adjusted to
      remove these costs. These factors may explain the drop in profitability after 2009.
        IPART now sets SWC’s and HWC’s WACCs on a commercial basis consistent with the
      approach IPART uses for the energy businesses.3 However, the beta of 0.7 is specific to urban
      water. If they achieve the projected cost targets, they should be able to earn a commercial
      return.


      15.2.2. Increase in Stand-Alone Credit Rating
      Moody’s Investors Services upgraded SWC’s credit rating from Baa2 to Baa1. This was the
      first upgrade in the last 20 years. Moody’s noted in upgrading SWC’s credit rating, that it was
      due in part to improved transparency in IPART’s regulatory framework. In particular,
      Moody’s expects that IPART will continue to exhibit consistency in its decisions, translating
      into increased stability in revenue outcomes for SWC (Moody’s 2015; SWC 2016).


      15.3. Increased Efficiency
      While there are strong reasons to expect that better governance and regulation will lead to
      increased efficiency, it is difficult to demonstrate this empirically due to (a) the absence of con-
      tinuous consistent data; (b) the partial nature of many measures of efficiency (such as OPEX per
      customer); (c) the contemporaneous changes in service quality and difficulty of quantifying
      the value cost of these; and (d) the impact of other factors that affect performance, particularly


158   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
for individual utilities, such as the quality of the utility’s management and the implementation
of the governance regime.4 Furthermore, given that the changes in governance and regulation
have occurred over the same period, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of each.
  Three separate sources of information covering different periods suggest a net improve-
ment in productivity, especially when the increase in quality of services (in terms of security
of supply and the environmental impact of discharges of wastewater and stormwater) are
considered. First, the reduction in employee numbers of 35 percent in the first regulatory
period to 1996, in response to the strong cost reduction targets set by IPART in its determina-
tion of 1993. Second, the assessment by IPART in its review of the productivity performance
of HWC and SWC from 1996–2009, which concluded that (a) while the total factor productiv-
ity (TFP) deteriorated in the latter years in the period, this was due to substantial capital
investments to improve the quality of service, especially security of supply; (b) labor produc-
tivity increased by around 100 percent in both HWC and SWC over the period; and (c) SWC
and HWC performed well relatively to their peers in Australia. Finally, SWC’s estimate of its
current and projected TFP in the three years to 2015–16 shows a significant improvement in
TFP of 5.4 percent over the period (based on SWC’s forecast OPEX and CAPEX).


15.3.1. Productivity and Costs
1993–96

SWC achieved substantial reductions in operating costs that were largely in line with
IPART’s assumed cost savings in the first two regulatory periods. In its second determina-
tion in 1996, IPART found that:

   In the past three years, Sydney Water has made impressive progress in improving
   efficiency. Real operating cost per property is projected to be 22% lower in 1995/96
   ­
   than in 1992/93. The SWC targets to reduce underlying operating cost per property by
   45% in 2000/01 from the 1992/93 level. (IPART 1996, 3)


  In the three years to 1995/96, SWC reduced employee numbers by over a third (from 8,269
to 5,369).


1996–2009

IPART undertook a thorough review of the productivity performance and influencing
­factors in its Review of the Productivity Performance of State Owned Corporations (2010). For
HWC and SWC, it covered the period 1996–2009 and examined the efficiency of these utili-
ties through (a) estimates of TFP; (b) separate estimates of capital and labor productivity;
and (c) comparisons of the performance of HWC and SWC with their peers, based on partial
performance indicators of cost and quality of services.
  Productivity is the ratio of outputs to inputs and is a narrow measure of efficiency.
Typically, a business will seek to improve productivity by improving the quality and utiliza-
tion of its capital, labor force and other inputs. Better processes within the business and

                                                In regard to performance measured by TFP, IPART concluded that SWC’s TFP declined
                                              over the period. When inputs include the opportunity cost of capital component, its TFP
                                              fell by 14.5 percent. HWC’s TFP increased by 0.9 percent, since its output growth just out-
                                              paced the growth in its inputs. The dominant drivers of the urban water corporations’ TFP
                                              outcomes were the increases in their asset bases and HWC’s efficiency gains in the first half
                                              of the period. HWC’s TFP increased by 21.3 percent up to 2004, but significant increases in
                                              its CAPEX (which increased its asset base by 52 percent between 2004 and 2009) led to pro-
                                              ductivity being almost unchanged overall by 2009. Finally, SWC’s output growth largely
                                              matched input growth between 1996 and 2004, but significant increases in CAPEX (result-

                                              productivity decline by the end of the period (IPART 2010).

                                                When this was disaggregated, the trends in labor and capital productivity were markedly
                                              different. IPART found that SWC’s staff labor productivity increased by 90 percent over the
                                              period. This increase was partly due to reductions in labor input following the separation
                                              of bulk water functions from SWC and creation of the SCA in 1998, as well as some shifting of
                                              load to consultants and contractors between 1996 and 2001. However, from 2001 to 2009,
                                              SWC’s staff labor productivity increased by around 26 percent with no further apparent shift-

Chapter 16   Concluding Comments
             16.1. Drivers for Reform
             Reform is challenging: to be successful it often requires a crisis to focus attention and effort,
             and a mix of push factors (external drivers) and pull factors (such as internal drivers and
             early movers demonstrating improvements). The importance of these individual reform
             champions and the strength of political commitment should not be underestimated.
               The early reforms in Hunter Water Corporation (HWC) reflected both a crisis (the severe
             inefficiency and antiquated systems in place) and the importance of a change agent. Critical
             to the reform process were the new head of the organization, Dr. John Paterson, and execu-
             tives with very strong capabilities and drive to push through resistance.
               The crisis that drove the National Competition Policy (NCP) was somewhat more amor-
             phous: a slow productivity growth and comparative economic decline. Some sectors had
             more immediate crises. In electricity it was the extent of excess generation capacity; in rural
             it was the problematic salinity and the tension between environmental and agricultural uses
             for the scarce water resources in the Murray-Darling Basin. Arguably, this helps explain the
             variable success and pace of reform. The other important factor encouraging reform was
             the strong commitment to the reform of the Commonwealth and key state governments.
             The creation of new federal (joint commonwealth–state) bodies and the Productivity
             Commission, a well-regarded advisory body with a degree of independence and a strong
             focus on economic reforms, assisted in guiding the reform process.


             16.2. Role of the Commonwealth Government
             The commonwealth government is a key external driver for the state and local governments,
             who are responsible for the delivery of urban water services. The Hilmer Report and subse-
             quent NCP recognized the importance of more efficient provision and use of infrastructure
             to improve national productivity and growth. The preferred means of achieving this (pro-
             moting competition through access to essential facilities and limiting the scope of the
             monopoly) have been more effective in other sectors such as electricity. However, the
             national framework for improving the governance of the sector has been important in guid-
             ing and reinforcing the reform of the sector, particularly in improving its financial sustain-
             ability and efficiency and the pricing of its services. The system of national competition
             payments was effective in encouraging the states to agree to and implement the reforms,
             and to reinforce preexisting reforms. Important aspects of this were the long tradition in
             Australian federalism of conditional grants, and the creation of an arm’s length agency to
             review and assess compliance and advise on payments.
               While this paper has focused on urban water reform in New South Wales, the common-
             wealth government’s leadership has been stronger in rural water. The water basins for the
             major urban areas in New South Wales are wholly within the state. In contrast, the key rural

      water basin (the Murray-Darling Basin) covers a huge area across the states of Queensland,
      New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and the need for national coordination of
      this resource was more immediate and obvious.


      16.3. Role of the State Governments: Leading and Implementing
      Much of the task of implementing the reforms in the urban water sector has fallen to the
      state governments as the service providers. Some states and utilities led the implementation
      of the reform agenda, whereas in other states the NCP and national water reform agenda
      were an important impetus to reform. New South Wales and Victoria were early implement-
      ers of many of the reforms (such as commercialization and price reform) subsequently built
      into the urban reform agenda under the NCP. The driver in both cases was an immediate
      budget crisis at the state level, with reform supported by the strong commitment of newly
      elected reformist governments. Even within New South Wales, HWC led the reforms, being
      corporatized and embarking on substantial price reforms in advance of the NCP. Although
      the policy commitments in regard to Sydney Water Corporation (SWC) were entered into
      before the NCP, arguably the NCP reinforced the commitment to and implementation of
      those reforms.


      16.4. Role of the Regulator and Regulation
      Independent, transparent regulation has been an important part of the reform; prices have
      become more efficient and cost-reflective, and over time returns in the sector have improved.
      By setting a hard budget constraint, the incentives to improve efficiency were strengthened.
      However, achievement of efficiency gains depends on governance and the quality of man-
      agement, not just incentives.
        One of the important lessons from the path of regulation in New South Wales is that
      reform  takes time and patience; not all problems can be addressed simultaneously. The
      initial focus was on setting tough efficiency targets and using the efficiency dividend to facil-
      itate substantial tariff reform and removal of cross-subsidies. In the last 15 years the financial
      framework has become more rigorous, and allowed rates of return have been lifted.
        The other key issue the reform experience raises is the interface between regulation and
      policy and the meaning of independent regulation. First, sound sustainable regulatory
      regimes need to provide a safety valve for political intervention to ensure broader policy
      objectives are achieved; the mechanism should be structured to ensure the transpar-
      ency and time consistency of such interventions. The New South Wales regime does this by
      allowing scope for the government to commission special reviews and provide public terms
      ­
      of reference and transparent directions. Second, independence is not inconsistent with def-
      erence to transparent, properly made policies of government. Elected governments are
      accountable to the community in a way that appointed regulators are not, and it is appropri-
      ate that the regulatory body have regard to the government’s public policy position even
      where it does not agree with those policies, such as in the removal of developer charges.

166   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
16.5. Promoting Efficient Provision of Services and Use of Resources
The framework for improving performance has revolved around (a) a clearer policy and
operating framework for the sector; (b) clear commercial objectives for the service pro-
viders aligned to the framework; (c) sector restructuring, a stronger role for the private
sector, and facilitation of competition; and (d) depoliticization and reform of pricing and
its regulation. Conceptually, this is a coherent package that strengthens the incentives
of  service providers and aligns these to the objectives for the sector. Some aspects of
improvement, such as the removal of cross-subsidies can be more measured and linked
to regulation. Others are more difficult, such as productivity improvement where it is
difficult to include quality improvements and the impact of capital cycles. However, the
AWA concluded that:


   What had been a heavily subsidised industry, under the control of disparate local gov-
   ernments—either directly or through their participation on governing boards—has
   become a competitive, financially secure industry, under the management of skilled
   boards and which prices its services to recover its costs and achieve a return on invest-
   ment. Furthermore, these reforms and others have led to a rationalisation in water
   use, and a highly strategic approach to asset management that has reduced mainte-
   nance, improved asset life and reduced service interruptions. Environment protection
   and water quality has also improved significantly. (AWA 2010)



Annex 16A—IPART’s Approach to Setting Revenues and Prices
IPART’s Current Approach to Setting the Annual Revenue Requirement
For its first two determinations, IPART used a cash flow approach focusing on the adequacy
of cash flows to cover efficient operating expenses (OPEX) and a reasonable level of internal
funding of efficient capital expenses (CAPEX). The adequacy of the profit margin was
assessed in terms of benchmark margins and free cash flows rather than returns on assets.
From its 2000 determination, IPART has explicitly used a building block approach to deter-
mine regulated revenues in which


  Annual revenue requirement (ARR) = OPEX + depreciation + return on assets (ROA).


Once the regulated revenues are determined, prices are set in accordance with the desig-
nated approach so that, for the forecast customer numbers and volumes of water and waste-
water, expected revenues equal the ARR. Figure 16A.1 summarises this approach.
  The allowance for OPEX is based on an assessment of the efficient OPEX. Depreciation is
a function of the regulatory asset base (RAB) and the assumed asset lives, and the ROA is a
function of the RAB and the allowed rate of return (ROR). The RAB is in turn a function of
the initial RAB and efficient CAPEX and any revaluation adjustments. This approach aligns
well with financial and accounting perspectives of businesses, and includes a profit margin

Asset Valuation
Setting of the Initial RAB

There are four basic approaches to calculating initial regulatory asset base (RAB): (a) depre-
ciated historic cost, (b) depreciated indexed historic cost, (c) depreciated optimized replace-
ment cost (DORC), and (d) discounted cash flow. Depreciated historic cost and indexed
historic costs were not feasible due to gaps in the asset acquisition values records given past
public sector accounting requirements, changes in accounting systems, and changes in the
sector structure.
  Following commercialization and corporatization, New South Wales businesses had
adopted replacement cost accounting and the New South Wales Treasury had pushed for
a DORC asset value. From the mid-1990s, there was broad support from utilities, policy
makers, and some regulators to adopt DORC asset values. Part of this support was driven
by the view that DORC values were a better approximation of the economic value,
although as Prof. Stephen King (King 1995; Reid and Choy 1996) argued, the economic
value of an asset can be anywhere between its replacement cost and its scrap value.
While there are strong precedents for the use of replacement cost values based on a the-
oretical optimal network in South America, this level of optimization was far greater than
that proposed in Australia. Optimizations in Australia start from the existing networks,
not a hypothetical greenfield network, and test for the existence of excess capacity.
Furthermore, the use of depreciated optimized replacement cost (DORC) values was not
supported by the precedents in U.K. electricity and water from which the Australian
approach was derived. In the United Kingdom, the RAB has been based on valuation of
the businesses in the first 100 days of trading. This is akin to the discounted cash flow
method, since the market value should reflect the expected value of future earnings
discounted to today’s values.
­
  IPART resisted the pressure to adopt the DORC approach to asset valuation, since it was
concerned about the uncertainty in asset valuations and its sensitivity to planning assump-
tions (which impact the extent of optimization). IPART also held concerns regarding unsus-
tainable increases if prices were based on DORC plus a commercial return. However, IPART
noted that historic cost estimates were not available.
  IPART did not lock-in an asset value until 2000 when it set the RAB using the discounted
cash flow (i.e., the asset value that would be supported by the current and projected cash
flows). IPART considered that this would provide a way of locking in a RAB for the future,
while minimizing price shocks. IPART recognized that this has an element of circularity,
since it requires assumptions about future prices. Interestingly, since then there has been a
more general move away from the DORC values. While the electricity network assets were
initially valued at the DORC, the rules1 were changed to remove future DORC revaluations.
Instead, the initial RAB is rolled forward with indexation for the general change in prices
(Consumer Price Index, CPI) only. The water pricing principles agreed in 2004 recognized
that DORC set a maximum value only.

      Roll-Forward of the RAB

      Having set the initial RAB, IPART set the basis for its revaluation and the roll forward
      of the RAB. It adopted the approach of indexing the RAB by a general measure of inflation,
      the CPI. This preserves the value of financial investment in the entity in real terms, and is
      consistent with the accounting principle of financial capital maintenance  (FCM).2 The
      approach to regulation adopted by IPART consistently adopts the FCM view.
        The RAB at the start of a regulatory period is rolled forward using the following formula for
      each year of the previous regulatory period (Box 16A.1):

                             (Closing RAByr 0)(1+∆CPI) + (CAPEX – Depreciation – Disposals)
           Opening RAByr 1 = 
                                (1+∆CPI/2)(16A.1)


            BOX 16A .1.   Steps in Setting Water, Wastewater, and Stormwater Prices


            Allocate costs to major business functions: water supply, wastewater, tradewaste,
            stormwater.

            For water:

            •	 Estimate LRMC of water supply

            •	 Set usage charge on basis of LRMC. Same usage charge applies to all
              customers

            •	 Fixed charge set to recover residual costs allocated to water (varies according to
              meter size, to reflect potential demand on system)

            For wastewater:

            •	 Allocate costs between residential and nonresidential customers

            •	 Set a standard fixed charge for households (difference between houses and
              apartments has been phased out)

            •	 Set discharge charge for nonresidential customers based on estimate of
              marginal cost

            •	 Apply discharge charge as a function of water consumption and discharge
              factor

            •	 Fixed charge set to recover residual nonresidential wastewater costs

            For stormwater:

            •	 Set a charge on property size (per m2) to recover costs allocated to stormwater

            For tradewaste:

            •	 Model impact of specific nonstandard discharges on costs

            •	 Set charge per unit of nonstandard discharge to recover costs allocated to
              tradewaste

Where:


•	 CAPEX is actual CAPEX, subject to an assessment of the efficiency of the CAPEX,

•	 depreciation uses actual CAPEX, exclusive of any adjustment for inefficiency,

•	 CAPEX and depreciation are assumed to occur evenly through the year, hence the allow-
  ance for half the rate of inflation.


  The same formula is used in rolling forward the forecast RAB for the regulatory period.
However, in this case CAPEX is the forecast efficient CAPEX, and depreciation is calculated
using forecast efficient CAPEX.



Asset Lives
Assumed asset lives have not been a contentious component of the determination of the
ARR. The asset life assumptions are based on assessments of the average economic life for
different classes of assets. The water utilities have proposed changes to asset lives at price
reviews, and these have largely been accepted by IPART. The key point to note is that changes
in asset lives affect the time profile of the revenue stream, but not the net present value of
revenues over the life of the assets. Shortening the asset life will increase prices in the early
years but result in lower prices in later years.



Allowed ROR
Since allowance for inflation is incorporated through the indexation of the RAB, IPART uses
a real ROR. It has used the WACC approach using a benchmark gearing of 60:40 debt to
equity; a benchmark cost of debt based on the cost of debt for BBB/BBB+ rated company; and
a benchmark ROE using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).
  Until the latest (2016) price review, the allowed ROR has been the most consistently
­
contentious element in the determination of prices. Initially the utilities were concerned
(with some justification) that the WACC was too low. There were a number of factors that led
to these concerns:

•	 Assumed maturity period (five years) for the risk-free rate, which was the starting point
  for the cost of debt and ROE

•	 Market benchmarks used for the estimation of the cost of debt and inflation expectations

•	 Relatively low ROE compared to debt and the returns allowed for the electricity utilities

  Over time, IPART has improved the rigor and transparency of the approach adopted and
increased the internal consistency of the WACC parameters by using short- and long-term
averages for the various WACC parameters on a consistent basis. In addition, it has deep-
ened the analysis of benchmarks for the cost of debt and equity beta and incorporated cur-
rent market data more systematically in determining the WACC. Finally, it has signaled that


Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                          171
      it will more consistently set the WACC at the midpoint of its best estimate of the WACC. Two
      key points are that the ROE is now estimated using an equity beta3 that is the same as that
      used for electricity networks in Australia. The same approach is used to setting the WACC
      for the government-owned water utilities and the privately owned Sydney Desalination
      Plant (SDP).

      Estimation of Efficient OPEX and CAPEX
      Since adopting the building block approach, IPART has engaged major engineering
      and management consulting firms to review the efficiency of forecast OPEX and CAPEX
      for the next regulatory period and CAPEX in the previous regulatory period. The approach
      assessing OPEX has developed to, first, estimate a step-change for catchup efficiency
      based on an assessment of the efficiency of each of the water utilities compared to its
      peers, using high level benchmarks (e.g., OPEX per customer) and a review of the effi-
      ciency of major components of OPEX. Second, estimate a trending rate of change in
      productivity for the sector. Third, consider specific factors, such as increases in unit
      ­
      costs  beyond the control of the utility, and changes in outputs (volume of water and
      ­
      customers served) and service and environmental standards. The CAPEX assessment
      focuses on reviewing the quality of the planning and decision-making processes, as
      well as reviewing major projects and programs and a sample of minor projects and pro-
      grams. The assumed efficiency improvements in the reviews from 2003 have been signifi-
      cantly  below those in earlier determinations, and in the last regulatory period
      (2012–16)  SWC achieved greater efficiency improvements than were expected in the
      determination.

      IPART’s Current Approach to Setting Tariff Structures
      IPART’s approach to setting prices consistent with the determined ARR is outlined in
      box 16A.1. The key objectives that guide this approach are that (a) usage prices should reflect
      the relevant marginal costs to provide appropriate signals for water usage and discharges;
      (b) customers pay their fair share of the total costs of supply and there are no cross-­
      subsidies; and (c) customers who place the same demand on the system face the same or
      similar total bill.

      Allocation of Costs to Services

      The urban water suppliers provide four different services: (a) supply of water, (b) removal
      and treatment of standard discharges, (c) management of stormwater flows, and (d) removal
      and treatment of nonstandard discharges (“tradewaste”). Except for head office and infor-
      mation technology (IT) assets, the assets used for water supply, wastewater, and stormwater
      are largely separate from each other and easily identifiable. Furthermore, most of the costs
      are either asset-related costs (depreciation and ROA) or OPEX costs that are asset driven.
      This has meant that the allocation of costs between water, wastewater, and stormwater has
      been noncontroversial and IPART has accepted the allocations proposed by SWC and HWC.


172   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
  Tradewaste consists of wastes that are substantially different in composition from normal
waste, and impose additional costs of treatment and management to normal waste. Examples
include waste from food processing plants that have a higher biological oxygen demand and
wastes from specialized processing plants, even as small as dry cleaners, containing higher
concentrations of chemicals. Since the same assets handle tradewaste and normal wastewa-
ter, the identification of the costs of tradewaste has involved modeling of the differences in
costs of management, treatment, and asset maintenance for tradewaste discharges com-
pared to normal discharges. One exception to this is the extent to which stormwater infil-
trates the wastewater system, causing overflows during major storm events. This led IPART
to take the view that the capacity of the sewerage system is driven by peak flows in storm
events, not by normal effluent levels outside these events.


Water Charges

The first step in setting water charges has been to estimate the LRMC of the supply of the
water. The LRMC will depend on the current and projected supply and demand balance and
the timing and cost of supply augmentation. The incremental costs of meeting additional
demand are the costs of additional bulk water supply common to all customers within the
service territory of each utility. Hence, in principle, the LRMC is similar for all customers.4
  Given the uncertainties and the different methods used in the calculation of the LRMC,5
there can be quite a large range in the estimates of the LRMC. In the latest review, IPART’s esti-
mates of the LRMC ranged from $A 1.11 per kL to $A 1.62 per kL while SWC’s estimates ranged
from $A 1.18 per kL to $A 2.68 per kL. These estimates were significantly lower than previous
estimates of the LRMC, since the need for the next augmentation had been pushed further
into the future with the reduction in per capita water use and the construction of the SDP.
  The second step in setting water charges is to set the usage rate, which applies to all cus-
tomers. From its first determination, IPART had increased the usage charges to reflect the
estimated LRMC. This had initially been controversial but there was now strong community
support for “user pays.” Water was seen to be a valuable, scarce commodity and customers
appreciated the sense of control over their bill gained by paying for water on the basis of
usage rather than fixed charges. In the 2016 price review, SWC argued that the usage charge
should be reduced by a smaller amount (from $A 2.28 kL to $A 1.97 kL) than the reduction in
the estimated LRMC. First, there was considerable uncertainty in the estimation of LRMC
and $A 1.97 kL was still within a reasonable range for the estimation of LRMC. Second,
­
customers make long-term decisions to improve water efficiency through investments in
appliances and equipment and redesign of production processes, and greater consistency
of  prices through time would support more efficient decision-making by consumers.
Finally, consumer research showed strong support for continuing usage charges at previous
levels, rather than switching to lower usage charges and higher fixed charges. IPART’s deci-
sion to accept SWC’s proposal indicated that LRMC is not an absolute or certain pricing rule
and that customer preferences should also be considered.


Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                           173
        The third step in setting water charges calculates the revenue to be raised through fixed
      charges (service charges). Once the usage charge is determined, the revenue raised is esti-
      mated based on forecast water demand. This revenue is deducted from the total costs allo-
      cated to the provision of water services to then determine the revenue to be raised from
      fixed charges.
        The service charge for each customer (residential and nonresidential) is set with reference
      to the standard 20 mm residential meter: all residential customers are assumed to be con-
      nected using a 20 mm meter. Fixed charges for nonresidential customers connected with a
      20 mm meter are the same as for residential customers. The fixed charges for nonresidential
      customers connected using larger meters are set by the ratio of the cross-section areas of the
      pipes. That is, the charge for a customer connected with a 50 mm meter is 6.25 times that for
      a 20 mm connection.6
        The fixed charge per customer is then set in the fourth and final step. The fixed charge for
      the standard 20mm connection (and hence all other fixed charges for water service) is calcu-
      lated so that the revenue from all fixed charges from all customers equals the residual reve-
      nue to be collected as per step 3.


      Wastewater Charges

      The wastewater charges are set in a similar manner to water charges except that costs for
      residential customers are recovered through a fixed charge only, and whether usage charges
      for nonresidential customers should be based on short-run or long-run marginal costs has
      been a matter of debate. For residential customers, usage charges are not considered feasi-
      ble, hence a fixed charge is used to recover the costs of these customers. Previously, the fixed
      charges for customers in multidwelling premises were lower than for those in stand-alone
      dwellings. However, the charge is now the same for all residential customers, based on the
      argument that average loads vary according to the size of the household rather than the type
      of dwelling.
        Nonresidential customer costs are recovered through a fixed charge and a usage charge.
      Unless discharges are measured, wastewater volumes are estimated based on a discharge
      factor applied to the amount of water consumed. The standard discharge factor is 78 percent
      (i.e., discharges are 78 percent of water consumed), but customers can apply for nonstan-
      dard discharge factors based on the nature of their production process and their use of water.
        Current usage charges ($A 1.10 per kL for SWC) reflect the estimated LRMC. In its review of
      pricing principles (IPART 2012), IPART had proposed that short-run marginal costs provide
      the better price signal and that usage charges should transition to the estimated SRMC
      ($A  0.25 per kL to $A 0.30 per kL for SWC). There were two arguments to support this.
      First, there is significant stormwater infiltration of the sewer system during major storms,
      and the capital costs are substantially driven by these peak loads during storms rather than
      wastewater discharges in normal periods. Second, IPART argued that the LRMC varied sub-
      stantially between different wastewater drainage basins within the service areas of SWC and


174   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
HWC. Hence, a single wastewater charge based on the LRMC would understate the true
LRMC in some areas and overstate it in others. These points were contested by SWC and
HWC, and customers expressed concern about the possible impact of the large reduction in
usage charges and a consequent large increase in fixed charges. As a result, IPART has not
enforced the transition to SRMC and is going to undertake a further review of the issue.
  The fixed charge for a nonresidential customer with a 20 mm meter is the same as the fixed
charge for a residential customer on a standard 20 mm meter, and includes a discharge
allowance of 150 kL pa. Fixed charges and discharge allowances for customers on larger
meters are pro-rated based on the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the connecting pipes.


Stormwater Charges

There are many variables that affect the stormwater run-off from a property and hence the
costs it imposes. These include the size of the property, the proportion of nonpermeable
surfaces, the slope of the property, and the receiving basins and waters. Initially, stormwater
was charged on a simple per customer basis. This created an inequity whereby a small flat
was charged the same as a much larger house that created a larger run-off and larger load on
the stormwater system. Hence, IPART has moved to a system of charging on the basis of
property area for nonresidential customers. This is still an imperfect system as it captures
only one of the many factors that impact stormwater loads. However, IPART has provided
for a new category of low impact customers that are charged the same rate as medium-sized
customers. Residential customers are not charged directly on the property area, but the
fixed charge per dwelling for multidwelling premises (e.g., apartments, town houses) is
lower than that for stand-alone houses based on the lower average property size and imper-
vious surfaces per dwelling.


Tradewaste Charges

The tradewaste charges are based on the measured composition and volumes of tradewaste
from businesses that are assessed to have discharges substantially different from the normal
composition. Cost models have been developed that assess the impact on costs of specific
elements in the components of the waste (such as specific metals that are difficult to treat or
dispose of, or biological oxygen demand that affects treatment and asset maintenance costs).
From this, a charge scale for these components is established, and tradewaste customers are
charged on the basis of this scale and the composition of their waste.
  The cost model and charging scale was initially controversial, and IPART required SWC to
engage with their tradewaste customers on the proposed charging scale. SWC was very
transparent on the basis of their costs models, walking customers through the effect of dif-
ferent types of waste on SWC’s costs and how this was translated into the charges. In response
to input from customers, SWC modified some of the proposed charges. This process of
engagement increased the level of understanding and ensured the resulting acceptance of
the proposed charges.

      	 3.	 Under CAPM, the return on equity = the risk-free rate + (the market risk premium X the equity beta), in which the equity
          beta is a measure of relative systematic risk.

      	 4.	 Pumping costs and incremental distribution costs may vary between regions, but there is strong support from the commu-
          nity and government for postage stamp pricing (i.e., the same price applies across the service territory of a utility).

      	 5.	 The two most common methods are average incremental costs and the Turvey perturbation method. Depending on the
          supply and demand balance, the difference in the estimates using these two methods can be quite large.

180   Australian Urban Water Reform Story
Appendix C   Literature Summary

             A key stage in the research leading to this report was to conduct a thorough literature review
             related to Australia’s urban water reform process. The aim was twofold: to (a) fill gaps in the
             current knowledge base, and (b) help inform the direction and scope of stakeholder inter-
             views in the next stage of the research.
               Searches of the literature yielded significant amounts of material on approaches to improve
             the economic return on public investment in water supply systems including efficiency
             reforms in line with national competition policy initiatives (see Horne 2013; LECG 2011;
             Productivity Commission 2011). Similarly, the last decade has seen an outpouring of material
             on government and utility responses to the critical issue of changing climatic conditions,
             observed keenly during the Millennium Drought period (see Head 2014; Marsden and
             Pickering 2006; Troy 2008; van Dijk et al. 2013; Wittwer 2013).
               An emerging body of literature discusses the urban water sector’s contemporary
             approaches to, or sometimes institutional barriers to, integrated urban water management
             and water-sensitive urban design: a next phase of the reform movement (see Brown and
             Farrelly 2009; Choi and McIlrath 2016; McCallum and Boulot 2015). In addition, a consider-
             able body of “gray” literature has been produced by or on behalf of government departments
             and agencies to document the water reform process and aspects of water utilities’ perfor-
             mance (see BOM 2016; DPMC 2007; NWC 2006; NWC 2014b).
               However, little contemporary scholarly work has been dedicated to a longitudinal account
             of the progression of urban water reforms in Australia, with the exception of a few historical
             analyses of large-scale utility expansions or regional adaptations to reform initiatives (see
             Abbott et al. 2011; Crase et al. 2000; Lloyd et al. 1992), and critical interpretations of localized
             planning or infrastructure developments in response to increasing population density and
             resource demand (see Davis and Farrelly 2009; Evans 1994; NWC 2012).
               A key focus of much of the existing literature discusses how the governance and institu-
             tional changes during the 1980s–90s reform era influenced the development of water policy
             and the restructuring of utilities and the sector. Largely, this literature frames the reforms as
             positive and the changes as successful (see Abbott et al. 2011; Berg 2014; Saleth and Dinar
             2005). However, in the last two decades, reports have been published that depict some of the
             reform efforts as counterproductive (in terms of price stabilization, demand management,
             or social cost), or not quite as influential in refashioning water management or water use as
             most studies depict (see Quiggin 2007; Sheil 2000; Syme 2008).
               Another divide in the literature is an emphasis on particular targets of the reforms, in
             which many accounts typically are couched in terms of economic outcomes or efficiency
             dividends (see Abbott et al. 2011; Carroll and Head 2010; Grafton et al. 2015). This reflects an
             early and very important focus of the reform process, as water agencies and
             utilities—especially those major urban utilities in the economic reform vanguard of
             New South Wales and Victoria—responded to (or in some respects inspired) the national


             Australian Urban Water Reform Story                                                             181
      competition and corporatization agendas. More recently, the literature emphasis has altered
      somewhat to incorporate considerations of “public good” outcomes, and attempt to accen-
      tuate social, environmental, and sustainability results or benefits that have derived from
      the reforms (see AWA 2016; Crase 2008; Johnson and Rix 1993; Kaspura 2006).
        A noticeable absence in the literature is close analysis of the implementation and impact of
      the reform process in separate Australian states and territories, save for a handful of case
      studies that tend to focus on the responses of particular regions or cities or urban utilities to
      policy “stresses,” or on policy initiatives and reform targets that played out in certain loca-
      tions (see Barkatullah 1999; Byrnes 2010; Head 2014; NWC 2011b). Generally, there appears
      to be little concerted effort to record how the reforms were implemented or championed in
      different parts of the country—or how these linked to the broader national agenda—in favor
      of a solely “big picture” coverage of the national scale of the reforms (see Byrnes 2013; Smith
      et al. 2014; Taylor 2008).
        Recently a number of publications have filled some of the gaps outlined previously, and
      indeed flesh out the historical and procedural context in documenting and understanding
      Australia’s urban water reform process (see Doolan 2016a; Doolan 2016b; Frost et al. 2016;
      Turner et al. 2016). In particular, the reports compiled by Prof. Jane Doolan (2016a; 2016b) for
      the Australian Water Partnership offer incisive and quite relevant analyses of the progres-
      sion of water reforms (both urban and rural) in Australia. The report on the Australian water
      reform journey (Doolan 2016a) traces the macro-level decisions and initiatives in the water
      sector over the last three decades. Overall, themes and lessons drawn from this report are
      deliberately practitioner-focused, and are therefore potentially transferable to other national
      contexts. The additional report (Doolan 2016b) focuses on attempts in Australia at building
      resilience to drought, tracing government and water industry reforms in response to the
      Millennium Drought, such as regional and cross-jurisdiction water allocation rights and
      environmental and water resource management. This report draws heavily from the
      Managing Drought report (Turner et al. 2016).
        In summary, there is not an extensive body of research that details which aspects of the
      reform process in Australia have generated successful changes and where. A decade-old
      study by the World Bank (2004); also cited in Langford and Briscoe 2011, and Smith et al. 2014)
      highlights two characteristics among its lessons from the Australian reform process for
      others: (a) while reform was guided by a common vision, and directed toward a common
      goal, reform was achieved while respecting the need for different approaches among the
      states; and (b) reform was achieved without significant change in the dominant role of the
      public sector; therefore, substantial privatization has been the exception in Australia’s water
      sector rather than the norm (see Araral and Wang 2013; Troy 2008; World Bank 2014).
        While the existing documentation identifies some of the positive steps that have resulted
      in effective practices from organizational, cost-recovery and sustainability perspectives (see
      Abbott et al 2012; Brown et al 2009; Byrnes 2013), translation of the Australian reforms to
      other contexts is complicated by factors such as complex hydrological systems and climate

need to ensure that reform agendas can allow the emergence of more effective and resilient
practices tailored to suit separate and quite distinct jurisdictions (see Muller 2007; O’Leary
2016; Olsson and Head 2015; World Bank 2014, 2016).
