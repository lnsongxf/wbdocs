How has Belarus shared in terms of poverty reduction and shared prosperity over the past
decade and a half? This paper has the goal of presenting the first comprehensive update of poverty,
inequality and shared prosperity trends – and key drivers of these trends – since 2003 until 2015, that
is starting with the end of the most recent poverty assessment published in 2004 and that covered the
period 1997-2002. In addition to discussing the past trends, the paper also aims to present some
emerging challenges to continued poverty reduction and inclusive growth in the near future. Relying
on data from the Household Sample Survey, the paper focuses on the dynamics of the main sources
of livelihood of households – labor income, pensions as well as direct transfers and indirect subsidies
– as key contributors to the evolution of overall disposable incomes of households, in order to
understand what lay behind the evolution of poverty and shared prosperity of the 2003-2015 period.
The paper also complements the cross-sectional, but more detailed, look at the contribution of the
Belarus fiscal system to poverty and inequality provided by the Commitment to Equity analysis
(Bornukova, Shymanovich and Chubrik, 2017), by providing a temporal dimension.

The evolution of poverty and shared prosperity in Belarus should be viewed in the context of
rapid economic growth during 2000-2008, followed by a period of slower growth, and
increased volatility, ending in recession. The economy of Belarus grew rapidly between 2000 and
2008, underpinned by energy supplies from Russia, the strong economic growth among Belarus’s main
trading partners, and substantial terms of trade gains. State intervention has also helped soften budget
constraints and delay restructuring in the economy. High economic growth and full employment were
key elements of the Belarus socioeconomic model and SOEs remained the main engine of
employment. The public sector has been a source of employer of last resort, while centralized wage-
setting system delivered lower cross-sectional wage differentials. Following the financial crisis of 2008,
the growth model has started reaching its limits. Real GDP growth had become increasingly dependent
on capital accumulation, supported, in part, by external savings, and leading to the accumulation of
public debt. The steep fall in the price of oil in the world market after June 2014 and the subsequent
tightening of the external borrowing constraint facing Belarus triggered a recession in 2015, the first
recession since 1995.

Overall poverty and shared prosperity trends
The period of rapid economic growth has been associated with considerable poverty
reduction and high growth of living standards among the bottom 40 population. Measured at
the internationally-comparable PPP US$5/day threshold, the poverty headcount fell from 32 percent
in 2003 to less than 1 percent in 2014. For a higher threshold of PPP US$10/day, the share of the
population of Belarus living in households with the level of purchasing power below that threshold
fell from 82 percent in 2003 to less than 10 percent in 2014. While poverty has been falling across the
whole Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region during this period, Belarus has outperformed the ECA
region during the earlier years before the financial crisis in 2009 – while in 2001 the US$ 5/day poverty
rate in Belarus was similar to the ECA-wide poverty headcount, by 2008, the $5/day poverty rate in
Belarus has fallen much lower than in the ECA region as a whole, and indeed it was at the same level
as the $2.5/day poverty headcount for ECA (Error! Reference source not found.Figure 0-1).

Within Belarus, economic growth and poverty reduction has also been associated with falling
spatial disparities. From the starting point in 2003, when Belarus has a much lower incidence of
poverty in Minsk than in other urban and rural areas, the past decade has been characterized by a
process of regional absolute convergence between Minsk and the rest of the country. For the $10/day
threshold, in Minsk the poverty headcount fell by 54 percentage points between 2003 and 2014,
whereas rural areas recorded a 75 percentage points reduction in the poverty rate during the same
period. The data suggest a greater contribution of large cities to overall poverty reduction during the
earlier years (2003-2008), whereas during 2008-2015 a larger proportion of overall decline in the
poverty headcount was due to falling rural poverty.

Despite overall income growth and poverty reduction during this period, along some
dimensions the disparities between the B40 and the T60 groups have increased. The evolution
of the profile of the population in the bottom two quintiles of the population over the 2003-2015
period reveals that on indicators such as the share of young dependents, as well as prevalence of high
educational attainment (tertiary education), there is a divergence rather than a convergence between
the B40 and T60 groups. Moreover, the B40 group remains more heavily concentrated in rural areas,
and with lower access to core public services, although on this dimension we observe a convergence
overtime. These patterns suggest that constraints remain to the income-generating capacity of the B40
group going forward, that could, for instance, in the case of education, accentuate disparities between
B40 and T60 groups in the future.

Belarus has performed well in terms of the World Bank’s shared prosperity indicator. For a
region-wide comparable time period, Belarus has exhibited the highest rate of growth of expenditures
in the bottom 40 group during the 2006-2011 period (almost 9 percent on an annualized basis), at a
time when many of the European countries were suffering from the effects of the financial crisis,
registering negative growth of incomes both for the population overall and for the B40 group. As the
economy slowed down further in 2015, the growth of incomes both in the B40 and the T60 groups

                                                                                                     5
decelerated, yet welfare of the B40 group still grew faster than that of the T60 group, and compared
to the ECA region and a number of Western European countries, incomes were growing relatively
fast, below only Georgia and Kazakhstan.

Main drivers of poverty reduction and shared prosperity
Growth in wages and pensions were the main drivers of shared prosperity in Belarus,
particularly prior to the financial crisis, with an increasing importance of social transfers in
the second half of the period. A large share of disposable income growth during the 2003-2009
period (68 percent of total) was due to growth in wages during the same period. Aside from growth
in wages, the second important factor was growth in pensions, contributing 20 percent of overall
disposable income growth, followed by the growth of other income sources. During the years
following the financial crisis (2009-2015), the absolute growth rates of wages were considerably lower,
and the relative contribution of wages to total income growth was also lower – 47 percent of total.
The relative contribution of pensions to B40 income growth increased from 20 percent during the
first period to 34 percent during the second period, and also the contribution of other transfers, such
as child benefits and other social assistance increased slightly from 3 percent of total to 12.5 percent
of total.

Real wage growth and greater employment among the B40 group were behind labor income
growth over the past decade. The data suggest improvements in the educational attainment during
2003-2015 for both the B40 and the T60 groups, as well as a partial (absolute) convergence between
B40 and T60 educational endowment during this period – in percentage points terms the decline in
the share of population with no more than general secondary population was greater in the B40 group,
although the incidence of higher education increased faster in the T60 group. Educational gains

in households) that receive wage income increased between 2003 and 2009, but these changes were

small, which is suggestive of the fact that strong labor income growth was primarily driven by increases
in the real value of wages. Indeed, taking the index of wage levels in 2003 as 100, wages grew steadily
during 2003-2015 and in 2015 were 207 percent of the 2003 level in constant prices, normalized by
the GDP deflator; in comparison, the value of a similar index of GDP per worker was 177 in 2015.
The Government sets both economy-wide, as well as regional and town-level targets on a recurrent
basis, and these targets apply to the entire economy, including the private sector. Wage targets also
resulted in little differentiation in wages across regions, and across sectors, while administrative
restrictions on wage structures also result in redistribution of incomes in favor of low-income workers
in sectors with low wages (IMF, 2014). B40 wages, as a share of T60 wages increased from 55 percent
in 2003 to 65 percent by 2015. However, B40 still have poorer labor market outcomes. They have
higher unemployment rates, more often work in less secure jobs (e.g. without written contracts) and
tend to work in the sectors with lower wages.

Pensions grew in lock step with wages, the pension system benefiting from a favorable
demographic environment from a fiscal point of view. Low birth rates and survival rates for the
1940-1946 cohorts, resulting in low numbers of pensioners in recent years, created a favorable
environment for the pay-as-you-go PAYG pension system. During the 2003-2015 period the levels of
pensions in real terms increased steadily, being recalculated in accordance with the growth of average
wages. In fact, for the B40 population, pensions grew relatively faster between 2003 and 2015 in
comparison with the T60 population. The pension system in Belarus is characterized by a notable
degree of redistribution that protects the incomes of low income households. Bornukova,
Shymanovich and Chubrik (2017) estimate that pensions reduced the Gini index of inequality in
Belarus by 11 points relative to the Gini index of market incomes.

The importance of social transfers has increased in recent years, particularly for certain
population groups. According to 2015 data, over half of the population (63 percent of the bottom
quintile) were covered by social assistance in Belarus, higher than the ECA average (48.6 percent), but
in like with the average for High Income countries (64 percent), or countries neighboring countries
like Poland (61 percent). The targeting of the social assistance system in Belarus (excluding privileges)
has deteriorated between 2003 and 2015, while the reliance on transfers among those who received
them has increased over time. In 2003 and 2009 public transfers accounted for 12 percent of income
in the B40 group, increasing to 20 percent in 2015. The increase in the importance of subsidies is both
due to the increase in the magnitude of transfers, and also falling incomes in 2015 due to the recession.
The system of transfers as a whole is progressive – in the absence of benefits the Gini index of
inequality would increase by 2 percentage points – and a number of benefits (unemployment benefits,
child benefits) are also very efficient, per unit of resources spent, in terms of their effect on reducing
poverty and inequality. On the other hand, the progressivity and effectiveness of the extensive system
of privileges – the scope of which has diminished during 2009-2015, is considerably lower.

Some emerging challenges to future shared prosperity
The recent deterioration of the external environment has shone a light on the degree of
vulnerability of low income households and raises questions about the sustainability of past
shared prosperity gains. In 2015 the poverty headcount at PPP $10/day increased by 2.5 percentage
points at the national level, and in rural areas by almost 6 percentage points (i.e. by 30 percent) in just
one year. The negative economic outlook, coupled with expectations of increasing unemployment due

to SOE reforms, as well as relatively high inflation in 2016 (13 percent) will continue eroding the
purchasing power of household incomes and may lead to further increases in poverty in 2016. The
fact that there is also a large number of households just above the $10/day threshold suggests that
absent mitigating measures, further erosion of household welfare, such as on account of increasing
utilities tariffs, can be associated with further increases in the poverty rate. The data on the dynamics
of household incomes and expenditures in 2015-2016 is consistent with households at the lower end
of the welfare distribution drawing down on savings to maintain consumption levels despite falling
incomes. However, this is not a sustainable strategy if household incomes continue to deteriorate.

While the economy faces multiple challenges, this paper highlights two challenges to
inclusive growth, the prominence of which is being accentuated by the recent recession – the
impact of population ageing, and the need to provide an adequate safety net in the context of
ongoing reforms, notably in the utilities sector. With respect to aging, as this process continues,
the prominence of elderly population in the B40 group – and the prominence of pensions in the
livelihoods of many households – will increase, creating pressure on the pension system, and brining
to the fore the importance of the active ageing agenda. The share of 60+ population in Belarus is
projected to increase from 15 percent in 2000 to 35 percent in 2050, while the old age dependency
ratio is projected to increase from 20 percent in 2000 to 46 percent in 2050. As the result of the
shrinking working age population, and the increase in the share of elderly in Belarus, the projected
fiscal flows in the pensions system in Belarus are projected to deteriorate, and the pension fund deficit
could reach an equivalent of 9 percent of GDP by 2050 (Bornukova et al., 2015). The share of pension
recipients both in the B40 population and in the T60 population increased between 2003 and 2015,
and will continue increasing in the future, such future pension dynamics will play an increasingly
important role in overall disposable income growth.

Meanwhile, ongoing reforms in the utilities sector will diminish the support to households in
the form of subsidized utilities prices, which, absent compensatory measures, can have a
notable welfare impact. Utilities subsidies are available to everyone in Belarus in the form of
subsidized tariffs and account for about 2 percent of GDP. They are also strongly regressive – low
tariffs disproportionately benefit higher income groups, while also leading to inefficient energy
consumption. Simulations suggest that increasing heating tariffs to cost recovery levels would lead to
a notable increase in the share of the overall budget that households would have to allocate to utilities
payments, and this increase would be the highest for low income households. In the bottom decile
the share of household budgets devoted to utilities during the heating season in urban areas could
increase from 11.6 percent of total to 16.5 percent of total by the end of 2017 (to 20 percent by the
end of 2018), under some of the recent tariff projections, and without any compensation. The
Government has introduced, at the beginning of the 2016 heating season, a compensatory program
that limits the impact of tariff increases, however it is estimated to only partially offset increasing
prices.

The most recent poverty assessment for Belarus was undertaken over a decade ago, and covers the
period through 2002 (World Bank, 2004). The report highlighted several salient patterns of poverty in
Belarus, including (i) the much lower incidence of poverty in the capital city of Minsk, (ii) strong links
between poverty and educational attainment; and (iii) higher poverty risk among collective farmers
and pensioners, as well as highlighting the notable pay differences among men and women. The
poverty assessment also highlighted several dimensions of fragility with respect to the poverty
reduction gains in Belarus, including unsustainable increases in real wages in excess of productivity; as
well as Russian subsidies, particularly for imported natural gas – an input for utility companies.

Since the publication of the last poverty assessment, Belarus has experienced rapid economic growth
-- per capita GDP grew at a rate of 8.6 percent per year during the 2000-2008 period. This performance
exceeded the average for the ECA region; Belarus was located at the 80th percentile of per capita GDP
growth performance among ECA countries. The rate of growth also exceeded the average
performance of other Upper Middle Income countries, as well as that of oil importing countries, or
countries designated by the IMF as “Emerging and Developing” – all countries groupings of which
Belarus is a member. With the advent of the financial crisis in 2009, growth stalled (GDP per capita
grew by 0.2 percent in 2009), but then quickly rebounded to 7.7 percent in 2010. During the 2010-
2015 period, the economy of Belarus, and of the ECA region as a whole, grew at half the pace of the
2000-2008 period, with the performance of Belarus aligned with the ECA average, but still high in
comparison with Upper Middle Income, and especially with OECD countries. In 2015 the Belarusian
economy entered a recession, which continued into 2016 and permeated most sectors of economic
activity. The poverty reduction trend was halted and poverty increased in 2015 and 2016.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a first comprehensive update of poverty, inequality and shared
prosperity trends – and key drivers of these trends – over the past decade, starting with the end of the
most recent poverty assessment, that is to focus on the period 2003 – 2015 (last available data point).
This paper thus aims to undertake an analysis of recent trends on poverty and shared prosperity in

                                                                                                        9
Belarus, highlighting links between poverty and shared prosperity with labor markets and fiscal
systems. The paper also provide a first detailed look into the evolution of the shared prosperity
indicator (i.e. the growth of expenditures of the bottom 40 percent) and the evolution of the profile
of the bottom 40 percent of the population over the same period, to assess whether the underlying
characteristics of the population either below the poverty line or vulnerable to poverty changed in
notable ways over the past decade. The paper aims to serve several objectives including building core
knowledge base on recent poverty and shared prosperity profile and trends in Belarus and making
such a knowledge base available for the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), and ongoing reforms
in the utilities sector.

The main data source for the analysis is the Household Sample Survey (HSS), which is available
annually for the period 1995-2015. The analysis will rely primarily on data for the period 2003-2015.
The data is a repeated cross section with information on (i) household composition; (ii) income
sources, both labor incomes and transfers; (iii) household expenditures, inclusively on utilities; (iv)
housing conditions and amenities. The HSS also includes individual-level data on education and
incomes for each household member. For each of the datasets, a standardized welfare distribution is
available based on the ECAPOV harmonization, on which welfare categorization, including
internationally comparable poverty thresholds and the indicators such as shared prosperity, describing
the bottom forty percent of the population in any given year, will be based. In addition, the study will
also rely on other official statistics published by Belstat, including statistics on social conditions and
the standard of living, as well as well as national account statistics and economic statistics on the
evolution of the structure of the economy, of the labor market, and of the social protection system.

A key data limitation, which restricts the scope of the analysis that is feasible, is the lack of Labor
Force Survey (LFS) data. This is particularly constraining in light of the fact that the HSS data does
not contain any information of the labor market characteristics of household members, including their
labor market status, sectoral and occupational distribution of employment, or characteristics of
unemployment, job search or inactivity. The only inference on labor markets that is possible with the
data at hand through the availability in the HSS of data on income sources, which allows us to
construct some proxies for employment status based on wage receipts. In order to address this notable
data constraint, the paper also relies on data from the Life in Transition Survey (LiTS), an attitudinal
survey implemented by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) for a small,
but nationally representative sample of adults in Belarus (and other ECA countries), but which has an
a more detailed employment module.

The paper is structured as follows: section 2 provides a brief overview of macroeconomic
developments over the past decade in order to put the track record of poverty, inequality and shared
prosperity into a broader economic context. Section 3 presents an overview of poverty, inequality and
shared prosperity dynamics during the 2003-2015 period. Section 4 looks in more details at the key
factors that contributed to the poverty and shared prosperity dynamics described in section 3. Section
5 outlines several challenges to sustaining shared prosperity in the future. Section 6 concludes.

The economy of Belarus grew rapidly between 2000 and 2008, underpinned by energy supplies from
Russia, the strong economic growth among Belarus’s main trading partners, and substantial terms of
trade gains. Belarus benefited strongly from the implicit subsidies in the form of underpriced energy
from Russia by importing energy at below world prices and exporting refined oil and other energy-
intensive products at world market prices. Between 2006 and 2008, the prices of oil products doubled,
while the prices of domestically produced fertilizers tripled. As a result, Belarusian exports became
increasingly driven by the dynamics of world commodity prices. In addition, strong economic growth
of trading partners in the CIS, and especially Russia, which alone accounted for over two-thirds of
Belarus’s total non-energy exports during 2001–2008, benefited exports of machinery and agricultural
goods. For 2001-2008, the share of CIS in machinery and agricultural exports was even higher: over
85 and almost 90 percent, respectively. Demand for exports from Belarus was strong on the back of
favorable oil prices boosting growth in the CIS, especially Russia.

address the problem of biased fixed investment deflators. Available data on capital stock display its unnatural stability, as
throughout the last 20 years, the annual growth rate of capital stock in real terms fluctuates around two percent. In order
to minimize the bias, alternative deflators for the whole economy and the selected sectors are constructed by re-evaluating
the capital stock. Source: Staff estimates based on Belstat data.

After 2005, economic growth became increasingly reliant on domestic demand. The decline in energy
subsidies from Russia exposed structural vulnerabilities of the economy. With little ability to diversify
its export products and markets to reduce its dependence on underpriced energy inputs economic
growth in Belarus became less export driven and domestic demand had to be boosted. Growth was
backed by large state support to the economy, sizeable public investments, and state-induced

expansion of credit, particularly under government directed lending programs. Economic growth was
driven mainly by capital accumulation. In addition, rapidly growing real wages fueled growth in
consumption. Real wage and income growth outpaced productivity gains and, thus, became an
additional factor contributing to the loss of competitiveness of Belarus.

State intervention has also helped soften budget constraints and delay restructuring in the economy.
The expansion of credit was driven by growing dominance of the GDL programs, under which large
state-owned banks allocate credit to priority sectors, projects, and individual companies at subsidized
interest rates, often with explicit government guarantees. GDL programs supported agriculture and
housing construction, but did not necessarily fund the most productive investments. Credit has
expanded across all sectors of the economy; however, the agriculture and construction sectors—the
main recipient sectors of GDL—have seen disproportionate increases.

Up until about 2009 high economic growth and full employment were key elements of the Belarus
socioeconomic model and SOEs remained the main engine of employment. The public sector has
been a source of employer of last resort, while centralized wage-setting system delivered lower cross-
sectional wage differentials. As the evidence in the next section will suggest, the economic growth in
Belarus during this period was pro-poor, helping to reduce the incidence of poverty and to increase
the average standard of living. Low poverty incidence and low income differentiation also helped to
strengthen the domestic demand which was relatively easy for local producers to meet.

Following the financial crisis of 2008, the growth model has started reaching its limits, however. Real
GDP growth had become increasingly dependent on capital accumulation, supported, in part, by SIPs
and external savings, leading to the accumulation of public debt. Growth was relying mainly on
investments. At the same time, increasing capital-labor ratios in Belarus did not result in higher total
factor productivity growth.1 Competitiveness deteriorated, as total factor productivity dynamics in the
tradable sectors worsened vis-à-vis the non-tradable sectors. The sources of competitive advantage
that had served Belarusian industry well in the 1980s and until mid-2000s—economies of scale in
production, economies of scope in distribution and sales, brand recognition with channels serving the
former Soviet Union markets, better information about customers’ preferences—began to dissipate
in the increasingly globalized market. During 2011-2015, only five sectors out of 24—construction,
mining, transports, communications, and finance—display positive TFP dynamics.

After the thirst shock of 2008-2009, the government responded with fiscal and monetary stimulus.
During the second half of 2010 (in the Presidential election run-up) macroeconomic policies were
loosened, resulting in the balance of payment crisis. The large and unsustainable external imbalances
put pressure on reserves in early 2011, and the NBRB was unable to defend the Belarusian rubel
through foreign exchange interventions. It devalued the national currency by 67 percent over six
months of 2011, while inflation soared to 108 percent and banking system became fragile. As a result,
the country experienced high external financing needs. A number of adjustment measures were

implemented (unification of the ER, reduction in government directed lending and budget
consolidation measures), including receiving the rescue package from the Anti-Crisis Fund and Russia
which provided some breathing space. Macroeconomic stability was restored in 2012 but the situation
remained fragile and annual growth decelerated to less than 1.5 percent in 2012-2014.

The steep fall in the price of oil in the world market after June 2014 and the subsequent tightening of
the external borrowing constraint facing Belarus triggered a recession in 2015, the first recession since
1995. GDP contracted by 3.8 percent in 2015, while private consumption declined by 2.4 percent and
investment by 15.9 percent. Underlying Belarus’s recession were deep seated structural rigidities
exposed by a 3.7 percent simultaneous contraction of the Russian economy. The high exposure to
external shocks because of a large dependency on the Russian market was further exacerbated by a
narrow concentration of the export basket on mineral products and fertilizers. As the Russian ruble
plummeted at the end of 2014, pressures on the Belarusian national currency intensified which
depreciated by 36 percent against US dollar and 19 percent against Russian ruble during 2015.

The recession was also reflected in the deterioration of labor market outcomes. Throughout 2015,
employment decreased by 1.4 percent y/y, while unemployment increased. The deterioration of labor
market conditions was also evident at the firm level, through falling working hours (inclusively through
partially-paid and unpaid leave). In January-September 2015, 8.3 percent of the active labor force
worked reduced hours (compared to only 3.5 percent during the previous year), and 5.3 percent were
subject to production stoppages, including at large SOEs and industrial sectors such as vehicles,
transport equipment, machinery, and household appliances. In 2015, real wages declined by 2.3
percent. Since January 2015, a number of firms facing financial difficulties failed to pay wages, with
nearly 500 companies accumulating arrears totaling 1.7 percent of the gross wage bill in the economy2.
The economic situation then continued to deteriorate further throughout 2016, although at a slower
pace than in the previous year.3 At the same time, on the household side, the negative shock was even
more pronounced in 2016. Real earnings fell by 3.8 percent in 2016; the contraction of real disposable
incomes of the population in 2016 (7.3 percent y/y) was similarly more severe than in 2015 (5.9
percent y/y).

External shocks have required tightening of domestic demand policies and greater exchange rate
flexibility in 2015 and 2016. In order to safeguard achievements in macroeconomic stabilization and
address structural constraints, the authorities have started to implement a number of relevant policy
measures, including a partial abolition of price controls over socially important goods and services,
raising of the utility tariffs, and tightening of the conditions for new government directed lending and
long-term financial assistance to SOEs. To mitigate the effects of economic downturn, the authorities

2 While reflecting serious financial problems at the firm level, the wage arrears are not as sizable as those experienced in
the early 2000s. Wage debts jumped to 7.5 percent of the gross wage bill in the economy after the Presidential elections
of 2001, upon the electoral pledge to raise monthly wages to $100 throughout all sectors, regardless of productivity
considerations. Even loss-making enterprises were expected to pay this wage, being granted with tax deferrals and/or
bank loans.
3 The most recent contraction occurred in export-oriented sectors, such as metallurgy, production of electrical

equipment, machinery and transport equipment, which traditionally export to Russia. In contrast, food, wood
processing, pharmaceuticals and other light industries reported growth.

are in the process of implementing a set of policies to regain competitiveness and to begin diversifying
the economy. In April 2016, the Government approved 2016-2020 Action Plan, aimed to regain
competiveness, reduce vulnerability to developments in the external environment, and to restore
economic growth. The Government has successfully negotiated a program with the Eurasian Fund
for Stabilization and Development (EFSD), and is currently discussing with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) a parallel program.


          3. POVERTY, INEQUALITY AND SHARED PROSPERITY
                      DYNAMICS DURING 2003-2015

Against this macroeconomic background presented in section 2, this section reviews the dynamics of
poverty, inequality and shared prosperity over the past decade and a half, both through the period of
rapid economic growth and the recent recession. In particular, the section aims to describe the
dynamics of poverty along key dimensions, both spatial and for different population groups, as well
as provide an account of shared prosperity and the composition of the B40 population over time. In
addition to describing dynamics, the section also tries to put the performance registered by Belarus
into international context.

          3.1.    POVERTY FELL DRAMATICALLY BETWEEN 2003 AND 2014

The poverty rate in Belarus fell precipitously between 2003 and 2014. Measured at the internationally-
comparable PPP US$5/day threshold, the poverty headcount fell from 32 percent in 2003 to less than
1 percent in 2014. For a higher threshold of PPP US$10/day, the share of the population of Belarus
living in households with the level of purchasing power below that threshold fell from 82 percent in
2003 to less than 10 percent in 2014, before increasing to 12.3 percent in 2015 (Figure 3-1).

A recent study of economic mobility in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region (Cancho et al.,
2015) defines the following four economic classes: individuals living on less than $2.5 PPP per day
(the regional extreme poverty line); individuals living on US$2.5 to $5 PPP per day (the regional
moderate poverty line); individuals living on $5 to $10 PPP per day and individuals living with $10

                                                                                                     14
PPP or more per day. Individuals with per capita expenditures of US$5-10 per day are considered as
being vulnerable to falling back into poverty, whereas individuals with per capita expenditures in
excess of US$10/day are defined as middle class. 4 Based on these welfare groupings, the share of
population vulnerable to poverty in Belarus fell from 50 percent of the population in 2003 to less than
10 percent of the population in 2014. At the same time, the share of the middle class population
increased from under 20 percent to over 90 percent during the same time period, before falling to 88
percent in 2015. One notable characteristic of the poverty reduction dynamics during this period is
that the pace of the reduction of the share of poor and vulnerable population on the one hand, and
the pace of the expansion of the middle class on the other hand, was quite constant throughout the
whole period, with the slowing down of the pace of poverty reduction only observed in 2009, with
the onset of the financial crisis, then picking up again during 2010-2012, and only slowing down during
the last 2 years (2013-2014), before the recession of 2015 resulted in an uptick of poverty.

It should be noted that the process of poverty reduction and of the expansion of the middle class
during the past decade was a more general process in the ECA region. For instance, according to
regional estimates, the share of the population of the ECA regions below the PPP US$5/day threshold
fell from 38 percent in 2003 to 13 percent in 2013, and the share of the population below the PPP
US$10/day threshold fell from 73 percent to just below 47 percent during the same period (Figure
3-2). However, even against this background of overall income growth and poverty reduction in the
region more broadly, Belarus stands out the country with the smallest share of poor population (below
$2.5/day threshold), alongside Slovenia, and also the country with one of the smallest shares of

At the subnational level, in 2003 the profile of poverty is described by a much lower incidence of
poverty (both $5/day and $10/day) in Minsk than in other urban areas and rural areas. While for the
$5/day threshold there are also notable differences in the incidence of poverty between large cities,
small cities and rural areas, for the $10/day threshold the headcount is broadly similar for these three
type of residence areas, all of which standing out against the lower incidence of poverty in the nation’s
capital. From this starting point, the past decade has been characterized by a process of regional absolute
convergence between Minsk and the rest of the country. For instance, for the $10/day threshold, in Minsk
the poverty headcount fell by 54 percentage points between 2003 and 2014, whereas rural areas
recorded a 75 percentage points reduction in the poverty rate during the same period (Figure 3-4). It
is also the case, however, that during the recession in 2015 the PPP $10/day headcount increased by
over 5 percentage points from 18.3 percent to 23.9 percent, whereas in Minsk no increase in poverty
incidence was observed – the PPP $10/day poverty headcount fell between 2014 and 2015.

This is confirmed by the formal decomposition of changes in the $10/day poverty headcount between
2003 and 2015 by type of residence. The decomposition, based on Huppi and Ravallion, (1991), allows
for changes in the overall national poverty headcount to be decomposed into “intra-sectoral” changes
(here sectors being the different residential categories), as well as changes due to geographic
population shifts. The results, presented separately for the 2003-2008 and 2008-2015 periods, suggest
that at the beginning of the period poverty reduction in large cities accounted for a larger relative share
of the total, whereas during 2008-2015 a larger proportion of overall decline in the poverty headcount
was due to falling rural poverty – rural areas accounted for 31 percent of population in 2008, but over
the 2008-2015 period rural areas contributed 38 percent of the overall (national) poverty decline. On
the other hand, Minsk city, while accounting for 16 percent of the country’s population, contributed
only 7 percent of the overall poverty decline (Table 3-1).

Across regions of Belarus, the profile of poverty in 2003 was again characterized by a much lower
poverty rate in Minsk city, and higher, and comparable (especially at the $10/day threshold) in other
regions, including the Minsk Oblast (excluding the capital). Over the 2003-2014 the pace of poverty
reduction appears similar across the various regions; a process of absolute convergence between Minsk
city and other regions (Oblasts) is observed to take place (Figure 3-5). Both at the beginning and at
the end of the observed time period the differences between regions (outside Minsk) are less than 5
percentage points at the $10/day threshold. Notably, even at the $10/day threshold, the share of
populations in Minsk city with expenditures below that level in 2015 was 0.7 percent.

Oblast-level decomposition of poverty changes during 2003 and 2015 suggest a broadly uniform
decline in the poverty headcount during 2003-2008, and an increasing contribution in more recent
years (2008-2015) to overall poverty decline of falling poverty headcounts in the 3 eastern oblasts of
Belarus -- Vitebsk, Gomel and Mogilev (Table 3-2).

As the share of population below the $5/day and below the $10/day threshold fell over the past
decade, the composition of this population also evolved somewhat. For instance, taking the $10/day
threshold, over the 2003-2015 period the share of single-member, or 2-member households in this
group decreased, even though for the population overall, the share of single-member or two-member
households increased (Figure 3-6). A notable trend is the increase in the share of population below
the $10/day threshold that originates from large households, particularly households with 5 or more
members – this share increased from 14 percent in 2003 to 32 percent in 2014, before falling to 28
percent in 2015, but still double the initial share.

Poverty rates among households with no children (age 0-12) were lower in 2003 compared to
households with 1 or more children, and this remains to be the case according to 2015 data. Over the
2003-2014 period the rate of poverty reduction was similar for households without children, as well
as for households with 1 or more children. One notable difference is the initially slower declines in
poverty among households with 3 or more children, catching up only during 2012 - 2014 (Figure 3-7).
The recession of 2015 was associated with an increase in the incidence of poverty for all groups of
household (by number of children), although the (absolute) magnitude of the increase in the poverty

                                                                                                  19
headcount was higher for household with more children – the poverty rate increased by 3 percentage
points for households with 2 children, by almost 7 percentage points for households with 3 children,
and by 13 percentage points among households with 4 or more children.

With regard to households differentiated by the number of elderly household members, a notable
change in the composition of the population below $10/day between 2003 and 2015 is the lower
poverty headcount among households without elderly at the beginning of this time period, but a higher
poverty headcount in this group in 2014; in other words, poverty declined faster, particularly in recent
years, among households with elderly members as compared to households without any elderly
members. Furthermore, the incidence of poverty measured at the PPP $10/day threshold fell further
in 2015 for households with 2 or more elderly, whereas it increased for household with no elderly, or
for those with only one person in the 60+ age group.

What characteristics differentiate the population below the PPP US$ 10/day poverty threshold in 2015
from the population above this threshold? The population below the poverty threshold is younger on
average (33.1 years on average vs 42.8 for non-poor), originates in families with much higher youth
dependency ratio (71 percent vs 37 percent for non-poor) and lower old-age dependency ratios (12
and 18 percent respectively). Only 11 percent of the poor are pensioners, while among those above
the poverty line this share is twice as high – 23 percent. Those below the poverty line live in families
with more children than the noon-poor: only one fourth of the poor live in families with no children,
while 57 percent of non-poor do so. At the same time, 30 and 13 percent respectively live in families
with two and three or more children, while for non-poor these numbers are only 13 and 2 percent.
Half of poor people live in rural areas and only 1 percent in the capital city, while for the non-poor
these numbers are equal around 22 percent. Poor people have worse education outcomes: among
them only 8.5 percent have tertiary education (28 percent among the non-poor), while the share with
general secondary education only is higher (40 and 24 percent respectively). Moreover, people with
per capita consumption below 10 USD/day in 2005 PPP have poorer access to main utilities including
hot and cold water, heating, gas and others. However, these differences are generally small and are
mainly explained by the higher rural population share among the poor. Within urban and rural sub-

populations separately the gap in access to utilities is small and, for many utilities, statistically
insignificant.

        3.2.    THE RECESSION OF 2015-2016 AND A PARTIAL REVERSAL OF
                                FAVORABLE TRENDS

In 2015, all regions of Belarus faced economic decline. The decline was slowest in Minsk Oblast and
fastest in Grodno and Vitebsk Oblast, but it contrasts with the dynamics during 2012 - 2014 when
most of the regions demonstrated economic growth. The biggest negative contribution to real GDP
growth came from Minsk city (-1.3 percentage points, or 1/3 of total GDP decline), the lowest from
Minsk Oblast and Mogilev Oblast (by -0.3 percentage points), because of the slowest decline in the
first and the lowest share of the latter in the national economy (Chubrik, 2016).
The economic decline was associated with employment levels and wages, particularly in later years.
The economic downturn in Belarus started somewhat earlier than the onset of recession. Rayon-level
estimates show that decreases in industrial output, fixed capital investment and employment rate, and
increasing share of low-making enterprises can be observed for at least some of the 119 rayons of
Belarus throughout the 2010-2014 period. For instance, decreases in the employment rate were
observed in most rayons as early as 2013. The prominent feature of 2014-2015 is the fall in real wages,
which, by 2015 can be observed across all but 6 rayons (Chubrik, 2016). In terms of magnitudes,
wages fell by 2.3 percent overall in real terms in 2015 relative to 2014, and in some regions like Brest,
Vitebsk, and Gomel wages fell by more than 4 percent (Belstat, 2016).
The worsening external environment, points to higher household vulnerability and sustainability
concerns. In 2015 the poverty headcount at PPP $10/day increased by 2.5 percentage points at the
national level. The decline in welfare was not uniform across the country, with rural areas being more
affected. In rural areas the poverty headcount increased by almost 6 percentage points (i.e. by 30
percent) in just one year (Figure 10). Across regions, there are also notable differences, with a small
increase in poverty in Grodno (and a further decline in Minsk city), but a large increase in the poverty
headcount in the Brest region. Furthermore, Figure 3-9 suggests that not only did the $10/day poverty
headcount increase in 2015 by 2.5 percentage points, but also that there is a large number of
households just above the $10/day threshold. The negative economic outlook, coupled with
expectations of increasing unemployment due to SOE reforms, as well as relatively high inflation in
2016 (13 percent) will continue eroding the purchasing power of household incomes and may lead to
further increases in poverty in 2016.

Preliminary data point to a further deterioration of household welfare in 2016. Following the economic
contraction of 3.9 percent in 2015, the economy is projected to contract again by a similar order of
magnitude (3.6 percent) in 2016. If 2015 is a guide, this will likely translate into higher poverty and
vulnerability. While household data for the full 2016 year are not yet available, data from the first
quarter of 2016 reveal a mean percentile growth rate of disposable incomes of -5 percent with respect
to Q1 of 2015. The income growth incidence curve (Figure 3-10) shows that disposable incomes fell
in real terms with 95 percent confidence for a large share of the population of Belarus. The dynamics
of per capita consumption also show a fall in household expenditures, albeit of smaller magnitude and
only marginally statistically significant.

                       The smaller magnitude of the fall in household expenditures relative to the decline in household
                       incomes may be due to some consumption smoothing, in part through reliance on savings. Cross-
                       sectional elasticities of household expenditures with respect to income are quite high during the 2005-
                       2009 years (elasticity is higher than 0.9), whereas in 2010 (following low growth in 2009) and in 2012
                       (following high inflation in 2011), the relationship between income and expenditures weakens,
                       particularly at the bottom of the welfare distribution. In recent years (2013-2015) the expenditure
                       elasticity with respect to income has exhibited a downward trend, particularly at the 10th and 25th
                       percentiles of the distribution, and to a much smaller degree at higher points in the distribution. As
                       the economy is estimated to post a second consecutive year of negative growth in 2016, and as growth
                       is forecast to remain negative or flat in 2017, before recovering very slowly during 2018-2019, the
                       ability of households to run down savings will reach its limits, leading to further declines in household
                       welfare.

The objective measures of deteriorating household welfare are also mirrored by subjective measures
of well-being – according to the Life in Transition Survey (LiTS) between 2006 and 2016 Belarus
recorded the largest deterioration of reported well-being among all ECA countries (EBRD, 2016) –
the share of adults reporting to be satisfied with life fell from 66 percent in 2006 (one of the highest
in the ECA region and significantly higher than the Transition region average) to 50 percent in 2010,
to 41 percent in 2016, below Transition region average (Figure 3-12).

The decline in overall life satisfaction is also reflected in the broader discontent with both the
economic and political situation in the country, as well as the perception of adequacy of household
finances. Belarusians are more pessimistic, on average, than the respondents in the Transition region
as a whole about the economic and political evolution of their country over the past 4 years, or indeed
about their own situation with respect to the recent past. Only 17 percent of adults in Belarus were
satisfied with their personal financial situation in 2016, compared to 31 percent of adults in the
Transition region as a whole (Figure 3-13).


       3.3.    EVOLUTION OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOTTOM 40
                          PERCENT DURING 2003-2015

As incomes of households rose over the past decade, and until the recession of 2015, the share of
population below the poverty line fell dramatically. A related, but separate, question examined in this
section is whether the composition of the population of those below the poverty threshold – their
main characteristics – has also changed in notable ways alongside the reduction in the poverty
headcount, or whether the composition of poverty in 2003 and in 2015 is relatively stable. Given the
dramatic changes in the poverty headcount, comparing populations below a certain absolute threshold
is not very meaningful – for instance, at the PPP US$ 10/day almost 90 percent of the population
were poor in 2003, such that the characteristics of the poor population at the beginning of the period
were not very different from the overall population of the country, whereas only 11 percent of the
population were below this threshold in 2015. For purposes of comparability, we examine below the
main characteristics of the bottom 40 population over the 2003-2015 period. The key advantage of

                                                                                                     24
this approach is that exactly 40 percent of the population are always in the B40 group, such that it is
meaningful to ask to what extent the composition of the B40 group has evolved overtime.

Bussolo and Lopez-Calva (2013) suggest that that the population at the bottom of the welfare
distribution may be characterized by a lower stock of assets (human and otherwise) to draw upon for
income-generating purposes. In addition, these households may also use their asset endowments less
intensively, as well as get lower returns to their asset endowments. Any structural rigidities that persist
overtime, even as income rise in an absolute sense, may be indicative of inequality traps, or persistence
of certain population groups at the bottom (see also Bourguignon, Ferreira and Bolton, 2006).

One of the constraints commonly associated with poor and B40 households is the relatively high share
of dependents, and, by implication, a smaller share of working age population in households. A smaller
share of working age population implies that the incomes of those able to work, and who do work,
are smaller, in per capita terms, relative to households with a larger share of working adults. The data
for Belarus show that the share of working age population was 11 percentage points lower in the B40
group compared to the T60 group in 2003, and this difference remained unchanged in 2009, before
declining in more recent years. Notably, the B40 group is characterized by a much higher share of
children, and the difference between B40 group and the T60 group has increased overtime – from 9
percentage points in 2003 to 11 percentage points in 2015, as the result of a faster decline in the share
of children in the T60 group (Figure 3-14). The T60 group has a considerably higher share of
population residing in households with no children, and a much smaller share of population residing
in households with more than 2 children.

In addition to the fact that the B40 group continue to be characterized by the smaller share of working
age adults in households, and thus, ceteris paribus, lower current household-level capacity to generate
employment income, the B40 group also continues to have lower educational attainment than the T60
population. Despite improvements in educational attainment over the past decade – the share of those
with general secondary education or below in the B40 group fell from 55 percent in 2003 to 34 percent
in 2015, the level of educational attainment in the T60 group also improved considerably during the
same period. Moreover, given the generally high educational attainment overall in Belarus, returns to

                                                                                                        25
education are likely to be more subdued for secondary education, even professional secondary, simply
on account of its prevalence in the population. On the other hand, if returns to tertiary education are
high, then it is notable that in terms of the share of those with tertiary education, this indicator has
actually improved faster in absolute terms (percentage points increase) in the T60 group than in the
B40 group. We return to this point in Section 4.

Geographically, Minsk city accounts for a much higher share of the population than of the B40
population, and this tendency has changed little over time. On the other side of the ledger, the Brest
region has a high share of B40 population, given its population size, and the concentration of the B40
group in Brest has increased monotonically over time. Another two regions that are relatively poor,
i.e. have a higher share of B40 population relative to the corresponding share of the overall population,
are Mogilev and Gomel, although in both cases the concentration of the B40 group in these two
regions has declined over time.

Looking at differences by level of urbanity, the B40 population remains disproportionally located in
rural areas and small towns, while the T60 population – in big cities and Minsk. It should be noted
that there is a relative convergence over time in the geographic distribution of the B40 and T60 groups
(Figure 3-18). The share of B40 population residing in rural areas declined from 47 percent in 2003 to
37 percent in 2015, a faster decline than in the T60 group, and the share of B40 in big cities also
increased faster than in the T60 group. Nevertheless, there is still a 20 percentage points difference in
the share of B40 and the share of T60 residing in rural areas (the former is larger) and the same
difference in the share of B40 and the share of T60 population residing in Minsk (the former is
smaller).

The urbanization of the country’s population has led to an improvement i n the access to public
services, inclusively for those in the B40. Access to key services such as running water, hot water and
sewerage has increased, and, at least in urban areas, the disparities in access between the B40 and the
T60 group have disappeared. Access remains considerably lower – albeit improving – in rural areas,
which accounts in part for the overall lower access of B40 population to services, given their higher
concentration in rural areas. At the same time, even within rural areas, access to key services is
somewhat worse for the B40 population, even though the inequities in access to services appear to
have declined notably over the past decade.

The evolution of the profile of the population in the bottom two quintiles of the population over the
2003-2015 period reveals that despite overall income growth and poverty reduction during this period,
along some dimensions the disparities between the B40 and the T60 groups have increased. In
particular, on indicators such as the share of young dependents, as well as prevalence of high
educational attainment (tertiary education), there is a divergence rather than a convergence between
the B40 and T60 groups. Moreover, the B40 group remains more heavily concentrated in rural areas,
and with lower access to core public services, although on this dimension we observe a convergence
overtime. These patterns suggest that constraints remain to the income-generating capacity of the B40
group going forward, that could, for instance, in the case of education, accentuate disparities between
B40 and T60 groups in the future. We return to this discussion in the next chapter that looks in more
detail at some of the main drivers of past shared prosperity in Belarus. The next section, in turn, looks
at the related issue of the overall dynamics of inequality in Belarus during a period of rapid economic
growth and poverty reduction.

        3.4.    ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION WITH NO
                              RISING INEQUALITY

Economic growth has been associated with a dramatic reduction of poverty in Belarus over the 2003-
2014 period. But have growth and poverty reduction been accompanied by an increase in inequality



                                                                                                      28
in Belarus during the same period? This section reviews the main trends in inequality in Belarus, both
overall for the country, and across geographic space.

Inequality in Belarus remains low, and has decreased over the past decade. The Gini index of inequality
in Belarus – at 26.7 in 2015, is lower than the average for the ECA region (31 in 2015), and in fact is
one of the lowest recorded among ECA countries. For comparison, the Gini index of inequality in
the Russian Federation was 42 (33 in Poland). Following some up and down swings in early years, the
Gini index reached a high of 29.6 in 2007, and then fell in most years with the exception of 2010 and
2014. The level of inequality is similar in urban and rural areas of Belarus (with the exception of a
decrease in inequality in rural areas in 2015), and urban and rural Gini indices have followed similar
trends over the past decade (Figure 3-21).

The Gini index, while it provides an overall picture of the evolution of inequality in Belarus over time,
does not allow any immediate insight into the distributional changes at various parts of the welfare
distribution. We examine the evolution over time of two quantile ratios – the fifty-ten ratio (Figure 3-22),
which looks at inequality in the bottom half of the distribution by means of the ratio of the 10 th
percentile of per capita expenditures to median per capita expenditures, and the ninety-fifty ratio (Figure
3-23), which looks at inequality in to top half of the distribution, respectively the ratio of median
expenditures to the 90th percentile. In both cases there are signs of mild convergence. For instance, in
urban areas median per capita expenditures were 45 percent higher than the 10th percentile in 2003,
and in 2015 they were 42 percent higher. Likewise, urban median household expenditures were 47
percent lower than those of urban households in the 90th percentile, and in 2015 they were 44 percent
lower.

A similar examination of the 50/10 and 90/50 quantile ratios at the regional level reveals a reduction
in inequality in the lower part of the distribution, as captured by the 50/10 quantile ratio, across all
regions of Belarus. In the upper half of the distribution, the 90/50 ratios also exhibit a reduction in
the differences between the 50th and 90th percentiles between 2003 and 2015 across all regions with
the exception of Minsk city, where the degree of inequality in the upper half of the distribution
increases steadily over time.

Another indicator that confirms the reduction in spatial disparities over time is given by the
decomposition of overall inequality into between-group inequality and within-group inequality. Figure
3-24 plots the share of overall inequality that is attributable to between group inequality across urban
and rural areas (the remainder being inequality within urban and rural areas). On the same graph we
present the decomposition for Oblasts of Belarus, with the line plotting the between Oblast
component. The share of overall inequality that can be attributed to differences in mean expenditures
across urban and rural areas has been declining steadily throughout the past decade until 2014
(indicating a convergence of mean incomes between urban and rural areas), with an increase in the
last year (2015), when the economy was in recession. Across Oblasts, the share of overall inequality
attributable to differences in mean expenditures across regions goes up and down during the 2003-
2015 period, with a notable decrease between 2010 and 2012, and a subsequent increase in recent
years between 2012 and 2015.

The above discussion refers to the inequality of outcomes. However, there is now a fairly large
literature that argues that not all inequality need be objectionable on the grounds of justice, and
proposes a decomposition of overall inequality into inequality due to differences in effort and
inequality due to differences in circumstances (see, among others, Roemer, 2000; Ferreira and
Gignoux, 2008; Checchi and Peragine, 2010), of which it is the latter that is objectionable, because it
refers to inequality generated by circumstances which were not chosen by the individual. A recent
study (EBRD, 2016) estimated the degree of inequality of opportunity for all countries in the ECA
region, relying on the data from the LiTS survey, which allows one to construct a measure of inequality
of opportunity based on the following set of circumstances (urban/rural birthplace, parents’ level of
education, gender, ethnic majority/minority, and whether the parents were members of the
Communist party). Figure 3-25 plots the relationship between overall inequality and inequality of
opportunity across the ECA region. This relationship is positive – countries with a higher overall level
of inequality also tend to have higher inequality of opportunity. Belarus is in the middle of the group
on both indicators. The estimates suggest that inequality of opportunity in Belarus accounts for one
third of overall inequality. This is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. For
instance, in both Moldova and Ukraine inequality of opportunity accounts for more than 40 percent
of overall inequality, in Poland 37 percent and in Russia 34 percent. At the same time, the degree of
inequality of opportunity is much lower in Germany, where it accounts for only 23 percent of overall
inequality. The main circumstance in terms of contributions to overall inequality of opportunity in
Belarus is parental education (account for about 40 percent of total inequality of opportunity), meaning
that children born to parents with higher levels of education are presented with a better opportunity
set compared to children born to parents with low levels of education. It should be noted, however,
that parental education the main contributor to inequality of opportunity in many countries in the

to other countries.

Having described the trends in poverty and inequality during the 2003-2015 period, the next section
reviews the dynamics of shared prosperity during the same period, an indicator that captures both the
pace of increasing welfare at the bottom of the welfare distribution, as well as, when compared to the
overall pace of welfare increases, the equity aspects of income growth, namely whether the incomes
or expenditures of those at the bottom of the welfare distribution are growing faster than average, and
thus catching up.

      3.5.    STRONG SHARED PROSPERITY PERFORMANCE PRIOR TO THE
                                  RECESSION

Promoting shared prosperity, defined as the income (or expenditure) growth of the bottom 40 percent
of the population, is one of the twin goals of the World Bank (alongside the elimination of extreme
poverty). The shared prosperity goal aims to capture the fact that increases in living standards among
the poor will not be possible without sustained economic growth, yet growth by itself will not be
sufficient – the shared prosperity indicator thus measures the degree of inclusiveness of economic
growth in a given country.

According to the latest comparable data for the ECA region, Belarus has performed well in terms of
the World Bank’s shared prosperity indicator. For a region-wide comparable time period, Belarus has
exhibited the highest rate of growth of expenditures in the bottom 40 group during the 2006-2011
period (almost 9 percent on an annualized basis). This is at a time when many of the European


                                                                                                    32
countries were suffering from the effects of the financial crisis, registering negative growth of incomes
both for the population overall and for the B40 group (Figure 3-26). As the economy slowed down
further in 2015, the growth of incomes both in the B40 and the T60 groups decelerated (Figure 3-27).
Nevertheless, welfare of the B40 group still grew faster than that of the T60 group, and compared to
the ECA region and a number of Western European countries, incomes were growing relatively fast,
below only Georgia and Kazakhstan.

The good shared prosperity performance of Belarus during the past decade is not an artefact of a
particular choice of the beginning and end years for which the growth of household expenditures is
computed. Figure 3-28Figure 3-28 considers the increase of B40 and T60 expenditures in Belarus for
any given 5-year period ending from 2005 and 2015. The estimates suggest that over the past decade
and a half Belarus consistently recorded high growth rates of real household expenditures averaging
over 10 percent on an annualized basis until 2009, and ranging from between 7 and 9 percent on
annualized basis during the 5-year intervals ending in 2011 to 2014. Another thing that could be noted
from the graph is the fact that the shared prosperity figures track reasonably well the growth dynamics
of GDP growth rates – falling slowly staring in 2008 and until roughly 2012, then being stable before
falling again in 2015. Pre-financial crisis growth of B40 welfare was higher than post-financial crisis,
but even during the 2011-2014 period the recorded growth rates are still quite high.

Another observation from Figure 3-28Figure 3-28 is that for the most part, the B40 growth rates
exceeded those for the population as a whole – this is the case for all 5-year windows with the
exception of those ending in 2009 and 2010. Finally, one can see the rapid slowdown of B40 income
growth during the 2010-2015 period from 8.9 percent in annualized terms during 2009-2014 to 5.6
percent in 2010-2015. As can be seen from Figure 3-29Figure 3-29, this slowdown is entirely on
account of falling household expenditures during 2015. Given continued negative growth in 2016, and
expectations of a very slow recovery in subsequent years, the growth of household expenditures of
the B40 group (and overall) is likely to slow down further.

This chapter has described the main trends in poverty, inequality, and shared prosperity in Belarus
over the 2003-2015 period. In doing so, it has documented the impressive reduction in poverty over
this period, as well stable, or decreasing inequality during the same period, both of these trends being
reflected in strong shared prosperity performance compared to the rest of the ECA region. The next
chapter considers some of the key drivers of these trends in poverty reduction and shared prosperity.


       4. KEY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO POVERTY REDUCTION
                       AND SHARED PROSPERITY

Over the past decade and a half, the dynamics of households’ expenditures in Belarus track closely the
evolution of household incomes, both for the B40 and T60 groups (Figure 4-1). In other words, the
growth of expenditures that underlies the shared prosperity indicators in Belarus is mirrored, during
the period under examination, by the evolution of household incomes. Recall also the high elasticity
of household expenditures with respect to household incomes in Belarus. This close correlation allows
us gain further insights into key drivers of shared prosperity by considering in more detail what were
the main drivers of disposable income growth in Belarus.

Over half of household income, on average, is comprised of labor income. The other key income
categories are pensions, transfers, and other income sources (Figure 4-2). The comparison of
household income sources for B40 and T60 groups reveals a larger share of pension and of transfers
(and a smaller share of labor income) in the B40 population. Over time, the data suggests are decrease
of the relative importance of labor income in the B40 group, and an increased share of both pension
and social transfers between 2003 and 2015. The share of other income sources (notably privileges),
is lower in 2015. In the T60 group an increase in the share of labor income is observed between 2003
and 2009, and a subsequent decline of the share of labor income category between 2009 and 2015,
with an increase of the importance of pensions and transfers, and a decreasing importance of other
income, mirroring similar compositional changes in the B40 group.

The composition of income in Belarus is not uniform across geographic space. Rural households rely
to a somewhat larger degree on pensions, and to a somewhat smaller degree of labor income. There
are also some differences in the evolution of income sources between 2003 and 2015. In the B40
population in rural areas the importance of labor income increased overtime, whereas in the urban
household within the B40 group the share of labor income was higher in 2003 (60 percent) in
comparison with 2015 (55 percent). At the same time, the urban B40 group has seen an increase in
the share of pensions (from 18 percent to 24 percent of total) as well as social transfers (from 4.7
percent to 7.9 percent). Other important differences include the considerably higher share of social
transfers (social assistance, child and unemployment benefits) in rural areas as compared to urban
areas. (Figure 4-3).

A more formal account of the evolution of different contributors to household disposable income
over time is provide by the Shapley decomposition of household disposable income growth by

component (Figure 4-4). The period 2003-2015 is broken down into a pre-financial crisis period (2003-
2009) and post-financial crisis period (2009-2015). The estimates show that during 2003-2009 total
household incomes per capita in the B40 group rose by 11.3 percent on an annualized basis. A large
share of this income growth (68 percent of total) is due to growth in wages during the same period.
Aside from growth in wages, the second important factor was growth in pensions, contributing 20
percent of overall disposable income growth, followed by the growth of other income sources.

During 2009-2015, the growth of incomes in both the B40 group and the T60 group slowed down in
comparison to the pre-financial crisis period. In terms of key contributors to overall income growth
during 2009-2015, it is still the case that the key drivers were wages and pensions, but now both the
absolute growth rates of wages were considerably lower, and the relative contribution of wages to total
income growth was also lower – 47 percent of total. The relative contribution of pensions to B40
income growth increased from 20 percent during the first period to 34 percent during the second
period, and also the contribution of other transfers, such as child benefits and other social assistance
increased slightly from 3 percent of total to 12.5 percent of total.

Guided by the results of the Shapley decomposition, we examine next in more detail what underpins
the dynamics of key income components contributing to shared prosperity in Belarus, namely (i) labor
income; (ii) pensions; and (iii) social protection benefits.

                           4.1.    EVOLUTION OF LABOR INCOME

Growth in labor income was shown to be the key contributor to overall income growth for households
in Belarus, particularly in the B40 group. Indeed, wages were the dominant contributor during the pre-
financial crisis period 2003-2009. Growth in wages can be on account of one of the following factors
(or both): (i) growth in the number of individuals (and households) receiving wages; and (ii) growth


                                                                                                     38
in the value of wages received among wage employees. We examine the evolution of both factors
below:

Official statistics show an increase in the activity and employment rates during the 2004-2011 period
(Figure 4-5). The activity rate increased from roughly 75 percent in 2004 to over 81 percent in 2011,
and the employment rate increased from 73 percent to 81 percent during the same period. During the
2011-2015 period there was a dip in the employment and activity rates in 2012, following by a gradual
recovery back to 2011 levels by 2015. It should be noted that the increase in the employment rate is
not entirely on account of increasing number of employed/active (both increased between 2003 and
2010, but were falling over the past 5 years); the 2003-2015 period also witnessed a 6 percent decline
in the total number of individuals of working age (Figure 4-6). In other words, the increasing
employment and activity are a combined effect of demographic trends (population aging), and higher
activity levels among younger cohorts.

Improving employment outcomes can be driven, in part, by improvements in educational attainment
during this period, as better education tends to be associated both with a higher probability of
employment, as well as a higher probability of skilled occupations. Regression estimates based on HSS
2015 data suggest that relative to the baseline of secondary education, the probability of employment
increases for higher levels of education, and in particular for tertiary education, and it is
correspondingly lower for those with pre-secondary education (Figure 4-7). While the occupational
categories of respondents in the HSS survey are not available, it is possible to examine the links
between education and the occupation type based on data from the Life in Transition (LiTS) survey.
Estimates from a similar regression show that the probability of the individual holding a professional
occupation increases with her level of education, and, relative to the baseline of secondary education,
there remains a notable tertiary education premium in Belarus (Figure 4-8).

Belarus already has near universal primary and secondary enrollment, (99 percent for pre-primary, 94
percent for primary and 99 percent for secondary education levels). Access to pre-school education
has also undergone considerable expansion over the past decade. Expansion of both pre-school
institutions such as pediatric medical and special childcare, and children development centers, as well
as part-time and at-home childcare options, has resulted in increasing pre-school enrollment both in
urban and rural areas (75 percent in urban areas and 55 percent in rural areas according to 2011 figures,
an increase from 70.9 and 46.3 percent respectively in 2000) (World Bank, 2013). Finally, tertiary
enrollment rates have increased since 2003, for both men and women, with Belarus starting at already
high levels relative to its GNI per capita, as compared to other ECA countries, and by 2013 tertiary
enrollment was nearly universal for women, and indeed the highest in the ECA region, and higher
than would be predicted based on GNI levels alone (Figure 4-9).

The improvements in educational attainment in Belarus over the past decade have been achieved
through a combination of (i) policy continuity (in contrast with disruptive restructuring of the
education sector in many other transition economies); and (ii) adequate financing. Belarus’ public
expenditures on education are in excess of 5 percent of GDP – higher than in the ECA region on
average, and on par with very high HDI countries (Figure 4-10). According the recent Public
Expenditure Review, education expenditures were at 13.5 percent of general government budget
expenditures, close to other transition economies. While education expenditures as a share of general
government expenditures have been declining until 2008, they have recovered after the 2009 crisis,
and by 2011 exceeded pre-crisis levels (World Bank 2013). The Government has also been able to
adjust to declining demographic trends through school consolidation (see Box 1).

   Box 1: School consolidation – an unfinished agenda

   One of the key policy developments over the past decade has been the Government’s effort to
   adjust the sector to declining demographic trends through a program of school consolidation.
   Under the National Development Program for General Secondary Education2 (GSE) in 2007-2016,
   673 GSE schools have been closed and 789 reorganized across all 6 oblasts (regions) of Belarus and
   the city of Minsk, reducing by nearly one-third the number of institutions in rural areas. As a result,
   the total number of teachers has been reduced by 15% since 2007, while others have been retrained
   to teach other subjects or transferred to other schools (World Bank, 2015).

   While the school consolidation program helped boost the fiscal sustainability of the sector, the
   number of teachers, and thence wage expenditures in Belarus remain high (the ratio of education

 sector wages to economy-wide wages in Belarus, at below 80 percent, is lower in Belarus that in
 other neighboring countries, including Russia, Ukraine and Poland (World Bank, 2013)). At 15
 pupils per teacher, the pupil-teacher ratio is Belarus is lower than in high HDI countries or Russia,
 albeit it is comparable to the value for Very High HDI countries (Figure 4-10).

 The success of the consolidation program is not fully realized, in part, because signification
 expenditures on salaries, utilities and school meals leave limited room for quality improvements.
 On average, salaries, utilities and meals account for as much as 84 percent of available budgets, and
 in some schools for as much as 98 percent of the total (World Bank, 2013). Thus, despite financial
 savings from school consolidation, students in “consolidated” schools are not necessarily benefiting
 from an improved learning environment. According to 2010 data, some Rayons spend more than
 25 percent of their education budgets on heating alone, leaving little room for the rehabilitation of
 facilities or laboratory equipment (World Bank, 2015).


Human capital improvements are a key driver of shared prosperity. Bussolo and Lopez-Calva (2013)
propose a framework for analyzing the drivers of shared prosperity in which the differential ability of
households to improve their income is a function of (i) asset (human, physical, social) endowment,
including education; (ii) intensity of asset use; and (iii) returns to assets (e.g. wages in the case of human
capital). For these reasons, it is important to consider not only the educational dynamics overall, but
also the distributional incidence of improvements in educational attainments. As was noted in section
3.3, improvements in the educational attainment in Belarus during 2003-2015 can be observed both
for the B40 and T60 groups (see Figure 3-16). There was a partial (absolute) convergence between
B40 and T60 educational endowment during this period – in percentage points terms the decline in
the share of population with no more than general secondary population was greater in the B40 group.

                                                                                                           42
At the same time, the incidence of higher education in the T60 group increased by 9.3 percentage
points, compared to 7 percentage points in the B40 group, i.e. there was no absolute convergence in
the expansion of higher education for the bottom 2 quintiles.

Did educational gains translate into greater employment among the B40? Notably, employment
information is not available directly from the HHS survey in Belarus. We can examine, instead, the
share of individuals in the bottom 40 percent of the population, and in the T60 group, who receive
wage income. The results are reported in (Figure 4-11) for 2003, 2009 and 2015. It appears that the
share of those receiving wages increased for the T60 group (from 54 percent in 2003 to 58 percent in
2015), and the share of wage recipients in the B40 group increased from 41 percent in 2003 to 44
percent in 2015. However, since the shared prosperity indicator is computed at the household and not
at the individual level, the indicator that is a more direct counterpart, is the share of households (or
population residing in households) that receive wage income (Figure 4-12). This indicator shows an
improvement in the pre-financial crisis period, a subsequent deterioration, and, only in the case of B40
population, an increase in the last two years for which data is available.

While the HSS survey allows us to document greater levels of employment in the B40 group, it does
not provide information on the types of jobs (sector, occupation, type of contract) across the
population. In order to gain some insights into the types of jobs held by those at the bottom end of
the welfare distribution, we turn to the LiTS 2016 survey. The LiTS data reveals that those in the B40
population, when employed, have less secure jobs.5 Members of the B40 group are more often self-
employed than T60 (3.9 percent vs 2.3 percent). A higher share of B40 group work without written
contracts (8.2 percent) than among T60 (6.3 percent) that increases their risks to be laid off and makes
them more vulnerable to turbulence on labor market. In terms of the type of enterprises where people


5Note the B40 group in the LiTS survey is constructed on the basis of the LiTS expenditure module, which does not
correspond to the expenditure module in the HSS, such that the two B40 populations are not the same.

                                                                                                                    43
work, those in the B40 group are less often employed in banks, foreign firms and state-owned
enterprises – types of employers that are associated with highest wages or stability.

The sectoral structure of employment is less favorable for the bottom of the distribution compared
to the top. Members of the B40 group are relatively more often employed in the sectors that have
lower average wages (Figure 4-13). For instance, the B40 population is characterized by a higher share
of agricultural employment, while wages in this sector are 30 percent lower than average wages in the
economy. At the same time, members of the B40 group are less often work in sectors that are
associated with higher wages, such as financial services (Figure 4-13). The magnitude of changes in
employment levels, combined with the differentiation in employment patterns between the B40 and
the T60 groups, are suggestive of the fact that the robust labor income growth was primarily driven
by increases in the real value of wages, and less so by the expansion of wage recipients. We examine
the dynamics of wage levels next.

Wage levels grew considerably in Belarus over the past decade. Taking the index of wage levels in
2003 as 100, wage growth normalized by the GDP deflator (also by CPI) outpaced productivity growth
expressed as GDP per worker normalized by the same price index, particularly in the second half of
the period (Figure 4-14). Wage growth in Belarus has been driven by Government-set wage targets.
The Government sets both economy-wide, as well as regional and town-level targets on a recurrent
basis, and these targets apply to the entire economy, including the private sector. In addition, the
Programs for the Socio-Economic Development of Belarus set medium-term wage objectives for the
economy (IMF, 2014). The observed wage growth over the past decade has tracked the
administratively-set wage targets precisely.

The wage targets have had several implications. First, there is little differentiation in wages across
regions (Figure 4-15), and in the regional wage dynamics over time. Second, there is also little
differentiation in wages across sectors, while administrative restrictions on wage structures also result
in redistribution of incomes in favor of low-income workers in sectors with low wages (IMF, 2014).
According to Belstat data, the ratio of average wages in agriculture to average national wages increased
from 69 percent in 2010 to 74 percent in 2015, in comparison, earnings in agriculture in Russia were
57 percent of average in 2015. With the exception of the ICT sector, where average earnings are 3
times the national average, across other sectors differences in average earnings are subdued ( Figure
4-16)

The wages gap between the B40 and T60 group has fallen overtime. In 2003, average wages in the
B40 group were 55 percent of the level of wages earned in the T60 group; this ratio has increased to
61 percent in 2009 and 65 percent in 2015 (Figure 4-17).

The Oaxaca-Blinder (1973) decomposition allows wage disparities to be decomposed into endowment
effects and return effects—which reveal whether disparities in earnings are driven by differences in
portable characteristics of the population (i.e. human capital) or by differences in returns to those
characteristics that are determined by group-specific characteristics (i.e. intensity of use). Estimates
based on this decomposition suggest that the gap is mostly driven by returns to endowments rather
than difference in levels of endowments, here measured by a combination of education, work
experience, gender, and region of residence. The relative contribution of endowments is about 30
percent of the overall wage gap, and this has remained constant over time.

A recent analysis of returns to education in Belarus for the period 1995-2011 shows wages to be
positively correlated with education levels, and returns to education to be relatively stable throughout
the whole period (Chubrik and Shymanovich, 2013). The results of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition
are similarly suggestive of the importance of returns to education (among other characteristics) in
explaining differences between wages in the B40 and T60 group, albeit it should be noted that data
limitations do not allow us to account for important characteristics such as the difference in the sector
and occupation characteristics of those employed across the two groups.

The evidence presented in this section leads us to conclude that human capital increases contributed
to wage income growth overall in Belarus, and particularly in the B40 group. This is important, because
human capital improvements are a key driver of shared prosperity (Bussolo and Lopez-Calva, 2014).
Educational endowments have increased over the past decade and a half; in particular, tertiary
enrollment rates increased for both men and women—from an already high level. There was also a
partial (absolute) convergence between B40 and T60 educational endowment during the past decade.
The probability of holding a professional occupation is also higher for higher levels of education,
which would suggest an improvement in the skill composition of employment in the B40 group,
although lack of sectoral information in the B40 ground does not allow us to verify this directly.
Finally, a combination of positive returns to employment, and administratively mandated increases in
wages throughout the economy, which resulted in falling wage inequality over time, resulted in B40
wages converging over time to those of the T60 group, although they are still only two thirds of the
T60 wages.

          4.2.    CONTRIBUTIONS OF PENSIONS TO SHARED PROSPERITY

Social protection benefits – particularly pensions – are an important source of livelihood both overall
for the B40 and T60 population groups, and especially for some population groups (e.g. elderly,
disabled, poor). Pensions alone accounted for 25 percent of household total incomes in 2015 (23
percent in the T60 group). For both population groups, and in particular for B40, the relative share of
pensions increased over time – in 2003 pensions accounted for 20 percent of incomes in the B40
population (Figure 4-21). Reliance on pensions in higher in rural areas, compared to urban areas, but
in both cases the relative importance of pensions increases overtime. The decomposition of overall
household income changes during 2003-2015 suggested that growth in pensions in particular was the
second most important contributor to overall income growth both pre-2009 financial crisis, and during
the 2009-2015 period, and, moreover, the importance of the contribution of pensions to overall
disposable income growth increased considerably post-2009.

Belarus spends about 10 percent of GDP on social protection, an average amount by ECA standards.
Three quarters of the population are covered by the social protection system, including social
insurance, or social assistance, or both. Some three quarters of that amount is absorbed by social
insurance programs, mainly pensions, which are the most important component of the social
protection system in Belarus. This mirrors the relative importance of pensions among non-wage
sources of income in households. According to administrative data, there were more than 2.7 million
pension recipients in Belarus in 2015 (more than a quarter of the total population of Belarus). Pensions
in Belarus have a wide coverage, about half of the households in Belarus (40 percent in the bottom
decile) received pensions in 2015. Consistent with the age profile of the welfare distribution, namely
the increase in the share of elderly population in the T60 group overtime, the incidence of pensions
has increased between 2003 and 2015 in the upper half of the distribution. On the other hand, while
the share of receiving households increased more in the T60 group than in the B40 group, the relative
importance of pensions in the overall household income increased more at the bottom of the income
distribution – in the B40 group, among receiving households, the share of pensions in household
income increased from 46 percent in 2003 to 51 percent in 2015. This is consistent with the results of
the Shapley decomposition of disposable income growth that showed the notable increase in the
relative contribution of pensions to overall disposable income growth overtime.

The pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension system in Belarus benefited from a favorable fiscal environment
prior to the financial crisis. This was due to low birth rates and survival rates for the 1940-1946
cohorts, resulting in low numbers of pensioners in recent years (Zviniene and Biletsky, 2011). While
similar in size to other European countries (total pensions in Belarus were about 9 percent of GDP
in 2013), a couple of characteristics are notable, including: (i) very low retirement ages (60 for men
and 55 for women); (ii) very high contribution rates -- total pension contributions are 29 percent of
gross wages, of which 1 percent is paid by the employee and the rest is covered by the employer
(Lisenkova and Bornukova, 2015).

While replacement rates are not particularly high in Belarus (cca 40 percent of average wages,
compared to the OECD average of 54 percent), individuals who reach retirement age in Belarus can
continue working while receiving pensions, and indeed during the 5 years post retirement age (55-59
for women and 60-64 for men) 50 percent of men and 60 percent of women are found to be employed
(Bornukova, Lisenkova and Luzghina, 2015). Moreover, pension amounts in Belarus are indexed to
average wages, meaning that pensions in Belarus kept up with the rapid increase in wages in Belarus
over the past decade and a half.

During the 2003-2015 period the levels of pensions in real terms increased steadily, being recalculated
in accordance with the growth of average wages. In fact, for the B40 population, pensions grew
relatively faster between 2003 and 2015 in comparison with the T60 population. In relative terms, the
ratio of the average pension to the average wage was relatively constant during this period, at just
below 50 percent, falling somewhat in the last 3 years.

The pension system in Belarus is characterized by a notable degree of redistribution that protects the
incomes of low income households. For instance, estimates suggest that in terms of effective
replacement rates, minimum wage workers can expect 95 percent of their pre-retirement income
replaced after retirement, while for workers earning 2 times the average wage the effective replacement
rate is only 25 percent (World Bank, 2011). The recent analysis (Bornukova, Chubrik, and
Shymanovich, 2017) based on the commitment to equity (CEQ) methodology (Lustig and Higging,
2016) show that pensions play a major redistributive role in Belarus. The concentration curve for
pensions, or the cumulative proportion of pensions plotted against the cumulative proportion of
population ranked by market income, is well above the 45-degree line (Figure 4-23), and is, in fact,
higher than the concentration curves for other transfers such as social benefits and privileges.
Bornukova, Shymanovich and Chubrik (2017) estimate that pensions reduced the Gini index of
inequality in Belarus by 11 points relative to the Gini index of market incomes. Pensions in Belarus
are also among the most efficient measures for social fiscal interventions, measured in terms of the
impact on poverty and inequality per 1 percent of GDP of expenditure (or tax) – only child benefits,
child support and unemployment benefits have a higher composite efficiency than pensions.

Another way of illustrating the redistributive character of pensions in Belarus is to consider the
alternative treatments of pensions as a government transfer, or as a deferred income. Given the
contributory nature of pensions, they can be viewed as income that is earned during working years,
but deferred until retirement. Bornukova, Shymanovich and Chubrik (2017) estimate the effect of
pensions of poverty and inequality according to these two scenarios. Table 4-2 reports the changes in
poverty and inequality when moving from disposable to market income. When pensions are treated
as a transfer, they are subtracted from disposable income to obtain market income, whereas when
pensions are a deferred income, they are considered as part of market income (thus, what is subtracted
is other direct transfers such as social assistance benefits, while direct taxes are added, but without
SPF contributions). Comparing the two scenarios one can observe the large impact of pensions on
inequality, both in terms of the reduction of the Gini index and of the 90/10 quantile ratio, as well as
the large reduction in both the USD 10 PPP poverty rate and poverty gap on account of pensions
alone.

As the process of population ageing in Belarus continues, the prominence of elderly population in the
B40 group – and the prominence of pensions in the livelihoods of many households – will increase,
creating pressure on the pension system, and brining to the fore the importance of the active ageing
agenda that was highlighted in the recent Golden Aging report (World Bank, 2015). We return to these
challenges in the next chapter.

         4.3.    THE IMPORTANCE OF NON-CONTRIBUTORY SAFETY NETS

In addition to social insurance, another important component of the safety net, particularly for low
income households, is provided by the (non-contributory) social assistance system. By ECA standards,
Belarus spends a relatively high sizeable share of GDP on social assistance -- in 2015 Belarus spent
2.76 percent of GDP on programs including on i) child-related benefits, ii) privileges and subsidies,
iii) means-tested support low-income households (GASP), iv) disability-related allowances, and v)
other programs.

FIGURE 4-24: GDP PER CAPITA AND SA EXPENDITURES IN ECA

In 2005, the SA system stood at about 2.8 percent of GDP, declining below 2.2 percent of GDP by
2011, but the slowdown of GDP in recent years was not associated by a similar shrinkage of the safety
net in Belarus, such that as the share of GDP spending rose to pre-crisis levels in the last 3 years. The
structure of the SA system has undergone some changes over the past decade. While child-related
allowances were always the largest SA component, in terms of relative shares, the importance of child-
allowances increased overtime, primarily at the expense of privileges and subsidies, which fell
throughout the period, and in 2015 were only a minor component of the safety net in terms of its
relative share (Figure 4-25).

The various social assistance programs cover over half of the population of Belarus. According to
2015 data, over half of the population (63 percent of the bottom quintile) were covered by social
assistance in Belarus, higher than the ECA average (48.6 percent), but in like with the average for High
Income countries (64 percent), or countries neighboring countries like Poland (61 percent). This is
the result of high reliance of the system on categorical benefits results in a low degree of targeting.
Thus, 42 percent of the top quintile were also covered by social assistance in Belarus, compared to
only 20 percent for ECA and for High Income countries on average (25 percent for Poland). The
share of income-tested programs designed to support low-income families stood at 0.06 percent of
GDP in 2015, having fallen in recent years simultaneously with the expansion of categorical child-
related benefits, which, by comparison, stood at 1.8 percent of GDP in 2015 (World Bank, 2017).
While the overall coverage of social assistance programs is high, the coverage of the bottom quintile
is actually quite low by European standards, given the very small share of means-tested programs in
the overall SA system.

Across individual categories of assistance programs, based on 2015 data, child subsidies, particularly
those for children under the age of 3, have the largest coverage (almost a quarter of the B40 group),
and the coverage of subsidies tends to be higher in the B40 group than in T60 group. The coverage
of non-child related subsidies is much lower, and in the case of the burial subsidies, it mostly goes to
the T60 population. In the case of privileges, a number of them cover a notable part of the population
of Belarus, especially privileges for nutrition support, for public transport, for medicines and
sanatorium care, as well as privileges for costs associated with pre-school education. Notably, a
number of privileges such as those for transport and for medicine, cover a higher share of the T60
population than of the B40 population, while privileges for pre-school costs and nutrition are more
heavily concentrated among lower income households.

One of the notable changes in the SA system in Belarus was the elimination of a large number of
poorly targeted social privileges were abolished in 2007. As the result, the share of population receiving
privileges fell from 64 percent in 2003 to 48 percent in 2009 and 36 percent in 2015 in the B40 group.
In the T60 group the coverage fell even more from 60 percent in 2003 to 36 percent in 2009 to 31

percent in 2015. This is also reflected in the falling share of resources devoted to privileges in the
overall SP budget.

Poor targeting of privileges is seen both indicators – distribution of program budget across deciles
and distribution of number of receivers across deciles. Both indicators improved over time, but the
targeting is still not very well. Share of money they are received by household in the B40 increased
from 40 to 47 percent, while share of money received by T60 decreased respectively (Figure 4-30).
There are receivers of the privileges in all parts of the distribution: in 2015 13.5 percent of privileges
receivers were in the bottom decile, while 7.6 percent in the top one. Allocation of money was even
more equal. In 2015 41 percent of program budget was received by households in B40, of which 12
percent went to bottom decile, while 10.4 percent of privileges were received by top decile of the
distribution. This was due to the fact that the average size of privileges received was higher for higher
deciles if measured in absolute amounts, but it was lower as a share of disposable incomes (Figure
4-31).

Privileges remain common across most population groups. The profiles of those households who
receive privileges and of those who do not are similar, albeit not identical. Receivers of privileges are
more likely to live in cities (except for Minsk) than non-receivers and less likely to come from rural
areas. Sixty two percent of receivers live in big cities comparing to 55 for non-receivers, Families who
receive privileges are usually bigger (51 percent of receivers have children comparing to 44 percent for
non-receivers) and have more children (for example, 8 percent of families who receive privileges have
three children or more, while there are no among non-receivers). They more often consist of
pensioners than the other group (pensioners are 28 percent among receivers and 18 percent among
non-receivers). Also, privileges have a limited effect on poverty reduction. If we subtract the amount
of privileges from total welfare, the poverty headcount increases just marginally by few decimal points.

Other recent changes that improved the performance of the SA system involve the 2007 reform of
the Public Targeted Social Assistance (GASP) program, with the replacement of categorical eligibility
by an income test, and an increase in the eligibility threshold from 60 percent of the Minimum
Subsistence Basket (MSB) to 100 percent of MSB, resulting in an expansion of coverage from 60,000
beneficiaries in 2007 to 287,000 in 2008. The change also resulted in an expansion of coverage under
GASP, which previously consistent primarily of 1-parent families with under-aged children or families
with many under-aged children) to some other types of families as well as household groups such as
single individuals, including pensioners and disabled.

Nevertheless, the targeting of the social assistance system in Belarus (excluding privileges) has
deteriorated between 2003 and 2015. The share of the SA budget going to the B40 group fell from 54

Meanwhile, the reliance on transfers among those who received them has increased over time. In 2003
and 2009 public transfers accounted for 12 percent of income in the B40 group, increasing to 20
percent in 2015, and a similar increase, albeit smaller in magnitude can be observed in the T60 group.
Across individual programs, child subsidies have both the highest coverage and generosity – in the
B40 group subsidies for children under 3 accounted for almost a quarter of household income for
those who receive it. The increase in the importance of subsidies is both due to the increase in the
magnitude of transfers, and also falling incomes in 2015 due to the recession.

The Shapley decomposition of income growth by income source suggested that social assistance did
not contribute significantly to income growth during the pre-crisis period (2003-2008), whereas it had
a higher contribution, 13 percent of total disposable income growth, during the more recent years

                                                                                                                   57
(2009-2015), even though this contribution is still considerably smaller than that of pensions.
Nevertheless, both the SI and the SA systems have had an important effect in terms of safeguarding
low-income households in Belarus from falling below the poverty line. Simulations based on 2015
data suggest that the removal of all pensions would have increased the corresponding poverty
headcount from the baseline of 11 percent to 38 percent, or 27 percentage points. Similarly, removing
social assistance transfers is associated with a 5.6 percentage points increase in the poverty headcount.
At the same time, the removal of all privileges results in only marginal changes in the poverty
headcount, highlighting their lack of effectiveness as a poverty reduction mechanism.

The recent CEQ analysis (Bornukova, Shymanovich and Chubrik, 2017) also confirms that direct
transfers are pro-poor (when measured with respect to market income) and remain progressive when
measures with respect to disposable income, in the sense that the presence of direct transfers results
in a lower degree of inequality in Belarus. The absence of benefits, taken as a whole, would increase
the Gini index of inequality by 2 percentage points. A number of benefits are also very efficient, per
unit of resources spent, in terms of their effect on reducing poverty and inequality, as noted in the
CEQ. In particular, unemployment benefits, as well a child benefits for ages 0-3 and 3+, as well as
child support after breadwinner’s death are quite effective both as poverty reducing and as equalizing
instruments. On the other hand, severance pay, funeral benefits, and student grants are not efficient
interventions, as measured by the reduction in poverty or inequality due to these benefits, normalized
by the size of the program (Figure 4-36).

          5. EMERGING CHALLENGES TO POVERTY AND SHARED
                            PROSPERITY

A favorable external environment throughout the first decade of the current century has allowed for
robust economic growth in Belarus, which has led to a notable reduction in absolute poverty, and one
of the best performances in the ECA region on the shared prosperity indicator – economic growth
has been shared widely, primarily through a social contract based on full employment and
wage/pension growth, as well as an extensive system of benefits and privileges with a wide coverage.
In recent years, the deterioration of the external environment has exposed some of the structural
imbalances in the economy of Belarus, while at the same time the recession over the past two years
has brought to the fore the increased vulnerability of households and raised questions about future
sustainability of past poverty and shared prosperity gains.

While the economy of Belarus is currently facing multiple challenges, this section highlights two
emerging challenges that are relevant to protecting the welfare of poor and B40 households. The first
challenge is that posed by population ageing, that reduces income earning capacity of households
through higher dependency ratios, while simultaneously putting pressure on the social protection
system through the falling ratio of pensions contributors and pension recipients. The second challenge
is posed by the ongoing reforms in the utilities sector that can have an important negative welfare
impact on vulnerable household through increasing tariffs and requires an improved safety net in
order to alleviate the impact of higher tariffs. The importance of strengthening the safety nets in order
to alleviate the impact of energy sector reforms is in fact part of the larger reform agenda in the social
protection sphere, which also includes, notably, the importance of strengthening the social insurance

                                                                                                       59
system in Belarus. However, the analysis of challenges of reforming social insurance is made difficult
by the lack of LFS data. Thus, we focus here on utilities.

                  5.1.     POPULATION AGING AND ITS IMPLICATIONS

The population of Belarus is aging, and the size of the working age population has been declining
since 2000, and is projected to continue declining over the foreseeable future. At the same time, the
size of the elderly population is projected to continue increasing until after 2050 – the share of 60+
population in Belarus is projected to increase from 15 percent in 2000 to 35 percent in 2050 (Figure
5-1). The worsening demographic environment also sees the old age dependency ratio increasing from
20 percent in 2000 to 46 percent in 2050 (Figure 5-2).

The aging issues is a common challenge for most countries in the ECA region. In general, aging may
be driven by two factors – increases of life expectancy or declines in fertility. In Belarus, like in many
other countries in the region, the latter factor played a key role. However, low fertility is not a problem
per se, but requires adequate changes in demographic and economic policy as well as adjustments in
individual behavior. Fertility tends to have a U-share relation with income, such that it might rebound
again with the further increases in prosperity.

The economic consequences of aging are uncertain. Among the main channels through which aging
may adversely affect the economy are (i) higher old-age dependency ratio in the labor market and
hence smaller numbers of workers as a share of total population; (ii) fiscal challenges that require more
resources in pay-as-you-go pension systems and other age related areas of public expenditures, like
healthcare, and (iii) lower capacity for investment driven by a lower stock of savings dues to a declining
share of people of working age who tend to save the most as a share of their income. However,
population aging is not only a burden for an economy; it can also provide a stimulus and have positive
macroeconomic effects. For these effects to materialize, strong behavioral and policy responses are
generally needed. Among the potential responses are increases in labor force participation rates,
especially for elderly; increases in labor productivity and changes in savings patterns of households.

The recent Golden Aging report (World Bank, 2015) places Belarus among the top of the countries in
the ECA region in terms of the severity of the challenges presented by population aging and argued
that Belarus, together with Bulgaria, Moldova and countries in the Western Balkans need large
adjustments along both demographic and economic dimensions. In Belarus, this means, in particular,
improving life expectancy, with the mortality risk for a 60-year-old male today being considerably
lower than for a 60-year-old male in 1959. Among the seven indicators considered in the report –
three demographic ones and four economic, Belarus is in the top quartile of risk for healthy life
expectancy and in the middle two quartiles for the remaining six indicators. Belarus fares poorly by
regional standards on the indicator of healthy life years, requiring complex and multifaceted reforms,
inclusively to promote prevention in the health sector and to promote behavioral changes.

As the result of the shrinking working age population, and the increase in the share of elderly in
Belarus, the projected fiscal flows in the pensions system in Belarus are projected to deteriorate
between present day and 2050. This is due to the fact that aging and the shrinking of the working age
population will have a negative effect on GDP per capita growth in the future, as well as wage growth
in excess of GDP (due to increasing labor scarcity), which will imply pension growth in excess of
GDP. The pension system in Belarus operated under a relatively favorable demographic environment
over the past decade. The share of the working age population in Belarus has increased between 1975-
2000, while at the same time, the pension cohorts over the past decade have been composed of those
born during or immediately after WWII, when birth rates were low. Combined with increased
mortality during the transition years, this implied a relatively small share of pensioners, limiting
pressure on the expenditure side. This is not sustainable, however. Recent simulations (Bornukova et
al., 2015) suggest that the ratio of pensions expenditures to GDP could increase from 9 percent in
2013 to 20 percent by 2050. The cumulative effect of the increasing number of beneficiaries
(pensioners) and the falling payments into the pension fund, could result in a pension fund deficit
equivalent to 9 percent of GDP by 2050 (Bornukova et al., 2015).

In addition to emerging fiscal sustainability issues, another (related) emerging concern has to do with
the ability of the elderly to continue benefiting from shared prosperity in the future. HSS data reveal
that while the share of wage recipients has remained constant over the past decade, the share of
pension recipients both in the B40 population and in the T60 population increased – in the B40 group
the share of pension recipients increased from 19 percent in 2003 to 24 percent in 2015 (30 percent
to 37 percent in T60 for the same period). As the population aging process continues, all else equal,
the share of pension income in overall disposable income will increase for an increasing share of the
population. This shines a spotlight on the ability of pension income to support the well-being of the
B40 (and beyond) in the future.

Currently, the replacement rate of pensions in Belarus is just above 40 percent. Recent simulations
(World Bank, 2011) suggest that, under no reform scenario, the replacement ratio is projected to
decrease to below 35 percent over the next 50 years. Such projections are or course highly dependent
on the system parameters. For instance, Belarus currently has the lowest retirement age (55 for women,
60 for men) in the ECA region, and well below the age of 65, which tends to be the standard among
OECD countries. Should retirement age thresholds change to 65/65 for both men and women, the
projected replacement rates would actually increase to just below 55 percent of the same period (World
Bank, 2011).

                                 5.2.   IMPACT OF UTILITY TARIFF REFORMS

Many households benefit not only from direct transfers, but also from subsidized tariffs for a number
of services provided by the state, such as passenger transport or utilities. For instance, in the district
heating sector, the total fiscal and quasi-fiscal costs of cumulative losses on residential district heating
services was estimated to have risen from 0.7 percent of GDP in 2005 to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2012
(World Bank, 2014). Residential heating tariffs were at only 20 percent of cost recover levels in 2012,
and at less than 60 percent currently, thus providing important price subsidies to households for the
heating that households consume.

Low tariffs lead to inefficient energy consumption and disproportionately benefit higher income
groups. Utilities subsidies, available to everyone in the form of subsidized tariffs and accounting for
about 2 percent of GDP, are strongly regressive. While higher income groups tend to spend a lower
share of their total expenditures on utilities, their consumption in absolute terms is much higher
(because high income households tend to occupy larger living areas and have much higher total

                                                                                                                 62
expenditure (World Bank, 2011). Bornukova, Shymanovich and Chubrik (2017) show that in $PPP
terms the amount of utilities subsidies is monotonically increasing with income and is highest for the
top decile of the distribution (Figure 5-4).

The elimination of subsidies, and re-alignment of tariffs with cost-recovery tariffs would result, absent
mitigating measures, in notable welfare costs, particularly to low income households. To estimate the
welfare impact on households of increasing tariffs on utilities, we can use the framework proposed in
Freund, C. and Wallich C. (1996). [1] Specifically, we examine how the change in tariffs is affecting the
share of utility expenditures in the total household expenditures. This change can be calculated as:

                       Change in Budget Share = (S0(P1-P0)/P0)(ε+ ε(P1-P0)/P0+1),

Where P1 and P0 are prices after and before the price change, and S0 is the initial budget share before
the price change. When faced with increases in utility tariffs, households may change their
consumption patterns, inclusively for utilities. The degree of such adjustments – the price elasticity of
demand (ε) – is not known and will likely vary across households. So far, we have not modelled
behavioral adjustments (i.e. assumed a price elasticity of demand of zero), but this parameter can be
varied. S0 – is initial share of utilities in households’ expenditures.

Simulations suggest that increasing heating tariffs to cost recovery levels would lead to a notable
increase in the share of the overall budget that households would have to allocate to utilities payments,
and this increase would be the highest for low income households. In the bottom decile the share of
household budgets devoted to utilities during the heating season in urban areas could increase from
11.6 percent of total to 16.5 percent of total by the end of 2017, under some of the recent tariff
projections, and without any compensation. By the end of 2018 the share of households budgets
devoted to utilities in the bottom decile could reach 20 percent, absent compensatory measures. Note
that for households at the bottom of the income distribution the share of budgets devoted to utilities
is higher, and the absolute magnitude of the tariff increases is similarly higher, in comparison with
households further up the income ladder, i.e. tariff increases are more problematic for low income
households. This is also confirmed by focus group discussions that revealed that in order to cope with
tariff increases poor households would have to cut back on consumption of food and clothing, or
have to borrow money from friends or relatives (World Bank, 2014).

The Government has introduced, at the beginning of the 2016 heating season, a compensatory
program that limits the impact of tariff increase to no more than 20 percent of household budgets in
urban areas, and no more than 15 percent of household budgets in rural areas. Estimates of household
expenditures on utilities, accounting for this compensatory measure, are presented in Figure 5-6. Note
that the introduction of the program alleviates some of the impact of the program – in the bottom
decile utility expenditures are estimated to increase to 16 percent at the end of 2018 instead of 20
percent absent compensation. Still the impact of tariff increases on low income households is still
notable, taking into account that spending in excess of 15 percent of budget on utilities in commonly
considered in the literature as a threshold identified with “energy poverty”, indicating a level of
expenditures that is difficult to meet.

It is also evident from the estimated program coverage and the distribution of the program budget
across deciles that the targeting of the program could be improved. Less than 30 percent of the
population in the bottom decile is estimated to be would be covered by the program in 2017, and only
a quarter of the program budget would go the bottom quintile (less than half of the budget would go
to the B40 group). Alternative program designs that offer compensation on a sliding scale depending
on the ratio between the household’s income and the Minimum Subsistence Budget (MSB) are
currently being considered and could help improve both the coverage of households at the bottom
and the targeting of program resources.

                                           6. CONCLUDING REMARKS

High growth rates over the past decade were associated with a considerably fall in the poverty
headcount from over 80 percent of the population in 2003 to roughly 10 percent of the population in
2015, measured at the international PPP$10/day threshold. Economic growth was widely shared –
indeed, Belarus has registered one of the best performances along the World Bank’s shared prosperity
indicator among all countries in the ECA region. Disposable income growth has been driven by a
combination of income and pension growth, with an increasing importance of the contribution of
non-contributory social transfers in more recent years. A key feature of the social contract in Belarus
has been the provision of full employment with the help of a large SOE sector that employs over 60
percent of the workforce. A system of state support in the form of subsidized loans and tax
concessions has in turn allowed the SOE sector to maintain excessive employment. In addition, wages
have growth considerably in real terms, inclusively through administrative wage targets that affect
most spheres of the economy, and not just the SOE sector. A combination of high growth and a
favorable demographic environment (from the point of view of the pension system) has also allowed
pensions to keep pace with wages – an important aspect as the elderly are becoming a more prominent
share of the population overtime, inclusively of the B40 group.

While the fall in the poverty rate during 2003-2014 is impressive, among certain population groups
poverty, as measured at the international PPP$10/day threshold is still quire prevalent. More than a
quarter of people living in households with 2 children (0-12) were below the poverty threshold (45
percent among households with 3+ children), compared to only 7 percent among households with no
children. Similarly, while less than 1 percent of population of Minsk city live on less than PPP$10/day,

                                                                                                     66
in rural areas the poverty rate is 24 percent in 2015. Across regions, there are also notable differences
– the poverty rate in Minsk Oblast was 10.9 percent in 2015, whereas in Brest 22.3 percent of the
population were below the poverty threshold.

The worsening external environment also highlights household vulnerability and sustainability
concerns along multiple dimensions of the existing social contract. A deterioration of external
conditions in recent years exposed a number of growing imbalances in the economy. As the result,
economic growth slowed down, culminating in a recession during 2015-2016, which has led to a
reversal of the poverty reduction trend of the past. In Brest, already the poorest region, the incidence
of poverty increased by over 5 percentage points between 2014 and 2015. Furthermore, the high
concentration of the population just above the poverty line, combined with a sluggish recovery suggest
that new shocks could lead to further increase in the vulnerability of low income households. The
evidence from household surveys is consistent with low income households drawing down on savings
to deal with income losses, which is not sustainable over a long period of time. The ongoing reforms
of utility tariffs can also have important welfare effects, absent mitigation measures, and estimates
suggest that the mitigation measures currently in place do not fully compensate for tariff increases that
have already taken place. The worsening economic and demographic environment also adversely
affects the pension system, raising concerns about the ability of the elderly to continue benefiting from
shared prosperity in the future as they have been able to do in the past.

Finally, while lack of data has not allowed us to address labor market issues in detail here, it should be
noted that labor markets are currently under stress and the number of jobs is shrinking. During the
recession in 2015-2016, SOEs adjusted by reducing working hours and obliging workers to go on
partially paid, or even unpaid, leave. Earlier estimates of over-employment based on firm-level data
looking a comparison between the relative labor productivity of state and non-state firms with similar
characteristics, suggest that eliminating the excess employment in SOEs (e.g. increasing labor
productivity to the level observed in comparable private sector enterprises) could lead to an increase
of about 4.2 percentage points in the overall unemployment rate (World Bank, 2011).

The combination of the population aging process, as well as ongoing reforms in the energy sector and
the need for improving the allocation of factors of production in the Belarus economy in order to
boost productivity – especially important in the context of population aging – requires a parallel policy
agenda aimed at improving the ability of the social protection system (both the social insurance and
social assistance components), to provide an effective – and sustainable – safety net. This is also
consistent with the longer term objective of ensuring the sustainability of past shared prosperity gains.
From the perspective of households, things that will be important will be investing in people’s
productive capacity (assets) at the bottom of the distribution, and creating opportunities for them to
use the assets productively in the labor market. This will require, for instance, investing in policies that
promote and maintain access to early childhood education, as well as improving the Government’s
ability to assess the quality of education and the degree to which the skills provided by the education
system match the demands of the labor market, particularly in the expanding private sector. In
addition, in order to preserve impressive gains in poverty reduction, it will be important to reduce the

vulnerability of those who are not poor anymore but remain vulnerable to negative economic shocks,
in part through strengthening the parts of the social protection system that have been shown to have
a high degree of efficiency in reducing poverty and inequality. Finally, it should be noted that aiming
for sustainable shared prosperity, because of the anonymity of the B40 group, requires focusing not
on individuals with particular characteristics, but on channels that enable the accumulation, and
intensive use of assets, and embed good incentives in the social transfer systems in order to maximize
the earning capacity of households (Bussolo and Lopez-Calva, 2014). Recent changes in external
environment present a set of risks – but also offer an opportunity to build on past successes in
inclusive growth, but with a renewed focus on the sustainability of the social contract.
