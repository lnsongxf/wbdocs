Climate change is a risk multiplier that threatens to unravel decades of development gains. Among the
most critical and direct risks to humans is the impact of climate change on health. Heat stress will worsen
as high temperatures become more common and water scarcity increases; malnutrition, particularly in
children, could become more prevalent in some parts of the world where droughts are expected to become
more frequent; and water- and vector-borne diseases are likely to expand in range as conditions favor mos-
quitoes, flies, and water-borne pathogens. Worse still, these threats will be greatest in regions where the
population is most dense, most vulnerable, and least equipped to adapt, pushing more people in poverty
and reinforcing a cycle of environmental degradation, poor health and slow development.
    Addressing these climate-associated health risks is critical. Alongside risk, there is opportunity. Responses
to climate change have unearthed significant potential for improving both human health and the environ-
ment. Low carbon hospitals can draw upon the many advances made by the energy sector in developing
cleaner and renewable resources. Pharmaceutical supply chains can benefit from more efficient and less
polluting transport. And food and nutrition can be improved by the advances achieved through climate-
smart agriculture.
    Climate change challenges are multi-sectoral and so too are the solutions. At the World Bank Group, we
are tackling different dimensions of these environment and health threats in different ways. For example,
the ‘Pollution Management and Environmental Health’ Trust Fund addresses air pollution, toxic land pol-
lution, and marine litter. Work on Climate-Smart Agriculture aims to sustainably increase food productivity
and human well-being in a changing climate. We are putting in place a new operational framework for
strengthening human, animal, and environmental health systems in response to disease threats. And within
the health sector, we have made Universal Health Coverage core and increasingly considerate of climate
change and resilience.
    At the World Bank Group, we work with the broader development community to create solutions that
can respond to and reduce these risks. Our work aligns with other global efforts aimed at improving envi-
ronmental and human health, such as the work of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, Global Alliance
for Clean Cookstoves, One Health and Planetary Health communities, and broader efforts to achieve the
Sustainable Development Goals.

      This report outlines a World Bank Approach and Action Plan for climate change and health. It is intended to establish an institu-
  tional foundation from which country programming can be built. The document reflects a consultative process across the World Bank
  Group taken together with other experts to determine the most promising and feasible practices. And though the plan is specific to the
  World Bank Group, the approaches are intended to be generally applicable to any institution aiming to finance or implement climate
  change and health programs.
      The work presented here is expected to assist the development community in further mainstreaming climate change and health into
  development operations so that we may address the emerging needs of vulnerable communities, particularly women and children. We
  are committed to working with development practitioners around the world on climate change and health, capitalizing upon associ-
  ated opportunities and technologies, and contributing to the overall goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

Introduction


Climate change (CC) impacts on health outcomes—both direct and indirect—are sufficient to jeopardize
achieving the World Bank Group’s visions and agendas in poverty reduction, population resilience, and
health, nutrition and population (HNP). In the last 5 years, the number of voices calling for stronger
international action on climate change and health has increased,1 as have the scale and depth of activi-
ties. But current global efforts in climate and health are inadequately integrated. As a result, actions
to address climate change—including World Bank Group (WBG) investment and lending—are missing
opportunities to simultaneously promote better health outcomes and more resilient populations and
health sectors.
     Accordingly, with the financial support of the Nordic Development Fund (NDF), the World Bank
Group set out to develop an approach and a 4-year action plan—outlined in this paper—to integrate
health-related climate considerations into selected WBG sector plans and investments.2
     The approach and 4-year action plan is to integrate health-related climate considerations into selected
WBG sector plans and investments. It does so using the prevailing health sector conceptual framework
of Universal Health Coverage, which brings in the positive and negative impacts that investments in
other sectors/areas of the economy have on health outcomes. A substantial share of the impacts that
climate has on health are mediated through interventions in sectors other than health. Therefore, while
reducing GHGs for climate change reasons will generally produce substantial short- and long-term
benefits for health, that alone is unlikely to maximize the outcomes of health investments, and in the
case of some investments in non-health sectors it may even negatively affect health outcomes.3
     This paper proposes a two-pronged approach. One prong proposes to focus most of the World Bank’s
efforts on improving the climate resilience of the health sector, both through purely adaptive solutions
but also through improvements to the sector’s sustainable energy access and efficiency. The other prong
proposes to look at selected investments in other sectors that affect climate-sensitive health outcomes,
to maximize development impact while minimizing the possibility of maladaptation.
     As such, this paper sets out to inform key groups within the World Bank. It outlines a potential
approach for the WBG in climate and health by considering the current health-climate change impera-
tive, the evolution of the global policy environment and the picture today, and global initiatives and



1  Climate change has been called both the ‘biggest global health threat’ and the “greatest global health opportunity” of the 21st
century (Costello, 2009; Watts, 2015). The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) has called climate change
“the defining global health threat of the 21st century” (Chan, 2014), and the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change has noted “a climate agreement is a global health agreement.”
2  In addition, NDF resources have also been allocated under a different Bank product to support Mozambique’s Ministry of Health
in their efforts to strengthen the health sector’s resilience to climate change.
3  E.g.: Irrigation schemes, and reintroduction of mangroves as a coastal protection may help vector disease transmission if parallel
measures are not considered. Fuel policy exclusively looking at pollution for health reasons may have substantial GHG impacts or
vice versa, and climate resilient transport investments may worsen chronic flooding in certain areas or stimulate urban development
in areas likely to become unhealthy because of flooding.

          most vulnerable to climate shifts and have the least capacity to take adaptation or mitigation measures
          given their weak health infrastructure and capacity. The threat posed by climate to health outcomes
          has been extensively discussed for some years and is seen to be growing.
              Climate change impacts could drag more than 100 million people back into extreme poverty by
          2030 (Hallegate, 2016), with a significant part of this reversal attributable to negative impacts on health
          outcomes. There is clear and mounting evidence that health outcomes will—in large part—be negatively
          impacted by rising sea levels and temperatures and weather extremes due to climate change. Several
          of the emissions that drive climate change also affect health directly. These impacts will be greatest in
          the poorest countries and regions where the population is densest, most vulnerable, and least equipped
          to adapt (World Bank, 2012, 2013, and 2014; Smith et al., 2014).
              Given the complexity of social and environmental factors that influence disease and health outcomes,
          the precise extent of this impact is difficult to establish. The World Health Organization (WHO), for
          example, estimated in the early 2000s that climate change was already accounting for an additional
          150,000 annual deaths (WHO, 2004). Forecasts suggest that by 2030 an additional 250,000 deaths per
          year will occur from heat exposure, undernutrition, malaria, and diarrheal disease due to climate change.
          These estimates are regarded as conservative and do not include all climate-sensitive health impacts,
          e.g., pollution, injuries, non-malaria infectious disease, and others for which projection data is lacking
          (WHO, 2014). Figure 1.1 shows the endpoints of climate-sensitive health impacts and correlates them
          to environmental variables, sensitive to a cycle of broader climatic change.
              This additional burden of disease comes with a significant economic global and local impact. One
          study (Ebi, 2008) estimates the global additional costs associated with climate change-related cases
          of just three sets of diseases—malaria, diarrheal diseases, and malnutrition—to be US$4–12 billion in
          2030 under the business-as-usual scenario.4 A significant part of this burden is borne by poor countries
          where those three conditions are already persistent.
              Separate work suggests there are also significant costs associated with disaster-related health
          impacts. Although little research has been undertaken for the developing world, it was estimated that
          climate-related disasters have already caused US$14 billion in health-related costs over a 10-year period
          in the US alone (Knowlton, et al., 2011). Other research has estimated that impacts associated with
          labor productivity losses due to excess heat (correlating to health stress) may be as much as 11–20
          percent in heat-prone regions such as Asia and the Caribbean by 2080 (Kjellstrom, 2009). If avoided,




          4  This corresponds to a scenario that assumes that nothing additional would be done to control climate (e.g., reduce greenhouse
          gas emissions) beyond what would occur through increased efficiency, reductions in air pollution, etc. It corresponds to a CO2
          concentration in the atmosphere of 750 parts per million.

          Imperative


          The past 24 years have brought advances in better understanding and quantifying the impacts of CC
          and pollution in health. However, it is only in the past 5 years (and notably in 2015) that a series of
          global changes and events have taken place, opening for the first time a real window of opportunity
          for intervention at significant scale. To seize this emerging opportunity, steps need to be taken globally
          and by the WBG to pursue well-targeted knowledge gathering and operational and capacity building
          efforts to correct some of the evident system failures. In this chapter is a brief summary of global and
          WBG efforts to date.


          The Global Perspective
          Growing Awareness and Research Attention on Impacts
          of Climate Change and Health

          Beginning with the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, a small group of health experts has advocated greater
          consideration of the impacts of climate change on human health. Subsequently, there has been a
          growing body of research addressing both singular and collective dimensions of climate change and
          health. Initially, public work in this area focused on raising awareness of the impacts of climate change:
          notably vector-borne diseases, waterborne diseases, and malnutrition. Over time, the focus on impacts
          expanded to encompass approaches to adaptation and by the early 2000s included heat stress, psy-
          chological impacts, respiratory impacts, and injuries from extreme weather. The onset of the European
          heat wave of 2003 served to heighten interest in the field. At the global level, this focus has gradually
          expanded to address the co-health benefits of mitigation (such as cardiorespiratory health), the recur-
          rence in recent years of climate-sensitive infectious diseases, the greater scientific understanding of the
          impacts of temperature changes on pollution, the quantification of the related burden of disease, and
          the growth of highly polluted megacities.
              In the meantime, specialized research institutions have been established, nongovernmental organiza-
          tions have dedicated themselves to the cause, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Pan-American
          Health Organization have created climate change and health divisions, and a number of private foun-
          dations have devoted specialized funding streams. WHO has led the effort in developing a catalogue
          of country engagement resources including training, assessments, and analytical pieces to be used in
          supporting national adaptation plans and country strategies. In collaboration with the World Meteoro-
          logical Organization (WMO), WHO has supported 17 major projects focusing on health adaptation to
          climate change in 14 countries across all WHO regions. It has also carried out assessments of health
          vulnerability to climate change in over 30 countries. WHO reviews country requirements and serves
          as a clearinghouse of current adaptation projects, while also providing guidance to pilot projects on
          green and safe health services.

      uncertain in what is still an emerging research field. Progress in medical                                  a. Climate change only
      treatments offers hope that some of these issues could be solved over
      the long term thanks to new drugs and better health infrastructure. But
      short-term impacts could still be significant.
           Health shocks are important for poverty dynamics and the impact
      of CC for three main reasons. First, the diseases that most affect poor
      people are diseases expected to expand with CC (such as malaria and
      diarrhea). In Africa, for instance, malaria could increase by 5–7 percent
                                                                                                                   b. Development only
      among populations at risk in higher altitudes, leading to a potential
      increase in the number of cases of up to 28 percent. Similarly, climate
      impacts could increase the burden of diarrhea by up to 10 percent by
      2030 in some regions. Second, health expenditures are regressive, with
      poor households largely uninsured (such outlays push an estimated
      100 million people per year into poverty) and the loss of income for
      the sick or the caregiver can have a large impact on family prospects.
      Third, children are most vulnerable to these shocks and can suffer from                                       c. Combined effects
      irreversible impacts that affect their lifetime earnings and lead to the
      intergenerational transmission of poverty. Partly because of its impacts
      on agriculture, CC will increase undernutrition and could sharply increase
      severe stunting. By 2030, an additional 7.5 million children may be
      stunted. Climate Change may even lead to an absolute increase in the
      number of stunted children in some parts of Africa, with the negative
      effect of climate change outweighing the positive effect of economic
                                                                                                   Expansion        Contraction     No change    Absent

      (e.g., its content in terms of micronutrients such as iron, iodine, vitamin
      A, folate, and zinc) could also be affected by CC, even though little is
      known about potential impacts. Development—notably better access to
      health care and to services such as water and sanitation infrastructure—has the potential to reduce but not eliminate the risks climate change poses
      for health (see for instance, figure on malaria incidence). Universal health coverage would contribute greatly to climate change adaptation—and moni-
      toring and surveillance systems (both in the health and environmental sectors) will be critical to deal with emerging health issues.6

          The Conceptual Framework: Making
          UHC Climate Smart for World Bank’s
          Clients’ Population


          The single most significant predictor of future health impacts of climate change and health-related
          adaptation costs in a country may be the population’s current health status. It has also been noted that
          effective resilience hinges upon a country’s progress toward UHC, the degree of public access to basic
          goods and services beyond the health sector, and preparedness and response to disasters (whether
          climate-related or otherwise). These all serve to reduce impacts in terms of health and the costs of
          climate adaptation to the minimum.
              The 2010 World Health Report defined UHC as ensuring that everyone receives the health services
          they need—including initiatives designed to promote better health, prevent illness, and to provide treat-
          ment, rehabilitation, and palliative care of sufficient quality to be effective—while at the same time
          ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the user to financial hardship (WHO, 2010). In
          practice, these health services can encompass policies that discourage smoking, vaccination programs,
          and end-of-life care. UHC’s three dimensions—health services, finance, and population—are represented
          in what has come to be known as the “Coverage Cube” (Boerma T. et al., 2014; Figure 3.1).
              As illustrated in Figure 3.1, attaining universal health coverage requires growing the smaller blue
          cube to fill the larger cube. The larger cube represents the ideal world and the dotted arrows the gap
          between the situation today and the goal to be achieved. The X axis reflects the goal of ensuring health
          coverage of 100 percent of the population. At the same time, UHC requires increasing the number and
          types of services to which all the population has access from whatever is included today in the basic
          package of services to reach those determined to be defined policy aims (Y axis). For instance, a policy
          goal may be to make dental care available to all regardless of whether they can afford it. Finally, the
          Z axis corresponds to the percentage of the costs of health care that are financed by so called out-
          of-pocket payments. Under UHC, everyone is covered by one form or another of financial pooling
          mechanisms (e.g., insurance). This is to guarantee that no one is impoverished because of the need
          to pay for health care costs.
              The same way that “good” development is a necessary but not sufficient condition to increase the
          population’s resilience to climate change (World Bank, 2009), accelerating progress toward UHC is
          absolutely necessary to protect individuals and communities from the health effects of climate change
          but will be insufficient if pursued in a “business as usual” manner. Moreover, full implementation
          of UHC cannot eliminate all climate risks. Even wealthy countries with high adaptive capacity have
          pockets of poverty and groups of people who tend to be more vulnerable to climate variability and
          change, as demonstrated by the European heat wave in 2003, the Chicago heatwave in 1995 (Scheraga
          and Grambsch, 1998; NOAA, 1995), and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 (EHP, 2013; JAMA, 2014).

Box 3.3: Curbing the CO2 Footprint of the Health Sector. Examples of Mitigation
Interventions
The health sector’s GHG/CO2 footprint is smaller than some other sectors, such as energy, transport, and agriculture. It is however, energy-intensive,
and often pays inadequate regard to energy efficiency. In low- and some middle-income countries, energy payments represent a substantial per-
centage of operating costs at health facilities (WHO and World Bank, 2014). A lack of forward thinking traps the health sector on a high carbon path
that will be expensive to reverse later. At the same time, in many of those same countries, health facilities have very limited access to the minimum
power they need to offer basic services, posing a barrier to achieving UHC.
     Affordable, adequate, reliable and sustainable access to energy for health facilities is central to achieving UHC. Studies show that, in general,
focusing on energy efficiency and clean power in the health sector results in essential savings that can be applied to clinics and hospitals (WHO and
World Bank, 2014). Health facilities with electricity help attract skilled health workers, enable potentially more sustainable health care models, and
introduce lifesaving technologies. In the private sector, pharmaceutical and medical device companies may lose competitiveness if dependent upon
high fossil fuel needs in their technology investments. Finally, reducing GHG gases in any sector is a public good. The 2010 World Development
Report pointed to the fact that “affordability hinges on mitigation being (achieved) cost-effectively.”
     Partners in Health (PIH) work in Mirebalais University Hospital, is an example of such a clean-energy, cost-saving approach taken by one hospi-
tal operator in Haiti. Since 2007, PIH has installed small-scale solar energy systems at five clinics in rural Rwanda, as well as in Malawi, Lesotho, and
Haiti. After the devastating Haitian earthquake in 2010, PIH chose to use solar power as a cost-effective, reliable, and environmentally responsible
means to help power the University Hospital at Mirebalais and avoid the disruption posed by Haiti’s frequent blackouts. On most sunny days, the
system’s 1,800 solar panels will generate more electricity than the hospital consumes, allowing the surplus energy to feed back into the electrical
grid.
     In addition, the hospital minimizes energy needs through high-efficiency fluorescent light fixtures, motion sensors for lights that save up to 60
percent in energy usage, and natural ventilation that reduces both the spread of infection and the need for air conditioning. On the roof, reflective
white coating keeps the building cooler and makes the solar panels up to 15 percent more efficient.
     Other successful interventions across the world include the use of micro-dams to power hospitals, improved temperature controls, improved
insulation, and staff behavior change such as turning off equipment when not in use.
     For further expansion, please see the 2017 World Bank report, “Climate-smart healthcare: low carbon and resilience strategies for the health
sector.”

 4        Operational Framework for WBG
          Approach to Health and Climate


          This Approach and Climate and Health Action Plan build upon the World Bank Group Climate Change
          Action Plan (CCAP) approved by the WBG Board in April 2016. The CCAP affirms the institution’s
          commitment to strengthen action on climate and health, to increase its capacity to respond to coun-
          tries eligible for World Bank support that have included health in their NDCs, and to integrate climate
          considerations within its support for UHC. It states that, subject to available resources: 1) by the end
          of FY2020, the WBG will have supported two countries in developing plans to reduce GHG emissions
          in the health sector; 2) by the end of FY2017, the WBG will have supported two countries to carry out
          vulnerability assessments; and 3) by the end of FY2018, the WBG will have supported two countries
          to develop climate smart surveillance and early warning systems. In addition, by the end of FY2019,
          75 percent of HNP task team leaders will be trained in climate change and health; and by the end of
          FY2020, 20 percent of new HNP projects will consider climate in their design.
               Those goals are seen as enough to show proof of concept (or “low scenario”) for the climate change
          and health work. The proposed plan of action detailed in Annex C sets even more ambitious targets
          (see also Table 5.1), including defining and structuring, jointly with partners, the use of climate data for
          health planning, surveillance and early warning, the enhancement of existing urban energy efficiency
          planning tools to include impacts of clean air in health, and covering knowledge gaps in the economics
          of climate change and health.
               To deliver on its commitment to support countries in their resilience path as regards to health and
          climate, the WBG needs to facilitate the expansion of climate-smart UHC. This implies mainstreaming
          climate considerations in HNP operations and ensuring that critical aspects of health and climate are
          integrated into climate-smart WBG activities in other sectors. It also would require significant efforts
          to increase its internal capacity. The operational framework described in Figure 4.1 proposes two stra-
          tegic objectives, three activity pillars addressing the key systemic failures previously identified, and
          two transversal support areas.
               These pillars are of course interrelated. The knowledge being gathered and generated will increase
          World Bank staff’s capacity as well as that of our clients, and both will result in improved investments
          and operations. The details of the activities envisaged under these pillars and cross-cutting areas are
          presented below, after discussing the strategic objectives. The theory of change on which the approach

 5        The Climate Change and Health Plan
          of Action FY2017–2020


          While we are confident that most of the targets stated in the WBG overall Climate Action Plan can
          be achieved within existing World Bank budgets, the proposed scope of this Climate and Health Plan
          of Action requires substantial additional financing. Accordingly, the plan of action presents scenarios
          consistent with the level of available financing.
              This chapter summarizes proposed activities in support of the Climate Change and Health Plan of
          Action for the next four fiscal years, including a road map with financing needs, and general metrics
          and targets.

          The Theory of Change

          What is being proposed here ultimately implies integrating climate in both HNP and non-HNP opera-
          tions. Successful experience mainstreaming other concepts and actions across WBG operations and
          policy dialogues suggests the need for an authorizing environment, such as corporate commitments and
          strategies. Mainstreaming mechanisms include people, processes and programs, and financial resources,
          as these serve to catalyze changes in the policy discussions and investments.
               Figure 5.1 describes the proposed elements that need to be in place to facilitate the successful main-
          streaming of climate change considerations in HNP, and of climate and health consideration in selected
          operations in the rest of the World Bank portfolio. Experience suggests that a conducive authorizing
          environment greatly facilitates integrating new concepts or ideas into World Bank operations. Using
          existing corporate processes also helps. However, to be sustainable, such top-down support needs to be
          complemented by bottom-up buy-in, which is generally best achieved through increased awareness of
          staff, especially “champions” who are already leading innovative products. Working with staff across
          sectors who are leading such initiatives, and finding ways to leverage existing tools and resources, adds
          value to such platforms to reduce the burden on teams. For instance, in the case of climate change
          and health, we propose to leverage ESMAP’s knowledge and technical resources from the Efficient and
          Sustainable Buildings initiative, and IFC’s Excellence in Designs for Greater Efficiency tool, to increase
          the energy access and efficiency of health facilities in the public and private sectors, respectively. This
          is more efficient and much more likely to be successful than having the CCSA or HNP develop energy
          efficiency standards for health facilities.
               As indicated, this Climate and Health Plan of Action builds upon the World Bank Group CCAP. In its
          low scenario it proposes activities to fulfil the CCAP targets.10 In addition the proposed plan of action,
          detailed in Annex C, proposes two medium and high resource scenarios that set even more ambitious




          10  In a nutshell before 2020 the WBG would have supported at least six countries to develop plans to reduce GHG emissions in
          the health sector, or carry out vulnerability assessments or develop climate smart surveillance and early warning systems. It would
          have trained 75 percent of HNP task team leaders in climate change and health and 20 percent of new HNP projects will consider
          climate in their design.

Conclusion and Next Steps


The health impacts of climate change demand an immediate response, and there are many opportunities
to confront these new health-related climate realities across the numerous dimensions of World Bank
work. The CCSA and the HNP, and ENR GPs are central to this effort but so too are other sectors and
GPs, including Agriculture, Transport, Urban Development, Energy and Water, among others, as each
has a stake in considering the health impacts and opportunities of climate change. If we recognize and
act upon this challenge, we will be prepared for a substantially altered burden of health conditions;
the impacts of extreme weather events will be anticipated and managed, and low-carbon cities will
provide mobility while addressing pollution and related noncommunicable diseases. Recognition of
health costs will reinforce the economic case for shifting to low-carbon growth.
     Regions and countries also need to address these near-term and long-term impacts, drawing upon
the tools of many of the involved sectors. Through a strengthened coalition of international actors,
the potential for health impacts to undermine the international community’s goals for the post-2015
development agenda will be recognized and addressed.
     International actors bring different mandates and resources to this issue and the World Bank can play
a role in line with its comparative advantages that includes its convening power, knowledge resources,
and finance. As a convener, the World Bank can help mobilize coalitions for action from a broad sector
base, such as those in public health, environment, and—importantly—finance. As a knowledge bank,
it can use analytical resources to strengthen the evidence base for action. As a financing institution, it
can respond to growing demand to deliver responses at scale.
     Success requires that investment and lending operations be informed by sector strategies that rec-
ognize the climate exposure pathways that lead to health impacts, and integrate responses (both for
adaptation and mitigation) that lessen the burden of disease over time, particularly in the areas that
are currently being—and will be—most affected.
     Despite substantial efforts over the last 25 years, both by the World Bank and others in the inter-
national community, the health sector is yet to embrace the need to increase its resilience to climate
change to improve health outcomes. Given that achieving UHC is the core goal and strategic framework
for the global health community, this paper has selected UHC as the entry point for climate engagement
as it relates to health outcomes. It illustrates the ways in which climate can hamper progress to this
objective as well as pointing to ways the health sector can counter those effects. For the WBG, viewing
climate change through the lens of this framework also highlights the central role of other sectors in
increasing community resilience to climate-related health effects.
     The imperative for the World Bank climate change and health plan of action, summarized above
and detailed in Annex C, is to upgrade and expand its own capacity and define new priorities to
