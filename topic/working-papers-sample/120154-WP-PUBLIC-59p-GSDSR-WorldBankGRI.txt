                            IBRD commitments and resources: New lending commitments by IBRD totaled $22.6 billion for 133 operations
                            in fiscal year 2017. As of June 30, 2017, net commitments in IBRD’s active portfolio stood at $106.7 billion. In fiscal year
                            2017, IBRD raised US dollar equivalent (USDeq) 56 billion by issuing bonds in 22 currencies. IBRD’s equity comprises
                            primarily paid-in capital and reserves. Under the terms of the general and selective capital increase resolutions approved
                            by the Board of Governors on March 16, 2011, subscribed capital is expected to increase by $87 billion, $5.1 billion of
                            which will be paid in. As of June 30, 2017, the cumulative increase in subscribed capital totaled $78.7 billion. Related
                            paid-in amounts in connection with the capital increase were $4.6 billion.

                            year 2017, including $16.2 billion in credits, $3.2 billion in grants, and $50 million in guarantees. As of June 30, 2017,
                            net commitments in IDA’s active portfolio stood at $105.6 billion. IDA is financed largely by contributions from partner
                            governments. Additional financing comes from transfers from IBRD’s net income, grants from the International Finance
                            Corporation, and borrowers’ repayments of earlier IDA credits. Total resources for the IDA17 Replenishment, which
                            covered fiscal years 2015–17, amounted to $38.7 billion in Special Drawing Rights (equivalent to $57.9 billion).

principle or approach
                                 The Bank’s environmental and social safeguard policies are a cornerstone of its support to sustainable poverty

                                 development process. These policies provide guidelines for Bank and borrower staff in the identification, preparation, and
                                 implementation of programs and projects. The effectiveness and development impact of programs and projects supported
                                 by the Bank has substantially increased as a result of attention to these policies. Safeguard policies have often provided
                                 a platform for the participation of stakeholders in project design, along with being an important instrument for building
                                 ownership among local populations.

102-12 External initiatives      The World Bank is committed to helping developing countries end poverty and boost shared prosperity in a sustainable
                                 manner. The Bank is a partner of choice for countries seeking to reach many of the Sustainable Development Goals
                                 (SDGs), adopted in September 2015, particularly in the context of financing, data, and supporting implementation.
                                 The World Bank is also an active member of many external initiatives, such as the United Nations Environmental
                                 Management Group and the Multilateral Financial Institutions Working Group on the Environment. As a United Nations
                                 (UN)-specialized agency, the Bank also supports the mission of the UN and the multilateral agreements for which the
                                 Bank acts as an implementing agency, such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Multilateral Fund for the
                                 Montreal Protocol, and the Convention to Combat Desertification. These facilities have enabled the Bank to become

                             operate more effectively. A few examples are:
                                 •	   In February 2015, the World Bank Group became a founding member of the Partnership on Religion and Sustainable Development,

102-15 Key impacts, risks,   The work of the World Bank is anchored in its goals: to end extreme poverty—reducing the share of the global
and opportunities            population living in extreme poverty to 3 percent by the year 2030—and to promote shared prosperity—increasing the
                             income of the bottom 40 percent of the population. Both goals must be met in a sustainable manner. The World Bank
                             Group Strategy, released in 2013, discusses the significant areas in which the World Bank makes economic, social, and
                             environmental impacts, as well as the associated challenges and opportunities along the path toward ending poverty
                             and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The strategy combines the strength of the International Bank for
                             Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA)—collectively known as the
                             World Bank—the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The
                             strategy places the institutions in a position to work with the public and private sectors in partnership in order to achieve
                             the twin goals sustainably.

102-15 Key impacts, risks,       Dealing with global political and economic policy uncertainties: The World Bank Group’s Chief Risk Officer monitors the
and opportunities (cont.)        global political and economic environments that could impact the institution’s finances. In fiscal year 2017, the global
                                 economy entered a period characterized by some recovery but high uncertainty. Economic growth in advanced economies
                                 remains weak, lower commodity prices have hurt developing economies, and high corporate leverage and related
                                 external borrowing in the larger emerging markets constitute a further key vulnerability for the World Bank’s borrowing
                                 countries. Policy uncertainty presents a key overarching risk, and there is a significant chance that economic activity could
                                 diverge from the baseline that foresees a gradual strengthening of global activity. Potential protectionist pressures are
                                 a significant risk. There remains considerable uncertainty, however, as to what extent and when such pressures might
                                 translate into concrete measures and the form these might take. Countries with open economies and dependent on trade,
                                 including many low-income countries, would be among the most vulnerable. Increased protectionism could also impact
                                 foreign direct investment flows to developing countries. The policy stance of major central banks as they move at varying
                                 paces to normalize monetary policy is another source of uncertainty. Market interest rate expectations could adjust
                                 abruptly in response to higher inflation or fiscal policy developments, affecting both interest rates and risk appetite.




                                                                                                                                                                   General Disclosures
                                 The most vulnerable countries are those dependent on portfolio investment to finance current account imbalances.
                                 Divergence from monetary policy expectations could also lead to further exchange rate movements. Corporate sectors
                                 that need to service large unhedged foreign currency borrowing could face stress in light of sharp exchange rate moves.
                                 In some countries, large contingent liabilities could be a source of risk and disruption.
                                 The World Bank continues to innovate and adapt to meet the needs of individual countries, and to address the needs
                                 of global public goods. To address them and other challenges, the Bank is developing innovative forms of financing in
                                 partnership with the public and private sectors. The transformational IDA18 Replenishment, finalized in December 2016,
                                 resulted in a record replenishment size of $75 billion to finance projects from July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2020. The IDA18
                                 package will introduce a hybrid financing model that blends contributions with market debt, using IDA’s first-ever public
                                 credit rating—triple-A—which it received in 2016. Three IDA18 special themes were retained from IDA17—climate
                                 change; gender and development; and fragility, conflict, and violence—and two new themes were introduced—
                                 governance and institutions, and jobs and economic transformation—which align with the overarching theme of
                                 “Toward 2030: Investing in Growth, Resilience, and Opportunity.”
                                 Significant IDA resources will be devoted to the program’s priority areas. The new Private Sector Window will leverage
                                 $2.5 billion of IDA’s capital over the next three years to mobilize at least $6 billion–$8 billion in additional private sector
                                 investments in the poorest and most fragile markets, and resources for countries affected by fragile, conflict, and violence
                                 situations as a group will double to more than $14 billion, including new financing mechanisms such as $2 billion to
                                 support refugees and host communities.

Ethics and integrity

102-16 Values, principles,   Fiscal year 2017 was critical for values and principles of behavior at the Bank Group: the organization committed to
standards, and norms of      refreshing the corporate values it put into place in 1997. In addition to taking a new look at the corporate values, the
behavior                     Bank Group committed to applying them to each part of Bank Group consistently; previously, the World Bank and IFC
                             had separate values statements, and MIGA had none. This has been a bottom-up exercise to develop a modern values
                             statement, provide cues for behavior and decision-making, and help motivate staff to deliver at full capacity.
                             The Ethics and Business Conduct (EBC) Vice Presidency is leading the “Refreshing Our Values” initiative. EBC and the
                             Human Resources Vice Presidency are co-chairing its widely representative Steering Committee.
                             For the initiative, nearly 450 staff from across the World Bank Group provided input to the new core values through focus
                             groups in Washington, DC, and several country offices. Also, all staff worldwide had the opportunity to give their input
                             online.

                             The core values that emerge from these consultations will be crafted into a statement submitted to senior management
                             with the expectation that it will be launched in October 2017. A new Bank Group Code of Conduct will be written in line
                             with the refreshed values statement, and the organization will move to integrate the values into many aspects of core
                             business and human resources decisions.
                             While the Refreshing Our Values initiative is moving forward, the status quo under the previous values regime remains
                             in place. There is a mandatory e-learning training on the Code of Conduct for all new staff, including consultants with
                             contracts of more than 30 days. A summary of the Code of Conduct is available in nine languages. There is a separate
                             Code of Conduct for Board officials. Business partners are informed of ethics expectations through a separate document.
                             Adherence to high ethical standards is specified in contracts with employees, Board officials, and business partners.
                             Section 1(c) of the Code for Board Officials requires them to sign the code document upon assuming duty and deposit it
                             with the Ethics Committee of the Board.
                             In addition to the required training for new staff, the institution offers a number of ethics training courses. EBC
                             continuously expands its range of training for headquarters and country office staff on values, expected business conduct,
                             recourses available against misconduct and retaliation, and the prevention of conflicts of interest.
                             Staff members are required to uphold World Bank Group Staff Rules as a condition of employment.

 102-16 Values, principles,       The head of EBC is a Bank Group Vice President. The leadership of this function by a Vice President reflects the
 standards, and norms of          importance of EBC’s mandate, comprised of four key areas of responsibility: (1) setting standards through the design and
 behavior (cont.)                 stewardship of ethical policy, practices, decisions, and behavior, including administering Declarations of Interest Programs
                                  to ensure public confidence; (2) reaching out to staff and offering training to strengthen values, foster a culture of respect
                                  and integrity, and build bridges between scientific research and practice in ethical development; (3) advising staff and
                                  clients by sharing ethics expertise and spotting trends, and providing counsel on conflicts of interest and compliance-
                                  related issues as needed; and (4) addressing misconduct by reviewing concerns, recommending actions, and facilitating
                                  resolutions. For more information on the World Bank’s Code of Conduct and EBC functions, see http://worldbank.org/

 102-17 Mechanisms for            EBC enables staff members (both past and present) to seek ethics-related advice or report suspected misconduct and
 advice and concerns about        other ethical issues. EBC informs employees, business partners, and other stakeholders of EBC’s services through a
 ethics                           range of communications and training programs.

                                  EBC maintains an email service account (ethics_helpline@worldbank.org) accessible to staff and advertised on the
                                  external website. Employees also can seek advice directly from EBC staff during office hours or arrange to speak
                                  with team members at a convenient time. Most services are provided in English, which is the working language of
                                  the organization. Staff members can also contact the Ethics Helpline by phone (800-261-7497) 24/7. This line is
                                  administered in multiple languages by an outside vendor.
                                  Advisory requests are treated with the highest possible level of confidentiality given the requirements of the case.
                                  Requests for advice can be made anonymously.
                                  Details are outlined for staff in the World Bank Group Code of Conduct. See http://worldbank.org/ethics.
                                  For reports of suspected misconduct, all information is confidential and subject to disclosure on a strict need-to-know
                                  basis. Anonymous complaints are accepted.
                                  EBC received 846 requests for advice in fiscal year 2017. In more than 90 percent of the cases, answers were provided
                                  within two business days. The most frequently received queries concerned a staff member’s outside activities, pre- or
                                  post-Bank Group employment, and couples or family relationships. EBC does not currently administer a satisfaction
                                  survey to individuals who contact the office for advice, though most express their gratitude for advice, and EBC staff
                                  invite feedback via email. EBC does conduct a service quality survey for complainants, witnesses, and subjects involved
                                  in reviews of allegations of suspected misconduct. Both participation in the survey and ratings are consistently good.




10    World Bank GRI Index 2017
102-17 Mechanisms for       EBC received 228 allegations of misconduct in fiscal year 2017. The most frequently received allegations involved non-
advice and concerns about   compliance with staff rules, harassment, and abuse of authority. The large majority of allegations were reviewed and
ethics                      closed after intake or initial review. EBC found enough basis to investigate 21 cases. Of those, seven resulted in the
                            submission of an investigative report to the Vice President of Human Resources, who has the authority to determine if
                            misconduct occurred and to impose sanctions. In four cases, sanctions were imposed; the cases are pending as of this
                            writing.
                            The Bank Group has a non-retaliation policy that protects against any direct or indirect detrimental action threatened or
                            taken because a person engaged in a protected activity. Retaliation is considered misconduct, and will be investigated
                            and sanctioned accordingly.
                            In addition, the Bank’s Integrity Vice Presidency works to improve compliance with corruption-related policies. The unit
                            trains staff to detect and deter fraud and corruption, and investigates allegations in activities conducted or financed
                            by the Bank Group—as well as allegations of significant fraud and corruption involving staff. EBC and Integrity Vice
                            Presidencies cooperate to ensure a consistency of approach.

Governance

102-18 Governance           The World Bank is a development institution for which its 189 member countries are shareholders. Member countries
structure                   govern the Bank through the Boards of Governors and the Board of Executive Directors (EDs).
                            The Boards of Governors consist of one Governor and one alternate Governor appointed by each member country. The
                            office is usually held by the country’s minister of finance, governor of its central bank, or a senior official of similar rank.
                            The Governors and alternates serve for terms of five years and can be reappointed. His Excellency Imad N. Fakhoury,
                            Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, Jordan, is the Chairman for the 2017 Annual Meetings. The
                            Governors delegate specific duties to the 25 EDs, who sit as a resident Board of Directors in Washington, DC. The five
                            largest shareholders appoint an Executive Director, while other member countries are represented by elected Executive
                            Directors.
                            Together, the Boards of Governors and the EDs make all major decisions for the organization, including policy, financial,
                            and membership issues.

                                  Resources Committee, and Committee on Governance and Executive Directors’ Administrative Matters (COGAM). The
                                  committees help the Board execute its oversight responsibilities through in-depth examinations of policies and practices,
                                  overseeing and making decisions about the Bank’s policies and procedures, financial condition, risk-management and
                                  assessment processes, adequacy of governance and controls, and effectiveness of development and poverty-reduction
                                  activities. In addition, the Ethics Committee provides guidance on matters covered by the Code of Conduct for Board
                                  officials. These committees function independently of all World Bank Group executive officers.

102-24 Nominating and         Nominating Governors of the Bank depends on the political systems of the individual 189 member governments. The
selecting the highest         main criterion is that a Governor is a minister of finance, development, or other national ministry. Other criteria like
governance body               diversity, independence, and expertise may factor into the independent, government-led decision-making process.
                              The Bank has no direct influence over Governor nomination, which is a sovereign matter related to countries’ internal
                              governance and decision-making.

102-35 Remuneration           Per the World Bank Articles of Agreement, “[The] Board of Governors shall determine the remuneration to be paid to

                              qualified staff, the World Bank Group has developed a compensation and benefits system designed to be internationally
                              competitive, to reward performance, and to take into account the special needs of a multinational and largely expatriate

                              staff. The Bank Group’s staff salary structure is reviewed annually by the Executive Directors and, if warranted, is adjusted
                              on the basis of a comparison with salaries paid by private financial and industrial firms and by representative public
                              sector agencies in the US market.
                              The Articles also state that Governors (the highest governance body)“...shall serve as such without compensation from
                              the Bank, but the Bank shall pay them reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings.”
Stakeholder engagement

102-40 List of stakeholder    As a global citizen and a global employer, the World Bank Group consults and collaborates with thousands of
groups                        stakeholders throughout the world. The Bank groups the stakeholders into two main categories: internal and external.
                              Internal stakeholders include shareholder governments (Governors), EDs, and Bank employees (staff).
                              External stakeholders include civil society; faith-based organizations; academics; foundations; parliamentarians; the

                              percent) of the staff as part of its mandate. The Staff Association negotiates with the Human Resources Vice Presidency,
                              senior management, line management, and the EDs to ensure the interests of staff are met. More than 11,000 World
                              Bank Group staff are members of the Staff Association, and 90 country offices have established Country Office Staff
                              Associations. Founded in 1972, the Staff Association is not a union and does not engage in collective bargaining. It
                              serves a critical role by representing the rights of all World Bank Group staff, as provided in Staff Rule 10.01.

                                      range from civil society organizations (which include faith-based organizations), media, labor unions, foundations,
                                      parliamentarians, and the private sector and investors.

 stakeholder engagement               and situational. Engagement takes the form of numerous approaches, including policy dialogue; operational partnerships;
                                      consultations; convenings and global platforms such as the Annual and Spring Meetings; and joint issue-based advocacy
                                      on campaigns, such as End Poverty and the Early Years campaign on early childhood development.
                                      1. Member governments: EDs and Governors engage regularly with a wide spectrum of stakeholders, including
                                      national stakeholders in their own country and with international civil society organizations (CSOs) on the margins of the
                                      organization’s Spring and Annual Meetings, as well as during travel to client countries for Bank Group operations. Each
                                      fall and spring, the Boards of Governors of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund (IMF) hold Annual
                                      and Spring Meetings to discuss a range of issues related to poverty reduction, international economic development,
                                      and finance. The Annual Meetings provide a forum for international cooperation and enable the Bank Group and the
                                      IMF to better serve their client countries. In addition to the Annual and Spring Meetings, the Development Committee
                                      convenes to advise the Boards of Governors on issues of global concern, including the world economic outlook, poverty
                                      eradication, economic development, and aid effectiveness.

102-43 Approach to       2. Employees: Engaging employees to boost pride in the institution and commitment to a shared mission is the
stakeholder engagement   primary goal of the new World Bank Employee Engagement Strategy, launched in fiscal year 2017. Engagement channels
(cont.)                  include the employee intranet; internal events such as live webcast leadership town halls and cultural performances;
                         social media announcements and opinions; learning opportunities; and targeted (for example, dedicated briefings and
                         news digests for managers) and broad-reach newsletters and emails from leadership. The World Bank’s intranet—
                         available on mobile devices and desktops—reaches all staff in 140 countries as the default browser homepage on World
                         Bank devices. The intranet features leadership communications, announcements, stories, webinars, social media calls-to-
                         action, staff profiles, and staff conversations, all curated by the dedicated Employee Engagement team in coordination
                         with a network of communication professionals across the organization. The Bank also promotes various corporate
                         communication campaigns, such as the Community Connections Campaign to raise funds for the local community
                         and client countries. Each year, the in-depth Employee Engagement Survey invites staff to voice their opinions on
                         comprehensive key issues, from leadership to career development, from inclusiveness to the work environment. The Bank
                         participation rate for the 2017 survey was 85 percent, with an overall engagement index of 80 percent.

                         3. Civil Society: The World Bank engages CSOs (which include faith-based and religious organizations) regularly
                         at the global, regional, and local level. The Bank shares information, solicits input on policy reform, consults with CSOs
                         on our strategy, collaborates with them on Bank-financed projects, and forges partnerships to further our dual goals.
                         For example: the Civil Society team hosts a monthly update call with more than 300 CSOs, and distributes a monthly
                         CSO eNewsletter, which reaches roughly 8,000 subscribers. Twice a year, during the Annual and Spring Meetings, the
                         World Bank Group hosts the Civil Society Policy Forum. Six hundred eighty-six CSO participants attended the Annual
                         Meetings (October 2016) and 850 CSO participants attended the Spring Meetings (April 2017). During the meetings
                         these civil society representatives from around the world deliberated on priority development issues with a broad group
                         of stakeholders. Forty-plus dialogue sessions were held, organized primarily by CSOs in collaboration with the Bank on
                         topics ranging from safeguards, citizen engagement, and public and private partnerships to inequality, health, and food
                         security. Through the Strategic Framework for Mainstreaming Citizen Engagement in World Bank Group Operations,
                         the Bank Group engages with CSOs and citizens to achieve better development results. This effort is grounded in the
                         commitment to include beneficiary feedback in World Bank Group-financed projects in which there are clearly identifiable
                         beneficiaries. See http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/what-we-do/brief/citizen-engagement.
                         The Bank also engages with local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in our communities through volunteer
                         activities and through our workplace giving and matching program, the Community Connections Campaign. To learn
                         more about the NGOs we engage, see http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/community-connections.

 102-43 Approach to              4. Opinion Leaders: The Country Opinion Survey (COS) Program systematically assesses and tracks the views
 stakeholder engagement          of external opinion leaders across client countries. The World Bank Group has collected thousands of opinions in this
 (cont.)                         mandated program since its inception, in fiscal 2012. Each client country is surveyed once every three years; each year,
                                 about 40 to 45 countries are included. In this manner, over a three-year cycle, the COS Program obtains feedback from
                                 stakeholders in nearly all client countries. No other multilateral organization engages in a feedback mechanism of such
                                 breadth and depth.
                                 5.ESG Investor Community: The World Bank engages with investors including those with environmental,
                                 social, and governance (ESG) investment considerations. These are of general interest to them. But questions arise
                                 directly from ESG research and rating firms that rate and rank issuers based on their “E,” “S,” and “G” aspects of daily
                                 operations—both internally (for example, fair labor standards, staff satisfaction, carbon footprint based on business-as-
                                 usual activities) and externally, as its operational work impacts its client countries and other stakeholders (for example,
                                 safeguards applied to and risk assessments to consider in project implementation, and so on). The questions come with
                                 proposed responses, drafted by the ESG research firms, that reflect stories originating from multilateral development bank




                                                                                                                                                               General Disclosures
                                 watchdog press releases. Investors with ESG considerations receive these reports. The questions we regularly provide
                                 feedback on are used as part of the materiality exercise for the GRI Index.
                                 6. Local, national, and international media: The World Bank regularly reaches out to media to cover the
                                 Bank’s major report launches, corporate priority campaigns and messages, including events involving President Jim Yong
                                 Kim. At key opportunities, such as the Annual and Spring Meetings, the Bank proactively drives the primary messages
                                 of the institution, such as its commitment to the twin goals of ending extreme poverty by 2030 and boosting shared
                                 prosperity. The Bank approaches traditional media outlets (via interviews and op-eds) and actively uses social media
                                 to promote issues that need to be addressed to achieve those goals, such as major reports on climate change. It also
                                 responds to all media queries and interview requests to help the media better understand the Bank and what it does. In
                                 addition, the Bank’s reputation is managed by working with reporters to clarify Bank priorities and activities, providing
                                 institution views so they can write balanced and well-represented articles. Press releases, speeches, transcripts, and
                                 feature stories from the Bank appear on the World Bank’s website homepage, http://www.worldbank.org, and on the
                                 news site, http://worldbank.org/en/news.

102-43 Approach to       7. Foundations: The Foundations Program mobilizes political and financial support from the philanthropic world
stakeholder engagement   to advance the institution’s twin goals. Partnerships range from direct or parallel grant contributions to research,
(cont.)                  knowledge sharing, and joint advocacy. These partnerships often provide crucial early seed funding and access to
                         innovative ideas and new expertise. They also allow the Bank to reach a broad network of civil society grantees. The
                         World Bank has partnerships with more than 100 foundations in all regions of the world. In fiscal year 2017, the Bank
                         Group launched a number of important new partnerships with foundations that focused on scaling up investment
                         and advocacy efforts on priority issues, in addition to strengthening its existing partnerships. New partnerships
                         that were initiated in fiscal year 2017 included: (1) Identification for Development (ID4D): The Bill & Melinda Gates
                         Foundation was the first donor to the ID4D multi-donor partnership, which helps countries establish robust and
                         inclusive identification systems. The foundation’s role has been integral to expanding ID4D’s technical assistance to
                         more countries, developing technical guidance materials, and conducting research, including impact evaluations;
                         (2) ESMAP: The Rockefeller Foundation is collaborating with the World Bank Group’s Energy Sector Management

                         provided for economic development; and (3) Education for Competitiveness (E4C): The Bank Group announced a new
                         strategic partnership with the Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation for Education linked to the E4C initiative. It is focused
                         on improving the quality and relevance of education for Arab children and youth. The Foundation’s Advisory Council,
                         which is an annual action-oriented meeting designed to build political will and to kick-start transformative partnerships,
                         convened a select group of high-level influential philanthropic leaders, alongside senior Bank Group leadership, around
                         the topic of early childhood development. See http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/910971468184790958/

 102-44 Key topics and            3. CSOs: In fiscal year 2017, the team consulted on the IDA18 replenishment with a cross-section of CSOs and faith-
 concerns raised (cont.)          based organizations (FBOs), including through an IDA Forum that took place during the Spring and Annual Meetings.
                                  The team also consulted with CSOs about the creation of the Gender-Based Violence Task Force. In collaboration with
                                  the Africa region, three regional workshops took place in fiscal year 2017, which included site visits to World Bank-
                                  financed projects in Abuja, Dakar, Johannesburg, and Nairobi and deepened engagement with civil society in client
                                  countries. During the Africa workshops, CSOs and FBOs raised a number of issues, including (1) the need for greater
                                  capacity building; (2) the importance of ongoing rather than episodic or ad hoc engagement; and (3) the desire to see the
                                  WBG engage CSOs and FBOs more in World Bank operations as implementing partners and monitors of Bank-financed
                                  projects. CSO and FBO participants in each workshop produced an action plan that outlined goals and commitments to
                                  interact more systematically and successfully with World Bank country offices in order to advance shared development
                                  priorities and improve development effectiveness. The Civil Society Team is exploring partnering with other regions to
                                  organize similar workshops in fiscal year 2018.
                                  The World Bank also interacted with CSOs on reports such as the annual World Development Report (WDR) and




                                                                                                                                                              General Disclosures
                                  evaluations conducted by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG).
                                  Senior management also participated in public advocacy activities with civil society, including the Interaction Annual
                                  Forum and the Results Annual Summit. These organizations were among the supporters who mobilized their members to
                                  support IDA18, which resulted in the largest replenishment in IDA history.
                                  At the country level, the World Bank consults with a broad spectrum of CSOs on the Systematic Country Diagnostic,
                                  the Country Partnership Framework, sector studies, and individual Bank-funded development projects. Often these
                                  interactions involve multiple stakeholders and CSOs, governments, businesses, and donor agencies. Within these
                                  operations, the Bank is helping to build sustainable national systems for citizen engagement with governments and the

                                  prosperity, the Global Partnership for Social Accountability (GPSA) encourages civil society and governments to work
                                  together to solve critical governance challenges in developing countries. To achieve this objective, the GPSA provides
                                  strategic and sustained support to CSOs’ social accountability initiatives.

18    World Bank GRI Index 2017
102-44 Key topics and         4. Opinion Leaders: In fiscal year 2017, the mean rating for the Bank Group’s effectiveness and impact on
concerns raised (cont.)       development results (combined rating for two variables) in the Bank Group’s client countries was 6.6 on a 10-point scale
                              across all COS respondents. Participants in the fiscal year 2017 COS and the fiscal year 2016 COS had statistically similar
                              ratings for the Bank Group’s effectiveness and impact on development results (the mean in fiscal year 2017 was 6.6; the
                              mean in fiscal year 2016 was 6.6). Clients (those respondents who work with the institution) rated the Bank Group’s
                              collaboration with other donors and development partners in IDA countries positively: 7.4 (statistically similar to the fiscal
                              2016 COS rating: 7.3). On responsiveness and staff accessibility (combined rating for two variables), the client ratings
                              were relatively lower: 6.8 (statistically similar to the fiscal year 2016 COS rating: 6.9). For more information, see http://

                              5. ESG Investor Community: Investors ask the World Bank about project implementation and how safeguards
                              help reduce social and environmental risks. This includes preventing risks behind resettlement, the procurement labor
                              and supply chain during project implementation, and how well the companies procured for project implementation are
                              vetted in order to prevent any violation of human rights and child labor within the country where the projects are being

                              6. Media:The key priority in fiscal year 2017 was the continued promotion and implementation of the World Bank
                              Group goals and the three ways in which the organization is working to achieve them: (1) fostering sustainable growth;
                              (2) investing in human capital; and (3) building resilience. The communications emphasis was on the need for new
                              approaches to development finance and to crowd in private finance. Specific issues included forced displacement,
                              pandemics, and women’s economic empowerment. The issuance and promotion of our biannual global economic
                              prospects also garnered strong media coverage.

102-46 Defining report           The topics deemed relevant for disclosure were identified by assessing annual corporate priorities outlined by the
content and topic                institution’s Boards and President, considering stakeholder input, as well as ascertaining sustainability impacts of carrying
Boundaries                       out the mission and vision. Stakeholder feedback is gained through three key channels: the COS Program, civil society
                                 feedback, and queries from investor research groups.
                                 To determine if a GRI aspect is material for the World Bank to report on, an assessment is carried out based on the
                                 potential impacts on the Bank’s business, and sustainability impacts stemming from its business. The business-case
                                 category evaluates potential reputational risks to the organization, the importance to stakeholders (based on the above
                                 sources), the linkages with the Bank’s mission and goals and those identified as material in the World Bank Corporate
                                 Responsibility Strategic Plan. The sustainability impact refers to environmental and social criteria, as outlined by the
                                 Natural Step, namely, material extracted from the earth’s crust; the accumulation of persistent or toxic emissions;
                                 extractive industry or destructive processes; and the extent to which people’s ability to meet their needs are undermined.
                                 To ensure representation of sustainable development, an additional criterion was added to give preference for impact on
                                 the local economy.

                                 The Principles for Defining Report Content have been applied to identify, prioritize, and validate the information to
                                 be disclosed by considering the World Bank’s activities, impacts, and the substantive expectations and interests of its

102-47 List of material          Boundaries are defined based on the management control of impacts: indirect impacts lay within the “operational”
topics                           boundary while direct impacts fall within the “corporate” boundary.
                                 Impacts external to the organization (“operational boundary”): Indirect impacts occur in member countries as a result
                                 of World Bank lending and analytical services and may not be directly controlled by the Bank’s management. Impacts
                                 stemming from the World Bank’s work with clients are specified as “operational impacts.”
                                 Impacts internal to the organization (“corporate boundary”): “Corporate boundary” refers to the impact from activities
                                 over which it has direct control, such as operating World Bank facilities and managing staff members.

                                 The World Bank’s most pertinent sustainability impacts from financial and technical services to clients can be summarized
                                 in the following GRI-related aspects:
                                 1. Economic Performance – Because creating and distributing economic value is part of the mission of eliminating
                                 extreme poverty, shareholders and investors care about the sustainable economic performance of the institution.
                                 2. Indirect Economic Impacts – These impacts are an essential aspect of the Bank’s goal of reducing poverty and boosting
                                 shared prosperity.

102-47 List of material       3. Biodiversity – Through lending and grant support to client countries, the World Bank Group is one of the largest
topics (cont.)                international funding sources for biodiversity worldwide.
                              4. Human Rights / Child Labor / Indigenous Rights – The World Bank promotes human rights through its projects, for
                              example, improving poor people’s access to health, education, food, and water; promoting the participation of Indigenous
                              Peoples in decision making, strengthening the accountability and transparency of governments to their citizens;
                              supporting justice reform; and fighting corruption. In addition, civil society actively followed the World Bank’s process of
                              updating its safeguard policies, concluded in fiscal 2016.
                              5. Local Communities – The World Bank recognizes that CDD approaches and actions are important elements of an
                              effective poverty reduction and sustainable development strategy.
                              6. Anti-Corruption – Critical to the World Bank’s mission to alleviate extreme poverty is a well-functioning public sector
                              that delivers quality public services consistent with citizen preferences and fosters private, market-led growth while
                              managing its fiscal resources in a prudent manner. Opinion leaders in the Bank’s client countries listed anti-corruption as

                              The most material aspects of the Bank’s internal operations include the following:
                              1. Staff are the World Bank’s greatest asset. They bring a wide range of perspectives to bear on poverty-reduction issues
                              and emerging development challenges, and are critical to the effectiveness of the Bank’s core operational and knowledge
                              services. Staff-related indicators are pulled from the following GRI aspect categories: Economic Performance, Market
                              Presence, Employment, Occupational Health and Safety, Training and Education, Diversity and Equal Opportunity, and
                              Nondiscrimination.
                              2. The Bank recognizes that reducing its own corporate environmental impacts is in line with the institutional mission
                              to reduce poverty, as environmental degradation affects the world’s poor disproportionately. Increasing the efficiency of
                              how the organization runs its business—through facility-level and staff-behavior changes—reduces natural-resource
                              waste and decreases the cost of day-to-day operations. Key aspects related to the Bank’s environmental footprint include:
                              Materials, Energy, Water, Emissions, Effluents and Waste, and Procurement Practices.

Economic Performance
The World Bank is an important source of financial resources and technical assistance for developing countries around the world. It is not a bank in
the ordinary sense, but a unique partnership formed to reduce poverty and support development. The Bank supports a wide array of investments in
such areas as education, health, public administration, infrastructure, financial and private sector development, agriculture, and environmental and
natural resource management.
The World Bank’s lending is aimed at two different groups of countries: IBRD strives to reduce poverty in middle-income and credit-worthy poorer
countries through loans, guarantees, risk-management products, and analytical and advisory services. Its companion organization, IDA, offers below-
market-rate financing to the world’s 78 poorest countries, primarily through credits and grants. IBRD funds itself through high-quality bonds offered
in the international capital markets. IDA’s funding is predominantly from contributions by donor countries, including OECD countries and, increasingly,

middle-income nations.
The Bank has established ambitious but achievable goals to galvanize international and national efforts: to end extreme poverty—reducing the share
of the global population living in extreme poverty to 3 percent by the year 2030—and to boost shared prosperity—increasing the income of the
bottom 40 percent of the population. Both of these goals must be met in a sustainable manner. The World Bank Corporate Scorecard is designed to
provide a snapshot of the Bank’s overall performance in the context of development results. It facilitates strategic dialogue between management
and the Board on progress made and areas that need attention. Aspects of financial strength are measured under the Scorecard’s Tier III, which
reviews the overall success of Bank activities in achieving development goals and examines the effectiveness of Bank operations, including the
performance of its lending portfolio. For more information on the Corporate Scorecard, see http://scorecard.worldbank.org.

201-1 Direct economic             In fiscal year 2017, IBRD’s net revenues totaled $1.98 billion ($1.89 billion and $1.96 billion for 2016 and 2015,
value generated and               respectively), and IDA’s net revenues were $1.32 billion ($1.93 billion and $1.53 billion for 2016 and 2015,
distributed                       respectively). Sources of revenues include net revenue from loans, net revenue from IBRD’s Equity Management,
                                  revenue from investments trading, and transfers from affiliated organizations. This is different from last year due
                                  to a change in the presentation of revenue from externally funded activities, which is offset by a corresponding
                                  amount in administrative expenses. These amounts are being shown net.
                                  In fiscal year 2017, IBRD’s administrative expenses were $1.18 billion ($1.30 billion and $1.28 billion for 2016
                                  and 2015, respectively), and IDA’s administrative and development grant expenses for fiscal year 2017 were $4.09
                                  billion ($2.41 billion and $3.63 billion for 2016 and 2015, respectively). The Bank has delivered a strong lending

201-4 Financial                  World Bank member countries, or shareholders, are represented by a Board of Governors, who are the ultimate policymakers
assistance received              at the World Bank. Generally, the governors are member countries’ ministers of finance or ministers of development. They
from government                  meet once a year at the Annual Meetings of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank Group and the International
                                 Monetary Fund. The governors delegate specific duties to 25 Executive Directors, who work onsite at the Bank. The five largest
                                 shareholders appoint an Executive Director, while other member countries are represented by elected Executive Directors.
                                 Member contributions: IBRD has a diversified shareholder base that supports IBRD’s financial strength through both paid-in
                                 and callable capital. Callable capital may be called only when required to meet obligations of IBRD for funds borrowed or on
                                 loans guaranteed by it. For capital contributed by a member country, see Financial Statements, http://www.worldbank.org/

                                 Trust funds: Generally accounted for separately from the Bank’s own resources, trust funds are financial and administrative
                                 arrangements with external donors that lead to grant funding of high-priority development needs, such as technical
                                 assistance, advisory services, debt relief, post-conflict transition, and co-financing.

Indirect Economic Impact
The World Bank is an important source of financial resources and technical assistance for developing countries around the world. It is not a bank in
the ordinary sense, but a unique partnership formed to reduce poverty and support development. The Bank supports a wide array of investments in
such areas as education, health, public administration, infrastructure, financial and private sector development, agriculture, and environmental and
natural resource management.

The Bank has established ambitious but achievable goals to galvanize international and national efforts: to end extreme poverty—reducing the share
of the global population living in extreme poverty to 3 percent by the year 2030—and to boost shared prosperity—increasing the income of the
bottom 40 percent of the population. These goals must be met in a sustainable manner. The World Bank Corporate Scorecard measures the progress
on these goals. It reports key sectoral and multisectoral results achieved by clients with the support of the World Bank Group. For more information

                                  help them make informed decisions about improving access to and the quality of infrastructure services, which can
                                  include, where appropriate, leveraging private sector financing and public–private partnerships.

                                  growth. The Bank pursues its principal goals by providing loans, expertise on development-related disciplines, and
                                  risk management products and by coordinating responses to regional and global challenges. The Bank’s financial
                                  resources are significant, and equally valuable is its knowledge. The Bank’s scale, range, and diversity lie at the core
                                  of its specialized role as a key contributor to global development knowledge.

Anti-Corruption
Critical to the World Bank Group’s mission is a well-functioning public sector that delivers quality public services consistent with citizen preferences,
while managing its fiscal resources in a prudent manner. World Bank Group (WBG) operations across sectors systematically incorporate governance
and anticorruption measures into project design. The objective is to better mitigate corruption and fiduciary risks and ensure that development funds
are used for their intended purposes.
The Bank Group’s Sanctions System is comprised of three independent offices: the Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) and two adjudicative units, the
Office of Suspension and Debarment, and the Sanctions Board. INT investigates allegations of fraud and corruption in Bank Group-supported
activities (external investigations), as well as allegations of significant fraud and corruption involving Bank staff and vendors (internal investigations).
Any resulting Bank Group debarments made through the Sanctions System prevent these parties from participating in future Bank Group-financed
projects and serve as a deterrent to other potential wrongdoers. INT also helps client countries through its joint investigations and forensic reviews,
the investigative findings it refers to national authorities, and by sharing its insights with relevant ministries to help bolster their business systems and
administration. INT further works with the private sector and NGOs through its Integrity Compliance Office to institute integrity compliance programs
that sanctioned entities must satisfy to be released from a WBG sanction. By combining investigations with an enhanced focus on compliance,

detection of red flags, and building preventive measures in projects, INT promotes a proactive approach to managing fraud and corruption risks. It is
vital to manage these risks in an efficient and effective manner, as they can impact development resources, particularly in fragile contexts and high-
risk sectors. For more information on the Governance Global Practice, see www.worldbank.org/governance. For more information on INT, see www.

205-1 Operations                   INT assesses and investigates allegations of corruption involving WBG financing. In fiscal year 2017, INT opened
assessed for risks                 51 external investigations into possible corruption, fraud, collusion, coercion, and obstruction in 55 Bank Group-
related to corruption              financed projects in 33 countries. The investigations substantiated in the fiscal year involved 52 projects and
                                   included the review of 147 contracts, totaling approximately $727 million.
                                   Keeping staff who work on projects attuned to risks arising from investigations and forensic audits is critical to
                                   ensuring high-risk operations, in particular, are able to deliver results. As of the end of fiscal year 2017, INT had
                                   identified 157 WBG-financed projects as being exposed to specific integrity risks, consisting of 117 projects under
                                   implementation and 40 in the pipeline. The projects were identified on the basis of specific criteria, including
                                   relevant ongoing and recently substantiated investigations, and the existence of multiple credible complaints. INT
                                   alerted the relevant project teams so that the risks could be addressed through strengthened project design or
                                   supervision.

                           This clinic raises awareness about how corruption can impact Bank Group-financed projects so that Board members
                           are better able to assess projects before approving them.
                           Employees: All new employees receive an overview of relevant staff rules and how to report suspected
                           corruption issues. Eight hundred seventy-nine persons working for ministries and implementing agencies in client
                           countries, enforcement agencies, and CSOs received information and training from INT related to integrity in Bank

                           American Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Firms and individuals
                           who are blacklisted by the Bank Group must meet specific conditions, such as establishing and implementing an
                           effective corporate compliance program or improving an existing program, before they are again eligible to bid
                           on Bank Group-funded projects. These conditions are based on the Integrity Compliance Guidelines. To date, 289
                           entities have been sanctioned with such conditions. In fiscal year 2017, the Integrity Compliance Office notified 45

 Biodiversity
 Biodiversity supports economic growth and human wellbeing. And it is essential for sustainability and to maintain ecological as well as social
 resilience to disturbances such as climate change. But the world is experiencing a dramatic loss of biodiversity, which has negative effects on
 livelihoods, water supply, food security, and resilience to extreme events. It has consequences for 78 percent of the world’s extreme poor who live in
 rural areas, many of whom rely on ecosystems and the goods they produce to make a living. The World Bank estimates that crimes affecting natural
 resources and the environment inflict damage on developing countries worth more than $70 billion a year. The livelihoods, welfare, and safety nets of
 the rural poor, especially women, are often inextricably dependent on natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Biodiversity is especially significant for the
 300 million indigenous peoples of the world, for whom nature—apart from being a source of livelihood and wellbeing—is the foundation for their
 cultural and spiritual identities.
 The World Bank’s Environmental and Natural Resources (ENR) Global Practice works with national and local stakeholders to improve natural resource
 management. We address biodiversity through country-specific and regional projects, for example:




                                                                                                                                                              Operational Impact
 (1) Dedicated conservation projects, including with the Bank’s Global Environment Facility (GEF) funding, such as the South Africa iSimangaliso
 Wetland Park; the Amazon Landscape Program; and the Global Wildlife Program (supported by GEF plus IDA and Trust Funds);
 (2) Broader agricultural and natural resource management projects (including landscape-level interventions) such as in Burundi, where biodiversity-
 friendly shade coffee in PADZOC is scaled up to a larger agriculture project; the Sahel and West Africa Program in support of the Great Green Wall
 (funded by GEF plus IDA and Trust Funds); and Colombia Sustainable Cattle Ranching (funded by GEF and Trust Funds); and (3) Infrastructure and
 other large-scale development projects that address biodiversity conservation in order to maintain environmental services, mitigate adverse impacts,
 and enhance biodiversity outcomes, for example, the Cameroon Lom Pangar Dam and Lao Nam Theun 2 Dam. Both support large conservation areas
 as biodiversity offsets.
 Wherever feasible, Bank-financed projects are sited on already converted lands to preserve critical natural habitats. The World Bank does not support
 projects that involve the significant conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats unless there are no feasible alternatives for the project and
 its siting, and comprehensive analysis demonstrates that overall benefits from the project substantially outweigh the environmental costs.
 In response to a 2013 Independent Evaluation Group review of the Bank’s portfolio in the forest sector, the WBG developed a Forest Action Plan
 for fiscal years 2016–2020 that aims to boost the potential of forests to lift people out of poverty and generate lasting social, economic, and
 environmental returns in developing countries. Forests and trees provide vital resources and ecosystem services for humanity through the regulation
 of climate and hydrological systems. The number of people deriving direct and indirect benefits from trees—in the form of employment, forest
 products, and contributions to livelihoods and incomes—is estimated at 1.3 billion.

protected or restored             advisory work, project financing, and policy dialogue. From fiscal years 2006–2016, 92 projects supported habitat
                                  protected or restored areas, with a geographic emphasis on the Latin America and the Caribbean region (LAC) and
                                  Africa (33 and 31 projects, respectively), and 17 in East Asia and the Pacific, six in East and Central Asia, two in
                                  Middle East and North Africa, and three in South Asia. Habitat restoration was supported through five projects (two
                                  in Africa, one in East and Central Asia, and two in LAC).
                                  Our ongoing programs include: the New York Declaration on Forests; the African Resilient Landscapes Initiative and
                                  its forest component, the African Restoration Initiative; the Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration;

Child Labor
The World Bank recognizes that child labor is one of the most devastating consequences of persistent poverty. All standard World Bank bidding
documents contain a clause prohibiting the use of child or forced labor in contracts financed under any World Bank projects. Staff in Bank-supported
operations are required to assess social issues, such as child labor, within the environmental and social aspects of the projects and develop specific
measures that would be implemented during the project to mitigate the risk. The World Bank has been actively supporting the diversification of
agricultural production beyond cotton and wheat into other high-value crops such as fruit and vegetables, and livestock. This support is clearly
defined in the World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework that was approved in 2016. The World Bank-financed agriculture projects in
Uzbekistan focus on improving agricultural productivity, promoting sustainable management of land and water resources, increasing the efficiency
of irrigation infrastructure, and enhancing the economy’s competitiveness. This is also supported through analytical and advisory services. Results of
the 2016 cotton harvest monitoring, conducted by the International Labor Organization (ILO), were made public on February 1, 2017. The ILO report
concludes that organized child labor has been “phased out” in Uzbekistan and calls this a major achievement. However, concerns remain regarding
the risks of forced labor associated with the widespread organized recruitment of adults. The World Bank does not condone forced labor in any form
and takes seriously reports of incidents in the cotton production system of Uzbekistan. We continue to voice our strong concerns on labor issues to
the Government of Uzbekistan and we are supporting its efforts to eliminate forced labor by cutting cotton production, diversifying agriculture, and
increasing mechanization. We also support private sector players who demonstrate commitment to responsible labor practices.

Rights of Indigenous Peoples
Central to the Bank’s mission of reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development is ensuring that the development process fully respects the
dignity, human rights, economies, and cultures of Indigenous Peoples. The Bank recognizes that the identities and cultures of Indigenous Peoples are
inextricably linked to the lands on which they live and the natural resources on which they depend. These distinct circumstances expose Indigenous
Peoples to different types of risks and levels of impacts from development projects, including loss of identity, culture, and customary livelihoods. Gender
and intergenerational issues among Indigenous Peoples are also complex. As social groups with identities that are often distinct from dominant groups
in their national societies, Indigenous Peoples are frequently among the most marginalized and vulnerable segments of the population. As a result,
their economic, social, and legal status often limits their capacity to defend their interests in and rights to lands, territories, and other productive
resources, or restricts their ability to participate in and benefit from development. At the same time, the Bank recognizes that Indigenous Peoples play a
vital role in sustainable development and that their rights are increasingly being addressed under both domestic and international law.

Rights of Indigenous Peoples (cont.)
The World Bank safeguards policy on Indigenous Peoples, OP/BP 4.10, Indigenous Peoples, underscores the need for borrowers and Bank staff to
identify Indigenous Peoples, consult with them, and ensure that they participate in and benefit from Bank-funded operations in a culturally appropriate
way. It also emphasizes that adverse impacts on them are avoided or, where not feasible, minimized or mitigated. For all projects that are proposed for
Bank financing and involve Indigenous Peoples, the Bank requires the borrower to engage in a process of free, prior, and informed consultation. The
Bank provides project financing only where there is broad community support to the project by the affected Indigenous Peoples.
In August 2016, the World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved a new Environmental and Social Framework for protecting people and the
environment in World Bank-financed investment projects, marking the end of a four-year review process that concluded in fiscal 2016. This was the
most extensive consultation the World Bank has ever conducted. The World Bank will now implement an intensive preparation and training period
(12–18 months) to prepare for the transition to the new framework (expected in calendar year 2018).
The new framework advances the Bank’s existing Indigenous Peoples policy by including Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC), and by addressing
peoples in voluntary isolation, and pastoralists. This provision is well harmonized with those of other International Financial Institutions. The

safeguards review included a Global Dialogue and Engagement process with Indigenous Peoples that sought to incorporate Indigenous Peoples in
the review and update of the World Bank’s Environmental and Social Framework, as well as to strengthen World Bank support to and engagement
with Indigenous Peoples, more generally. The consultations on the framework included several dedicated Indigenous Peoples dialogue sessions, which
yielded important results in terms of participation, information gathered, and the beginning of a renewed and stronger relationship with Indigenous
Peoples.

 Human Rights
 Social development and inclusion are critical for all the World Bank’s development interventions and for achieving sustainable development for our
 member countries. For the Bank, inclusion means empowering all people to participate in, and benefit from, the development process. Inclusion
 encompasses policies to promote equality and non-discrimination by improving the access of all people, including the poor and disadvantaged, to
 services and benefits such as education, health, social protection, infrastructure, affordable energy, employment, financial services, and productive
 assets. It also embraces action to remove barriers against those who are often excluded from the development process, such as women, children,
 persons with disabilities, and youth and minorities, and to ensure that the voices of all are heard. In this regard, the World Bank’s activities support
 the realization of human rights expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Under the projects financed by the Bank, in a manner
 consistent with its Articles of Agreement, the World Bank seeks to avoid adverse impacts, and will continue to support its member countries as they
 strive to progressively achieve their human rights commitments.
 The World Bank recognizes the importance of human rights principles in development: transparency, accountability, non-discrimination, equality of
 opportunity, governance, empowerment, participation, and inclusion. These principles are reflected in all projects the World Bank finances. The Bank
 screens each project proposed for financing to determine the appropriate extent and type of environmental and social analysis to be undertaken

 Cultural Resources; OP/BP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement; OP 4.36, Forests; and OP/BP 4.37, Safety of Dams. In addition, the Bank recognizes that
 gender issues are an important dimension of its poverty reduction, economic growth, human wellbeing, and development effectiveness agenda. OP/
 BP 4.20 establishes a country-level, strategic approach to mainstreaming gender issues in Bank work. For more information on gender issues, see
 http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/gender.
 The Bank classifies each proposed project into one of four safeguard categories (A, B, C, or FI) depending on the type, location, sensitivity, and scale
 of the project and the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts. The borrower is responsible for any assessment required by
 the safeguard policies, with Bank staff providing advice on the application of the policies. Depending on the type of project and its safeguard policy
 category, the Bank project design incorporates such issues as public consultation, environmental and social assessments, Indigenous Peoples’ plans,
 and resettlement frameworks and/or resettlement action plans. Compliance with these policies forms part of the legal agreements for Bank grants,
 credits, and loans.
 In August 2016, the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved a new Environmental and Social Framework to protect people and the
 environment in its projects. A 2011 evaluation of the previous framework helped motivate the review and update. The new framework will be
 launched in 2018 and will contribute to sustainability and development effectiveness in Bank projects and programs by helping to avoid or mitigate
 harm to people and the environment. For updates, see http://worldbank.org/esf.

Local Communities
The Bank screens all projects proposed for financing to determine the appropriate extent and type of potential impacts on communities and the
environment. As each of the proposed projects is screened, it is classified into one of four safeguard categories (A, B, C, or FI) depending on the type,
location, sensitivity, and scale of the project, and the nature and magnitude of its potential impacts. The borrowing country government is responsible
for any assessments required by the safeguard policies; World Bank staff members provide general advice. The Legal Department monitors compliance
with policies that involve international law, such as those for international waterways and disputed areas.
If a project is considered to have adverse impacts on a community, the borrower must carry out an environmental and social impact assessment. This
impact assessment will consider gender issues as part of its social analysis. The borrower is required to consult on environmental and social impacts
and mitigation measures with the communities affected by the project. For meaningful consultations between the borrower and project-affected
groups and local NGOs, the borrower is required to provide relevant material in a timely manner prior to consultation, in a form and language
that are understandable and accessible to the groups being consulted. For projects with significant risks (category A and B), the Bank discloses the
environmental and social assessment. The borrower is required to establish a project-level grievance redress mechanism for all projects with adverse
impacts.

Our supply chain impacts are potentially the largest sustainability effects of the World Bank, with annual purchasing of the Bank topping $1
billion. Supply chain was also identified as a key impact area by stakeholders, including Sustainable & Impact investors. The World Bank Corporate
Procurement unit is responsible for coordinating and overseeing the sourcing strategy, selection, and contract execution for Bank offices around the
globe, including adherence to the Bank’s policies on socially and environmentally responsible corporate procurement policies. Corporate Procurement
partnered with Facilities Management in reviewing main categories to align the Bank’s sourcing strategy, selection, and contract execution with those
of leading companies working to minimize environmental impact. Assessments of major corporate material purchases (including office construction
and renovations, paper, computers, and furniture) are being conducted to strengthen and mandate environmental specifications. The World Bank
Group Procurement Review Committee of senior managers reviews all planned procurements valued above $5 million to ensure that socially and
environmentally responsible criteria are present from the project’s outset.

GRI 301: Materials
Consumption of materials is minimal in the World Bank’s corporate operations, but nonetheless important. Stakeholders, which include Sustainable
& Impact investors, recognized that the materials used in our internal operations and the associated supply chain practices are highly relevant to our
business impact.
Key materials include office supplies and electronics purchased to support the work of our staff globally. Reducing the environmental impact of these
materials by minimizing consumption and maximizing the use of recycled content and rapidly renewable choices ensures resources are available for
future generations. The World Bank identifies products and services with large environmental impacts or those that it procures in large amounts.
The Bank then works to identify environmentally and socially preferable alternatives. Quarterly reports from key suppliers reflect the percentage of
products that meet key environmental criteria, such as percentage of recycled content, environmental certifications including Energy Star ratings and
Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, and other sustainable criteria. We are currently assessing the approach to manage our material inputs
and associated supply chains and will have more to report in future years.

                                                                                                                                                           35
301-1 Materials used by          As a service organization, the World Bank does not use a large amount of materials to produce or package
weight or volume                 products; materials input primarily support our office-based environment. This includes the use of office supplies
                                 such as paper, information technology equipment, and food-service-related consumables. In fiscal year 2017, the
                                 total amount of non-renewable materials used was 235 metric tons, including 43 tons of electronic equipment, 97
                                 tons of office products, and 95 tons of bottled water. In the same period, the total amount of renewable material
                                 used was 595 tons, including 550 tons of paper and 45 tons of food-service-related consumables.

301-2 Recycled input             The World Bank is committed to using resources that are made from recycled or rapidly renewable materials for its
materials used                   internal operations. The largest material purchases include paper, office supplies, office furniture, cafeteria napkins,
                                 and electronics.
                                 World Bank standard copier and printer paper is 100 percent post-consumer waste recycled content and FSC

                                 In fiscal year 2017, this amount was 68 percent, up from 62 percent in fiscal year 2016. The Bank also tracks the

                                 The Bank also tracks the percentage by weight of all items purchased from our office supply vendor that contain
                                 at least 10 percent post-consumer recycled content. In fiscal year 2017, 16 percent of all purchases from the office
                                 supply vendor contained at least 10 percent post-consumer recycled content, compared to 22 percent in fiscal year
                                 2016. This decrease was due to the Bank’s use of a managed print service, which eliminated the use of recycled-
                                 content printer cartridges in favor of a centralized service provider.
                                 More than 40 percent of our office furniture contains a minimum of 10 percent post-consumer recycled content,
                                 and the majority of furniture in use at the World Bank has been refurbished or reupholstered.
                                 In our food services, all cafeteria napkins are made from 100 percent post-consumer recycled paper and produced
                                 with a 100 percent bleach-free process. In fiscal year 2017, we purchased six tons of napkins.
                                 We also use sustainability criteria for our information technology purchases to ensure components of our
                                 computers, laptops, and monitors are made of recycled input materials. The percentage of recycled components in

GRI 302: Energy
Energy is a key input to the World Bank’s business operations. Stakeholders, which include Sustainable & Impact Investors, consider energy as an
important impact from the Bank’s internal business. The purchase and use of energy can have various impacts because of the extraction of materials
from the earth’s crust and the production of persistent toxic emissions from the combustion of fuels. Combustion of fossil fuels can result in severe
health consequences, and affects the expense-to-business revenue ratio.
The World Bank manages its energy use carefully by tracking use in each owned facility. Quarterly tracking of the Bank’s energy use is evaluated by
the Director of General Services. Energy use is evaluated as an absolute figure and on an intensity basis to determine progress. Responsibility for
increasing the energy efficiency of the Washington, DC, headquarters campus, with the goal of bringing all owned facilities to Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design (LEED) minimum requirements, falls with the Senior Project Manager in the Bank’s Corporate Real Estate unit.
Data from country offices lag by one year; therefore, fiscal year 2016 data (including that from headquarters) are presented in the GRI Index 2017.

302-1 Energy           The World Bank purchases natural gas, propane, gasoline, and diesel fuel for combustion onsite. In fiscal year 2016,
consumption within the total global fuel use was 85,557 GJ, compared to 99,041 GJ in fiscal year 2015, 92,793 GJ in fiscal year 2014, and

                                  The portion of this fuel consumption from renewable resources is not tracked, because data from fuel providers are
                                  not appropriately detailed. Total global energy use in fiscal year 2016 equaled 495,645 GJ, compared to 538,966
                                  GJ in fiscal year 2015. Offices located in the US used 325,712 GJ, compared to 346,526 GJ in fiscal year 2015,
                                  337. In fiscal year 2016, data collected from the Bank’s 126 offices outside of the US totaled 169,934 GJ of energy,

 302-3 Energy intensity           Energy intensity decreased in fiscal year 2016, with the World Bank using 0.81 GJ of energy per square meter, as
                                  compared to 0.90 GJ per square meter in fiscal year 2015, and 0.88 GJ per square meter in fiscal year 2014.
                                  This is based on 612,226 total occupied square meters in fiscal year 2016, 596,562 total square meters in fiscal
                                  year 2015, and 548,795 total square meters in fiscal year 2014. This ratio includes all energy (onsite combustion
                                  fuel, electricity, heating, cooling, and steam) except for energy consumption outside of the organization.

 302-4 Reduction of               In fiscal year 2017, the Bank undertook efficiency measures that reduced its energy consumption by 879 GJ,
 energy consumption               predominately through reductions in electricity use.
                                  In our non-US offices, this included the following:
                                      •	   In our Dhaka, Bangladesh, office, CFL lights were replaced with LED fixtures, reducing electricity use by over 32 GJ per year.
                                      •	   In our Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, office, solar LED lights were installed in the parking area and security gate, reducing electricity use
                                           by over 33 GJ per year.
                                      •	   In our Juba, South Sudan, office, we installed solar security lighting throughout the compound, reducing electricity use by 172
                                           GJ per year.
                                      •	   In our Chennai, India, office, we replaced inefficient sodium halide lighting with solar-powered LED perimeter lights, and
                                           upgraded other fixtures from CFL to LED, reducing electricity use by 643 GJ per year.

GRI 303: Water
Water security is among the top global risks in terms of development impact. The world will not be able to overcome the sustainable development
challenges of the 21st century—including human development, livable cities, climate change, food security, and energy security—without improving
management of water resources and ensuring access to reliable water and sanitation services. Water was identified as a key impact by stakeholders,
including Sustainable & Impact Investors.
Quarterly evaluation of the use of water, like other utilities, is conducted by the Director of General Services. Water use is evaluated both as an
absolute figure and on an intensity basis to determine progress. Responsibility for increasing the water efficiency of the Washington, DC, campus,
with the goal of bringing all owned facilities to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) minimum requirements, falls with the Senior
Project Manager in the Bank’s Corporate Real Estate unit.

303-1 Water withdrawal The World Bank Washington, DC, offices use municipal water supply from the Potomac watershed. In fiscal year
by source              2016, 193,716,752 liters of municipal water was used in our Washington, DC, offices, primarily for domestic and
                       drinking water purposes. No surface water, groundwater, rainwater collected by the organization, or wastewater
                       from other organizations was used in Washington, DC, offices in fiscal year 2016. Of 126 offices outside the US,
                       the total water used could be reported by only 37 offices, due to metering constraints or lack of utility bills from
                       landlords. In fiscal year 2016, this value was 48,185,883 liters. The source of withdrawal is not available for these
                       offices, as this information is not currently collected, but will be in fiscal year 2017. Water use is based on utility
                       bills from the local water utility, DC Water, in Washington, DC, and from utility bills or meters in those non-US
                       offices that can report.

GRI 305: Emissions
Addressing climate change is part of the World Bank’s core mission of helping countries end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. Climate
change threatens to erode development gains around the world—and its effects are greatest on the poorest and most vulnerable countries, which
are the World Bank’s clients.
As a demonstration of its corporate commitment to addressing climate change, the Bank continues to deepen its efforts to measure, reduce, offset,
and report its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with its global internal operations, including its facilities, key meetings, and corporate
air travel. The Bank has measured the GHG emissions from its facilities in Washington, DC, since 2005 and globally since 2007. Emissions are
calculated in accordance with the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s GHG Protocol, with additional
information on proxies, emissions factors, and the complete boundary available in the annually updated World Bank Group’s Inventory Management
Plan. A third party regularly verifies the Inventory Management Plan and the GHG inventory to ensure they meet international best practices.
In fiscal year 2010, the World Bank set a goal of reducing GHG emissions by 10 percent from owned and managed facilities by fiscal year 2017. As
of fiscal year 2016, the Bank was on track to meet this goal. Data from country offices lag by one year, therefore fiscal year 2016 data (including that
from headquarters) are presented in the GRI Index 2017. We will continue to work toward reducing emissions further and report on our progress in

305-5 Reduction of GHG Estimated reduction in CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from Scope 2 activities from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year
emissions              2016 totaled 2,418 metric tons, including the projects listed below:
                                  Lighting upgrades at headquarters resulted in significant savings of over 2,300 metric tons of CO2e per year.
                                  Smaller projects in our offices in Addis Ababa, Juba, Chennai, and elsewhere resulted in savings of around 70
                                  mtCO2e per year.
                                  Reduction reporting is based on major initiatives taken in fiscal year 2016 as related to achieving reductions from
                                  the fiscal year 2010 base year. Fiscal year 2010 was chosen as the base year because it was the first year that
                                  confidence for data related to emissions from country offices was high.
                                  Methodologies and assumptions for calculating reductions are based on initiative proposals for each reduction
                                  project.

GRI 306: Effluents and Waste
The World Bank views reducing effluent and waste production as a material aspect because of the possible negative environmental impacts, which




                                                                                                                                                             Corporate Impact
include the release of persistent toxic chemicals through waste disposed of in landfills and through incineration. Bank stakeholders have also raised
waste management as an important corporate impact.
The Bank has worked to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills through a combination of source reduction, reuse, and recycling. Minimizing
the amount of material brought into Bank facilities is the first way the Bank manages the amount of waste created. Avoiding unnecessary packaging
for purchased items, including encouraging minimum purchase thresholds for office supplies, is one way the Bank accomplishes this. Another way is
by mandating that large purchases from vendors, such as the Bank’s latest computer monitor purchase, be delivered in bulk instead of individually
packaged. In fiscal year 2016, the Bank continued to pursue efficiencies in the standardization of waste management in its headquarters facilities.
In 2016, standardizing bins in offices and common areas resulted in an increase in diversion rate. All offices in Washington, DC, facilities received
a standard bin for both landfill and recyclable waste. A program to improve signage and locations of waste bins, including capturing compostable
waste in common areas, was piloted in one of the Bank’s Washington, DC, buildings. Results demonstrated marked success, with the diversion rate
increasing by over 15 percent and the amount captured as compostable material drastically increasing. The program will be rolled out to the entire
Washington, DC, headquarters campus before the end of 2017. Following this, a waste audit will be carried out and results will be shared in next
year’s GRI Index.

306-2 Waste by type               Typical waste items from World Bank facilities include paper, bottles, cans, cardboard, food waste, toner
and disposal method               cartridges, carpet tiles, and electronics.
                                  Total nonhazardous waste produced by the Bank’s Washington, DC, offices in fiscal year 2017 was 2,020 metric

GRI 200 Economic Standard Series
GRI 201: Economic Performance
The World Bank values the diversity, health, safety, and security of all our staff working in Washington, DC, and in 140 countries worldwide.
The institution’s diverse workforce brings a wide range of perspectives and experience to bear on poverty-reduction issues and emerging development
challenges. Our staff diversity is a strategic business asset that directly contributes to the achievement of our twin goals: reducing extreme poverty by
2030 and boosting shared prosperity for the bottom 40 percent of the population in every country where the Bank works.
The FY2017–2019 World Bank Group People Strategy was endorsed by Management and the Board in fiscal year 2017. The strategy was developed
taking into account multiple inputs, including (1) the business strategy (articulated in the “Forward Look: A vision for the World Bank Group in 2030”); (2)
a retrospective view of progress and lessons learned from the FY2014-2016 Human Resources (HR) Strategy; (3) a review of global workforce trends; (4)
benchmarking against comparable institutions; (5) analysis of internal trends and engagement surveys; and (6) insights gathered via an unprecedented
level of outreach to Bank leadership and staff. The FY2017-2019 People Strategy articulates a clear vision to (1) build a workforce with the right skills, in
the right place, at the right time who can offer the best development solutions to our clients; and (2) be the best place to work in development.

44    World Bank GRI Index 2017
GRI 201: Economic Performance (cont.)
To achieve that vision, the People Strategy identified five strategic areas of focus and three cross-cutting themes. Areas of focus include: (1) leverage
the World Bank’s global and diverse talent; (2) build and develop managerial and leadership capacity; (3) strengthen performance and rewards; (4)
promote the health, safety, and wellbeing of our people; and (5) improve the World Bank’s organizational effectiveness. Cross-cutting themes include:
(1) focus on the HR fundamentals—strengthen policies, processes, platforms, and support that underpin everything HR does; (2) strengthen support
in fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV) situations; and (3) advance diversity and inclusion. To ensure successful delivery of the new People Strategy, HR
developed a robust implementation plan, which was endorsed by the Board in January 2017. Implementation is well underway.

201-3 Defined benefit              The World Bank offers its staff defined benefit plans. Participation in the pension plan is mandatory. The Staff
plan obligations and               Retirement Plan (pension) and Retired Staff Benefits Plan (medical) assets are held in separate irrevocable trusts,
other retirement plans             and the Post Employment Benefit Plan assets (other benefits) are included in IBRD’s investment portfolio. The
                                   assets of the plans are used for the exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries, and represent the
                                   accumulated contributions paid into the plans net of benefit payments, together with the accumulated value of
                                   investment earnings, net of related expenses.

201-3 Defined benefit              The World Bank is a responsible long-term investor; therefore, the plans’ investments incorporate consideration
plan obligations and               of material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors across asset classes. This is in accordance with
other retirement plans             the fiduciary standard applicable to the administration and investment of plan assets. ESG awareness promotes
(cont.)                            responsible investment practices among external managers. Examples of this approach include due diligence on
                                   external managers on how they account for, manage, and report on relevant ESG risk factors such as environmental
                                   practices, worker safety and health standards, and corporate governance, as well as long-term issues such as
                                   climate change, resource scarcity, and others. This review resulted in various managers being motivated to enhance
                                   and formalize their ESG policies and practice.
                                   The employer contribution to the pension plan is based on a specified funding methodology and varies from year to
                                   year in response to changes in the plan’s financial position. Participants in the gross plan (closed plan) contribute 7
                                   percent of the pensionable gross salary. Participants in the net plan (open to new entrants) contribute 5 percent of
                                   their net salary to the mandatory cash balance component. Participants in the net plan may choose to contribute up
                                   to an additional 6 percent of their net salary to the cash balance.
                                   As of June 30, 2017, the value of accrued pension liabilities for IBRD/IDA was $17.7 billion, supported by assets of
                                   $16.8 billion held in a trust. The funded ratio (assets over liabilities) was 94.5 percent.
                                   Assets are evaluated at their fair value, and liabilities are measured as the Projected Benefit Obligation, discounted
                                   with high-quality corporate bonds rates. The two amounts are estimated in full compliance with the US accounting
                                   standards (ASC 715).

202-1 Ratios of standard          To recruit and retain highly qualified staff, the World Bank has developed a compensation and benefits system
entry level wage by               designed to be internationally competitive, reward performance, and consider the special needs of a multinational
gender compared to                and largely expatriate staff. The Executive Directors annually review the staff salary structure and, if warranted,
local minimum wage                the salary structure is adjusted based on a Board-approved methodology that entails comparison with salaries
                                  paid by private financial and industrial firms and by representative public sector agencies in the US market. The
                                  salary structure is reported for job positions for Washington, DC, staff, which comprises almost 60 percent of total
                                  staff. For staff in offices outside the US, compensation programs are developed based on local market practices
                                  consisting of private sector firms, and representative quasi-public and nonprofit organizations. The grading system
                                  and benchmark job positions in country offices follow the same framework as in Washington, DC. Globally, World
                                  Bank salary structures do not differentiate by gender. Remuneration of executive management, Executive Directors,
                                  and staff are disclosed in the World Bank Annual Report. For more information, see www.worldbank.org/en/about/

GRI 401: Employment
To be the best place to work in development, the World Bank needs an Employment Value Proposition (EVP) that attracts, motivates, and retains
staff with the critical skills, mindsets, and behaviors to fulfill the mission. The EVP, which was articulated in the FY2017–2019 World Bank Group
People Strategy, is centered around five core elements: people, organization, work, opportunity, and rewards. The Bank is committed to attracting and
retaining the best talent, developing their capabilities, ensuring their wellbeing, and affording them opportunities to make a difference in the world.
Bank staff members come from over 170 countries—their diversity and global reach is unparalleled among international financial institutions and
other development organizations. Bank staff include economists, educators, environmental scientists, financial analysts, foresters, agronomists,
engineers, information technology specialists, social scientists, and so on, and they offer clients a unique combination of global expertise and local
knowledge. To capitalize on these comparative advantages requires an understanding of where the business is headed and the skills mix required,
coupled with the ability to identify, grow, and deploy talent in a proactive and deliberate way, as envisioned under the People Strategy.
Supporting a positive and respectful work environment not only assists the Bank in retaining the world’s top talent, it allows the workforce to be

resolve workplace issues using informal and formal services. These services encourage collaboration among staff, provide space for the effective
management of conflict, and increase the Bank’s capacity to build and retain a globally representative workforce.

The World Bank is committed to its staff and their wellbeing, safety, and security, recognizing the complexities of the challenging environment where
they work. We appreciate the value of the rich, diverse perspectives that staff bring, paramount to our success as a global knowledge organization.
About 70 percent of employees travel throughout the world to serve our global clients, thus the institution considers appropriate and accessible
health care through international vendors, regional health advisors, and onsite clinic facilities as an important service component. Promoting
the health, safety, and wellbeing of staff is one of the focus areas of the FY2017–2019 People Strategy. In this area, key highlights include: (1)
developing a phased, five-year strategy to enhance the culture of health; (2) improving pre-deployment health and resiliency briefings for relocating

The World Bank is also committed to creating a supportive workplace for people with disabilities that enables them to fulfill their job responsibilities
while fully using and developing their capacities. The Health Services (HS) Occupational Health Unit (OHU) is the lead unit in determining workplace
accommodations for disability. Reimbursement of accommodation costs is facilitated by the centrally funded Disability Accommodation Fund (DAF),
managed by HS.
The World Bank Occupational Health and Safety Committee (OHSC), which reports to Management, is tasked with developing, implementing, and
overseeing an occupational health and safety management system that applies to Bank employees worldwide.

403-1 Workers                     The World Bank’s OHSC meets quarterly to address health and safety issues related to staff. The group is chaired by

                                  To address global health issues, the committee collaborates with the United Nations (UN) and other international
                                  organizations. The committee has also approved several OHS initiatives such as the Automated External Defibrillator
                                  (AED) program and Staff Road Safety, for which a survey was launched in fiscal year 2017. Analysis of the survey
                                  results will serve as input for the ongoing work of improving procedures and the current Staff Road Safety Directive.
                                  In addition, the OHSC has provided concept approval of an OHS Incident/Accident Reporting system and the use of

 The OLC was launched by President Jim Yong Kim in January 2016 with a dual mandate to provide a platform (1) to provide continuous learning for
 staff to remain cutting edge; and (2) where staff and clients can co-create solutions to complex development challenges. The OLC is managed by the
 Global Theme – Knowledge Department and services key learning divisions of the Bank (HR, OPCS, Finance, ITS, Technical, Corporate, and Leadership)
 as well as IFC and MIGA.
 All learning on the OLC is evaluated for scale and impact. On the staff side, we evaluate all classes entered in OLC that are greater than or equal to
 one day. All classes that are less than a day can be selected by course catalog builders for evaluation as needed. On the client side, we evaluate all
 learning programs, and regularly inform senior management, including through three-year trend analysis, to guide programs, course corrections, and
 learning innovations. For more information about OLC, see https://olc.worldbank.org/staff-learning .

                         indicated they had a performance conversation with their supervisor; this included 90 percent of women and 89
                         percent of men.
                         In addition to the regular performance evaluations, an annual development-focused talent review is undertaken by
                         management to give the organization a better understanding of the skills and aptitudes of staff, and, importantly,
                         to identify next steps for the staff’s professional development, including targeted learning programs, stretch
                         assignments, or rotations to other business units, as well as readiness to take on greater responsibilities.

GRI 405: Diversity and Equal Opportunity
The World Bank is committed to creating a workplace where everyone is valued, where differences are respected and celebrated, and where
opportunity and equitable treatment is afforded to all. Ensuring diversity and inclusion are integrated into our daily work means creating a positive
culture through practices that recognize, value, and harness what makes every individual unique in the broader sense, and by acknowledging and
respecting differences, including nationality, gender and gender identity, race, religion, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, disability, and educational
background.
Beyond the moral imperative, empowering others and respecting differences is much more than part of our institution’s core values: it makes good
business sense. A diverse staff mirrors the diversity of the clients we serve and the partners we work alongside around the world, and that reflection
is key to our credibility as an institution seeking equity and opportunity for all. In addition, it has been demonstrated that a diverse staff stimulates
the creativity and innovation our clients expect, drawn from the collective energy of individual experience, knowledge, and perspectives.
World Bank staff in 140 countries work in core finance, administrative, legal, economics, and technical specializations in more than 20 sectors.
Staff contribute an impressive breadth and depth of professional expertise, academic background, industry, and international experience. The
acknowledged diversity of our staff allows the Bank, the world’s leading development organization, to attract, retain, and grow the finest talent from

the broadest span of different backgrounds possible. When we leverage the diversity and perspectives of all our talent, the solutions that we offer—
through our projects, programs, and assistance—are those that will meet our clients’ development goals.
The World Bank recognizes that meeting the demands and needs of its diverse client base more effectively means the Bank must consider a range
of ideas and perspectives to find the best solution to development challenges. Achieving shared prosperity in a sustainable way is about equal
opportunity, empowerment, and economic and social inclusion. The Articles of Agreement for IBRD and IDA emphasize the need to “pay due regard
to the importance of recruiting personnel on as wide a geographical basis as possible” when appointing Bank officers and staff, “subject to the
paramount importance of securing the highest standards of efficiency and of technical competence.” This directive was reiterated in the 1983
Principles of Staff Employment, approved by the Executive Directors, to set forth the broad policies according to which the President shall manage
staff. These principles direct the Bank to “encourage diversity in staffing consistent with the nature and objectives of the Organizations.” In addition
to reflecting the World Bank’s global nature, the importance of staff diversity in enhancing the effectiveness and credibility of the Bank’s institutions
has been underscored by ongoing reforms to increase the voice and participation of emerging markets and developing countries at the Bank. The
World Bank manages these commitments and directives through an integrated approach that focuses on three pillars: advocacy (demonstrate
leadership and build partnerships), accountability (set goals and measure outcomes), and inclusion (embed diversity and inclusion into talent
processes and create an inclusive environment).
The World Bank measures the effectiveness of its efforts through Diversity and Inclusion Compacts, which establish both diversity and inclusion
targets and identify specific actions to achieve the targets. The diversity targets include parity in management by gender and country part (Part I
versus Part II—roughly equivalent to developed and developing countries, respectively), as well as by gender among full-time staff at professional
grades (grade GF+) in non-managerial roles. An additional institutional target is 12.5 percent for Sub-Saharan African (SSA) and Caribbean (CR)
nationals among full-time staff at professional grades (grade GF+).

Inclusion targets are derived from staff responses on the annual engagement survey, which includes a set of questions comprising the Inclusion Index.
The World Bank Compact, which is signed by the President and his senior team, is cascaded through all vice-presidential units. Progress against the
Compact targets and actions are reported monthly and reviewed quarterly. In addition to the Compacts, actions to improve staff perceptions on the
engagement survey, including the Inclusion Index, are developed and tracked at the World Bank and vice-presidential unit level.

405-1 Diversity of               On the World Bank Boards of Governors and Board of Executive Directors, representatives are determined by
governance bodies and            member countries. Of the 25 Executive Director Board members, five were women in fiscal year 2017. For more

                                 Nationals of Part II countries accounted for 43 percent of staff in management positions. Women accounted for 39
                                 percent of staff in management positions, and for 44 percent of full-time staff at professional grades (grade GF+) in
                                 technical positions. SSA and CR nationals represent 13 percent of full-time staff at professional grades (grade GF+).
                                 Since 1998, nationality, gender, and race have been the dimensions of diversity for which the Bank has set and

                                 monitored quantitative targets. Nationality has been measured in the aggregate by Part I and II contributing
                                 member status, whereas SSA and CR nationality has served as the proxy for race, specifically for Black staff.
                                 The HeForShe solidarity movement for gender equality, created by UN Women, provides a systematic approach
                                 and targeted platform where a global audience can engage and become change agents for the achievement of
                                 gender equality in our lifetime. To commemorate the 2017 International Women’s Day, President Jim Yong Kim was
                                 recognized as the Inaugural HeForShe Thematic Champion for International Financial Institutions for committing to
                                 close the gender gap within Management by 2020. The other commitments made for the organization were:
                                     •	   Achieve the gender parity target for women and men in technical fields by 2022.
                                     •	   Achieve the second level of EDGE (Economic Dividends for Gender Equality) certification by 2020.
                                     •	   Implement, in operations, the action plan encompassing recommendations coming from the Global Gender-based Violence Task

405-2 Ratio of                    In fiscal year 2017, the World Bank Group Development Research Group, in collaboration with the Gender Cross-
basic salary and                  Cutting Solution Area and Human Resources, completed a landmark study: “Compensation, Diversity, and Inclusion
remuneration of                   at the World Bank Group.” This study leveraged 25+ years of HR data to explore the issue of pay parity among
women to men                      Bank populations, including by gender. Key results included the observation that we have an aggregate salary gap
                                  between genders, but that the gap has decreased significantly over the 25+ years of the analysis. The aggregate
                                  salary gap is mainly caused by the gender composition of different grades at entry. The study is currently being
                                  disseminated. Key follow-up action items include the production of a report that HR and managers will use to
                                  address compensation outliers and more closely monitor salary parity upon entry to the institution. In fiscal year
                                  2018, the World Bank Group will examine a standard indicator to monitor pay parity by gender and grade level,
                                  and aims to include this in fiscal year 2019 GRI reporting.

GRI 406: Non-discrimination
The World Bank Group core values are personal honesty, integrity, and commitment; working together in teams with openness and trust; empowering
others and respecting differences; encouraging risk-taking and responsibility; and enjoying both work and family, as detailed in the Code of Conduct.




                                                                                                                                                           Corporate Impact
There is a mandatory e-learning training on the Code of Conduct for all new staff, including consultants with contracts of more than 30 days. A
summary of the Code of Conduct is available in nine languages. There is a separate Code of Conduct for Board officials. Business partners are
informed of ethics expectations through a separate document. Adherence to high ethical standards is specified in contracts with employees, Board
officials, and business partners. Section 1(c) of the Code for Board Officials requires them to sign the code document upon assuming duty and deposit
it with the Ethics Committee of the Board. Staff members are required to uphold World Bank Group Staff Rules as a condition of employment.
Due to its immunities from most national courts, the Bank provides staff comprehensive grievance mechanisms to address and resolve workplace
issues through informal and formal services. These services encourage collaboration among staff, provide space for the effective management of
conflict, and increase the Bank’s capacity to build and retain a globally representative workforce.
Most workplace issues are addressed and resolved using the informal core services of the Internal Justice Services (IJS). The informal services include
the Respectful Workplace Advisors (RWA) Program, Ombuds Services (OMB), and Mediation Services (MEF). Peer Review Services (PRS) is a core
formal service that uses a panel of peers to determine whether the Bank’s actions are consistent with the staff member’s contract of employment
and/or terms of appointment. The results of the hearings, conducted by a panel of peers, results in a recommendation that is then shared with the line
Vice President for his or her approval. In fiscal year 2017, a two-tier Administrative Review and Performance Management Review was implemented
to address performance management issues (performance evaluations, salary review increases, Opportunity to Improve) in a more efficient and
expeditious manner.
Various offices within the IJS provide evaluations to staff who retain its services. These offices include MEF, PRS, and the Ethics and Business Conduct
(EBC) Vice Presidency. In fiscal year 2017, the evaluations and the input of stakeholders was examined as part of a formal Metrics Review. The
outcome of the review and its recommendations will be shared with stakeholders and implemented in fiscal year 2018. In addition to the Metrics
Review, the IJS will disseminate its first integrated IJS Annual Report in fiscal year 2018.

406-1 Incidents of         In fiscal year 2017, EBC reviewed seven allegations of discrimination. These included alleged instances of
discrimination and         discrimination based on race, nationality, religious/creed, and gender. None of these allegations resulted in a report
corrective actions taken   of investigation or finding of misconduct.
                           EBC recognizes that discrimination can be hard to prove because of its nature, which is often covert and subtle,
                           and because of the “clear and convincing” standard of proof required of this and other serious allegations of
                           misconduct pursuant to the World Bank Group’s Administrative Tribunal jurisprudence. EBC, therefore, is reviewing
                           the process by which the Bank Group addresses alleged discrimination, to make it easier for staff members to
                           successfully bring forward a claim of alleged discrimination, increase the effectiveness of EBC reviews, and provide
                           more support to potential victims.
