                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Control/Challenges
â¢	   Zimbabwe spends significant resources on education, both public and private. The current
     economic growth and fiscal challenges leave little room for further increase of this spending
     envelop in the short and medium term.
â¢	   The need to provide equal opportunities to quality education for all Zimbabwean children is
     paramount, which calls for more effective use of the available resources.
â¢	   This PER analysis points to several imbalances in the education spending. Zimbabweâs secondary-
     to-primary-student public spending ratio of 1.66:1 far exceeds the averages for OECD countries
     (1.15:1) and other developing countries with similar demographic characteristics (ranging from 0.83-
     1.14:1). Of particular note is the very high share of public spending on salaries, crowding out public
     resources for infrastructure development and quality improvement. Total familiesâ contribution
     is equally large but the capacity to contribute varies with poorer communities not capable to pay
     fully as their income is limited. This resulted in a wide variation of actual per student spending at
     the school level which depends almost exclusively on parentsâ contribution and posed the risk of
     students dropping out and not completing schools as expected.

Choices/Options
â¢	   One way to improve the effectiveness of resource utilization is to budget and monitor spending
     using unit costs. For the wage bill, the key variable is the Pupil-Teacher Ratio. Zimbabweâs average
     PTR for junior education is not high, and even low by international standards in secondary education.
     PTRs can however go as high as 84 in junior and 61 in secondary while they can also go as low as 5
     in junior and 3 in secondary, pointing to the existence of very crowded classes as well as extremely
     small classes. For the capital spending, the key variable is the Pupil-Classroom Ratio. Again there
     is a significant variation in this ratio across levels of education and across provinces.
â¢	   The unit cost approach will guide the discussion on whether (i) they are reasonable; and (ii) rooms
     for reduction (if deemed unreasonably high) or increase (if deemed unreasonably low) can be
     identified. This will help frame the discussion on who need more resources and why, enabling the
     savings to be used for equalization or need-based targeting investment to take place.
â¢	   It will also strengthen the Program-Based Budgeting efforts that are being implemented in the
     education sector in Zimbabwe. The specification of the outcomes and in particular outputs to be
     delivered at the end of the budget cycle should be developed in light of the unit costs. Spending
     proposal should be justified in terms of how many more students will be served. Unit cost budgeting
     will also enable a more structured and transparent framework to make trade-off decisions (between
     levels of education, salary vs non-salary/capital or public/private share) especially when the system
     faces hard budget constraints.

Coordination
â¢	   This approach calls for making good use of essential education and finance data. Zimbabwe has
     rich databases (EMIS, Examination, TDIS, Payroll and IFMIS) but they need to be linked, analyzed
     and used in the budgeting, implementation and monitoring processes.
â¢	   Evidence generated by the data will need to be shared and used by the key decision making
     bodies (MoPSE, Ministry of Higher and Tertiary education, Public Service Commission, Ministry of
     Finance and Economic Development and Provinces) in a coordinated manner. By working with a
     broader set of partners to make the most of the available data, Zimbabwe could develop innovative
     solutions to tackle the problems in education even in a fiscally challenging situation.

     1              INTRODUCTION
As Zimbabwe recovered from the protracted economic crisis from 2000 to 2008, the Government
of Zimbabwe (GoZ) made major efforts to restore service delivery in education. Public funding for
primary and secondary education rebounded from two percent of GDP in 2009 to about 5.4 percent
of GDP in 2013. Owing to strong investment in education by the GoZ, households, and donors, pass
rates by 2013 had risen to more than 50 percent for seventh grade exams,Â² and textbook/pupil ratios
had reached 1:1 for core subjects.Â³ School attendance recovered. Primary net attendance rose from
90 percent in 2009 to 94 percent in 2014. Secondary net attendance increased from 45 percent to 58
percent over the same period. ECD programs expanded, with about 22 percent of three- to five-year-
old children attending ECD programs in 2014 - up from 18 percent in 2009.â´

Expanding access to high-quality education is a major policy priority for Zimbabwe. The
Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation (ZimAsset), the GoZâs plan to achieve
sustainable development and social equity, provides a strong mandate for investment in education. It
calls on the government to âcontinue to improve the quality of education from ECD to vocational and
tertiary levels to enhance literacy levels and skills development.ââµ The goal of the Education Medium
Term Plan (EMTP) 2011-2015, endorsed by the Cabinet in May 2012, is to ârevitalize the provision of
relevant, quality, inclusive and holistic education, sport, arts and culture for all Zimbabweans in line
with the MDG targets by 2015,â and set ambitious targets across seven strategic priorities, including: (i)
restore the professional status of teachers; (ii) revitalize learning quality and relevance; (iii) restore and
improve conditions of learning; (iv) ensure quality assurance and staff development; (v) reinvigorate
school and system governance and management; (vi) focus resources on those with greatest needs;
and (vii) revitalize sports, arts, and culture. When economic growth slowed again in 2012, the MoPSE
and donors involved in education conducted a strategic review and agreed on a revised operational
plan accounting for the smaller than anticipated fiscal space for education.

The development of the next five-year sector plan for 2016-2020 is underway. Initial public
consultations involved 600,000 participants at more than 8,000 school centers. Though the need for
fiscal funding for education is universally accepted, communities voiced desires to contribute to the
education of their children. A school financing policy is to be developed under this plan, recognizing
the importance of both public and private education funding.

The following volume analyzes public, household, and donor expenditures in primary and
secondary education during economic recovery from 2009 to 2015, focusing on the effectiveness,
efficiency, and equity of spending. The analysis covers all expenditures financed by the Ministry
of Primary and Secondary Education (MoPSE),â¶ and expenditures of the Basic Education Assistance
Module (BEAM) program of the Ministry of Public Service, Labor and Social Welfareâs (MPSLSW). It also
covers donor and household financing.

National Level
The MoPSE is the key national-level institution responsible for primary and secondary education.
Its mission is to âpromote and facilitate the equitable provision of quality, inclusive and relevant Infant,
Junior and Secondary Education.ââ· The MoPSE sets policy; monitors performance; maintains quality
assurance; supports capacity building and operations at the provincial and district levels; and manages
resources and personnel. Figure 1 illustrates the MoPSEâs core organizational structure.

Other national-level ministries are involved in education through specialized programs - most
focusing on studentsâ health and well-being, or promoting equity in education spending.
As mentioned MPSLSW administers the BEAM program, which provides financing directly to
primary and secondary schools to cover fees for economically disadvantaged children, especially
orphans. The Ministry of Youth, Indigenization and Economic Empowerment supports technical and
vocational education programs in the country. Finally, the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education,
Science and Technology Development oversees the upper levels of Zimbabwe's education system.

Provincial and District Level
At the sub-national level, the MoPSE has offices in each of Zimbabweâs ten administrative
provinces, and each of its 72 districts. The Provincial Office is largely responsible for: (1) implementing
policies determined at the national level; (2) overseeing certain HR management and recruitment
functions for the province; (3) assisting with planning and infrastructure; (4) managing the process
of registration of new schools; and (5) supporting district level offices and schools as needed. District
offices, on the other hand, are continuously engaged with schools in districts, conducting financial
oversight and education quality assurance, and helping schools manage other issues as they arise.
The structures of the provincial and district education offices are shown in Figures 2 and 3.

Primary and Secondary Education



School Level
For the formal primary and secondary systems, Zimbabwe follows a modified 7-4-2 structure,â¸
with an additional two years of early childhood education. Following a renewed effort in 2005 to
reinforce ECD, Zimbabwe added two additional years to primary education, and in 2014, split Infant
Education and Junior Education.â¹ Infant Education includes two years of pre-school (ECD A and ECD
B), and Grades 1 and 2. Junior Education includes Grades 3 through 7. Lower secondary is commonly
referred to as Ordinary Level (O-Level), and includes Form 1-4. Upper secondary, referred to as
Advanced Level (A-Level), includes two years known as âLower 6â and âUpper 6.â Students participate
in terminal exams at the end of Grade 7, at the end of Form 4 (O-level), and at the end of Upper 6
(A-level).Â¹â° This progression is summarized in Figure 4.

Zimbabwe categorizes schools at the primary and secondary levels based on their organizational
structure, location, and status of registration with the government. Students may attend either
government schools or non-government schools (religious, trust schools, company-owned, community,
or others). Schools are further classified according to their location, which determines funding received
from the national level. The designations P1 and S1 refer to primary and secondary schools in low-
density urban areas, while P2 and S2 refer to schools in high-density urban areas. P3 and S3 refer to
schools in rural areas.

These categories were created to differentiate between the resources available to different
schools. In addition, these categories are used to define the levels of fees that each type might charge
its pupils.Â¹Â¹ Finally, a school meeting all statutory requirements for government registration will be
classified as a âregistered schoolâ. Schools that have not yet met these requirements, but are on their
way to achieving them, are known as âsatellite schoolsâ and operate under the guidance of a registered
âmotherâ school. Figure 5 summarizes these overlapping categories of schools.




â¸ As of 2013, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) classified Zimbabwe as having a 7-2-4 school structure, which is unaligned
with the nationally-defined school system structure of 7-4-2.
â¹ Provisions are set out in the Secretaryâs Circular No. 14 of 2004 (ECEC); Directorâs Circular No. 12 of 2005 (ECD); and SI 106 of
2005 (ECD centers); 2014 was the first year when Infant Education represented a separate sub-vote in the budget for the MoPSE.
Â¹â° Progression from primary to O-Levels is unimpeded by results of 7th grade exams. However, some schools may have selection
criteria based on exam scores. Progression from O-Levels to A-Levels is contingent on passing exams, and schools admit students
based on performance on exams.
Â¹Â¹ This issue is discussed in more detail later in this report.

B. SCHOOL FINANCING                                         Figure 6: Estimated Financing of
MECHANISMS                                                  Primary and Secondary Education
                                                                    by Source, 2014
Primary and secondary education in Zimbabwe
is financed through several channels, including
the national budget, school fees and levies, donor
financing, and other locally generated funds. In
2014, public and private sources each accounted
for just under US$800 million, with donor funds
adding approximately US$50 million more to the
sector (see Figure 6).

National Budget
The MoPSE's budget should normally fund
a mixture of salaries; non-salary recurrent
                                                       Sources: MoPSE financial reports, EMIS 2014 data,
spending; transfers; to provinces; schools
                                                                     and donor reports.
and districts, and capital spending. In practice,
however, most budgeted and obligated funding is dedicated to salary expenses, leaving little to finance
other needs.

Despite increases in overall government spending on primary and secondary education,
financing of non-salary recurrent expenses remains low and continues to fall. Spending by the
MoPSE increased from US$176 million in 2009 to an estimated US$787 million in 2014. However, non-
employment recurrent expenditures fell from about $9 million in 2009 to about US$5.9 million in 2014.
On a per pupil basis, this represented a drop from US$2.77 per pupil in 2009 to US$1.46 in 2014. Of
MoPSE's total budget of US$877 million, only US$38 million (4 percent) was allocated to non-personnel
costs in 2014 - and only US$8 million (1 percent) was spent (see Figure 7). In 2014, about 64 percent
of MoPSE's budget was allocated to primary education (including ECD), and 34 percent to secondary
education. In 2014, MoPSE budgeted three percent to education administration, coordination, and
development - though spent only one percent.

Within the employment costs classification of MoPSEâs budget, substantial growth has occurred
in the category of employment allowances, and to a lesser extent base salaries, in primary and
secondary education. The MoPSEâs expenditures on the wage bill grew by 83 percent from US$ 487
million in 2011 to US$ 893 million in 2015. Primary education in 2015 accounted for two-thirds of the
wage bill, but the growth in wage bill expenditure was split equally between primary and secondary
education, with wage bills in both sub-sectors nearly doubling over five years. Meanwhile, expenditure
on administration grew slightly. In terms of MoPSEâs expenditure categories within primary and
secondary education, employment allowances grew by 120 percent and base salaries 60 percent.
Housing and transportation allowances were the main factors in employment allowance costs. Total
expenditure on housing allowances grew by more than 150 percent from US$ 71 million in 2011 to
US$ 180 million in 2015, while spending on transport allowances rose by more than 110 percent from
US$ 71 to US$ 150 million. The sustainability of public education spending depends in large part on
the MoPSEâs ability to slow the growth of spending on these allowance categories - and on the wage
bill as a whole.

Most spending for school-level recurrent expenditures is based on locally sourced revenues.
However, nongovernment schools receive some support from per capita school grants, and government
schools receive tuition grants. The central government transfers such grants to schools to purchase
school books and learning supplies. Under normal circumstances these transfers would support a fixed
amount per pupil. Yet education provinces, having received much less grant revenue than anticipated
in the tight fiscal environment, have rationed funds to support the neediest schools. Current low levels
of public spending on non-salary support are inadequate to meet the basic costs of running a school,
such as paying for teaching and learning supplies, and school utilities. This low level also cannot
sufficiently maintain the operations of the MoPSEâs national, provincial, or district offices, which often
lack funding for basic needs, such as fuel to conduct audits or quality assurance functions.

Similarly, spending on capital expenses is far behind in meeting the needs of the sector. Overall
capital spending averaged about US$3.4 million per year between 2009 and 2014ârepresenting only
0.6 percent of overall spending. This spending fell far short of budgeted amounts, which averaged
US$8.9 million per year, or about 1.6 percent of the overall budget. Building grants, which are transfers
from the central government budget for school capital improvement projects, are schoolsâ main source
of funding for undertaking capital improvements.

A final source of funding from the national budget is the BEAM program. BEAM is a transfer
program established in 2001 to improve access to quality education for orphans and vulnerable children
(OVC). The GoZ initiated funding for BEAM, but donors began contributing by late 2008. This program,
which is managed by the Department of Social Services (DSS) of the MPSLSW, transfers funds directly
to primary and secondary schools to cover fees and levies of eligible students, and examination fees
in secondary schools. From 2010 to 2014, the GoZ budgeted an annual average of US$11.8 million
to BEAM, though the yearly budgeted amount varied somewhatâfrom US$15 million in 2010, 2012,
and 2014, to only US$1.5 million in 2013. Actual spending on BEAM also varied, ranging from US$13.5
million in 2010 to only US$1 million in 2013. In 2012 and 2014, $15 million was budgeted, but just US$5
million and US$7 million were spent in these years respectively, as shown in Figure 9.

According to the 2014 EMIS figures, the median school fee paid by households is US$40 per year
per primary pupil, and US$95 per year per secondary pupil. This amount varies widely, however,
based on the type and location of the school. The reliance on private fees has grown in recent years,
putting additional pressure on households unable to afford these payments. In the second half of
2015, for example, the cost of pre-primary and primary educationâas measured by the consumer
price index (CPI) âgrew by more than 11 percent, representing a sharp increase in out-of-pocket costs
for many Zimbabwean households. The topic of private fees is discussed in more detail in the section
on equity in Zimbabweâs education system.

Donor Financing
Domestic sources of financing for education in Zimbabwe, especially financing for recurrent
spending, are supplemented by funding from international partners, which play a modest
but strategic role in filling the gap in education. Donors contribute approximately US$50 million
to Zimbabweâs education sector each year. From 2009, the largest source of support has been the
Education Transition Fund (ETF) and the Education Development Fund (EDF). The ETF is a multi-donor
funding mechanism set up in 2010. The ETFâs first phase focused on supporting the education sector
to regain its footing after Zimbabweâs period of instability. The second phase of the ETF reinforced
gains by making strategic investments, including helping the GoZ to reduce the textbook-pupil ratios of
core subjectsÂ¹âµ from 1:10 to 1:1.Â¹â¶ As Zimbabwe moved from stabilizing to strengthening the education
system, the ETF 1 and 2 were superseded by the EDF in 2012. Also a multi-donor funding mechanism,
the EDF provided about US$115 million in funding from 2012 to 2015. Managed by UNICEF, the EDF
receives funding from Germany, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Sweden, Finland, Norway,



Â¹Â² Some schools may differentiate between types of levies â such as School Development Committee (SDC) levies, building levies,
sports levies, and boarding levies or fees, if applicable. Many schools will combine fees and levies in their financial records,
and report only the total amounts charged to parents. For simplicity in this report, we designate only between fees, which are
a government mandated, and levies.
Â¹Â³ They are meant to cover only teaching and learning supplies, though it is unclear if this is closely monitored.
Â¹â´ Prior to 1999, fees paid at the school level were collected in a treasury account and redistributed based on government
priorities. However, a decision was made to institute a âSchool Services Fundâ, which allows schools to retain fees collected at
the source, and use them to finance non-salary costs at that school.
Â¹âµ The four core subjects include English, mathematics, environmental science, and one vernacular language.

and the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (OSISA). Table 11 in Annex 2 provides details on
major activities funded by the EDF.

The Global Partnership for Education (GPE)âa multilateral organization helping developing
countries to improve their education systemsâbegan supporting Zimbabwe in 2013, through
a grant of US$ 23.6 million for programming between 2013 to 2015. The lead coordinating agency
for GPE in Zimbabwe is the United Kingdomâs Department for International Development (DFID).
The lead managing agency is the United Nations Childrenâs Fund (UNICEF). Of the about $50 million
provided by the EDF and the GPE in 2014, roughly half went directly to help schools implement their
development plans.Â¹â· Table 13 in Annex 2 provides details on the major activities funded by the GPE.

DFID also supports activities in Zimbabwe related to education. This includes Â£12 million dedicated
to education under DFIDâs Â£24 million contribution to the Child Protection Fund (CPF), a multi-donor
trust fund, which supports phase II of the governmentâs National Action Plan for Orphans and Vulnerable
Children. In addition, DFID supports two centrally funded projects under the Girls Education Challenge
(GEC), providing Â£24 million to two NGOs to support additional bursaries for girlsâ education, and a
transformative program to empower girls within their schools and communities.

In addition, donors have contributed to the BEAM program, which subsidizes education for
orphans and vulnerable children. Donors began contributing to BEAM in late 2008 through the CPF.
The first round of funding, however, had negligible impact due to hyperinflation. During the next round
of funding from 2009 to 2011, BEAM disbursed US$60.2 million directly to primary and secondary
schools to cover fees, levies, and examination fees in secondary schoolsâ45 percent of which was
provided by donors. Â¹â¸ Since 2012, donors have phased out support for BEAM, though several donors
continued to support the CPF through end-2015.

Given the GoZâs funding shortfalls for non-salary recurrent spending, donors have provided the
most resources for such costs (see Figure 10). From 2012 through 2014, EDF provided more than
five times the spending of MoPSE on school monitoring and supervision, and 7.5 times the spending
of MoPSE on educational materials and supplies.

Current spending allocations are insufficient to meet school funding requirements: many
P3 and S3 schools have only basic facilities and supplies, and households bear most costs.
As donor support diminishes, the MoPSE will need to consider options for increasing budgetary
spending to sustain school operations. For example, the MoPSE will soon need to start replacing
ETF2/EDF-funded textbooks, which were provided in 2012 but have about a five-year life span.
Assuming that the MoPSE replaces a quarter of the old textbooks each year from 2017 to 2020, the
MoPSE will need to spend US$2.27 million per year at the primary level, and US$1.39 million per year
at the secondary level.Â¹â¹ Table 14 in Annex 2 provides details on unit costs of supplies and services
delivered under the ETF2/EDF.


C . A C C O U N TA B I L I T Y
Over the past several years, Zimbabwe has put in place new systems and approaches to enhance
accountability in using resources at all levels of the education sector. Such approaches include
strengthening national public financial management (PFM) and human resource management systems,
improving performance management, and reinforcing mechanisms for school-based management.

Public Financial Management Systems
At the national level, the Public Financial Management System (PFMS) allows the treasury to
release funds only if a corresponding budget allocation is authorized and funds are earmarked
to cover that expenditure. This system prevents overspending on approved line items,Â²â° except for
public utility costs, which are billed post-service based on actual use. Overall, this policy promotes
accountability and predictability in the whole PFM system.

The MoPSE has strengthened its internal auditing department, though weaknesses remain due
to financing gaps. The MoPSE has four chief internal auditors at its national officesâup from one in
2014. At the local level, the Ministry has about 70 auditors, and about 20 vacancies in provinces due
to a lack of qualified candidates. Auditors are not always able to fulfil their responsibilities in the field
as they lack funding for vehicle repairs and fuel for supervision missions. As a result, auditors tend to
more closely supervise schools in urban areas, while smaller, rural schools go several years between
audits. The audit department is mounting an ambitious effort to audit all 8,451 institutions (of which
about 8,300 are schools) under their purview in a four-year period, though funding for this effort is
not guaranteed.

Provincial and district offices benefit from the PFMS and electronic payroll, but few goods and
services are procured at this level due to low funding for non-employment costs. Provinces and
districts have another source of funding for non-salary costs: the Better Schools Programme-Zimbabwe
(BSP-Z). Under the BSP-Z, schools transfer between $0.10 and $1 per child of collected school fees to
the district level, which provides a fraction to the provincial level. Provincial and district staff are meant
to use these resources to finance supervision and teacher trainings benefitting schools. Yet there is
less transparency in using these funds, which do not run through the PFMS, as do funds transferred
from the central treasury. One recent innovation to improve transparency is UNICEFâs fuel smart-card
system, which provides cards to provincial and district offices permitting the easy monitoring and
supervision of fuel costs. The MoPSE may consider adopting this system to monitor fuel costs financed
through other government programsâsuch as the BSP-Z.




Â¹â¹ These calculations include replacement of 4 core textbooks at the primary level (at a cost of $0.86 per textbook) and 4 core
textbooks at the secondary level (at a cost of $1.32 per textbook). The projected number of students requiring textbooks is
based on estimated enrollments of primary and secondary student, which was calculated by taking an average of progression/
repeat rates by grade, as well as growth rates for the entry of students into ECD A, ECD B, and Grade 1 (as not all students who
enter Grade 1 will have necessarily have completed both ECD A and ECD B).

Human Resource Management
The MoPSE manages more than 120,000 employeesâmost of whom are teachers throughout
the country. The high number of dispersed teachers makes it challenging to maintain a qualified
workforce, ensure teachers and staff report for duty, manage discipline issues, and identify and address
cases of absenteeism.

Salary payments are submitted to several levels of inspection. Both the Public Service Commission
(PSC) and the treasury must concur on salary payments after the head of each department confirms
that employees on payroll were on-duty during the period in question. Payroll is executed through
an electronic payroll system.

Hiring at the provincial and district levels is overseen by the PSC, but the process was recently
revised. In mid-2013, the PSC assumed full jurisdiction over hiring decisions of the MoPSE, which
proved problematic as the PSC did not always hire teachers for posts for which they were qualified. In
January 2015, an adjustment was made to the hiring decision process: the PSC remains on the hiring
committee and must provide approval, but MoPSE staff at the provincial and district levels have roles
in ensuring that the most qualified candidates are selected.

The MoPSE has implemented mechanisms to better manage teacher qualifications. To better
catalogue and track its teaching staff, the MoPSE began implementing in 2013 the electronic TDIS
database, which includes a census of all teaching staff, their credentials and specialties, and matches
between qualifications and current assignments. This database also helps to minimize the possibility
of ghost workers. Under its 2011-2015 Medium Term Plan and Operations Strategy, with support
from DFID and UNICEF, the MoPSE started a Teacher Development Strategy that established Teacher
Professional Standards (TPS). This strategy supports a Continuous Professional Development Program
to improve the skills of teachers, implementation of a Performance Lag Address Programme (PLAP),
and upgrading skills of ECD paraprofessionals and teachers without O-level math, science, and
language.

Results-Based Management Techniques
The GoZ began implementing Results-Based Management (RBM) in 2006, with a view to reinforcing
public sector performance and service delivery through better strategic planning, more efficient use of
resources, and improved monitoring and reporting on performance information. In Zimbabwe, RBM
involves four main initiatives: (1) personnel performance system, (2) monitoring and evaluation, (3)
management information system, and (4) Results-Based Budgeting (RBB). These reforms have been
driven by the Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC), which created the Department of Reforms
within the OPC to move the process forward. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development
and the PSC have also supported these reforms.

A few of these initiatives made strides in recent years. A results-based personnel evaluation system
was deployed throughout the public sector. Public sector employees are now annually evaluated
against specific results related to their job description. The government is beginning to roll out RBB
with the MoPSE and two other pilot ministries that adopted this approach in 2015. More information
on RBB is included in Box 1 below.

                   Box 1: Program/Results-Based Budgeting in the MoPSE

   In late 2014 and early 2015, the MoPSE began transitioning to Program/Results-Based Budgeting.
   This form of budgeting re-groups planned and actual expenditures on a set of outputs these
   expenditures aim to provide, and links spending to output, outcome and impact indicators.
   Program/Results-Based Budgeting has advantages over traditional forms of line item budgeting,
   including, among others: (1) increased focus on service provision and sector strategy priorities
   over administrative divisions; (2) improved planning and operations because real costs of service
   delivery are clearer; (3) increased information to promote the efficiency and accountability of
   results; and (4) more informed tradeoffs for budget negotiations.Â²Â¹

   To begin this process, the MoPSE defined its programs and sub-programs, established key
   indicators, set baselines and targets for indicators, and translated the current yearâs budget
   from line item format into program budget format. The programs and sub-programs are
   defined as follows:

   The resulting âprogram budgetâ provides a much clearer picture of the costs of service delivery
   for the ministry. This is because several major costs for service provision cross administrative
   units in the budget structure, thus obscuring the picture of how the ministry spends its budget.

   For example, all of the ministryâs spending on school construction and maintenance is executed
   through the Administrative and General sub-vote, despite representing costs for infrastructure
   in primary (infant and junior) and secondary education. Another example is budget allocations to
   infant education. Based on the administrative structure, in the 2015 budget the MoPSE allocated
   only about US$ 1.8 million to infant education. This amount is much below the actual allocation,
   however, as the budget for teachers in infant education and grades 1 and 2 was provided in the
   junior education subvote. The program structure corrects this issue; in the 2015 program budget,
   infant education received an estimated allocation of US$ 110 million.

   Annex 1 provides the trends in administrative and program-based budgeting and expenditure.




RBB is one of the core elements of the GoZâs efforts to implement RBM. Efforts to implement RBB
have been ongoing since around 2011, though progress accelerated in late 2014 and early 2015. In
2011 and 2013, staff at the Ministry of Finance and select line ministries were trained on RBB concepts.
These trainings did not result in major adjustments in budgeting practices until 2014 and early 2015,
when authorities signaled to donors that implementing RBB was a top priority.

School-Based Management Systems
At the school level, the School Head plays a major role in managing school finances. The School
Head is involved in annual budgeting and strategic planning exercises, and in administering the budget
on a day-to-day basis. If sufficient resources are available, some schools may also have a bursar or school
accountant who supports financial management. That said, School Heads or Teachers-in-Charge are
teachers rather than managers by training, and often take on school financial management responsibilities
without strong backgrounds in financial management. In 2013 and 2014, as many as 90 percent of all
School Heads underwent training in financial management at public service training centers with the
assistance of UNICEF. A full financial management manual was developed and disseminated, along with
reporting templates. Accountability of funds was reported to have improved significantly. This progress
could be confirmed if more regular audits are possible.

Zimbabwe has developed a system of SDCs as a control mechanism for school finance and
service delivery. SDCs have a role in reviewing the annual school development plan and the annual
budget required to implement the plan, before the plan and budget go to the full Parentsâ Assembly for
authorization. The annual budget is accompanied by the estimated school fees and levies required to
mobilize annual funding requirements. At the end of the year, the SDCs review the final accounts for the
year. Furthermore, SDCs designate a smaller finance committee to help monitor financial management
issues more regularly and make decisions on the use of funds. The finance committee should be
composed of the School Head, the Deputy Head, a chairperson and a vice chairperson. In addition,
each school should have a procurement committee that oversees purchases, evaluates quotations, and
justifies purchases based on competitive procurement processes.Â²Â²

Given the role of SDCs in managing schools, the ETF I and the MoPSE trained two to four SDC
members from each school in 2010 to monitor the delivery of learning materials provided by
the ETF.Â²Â³ The Finance and Administrative Manual provides guidelines for processes and requirements
for SDCs, finance committees, and procurement committees. More training or materials for SDC leaders
may be warranted, since turnover is quite high, as parents may only be able to commit for one or two
years, or leave after their children graduate from school.

                        EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVE
        3               SERVICE DELIVERY
A . A D E Q U A C Y A N D S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y
Zimbabweâs public expenditure on primary and secondary education has grown considerably
since the nadir of the economic crisis in 2008. Overall, the voted budget allocated to the MoPSE
increased fivefoldâfrom $177 million in 2009 to $876 million in 2014, then to $890 million in 2015.
In actual budget expenditures, spending by the ministry increased from $176 million in 2009 to an
estimated $787 million in 2014.

However, government spending does not yet fully finance the needs of general education. In
fact, private sources are estimated to have contributed $779 million to primary and secondary schools
in 2013. Donors contribute an additional $40-50 million to the sector each year, with a large portion
going directly to schools.

Compared to neighboring countries, Zimbabwe fares well in public spending allocated to primary
and secondary education. For example, primary and secondary education (including ECD) in the 2015
MoPSE budget made up about 20 percent of the total 2015 national budget. In comparison, nearby
Zambia allocated only 16 percent of its 2015 budget to primary and secondary education. The difference
is more pronounced measured as a share of GPD. Though Zimbabwe allocated 6.2 percent of GDP to
primary and secondary education in 2015âthree times what it spent in 2009âZambia budgeted only
3.9 percent in 2015 (a modest increase from 2009).

Despite the vast improvements since 2008, the adequacy and sustainability of public spending
remain a concern for the education sector. The large share of spending from private and, to a lesser
extent, donor sources point to inadequate public financing to meet basic educational needs. Financing
of non-salary recurrent and capital costs, as discussed below, largely falls within the realm of private
contributions. The sustainability of relying on off-budget sources to support schoolsâ basic operations
is a concern for this fast growing sector.



B. ALLOCATIVE EFFICIENCY
One way to measure the efficiency of public expenditure is to assess whether resources are
optimally allocated across different expenditure categories to achieve desired objectives. In other
words, are funds being spent in the right areas to ensure a quality education, or would reallocating
resources make the sector more efficient?

In allocative efficiency, a key concern in Zimbabwe is the high share of the MoPSE budget
devoted to salaries. Employment costs dominate spending by the ministry, accounting for virtually
the entire increase in MoPSE spending between 2009 and 2014 (see Figure 11). Employment costs rose
steadily from $167 million to $779 million over this period. Meanwhile, non-salary recurrent and capital
costs decreased from $10 million to $8 millionâdespite a growing student population. Zimbabweâs
99 percent of public spending devoted to employment costsâwith only 1 percent spent on all other
inputsâis among the most lopsided ratios in the world.

Non-salary spending is insufficient for two reasons; the first is that the allocation approved
in the annual budget is not adequate to fund school investment and operating costs. In the
2014 budget, MoPSE was allocated US$877 million, but only US$38 millionâabout 4 percentâwas
allocated to non-salary spending. In the 2015 budget, MoPSEâs allocation to non-salary spending fell
to US$17 millionâor less than 2 percent. In 2014, this non-salary allocation equaled US$9 per student,
far less than necessary to ensure proper learning conditions. In fact, of the total resources for capital
expenditures in primary schools, most comes from private sources. In secondary schools, capital
financing is sourced more equally between public and private sources. Compared to other countries,
Zimbabweâs school system generally underfunds capital investment (see Table 1), and the low share
of publicly financed investment is particularly troubling.

The second reason for inadequate spending on non-salary items is low budget execution. In 2014,
the MoPSE reported a 90 percent execution rate of its overall budget. However, no non-salary line
item surpassed 61 percent. MoPSE disbursed only US$0.4 million of its budgeted US$0.7 million for
maintenance costs. Budget execution for goods and services, together with current and capital transfers,
reached only 29 percent. Meanwhile, acquisitions of fixed capital assets and the implementation of
special budget programsâsuch as quality assurance, e-learning, and school feedingâreceived less
than 1 percent of allocated amounts (see Figure 12). In comparison, budget execution for employment
costs reached 93 percent. As a result, less than US$2 was spent per child from the 2014 MoPSE budget
to finance operating and capital costs in Zimbabweâs schools.

Delaying the release of funds for non-salary spending has deeply negative consequences.
Maintenance and operations must be financed according to a regular schedule, and capital investment
projects are especially dependent on predictable funding. The failure to release budgeted funds
undermines the ability of local education authorities to design and execute performance plans, and
undermines the credibility of national authorities.

The allocative efficiency of MoPSEâs spending
can also be reviewed by looking at the
budget split between primary and secondary
                                                                              Table 2: Secondary to

slightly from 2009 to 2012. In parallel, the total amount spent per student more than quadrupled
between 2009 and 2014 (see Figure 12). In comparison, the secondary to primary ratio of spending

education systems with young and growing student populations, are more generous to primary
education (see Table 2).

Primary and Secondary Education


As 99 percent of MoPSE spending goes to personnel costs, the difference in per-student allocations
between the primary and secondary levels can be attributed to differences in student-teacher
ratios. According to the 2014 EMIS, the average student-teacher ratio was 35 in ECD classes, 36 in
primary schools, and 23 in secondary schools.Â²â· Though ECD and primary school classes are large
by necessityâthere are not enough classrooms and qualified teachersâsecondary school classes
and student-teacher ratios are smaller because more resources are available. In fact, Zimbabweâs
student-teacher ratio in secondary schools is lower than that of Chile, a high-income member of the
OECD (see Figure 14). Since only half of Zimbabweâs students progress to secondary education, the
relatively generous resource allocations to secondary schools (exhibited in small class sizes) may be
unaffordable in a country working to ensure adequate ECD coverage.Â²â¸



                           Box 2: Using Technology to Improve Learning in
                           Large Class Environments: Case of South Korea
   South Korea is widely viewed to be a pioneer in using Information and Communication Technologies
   (ICTs) in the classroom. South Koreaâs first master plan for ICT in education dates to 1996, and
   educators have since increasingly integrated ICTs into education at all levels. South Koreaâs innovations
   and dedication to quality teaching have paid off â Korea routinely scores at the top of Programme
   for International Student Assessment (PISA) rankings for math, science and readingâdespite
   having higher pupil-teacher ratios than other countries in the OECD. A recent trend in the South
   Korean approach is âSMART Educationââthat is, education which is âSelf-directedâ, keeps students
   âMotivatedâ, âAdaptsâ to the learnersâ needs, includes a rich set of âResourcesâ in the system, and
   embeds âTechnologyâ throughout the learning process.

   ICT education in South Korea includes a mix of training on the use of ICTs and ways to use ICTs to
   teach other subjects, such as language arts, mathematics, and science. The ICT skills curriculum
   covers computing skills (hardware and software), the role of information in society and ethical issues
   related to technology, and other IT skills, such as data analytics and web development. Training on
   ICT skills is widespread at the elementary (primary) level: 77 percent of primary students receive
   such training. This falls to 22 percent in middle school and 35 percent in high school. This model
   demonstrates the importance of introducing ICTs to students at an early age to maximize impact.
   ICTs are used to teach more traditional subjects, such as mathematics, science and language arts,
   through interactive, digital textbooks, which in many cases supplement physical learning materials.
   These textbooks allow students to engage with the subject matter in a self-paced manner through
   interactive learning modules, games, tests, and activities. Teachers have access to learning outcome
   information to better understand the challenges facing individual students, and customize their
   teaching methods to individual students.

   South Koreaâs success is due to several factors: alignment of education policy; investments in ICTs at
   the school level; e-learning embedded in the curricula; trainings of teachers on ICTs in the classroom,
   and private sector partnerships to develop education content innovations through digital textbooks
   and e-classroom modules. The master plan for ICT in education was a key step for South Korea to begin
   mainstreaming ICT in its education system. Building on that experience, the World Bank is working
   with the MoPSE to develop a draft policy framework for ICT in Education. The policy framework is
   intended to provide cost-effective, innovative and sustainable options for using ICT to connect schools,
   districts, and provinces with one another and with the Head Office. The framework will also support

Â²â· The ECD ratio showed substantial variation across different provinces, ranging from 23 in Bulawayo to 42 in Masvingo. Meanwhile, the
primary and secondary ratios were relatively uniform throughout the country, ranging between 33 and 39, and 20 and 24, respectively.
Â²â¸ Larger class sizes do not necessarily lead to poor education outcomes. An interesting example of a country achieving high quality
education with larger than average class sizes is South Korea (Republic of Korea), which has done so partly through the use of
technology in the classroom (see Box 2).

In sum, the per-student allocations from public sources are skewed toward employment costs
over recurrent and capital expenses, and toward secondary education over primary education
and ECD. These imbalances present challenges in allocative efficiency, and heavily influence the equity
of public resource allocation. Equity-related aspects are explored in the equity section below.


C. TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY
In addition to examining resource allocation, efficiency can be measured by assessing how well
resources are being utilized to achieve desired objectives after allocations are made.Â²â¹ This approach,
known as technical efficiency, is the study of expenditures in relation to results, expressed through various
service delivery indicators. These indicators can be input-oriented, such as student-teacher ratio, student-
qualified teacher ratio, student-classroom ratio, computers per 100 students, average class size, and average
school size. Indicators can also be output-oriented, such as enrollment rates, completion rates, student learning
outcomes, and so forth. Several indicators are discussed in the equity section below. This section focuses on
assessing efficiency by analyzing unit costs, student-teacher ratios, and student learning outcomes.

Despite the nearly fivefold increase in the primary and secondary education budget from 2009 to
2014, key output measures in education barely changed. According to preliminary 2014 EMIS data,
net enrollment rates have fallen slightly since 2009 from 97.7 percent to 92.2 percent, while enrollment in
secondary education rose from 38.6 percent to 49.6 percent. The increase in secondary education enrollment
was most evident at the A-level (Form 5-6), where net enrollment grew from 4.8 percent in 2009 to 7.2 percent.
Meanwhile O-level (Form 1-4) enrollment rates experienced a slight decline.

The pass rates of the three main examinations changed little since 2009. The Grade 7 exam, taken
by pupils at the end of primary education, improved the most: pass rates increased from 39.7 percent to
50.2 percent from 2009 to 2013, though this is still below the pre-crisis rate of 70 percent in 2007. Despite
Zimbabweâs expanding education budget since 2009, pass rates for the O-level and A-level exams stayed
largely unchanged at around 20 percent and 85 percent, respectivelyâthough rates fluctuated moderately
from year to year.

Â²â¹ Measuring the efficiency of frontline service delivery units in the public sector is a growing field utilizing various methods to
assess the relative efficiency of achieving the desired outcomes by schools, clinics, public administration offices, etc., with a
given level of inputs (see Box 3).



                                                                                                                            19
Primary and Secondary Education


As reflected in Figure 16 and Table 3, the unit costs of providing education vary across Zimbabweâs
provinces. The school-level expenditure per studentâexcluding centrally paid staff salariesâranges
from $35 to $319 in primary schools, and from $267 to $841 in secondary schools. The provinces
with the highest costs are not remote, rural areas where costs are expected to be greater owing
to higher transport costs and lower class sizes in less dense areas. Instead, the two metropolitan
provincesâ Bulawayo and Harareâare where spending per student is the highest. This is because
urban households tend to have higher living costs and a greater ability to pay school fees, which makes
available more resources to urban schools.Â³â°

Student-teacher ratios are relatively uniform across the country. The average number of students
per teacher employed in primary schools (including ECD) ranges from 32 to 39, while secondary schools
average from 20 to 24 across provinces. The large difference in students per teacher between primary
and secondary schools is arguably suboptimal. By international standards, Zimbabweâs provinces range
between Chile (25) and the United Kingdom (18) in students per teacher in secondary education,Â³Â¹
which may be unaffordable given Zimbabweâs emergence from a deep economic crisis.



                            Box 3: Measuring Efficiency at School Level in
                                  Primary and Secondary Education

   An education system aims to develop studentsâ cognitive and non-cognitive skills, consistent with
   a countryâs education policy and priorities. To achieve desired outcomes, which can be measured
   through student learning assessments or other methods, schools use a mix of available inputs.
   These inputs, which contribute to the learning process to different degrees, include: teachers with
   varying levels of training; non-teaching staff; financingâboth public and private; learning materials
   and technology; educational facilities; and so forth. Additional non-school factors influence
   how inputs are converted into learning outcomes. These factors include the socioeconomic
   background of students (e.g., parental education and income levels) and characteristics of schools
   and communities, such as urban-rural location. Non-school factors are outside the control of the
   school system, but can impact student performance.

   Technical efficiency is generally measured by comparing the level of output achieved with a
   given level of input, or by comparing the level of input needed to achieve a given level of output.
   An education âproduction functionâ can be constructed to determine the technical efficiency of
   each production unit (e.g., a school or a district), which will calculate an âefficiency scoreâ for each
   unit. Various techniques can derive such scoresâsome simple and other complex. At its most
   straightforward, an efficiency analysis can compare schools achieving high marks with low levels
   of inputs (e.g., low levels of per-student spending and/or below-average socioeconomic status of
   students). Such schools are deemed relatively technically efficient, while schools with high levels
   of inputs but low scores are relatively inefficient. Sophisticated methods to calculate efficiency
   scores include econometric techniques, such as parametric and non-parametric estimation.

   Two common methods from literature in education and health are Data Envelopment Analysis
   (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). Both approaches calculate an efficiency score for
   each school or district by constructing an âefficiency frontierâ against which all schools can be
   mapped. The distance to this frontier is considered that schoolâs efficiency score. In DEA, for
   example, units lying on the frontier are considered âperfectly efficientâ, and receive the maximum
   score of 1. This analysis requires reliable measures of student learning outcomes, and detailed
   school-level data on education inputs (e.g., spending by school on various expenditures, student-
   teacher ratios) and school context (studentsâ socioeconomic background). It also requires a high
   familiarity with advanced econometric techniques, and an ability to work with large data sets
   using modern statistical software. Increasingly, ministries of education and ministries of finance



Â³â° A thorough review of cost drivers in the urban provinces is underway to investigate whether these preliminary findings are a
result of errors in the underlying data or arise from legitimate spending differences among Zimbabweâs schools.

Yet a sizeable share of teachers lack proper qualifications. The ratio of students per qualified
teacher is substantially higherâbetween 36 and 68 in primary schools (including ECD), and between
26 and 38 in secondary schools. Nationwide, the share of unqualified teachers in primary school is 11
percent, reaching as high as 39 percent in Matabeleland North province. In secondary education, 26
percent of teachers lack proper qualifications. The share of unqualified ECD instructors is a whopping
67 percent nationally, but reaches 90 percent in Matabeleland North and South provinces. Teacher
training colleges are working to fill the gap with qualified ECD teachers, but the current output of
about 2,000 new teachers per year struggles to keep up with demand.Â³Â² Resolving this challenge will
be essential for Zimbabwe to attain the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #4, which aims to ensure
that all girls and boys have access to quality ECD, care, and preprimary education by 2030. In the short
term, officials may need to explore alternative methods of providing ECD in areas with high teacher
shortages, such as technology-based ECD models, which can support interactive audio instruction.

Primary and Secondary Education


Partly due to shortages in school financing and qualified teachers, learning outcomes vary
substantially across the country. In primary schools, an average of 49 percent of internal candidates
passed Grade 7 (G7) exams in 2013. However, the pass rate ranged from 32 percent (Matabeleland
North) to 80 percent (Bulawayo). In secondary schools, 23 percent of O-level internal candidates
passed the 2013 examâranging from 17 percent in Matabeleland North to 27 percent in Harare. Of
those who reached A-levels, the vast majority (83 percent) passed in 2013âranging from 70 percent
in Matabeleland North to 88 percent in Mashonaland East.

Not surprisingly, a strong correlation is observed between provinces performing well on exams
and those where school resource endowments were more plentiful.Â³Â³ This is particularly striking at
the primary school level. Provinces with higher per-student spending tend to have higher G7 pass rates
(see Figure 17). Provinces with fewer qualified teachersâand higher ratios of students per qualified
teacherâtend to have lower G7 pass rates. As consistently shown in international research literature,
spending levels are generally not a strong predictor of student learning outcomes, but a minimum level
of financial resources is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for learning. Zimbabweâs schools and
provinces (such as Matabeleland North) that fail to meet this condition are likely to continue providing
a low quality education to students.

Though supporting a robust system of national examinations, Zimbabwe lacks an effective
mechanism for system-wide quality assessment. Various international, regional, and national
mechanisms for measuring education quality are being used throughout the world. Zimbabwe is a
member of the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ),
but Zimbabweâs last set of publicly available SACMEQ assessment results is from 2007. To better
understand the relationship between student learning outcomes and the allocation of resourcesâ
including issues relating to equity and efficiencyâZimbabwe might consider joining an international
program providing regular measurements of the quality of education. One such program is PISA for
Development, which is being implemented by the OECD (see Box 4).




Â³Â³ While student learning outcomes are affected by a wide range of factors, resource availability is likely to play a role in
determining learning outcomes in Zimbabwe.

          Box 4: International Programs of Student Learning Assessment

The last 20 years has seen tremendous growth in the use of international systems for student
learning assessment. Such assessments aim to provide information on education system
performance, typically relative to an agreed set of standards or learning goals, to inform education
policy and practice. International assessments can be similar to ones used at the national or
subnational levels, but they introduce an element of comparability and standardization across
countries, facilitating easy benchmarking of results internationally.

Popular international systems for student assessment include TIMSS (Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study), PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study), and
PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment). Regional systems also exist, such as
SACMEQ (Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality), PASEC
(Programme dâAnalyse des SystÃ¨mes Educatifs / Program on the Analysis of Education Systems),
and LLECE (Latin American Laboratory for Assessment of the Quality of Education).

Though systems differ in their goals and the methods for measuring achievement, the top
scoring education systems on international assessments are typically considered among the most
successful and most emulated in the world. Countries and cities with top scores on PISA 2012,
for example, included Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, and Finlandâall of
which have a reputation for delivering high quality education to their students.

The OECD, which runs the PISA initiative, recently developed a program of assessments designed to
measure the skills and knowledge of 15 year olds in developing countries. PISA for Development,
as it is called, will conduct its first assessments from 2015 and 2018. Seven countries from Africa,
Asia, and Latin America have signed up so far, including Cambodia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Paraguay, Senegal, and Zambia. In addition to providing a single reference for rigorously gauging
progress on educational quality and equity, PISA for Development emphasizes institutional
capacity building to strengthen countriesâ national assessment systems.

By participating in international programs, such as PISA for Development, Zimbabwe can
enhance its use of data in managing the education system by adding robust measures of
student learning outcomes and skill acquisition to the pool of assessment information already
available for policymakers.

     4                EQUITY
A . A C C E S S A N D I N F RA S T R U C T U R E M A T T E R S
Access to education is one of the basic concepts of educational equity. Access is commonly
measured using enrollment rates. In such terms, Zimbabwe has achieved widespread and nearly
universal access in primary education: 92 percent of boys and girls aged 6-12 are enrolled in primary
school (see Table 4). Except for Harare, no province has a net enrollment rateÂ³â´ below 90 percent for
boys and girls. However, the story is different in ECD and secondary education. The net enrollment
rate for ECD was only 25 percent in 2014, with Harare the lowest among provinces at 9 percent.
Zimbabwe has commendable gender parity in ECD enrollment, and four provinces (Manicaland,
Masvingo, Matabeleland North and South) have reached 30 percent net ECD enrollment. However,
much work remains to be done to ensure adequate ECD coverage throughout Zimbabwe.

Secondary education faces equity challenges, especially in the transition from lower to upper
secondary school. Based on net enrollment, 54 percent of 13-16 year olds attend lower secondary
(Forms 1-4), but only seven percent of 17-18 year olds enroll in upper secondary. Girls outnumber boys
in lower secondary, though the gap is narrowed when considering gross enrollment rates. This implies
that a larger share of boys enrolls in Forms 1-4 at a later age. In upper secondary, net enrollment rates
are low for both boys (7.6 percent) and girls (6.8 percent). Gross enrollment rates for girls and boys


Â³â´ Net enrollment rates are calculated as the number of children enrolled in each level of education from the appropriate age group
(e.g., ages 3-5 for ECD) divided by the total number of children in appropriate age group. Gross enrollment rates are calculated as
the total number of children enrolled, regardless of age, divided by the total number of children in the appropriate age group.

diverge in upper secondary â with boys attaining a gross enrollment rate of 13 percent and girls a gross
enrollment rate of 10 percent. This suggests scope to encourage girls to continue studies in line with
the SDG to eliminate gender disparities and ensure equal access to all levels of education. Both boys
and girls enroll in A-level classes at a later than expected age. Net enrollment is starkly different across
provinces in lower secondary, ranging from 43 percent in Harare to 65 percent in Mashonaland East,
and in upper secondary, ranging from 3 percent in Matabeleland North to 10 percent in Bulawayo.

In many parts of Zimbabwe, access to education is impaired by inadequate infrastructure. In
primary and secondary education, provinces with higher pupil per classroom ratios tend to have lower
enrollment rates (see Figure 18). Harare has the lowest enrollment rates in the country. Harare also has
the most crowded classroomsâ56 students per primary classroom, and 52 per secondary classroom,
substantially exceeding the national averages of 45 and 44, respectively. However, higher enrollment
rates in ECD are associated with higher pupil per classroom ratios, suggesting schools may be reluctant
to turn children away, instead opting to pack them into severely overcrowded classrooms. The quality
of ECD likely suffers as a result. In some provinces, pupil per classroom ratios in ECD exceed 100, such
as 107 in Mashonaland Central and 124 in Matabeleland North. Moreover, education authorities would
likely find it difficult to provide a quality ECD education even at the national average of 73 children per
classroom, suggesting a need to build or identify additional classrooms.

Expanding access to education in these areas requires scaling up public resources and capital
investment to fill the infrastructure gap. The most pressing need is in ECD, where reducing the
pupil per classroom ratio to 40 students will require at least 4,812 new ECD classroomsâalmost
double the current stockâassuming no increase in ECD enrollment. Reducing the ratios to 40
students per classroom in primary and secondary education will require constructing 7,911 new
primary classrooms and 2,056 new secondary classrooms. Based on MoPSE estimates, these figures
translate into a shortage of 1,252 primary schools and 804 secondary schools. The ECD program
has been fully incorporated into the primary school curriculum under the Infant Module. The
targeted 1,252 primary schools will be mandated to have full-fledged Infant Module Centres. Such
ECD investments are anticipated to be included in the new Education Sector Plan for 2016-2020.

One concern about the boom of new community schools, which resulted from the 2000
land reform, is that many were not established in line with the normative framework. The
rules of the Directors Policy Circular No. 73 of 1991, which guides the establishment and planning
of new schools, were not fully applied in many recently set-up satellite schools. The MoPSE is
making efforts to ensure that all schools established henceforth comply with guidelines, and is



                                                                                                     27
Primary and Secondary Education


considering amending the Circular to accommodate the Infant School Module (ECD). The MoPSE
may give priority to public over private schools when establishing new institutions, with a view to
reducing user fees in selected areas.Â³âµ

At present, infrastructure conditions in many schools do not provide an adequate learning
environment. Half of Zimbabweâs schools report having no electricity, and one-third have insufficient
or inconsistent water supply. Among primary schools, 52 percent lack electricity, though this share
is even higher among P3 schools (58 percent), and primary schools in certain provinces, such as
in Matabeleland North (67 percent). Sufficient and consistent water supply is available in only 65
percent of primary and 64 percent of secondary schools in the country.



B. RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS ACROSS SCHOOLS
AND SCHOOL TYPES
The resources available to different primary and secondary schools varies substantially across
Zimbabwe. According to 2014 EMIS data, schools reported a total of $814 million in income during
the 2013 academic year. Of this, $779 million (96 percent) came from private sources, $32 million (4
percent) from public sources,Â³â¶ and $3 million (0.4 percent) from external sources. This amounts to
$134 in school revenues per student enrolled in primary education, and $458 per student in secondary
education (see Figure 19). Private financing comes from a multitude of levies and fees. Invariably,
schools serving children from more disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds have less capacity to
collect private funds, leading to highly unequal resources available to different categories of schools.

Though public resources are generally allocated to categories of schools that have lower capacity
to generate own-source revenue (such as P3 and S3 schools), the distribution of private funds
raised by schools is highly regressive. Public financing is transferred to schools through four main
channels: per capita grants, salary grants, building grants, and BEAM payments. All of these are
distributed in a generally progressive manner. For example, a larger share of public transfers benefit P3
and S3 schools, whose students tend to come from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, who make
up 79 percent and 69 percent of primary and secondary school students, respectively. External donor
funds reach schools in a generally regressive manner: P1 and S1 schools receive four times as much
funds per student as other schools. But the most regressive flows are from private sources. In 2013, P1
schools received $608 per student in 2013âtwice the amount received by P2 schools, and a staggering
nine times more than P3 schools. Similarly, S1 schoolsâreceiving $1,827 per studentâcollected four
times as much in fees and levies as S2 schools, and eight times more than S3 schools (see Table 5).




Â³âµ The proliferation of community schools in rural areas has likely exacerbated the need for infrastructure investment in satellite
facilities, which do not meet the standards to become registered schools. This, in turn, has led to higher fees to be charged to
households in these areas.
Â³â¶ These totals exclude staff salaries, which are paid directly by the government and make up the vast majority of public spending
on education.

Large differences in spending per student on categories ranging from textbooks to teacher
training profoundly alter the opportunities available to students in different schools. Primary
schools spent an average of US$89 per student in 2013âjust under a third of which went to salariesÂ³â·

and benefits (US$28) and building construction and repairs (US$17). Secondary schools spent five times
as muchâUS$480 per studentâof which compensation made up a slightly smaller share (US$127).
The rest was spread more or less evenly across sports; textbooks and learning equipment; buildings

However, large differences in equity were observed in level of education. Primary schools in
more affluent areas (P1) spent on average US$634 per child, four times more than P2 schools and 14
times more than P3 schools (see Table 6). P3 schools spent only US$45 per student in the 2013 school
yearâone-third of which (US$14) funded building construction and repairs, with little left for textbooks
and learning materials (US$5) and school management and teacher training (US$4). The differences
are nearly as stark in secondary education. Though S1 schools spent US$2,049 per student, S2 and S3
schools spent $638 and US$217, respectively. S1 schools thus spent three times as much as S2 schools,
and nine times as much as S3 schools. In short, though P3 and S3 schools enroll three-quarters of
all students in Zimbabwe, they have next to no resources that can be used on teacher training and
learning materialsâtwo crucial inputs in the educational process.

C. SCHOOL FEES AND LEVIES
As demonstrated above, private financing accounts for the overwhelming majority of resources
available at the school level. According to 2014 EMIS data, virtually all schools charge some combination
of levies and fees. The median amount charged by primary schools was $40 per student in 2013. The
median for secondary schools was $95. These amounts vary widely across school categoriesâfrom
$36 in P3 schools to $253 in P1 schools, and from $80 in S3 schools to $643 in the wealthier S1 schools.

Fees and levies finance everything from capital improvements and classroom construction to
staff salaries and learning supplies. In 2013, the single largest category of private funds for primary
schools was the building levy, which accounted for one-quarter ($101 million) of all funds raised by
these schools (see Table 7). The Centre/SDA levy ($96 million) and the tuition fees ($94 million) were
not far behind. For secondary schools, tuition fees brought in the most revenue ($112 million), followed
by boarding fees ($75 million) and the Centre/SDA levy ($71 million).

The level of fees and taxes collected at each school varied substantially according to parentsâ
ability to pay. By law, the level of fees is set by the central government, agreed between the school
administration and the respective SDC, and approved by the District Education Office. In reality, the
payment demanded from families each term (combining all levies and fees) is often determined by
the administrationâs assessment of what families can afford, along with school needs. Cases of non-
payment are widespread, but a recent government decision has barred schools from denying education
to children whose families cannot pay. Conversations with several heads of schools confirmed that
this decision has resulted in lower levels of payment compliance.

Schoolsâ heavy reliance on highly variable fees has created a system in which parentsâ ability to
pay determines the availability of infrastructure and learning materials in a particular school,
perpetuating inequalities. The number of computers in a school, for example, is closely related to
the total amount of taxes and fees charged by the school. This relationship is particularly strong in
secondary schools where fee levels explain nearly one-third of the variation in the total number of
computers (see Figure 21). Also, investments in teacher training and school infrastructure reflect the
level of private financing received by each school.

At present, no equalization mechanism exists to ensure an adequate and equitable distribution of
resources across Zimbabweâs schools.Â³â¸ Studies have shown that equalizing education financing can contribute
to improvements in access to education and learning outcomes for disadvantaged populationsÂ³â¹ The introduction
of an equalization mechanism to allocate financial resources more equitably across schools and school types
should, therefore, be considered in Zimbabweâpotentially within the framework of the existing BSP-Z program.
