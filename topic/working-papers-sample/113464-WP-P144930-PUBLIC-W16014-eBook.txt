Overview
                                     Connecting the Water and Energy Sectors
                                     Water and energy are often entwined in the sense that the use of one depends on the
                                     availability of the other. Decision making in one sector significantly affects the other,
                                     but those effects often are not taken into account in traditional sector-based planning
                                     processes. The sustainable supply of services from these two interdependent resources
                                     therefore constitutes a set of integrated challenges commonly referred to as the water-
                                     energy nexus. Improving our understanding of the complex interdependencies of the
                                     water-energy nexus and developing appropriate tools to assist decision makers with
                                     future infrastructure planning are essential for continued sustainable development in
                                     the face of the uncertainties posed by climate change.
                                        The World Bank has embarked on a global initiative called Thirsty Energy to help
                                     countries tackle the challenges of managing the water-energy nexus in an integrated
                                     manner, starting with the energy sector as an entry point. A primary aim is to demon-
                                     strate the importance of combined energy and water modeling, planning, manage-
                                     ment, and decision making and to develop practical methodologies that can be applied
                                     to operational tools. This report presents the results from the development of a new
                                     water and energy modeling tool to support integrated decision making in South Africa
                                     and offers a proof of concept for the integration of energy and water planning tools.
                                     The results are presented as a first step toward understanding the implications of inte-
                                     grated water-energy modeling and are not intended as a definitive policy study, which
                                     would require more rigorous sensitivity analysis. Nevertheless, the findings presented
                                     here should be of great interest to policy makers.
                                        South Africa represents an ideal case study of the challenges that the Thirsty Energy
                                     initiative is designed to address. South Africa is a water-stressed country that is also
                                     experiencing a crisis of electricity supply. The sustainability of water and energy sup-
                                     plies is uncertain, as is the impact of shortages on social well-being, the national
                                     economy, and the environment, particularly in the context of climate change. Fully
                                     ­
                                     understanding the contours of the water-energy nexus is therefore particularly relevant
                                     for South Africa.
                                        In contrast to many other developing countries, South Africa has long had pro-
                                     cesses for long-term planning related to the supply of energy and water. Planning
                                     for one has historically taken into account the cost and scarcity of the other, though
                                     to varying degrees. For example, the state-owned utility, Eskom, has a policy known
                                     as “zero liquid-­
                                                     effluent discharge” and has made significant historical investments in
                                     dry cooling for coal-fired power plants and plans to use dry cooling for all future
                                     plants. Additionally, the National Water Resources Strategy and other water resources
                                     planning studies consider the future water needs of the power sector. This has
                                     resulted in the development of an integrated system of large dams and interbasin
                                     transfers to ensure a reliable water supply to the energy sector (among others). The
                                     South African situation therefore provided a unique opportunity for the Thirsty
                                     Energy Initiative to develop and demonstrate methodologies for integrated water-
                                     energy planning.




2  Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus   Overview
Overview of the Modeling Methodology
This case study is the first time the cost of water supply has been assessed in a sectorwide
energy supply expansion plan.1 By documenting the methodology, the authors aim to help
energy sector planners and modelers properly incorporate water constraints in their work.
    The South African TIMES model (SATIM),2 a public domain energy systems model
developed by the University of Cape Town’s Energy Research Centre (ERC), was
selected as the basis for the development of a water-smart energy planning tool as an
important first step towards an integrated water-energy planning methodology. SATIM
is a national model built using the TIMES modeling platform, a partial-equilibrium lin-
ear optimization framework capable of representing an entire energy system, including
its economic costs and emissions.
   The South Africa case study presented in this report documents the development
of a “water smart” version of SATIM (SATIM-W), depicted in figure O.1, in which the
water needs of the energy sector and the options available to meet those needs (bulk
water infrastructure and alternative sources such as desalination) are represented by
information derived from a detailed water-basin model. The wealth of water-planning
datasets and cost curves available from South Africa’s Department of Water and
Sanitation (formerly the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry) and supported
by local water modeling experts serve as the main data source on water for this
purpose.
   A key feature of the developed SATIM-W model is that it regionalizes power genera-
tion, refining, and energy resource supply, thereby introducing a spatial dimension to
the water demands of the energy sector. It also contains a regionalized structure of the
basins and delivery infrastructure that would be required to supply the energy sector
and assesses the impact of meeting those needs on the cost of supplying water.
   Given that virtually all water in South Africa is allocated, any future demand for water in
the energy sector will require new water infrastructure. SATIM-W tracks regional water
demands and the need for new regional water infrastructure, including interregional
exchange possibilities, to better understand the impact of water supply costs on the energy

both energy and water supply. Because the planning, design, and construction of infrastruc-
ture requires long term engagement, the results from such a planning exercise can help to
ensure the timely planning of investments for the delivery of water to the energy sector.

                                     •	 Is the current policy of dry cooling for new coal-fired power plants economically justified?
                                     •	 How do stricter environmental controls affect coal investments in the Waterberg region?
                                     •	 How does a dry climate affect coal investments in the Waterberg region?
                                     •	 How does the cost of water affect shale gas production?
                                     •	 In a carbon-constrained world, what is the likelihood of stranded assets?
                                     •	 Why does SATIM-W select concentrating solar power (CSP) with wet cooling in the

4  Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus   Overview
Initial Findings on the Water-Energy Nexus
This case study has yielded some important general findings on the broader impacts of
modeling the water-energy nexus. They point to the potential benefits of further devel-
opment of the SATIM-W model and of the concept of the water-energy nexus as a criti-
cal consideration in planning.




General Findings
The most important message of the report is that taking into account the regional vari-
ability of water supply and the associated costs of water supply infrastructure has a
very significant impact on the optimal mix of energy technologies and on greater effi-
ciency and sustainability in water use.
   Taking into account the regional variability and the associated costs of water supply
infrastructure yields suggestions for optimal energy technology investments that are
different from the results reached when variability and costs are not included or when
an average water supply cost is applied to all energy technologies irrespective of
where they are located and regardless of likely water supply options.
   Energy sector policies can have significant implications for investments in water
supply infrastructure and can lead to stranded water supply investments—and vice
versa. However, if decision makers plan in a more integrated manner they can ensure
the robustness of water supply for energy and for other water users, thus maximizing
the value of both energy and water infrastructure investments.
   Accounting for the differences in the costs of the physical infrastructure necessary
to provide water for energy in different regions of the country better integrates water
and energy planning and decision making. However, other aspects of the water-energy
nexus remain unaddressed. These include the harder-to-quantify aspects of the value
of water in a particular region, among them potential conflicts between water uses,
opportunity costs from other sectors, and effects on water quality. Further investiga-
tion is needed to know how planning tools can best account for these aspects.
  Water system planning models (generally at the basin level) can provide data on the
costs and availability of specific water supply and infrastructure options. These can be
explicitly represented in a water-smart national energy system model to derive water
supply cost curves that can impact decisions on energy production.
   In terms of modeling the water-energy nexus, this case study demonstrates that a
national-level energy systems optimization model can be regionalized in terms of
energy resource supply and power plant locations, and the regional costs and limita-
tions for water supply infrastructure can be incorporated to create a water-smart plan-
ning tool. The process used for the South Africa model can be adapted to other national
energy system planning models.3

                                        It is clear that the effects of climate change and climate-related policies will have a
                                     significant impact on both water and energy planning, so they must be taken into
                                     account in plans that purport to address the water-energy nexus.



                                     Findings for South Africa
                                     The following findings of this report are specific to the water-energy nexus in
                                     South Africa. They are discussed with reference to specific SATIM-W model scenarios
                                     constructed around policy options and investment decisions in both energy and water
                                     supply. Thus the findings are primarily illustrative and serve to showcase how
                                     SATIM-W can be used to inform policy formulation and decision-making for the energy
                                     sector with consideration of the impacts of water supply costs.

6  Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus   Overview
             The commissioning of dry-cooled rather than wet-cooled coal-fired power
             stations appears economically justified when taking into account future
             water infrastructure supply costs
             Even in water-scarce countries such as South Africa, wet-cooled power stations are
             often considered to be more cost effective than dry-cooled power stations owing to
             their lower investment costs and higher net generation efficiency. However, when
             regional water costs are taken fully into account (as under the SATIM-W Reference
             scenario with water costs), dry-cooled power stations yield the optimal cost solution
             for South Africa.
                Even though it increases the cost of electricity from coal power plants, Eskom’s
             dry cooling policy is really in the economic interests of the country. As shown in

                                     1.65 l/kwH by 2050 based on the Reference (No Water Cost) scenario, or 0.5 l/kWh
                                     based on the Reference (Water Cost). In the Reference (Water Cost) scenario, the
                                     power sector’s cumulative water consumption for 2010–50 drops by 9,338 Mm3
                                     (77.34 percent) with just a modest increase (0.84 percent) in the total discounted
                                     energy system cost.4
                                        The Waterberg region provides a good example of the importance of accounting for
                                     water cost in energy planning and highlights the specific regional challenges of the
                                     water-energy nexus. In Waterberg, the energy sector is the largest water user, with
                                     power plants accounting for the largest share. If water costs were not taken into
                                     account in energy-system planning through 2050, water consumption would rise from
                                     45 Mm3 in 2015 to almost 900 Mm3 by 2050, with power plants approaching 80 percent
                                     of the ttal water consumption in the region. Under the contrary scenario, by contrast,
                                     power plant water consumption5 drops to less than 100 Mm3 by 2050 and total water
                                     consumption in the region is about 250 Mm3.
                                        Other than the water consumed by power plants, the two Reference scenarios have
                                     similar total system cost, energy supply expenditures, and primary and final energy
                                     consumption results.
                                         Interestingly, the Reference scenario with water costs produces slightly more CO2
                                     emissions than the scenario without water costs, despite generating 1.3 percent less
                                     electricity with coal and 2 percent more with renewable energy (RE) technologies,
                                     chiefly wind and solar photovoltaics (PV), which require no water to generate electric-
                                     ity. The higher CO2 emissions stem from the higher unit emissions of dry-cooled
                                     coal plants.
                                        The increase in total system cost for the Reference scenario with water costs is
                                     only 1.1 percent because of the relatively small share of water supply infrastructure
                                     costs compared with all other investments and expenditures for energy in the supply
                                     and demand sectors. Investment costs for water supply infrastructure account for
                                     40 percent of the increase, while water system supply and operating costs account
                                     for the remaining 60 percent.
                                        The water intensity of the power sector under other scenarios is close to the inten-
                                     sity level generated by the Reference scenario with water costs (figure O.3), except in
                                     the case of the scenarios based on targets for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-
                                     sions, where the model favors use of some CSP plants using wet cooling for reasons
                                     explained in the last finding presented in this section.

                                        The total discounted energy system cost is the sum of the present value of all energy system investments

             Stricter environmental controls (Environmental Compliance scenario) reduce investment
             in coal-based energy supply and associated water supply infrastructure in the Lephalale
             area of Limpopo province, as current emissions regulations requiring flue gas desulfuriza-
             tion (FGD) for existing coal power plants and new coal-to-liquids (CTL) plants prove to be a
             major investment disincentive. This scenario accelerates the retirement of the existing coal
             plants starting in 2030, with more solar PV coming online to replace it. It also results in a
             significant reduction in new CTL plant capacity, compared with the Reference (Water Cost)
             scenario. This leads to higher imports of petroleum products and a deferment of new
             water supply schemes in Waterberg that were driven mainly by water demand from CTL
             plants. Postponement of those schemes could have a wider impact on economic develop-
             ment in the area, such as new mines and industries that would also depend on the new
             water supply infrastructure.
               The result of this scenario again highlights the importance of looking at the water-
             energy nexus to avoid suboptimal or even misguided investments in one sector or
             another. In this scenario, the cumulative (2010–50) demand of water for power plants




                                                                    Overview        Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus  9
                                      increases by 2.34 percent, in part given the extra water needed for the FGD systems.
                                      However, the water needs of the whole energy sector drop by 1.59 percent in this sce-
                                      nario because new CTL plants are not built and, as a result, less coal is mined.
                                        On the other hand, requiring existing power stations to retrofit with FGD sys-
                                      tems has little impact on the Upper Vaal and Olifants water supply schemes. This is
                                      because non-energy water requirements are the main drivers of investment in
                                      water infrastructure in this region, where most existing coal power plants are located.
                                          Future water supply schemes commissioned under the Reference (Water Cost) sce-
                                      nario appear sufficient to also meet demand generated by the FGD retrofits required
                                      for to meet current regulations to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions for existing coal-
                                      fired power plants in the Upper Vaal and Olifants water management areas. The
                                      Reference (Water Cost) scenario adds a new water supply scheme in 2020, which is
                                      more than adequate to provide the relatively small amount of water needed for FGD
                                      systems in the Olifants region, where most existing power plants are located.
                                         On the other hand, the demand for water for FGD systems for new power plants in
                                      the Waterberg region would trigger the need for new water infrastructure and justify
                                      the development of a new pipeline to the area.
                                         Requiring all power plants to incorporate FGD systems could increase water con-
                                      sumption by the power sector by 65 million cubic meters per year (a 0.6 percent
                                      increase). However, it would have a positive impact on the environment.6




                                      The waterberg region is the region where the water-energy
                                      nexus is most evident and critical
                                      In the Waterberg region, a large share of water goes to the energy sector. Under the
                                      Reference (Water Cost) scenario, water consumption by power plants will account for
                                      about 40 percent of all demand in 2050, whereas coal mines consume about 25 percent
                                      and CTL plants and non-energy uses consume equal shares of the remaining
                                      35 percent. Given that all energy sector uses account for more than 80 percent of the
                                      water demand in the region (figure O.4), it is no surprise that the region is sensitive to
                                      energy policy changes. A deep dive in this particular region may be justified in future
                                      work, particular as significant concerns surround the impacts of energy-related water
                                      consumption on agriculture production and tourism.
                                          Declining water quality in the Waterberg region threatens expansion of the energy
                                      sector and would result in increased investments in RE technologies elsewhere. The
                                      extent to which new power plants and CTL production occur in the Waterberg region
                                      are shown by the model to be significantly affected by the cost of treating low-quality
                                      water. As water quality drops (because of rising salinity or contamination with indus-
                                      trial pollutants), the increased costs of treating that water become more substantial,

                                         For this initial study, only wet FGD systems were modeled (see Appendix H), the cost of waste disposal and
                                      sorbent still needs to be incorporated in the model, and the total increase in costs for the system need to be fur-

                                   Quality scenario the increased cost of treatment associated with lower-water quality
                                   results in a decrease in capacity of new coal power plants of approximately 7 GW
                                   (16 percent of total capacity) by 2050 compared with the Reference (Water Cost) sce-
                                   nario. To replace it, an additional 9 GW of RE capacity is built (solar thermal and solar

                                      to balance the system load for the higher levels of RE. Similarly, when the water quality
                                      cost is internalized, there is a 20 percent reduction (approximately 100 PJ/year or
                                      60 thousand barrels a day) in new CTL capacity by 2050, resulting in increased imports
                                      of refined oil products.




                                      Shale gas appears to be quite attractive for electricity generation but
                                      will require investment in additional water supply infrastructure for
                                      major development and careful consideration of broader water-
                                      related risks
                                      While current world prices for oil and gas may deter exploitation of shale gas in
                                      South Africa, SATIM-W looks at long-term trends. Shale gas production starts in 2025
                                      at about 111 PJ and rises to 582 PJ in 2050 under Reference conditions. However, with
                                      climate change policies, shale gas production ramps up to more than 735 PJ. Given the
                                      energy-security benefits of domestic production, shale gas will most certainly receive
                                      further consideration as a way to diversify South Africa’s energy mix, while decreasing
                                      its GHG emissions, but this will require careful consideration of the water-energy nexus
                                      and broader social and ecological impacts.
                                         Using the limited data available, the model suggests that the use of shale gas for
                                      power generation under the Shale Gas scenario will grow at a similar rate once the
                                      costs of supplying water are taken into account. In other words, the cost of water
                                      (which was only partially modeled in this case study due to lack of data) does not
                                      appear to be the main driver of decisions about whether to invest in shale gas to gen-
                                      erate power. However, regional water supply costs could potentially double in certain
                                      regions because of demand from shale gas production, thereby affecting not only the
                                      producers but other water users as well through lowering of the groundwater table
                                      and increased risks for surface and groundwater pollution.
                                         Under the modeled scenario, an assumed limit on on-site groundwater usage of
                                      1 Mm3/year (see section 6) leads to a reliance on trucked water for in the early
                                      stages of development for the shale gas sector, resulting in relatively high water
                                      supply cost. However, the construction of a pipeline in 2030 to bring water into the
                                      shale production area reduces the cost of supply by about 95 percent, and this
                                      assumed lower cost accelerates shale gas development. In this scenario, cumulative
                                      water consumption of the power sector between 2010 and 2050 decreases by
                                      14.9 percent, as given that coal power plants are replaced by CCGTs, which con-
                                      sume less water. Cumulative water needs for the overall energy sector also decrease
                                      by 9.76 percent.
                                         However, it is important to note that, because of a lack of data for South Africa, in
                                      this preliminary analysis the potential costs of (a) treatment and disposal of return-
                                      flow effluent (which will further increase production costs) and (b) distribution or
                                      delivery of water supply are not fully reflected in the model. That is, the model consid-
                                      ered only a high level estimate of the bulk water supply to the region and did not
                                      account for the significant cost of distributing the water to individual wells.




12  Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus   Overview
When these considerations are fully incorporated and modeled, the water implica-
tions for shale gas extraction and utilization may vary from the results reflected in this
analysis.




Policies limiting carbon emissions may strand some water-energy
infrastructure but could make water available (at higher cost) for other
users if planned accordingly
The model indicates, not surprisingly, that coal-fired and CTL generation would be
directly affected by a cumulative carbon cap on energy emissions by 2050. A 10 Gt limit
would reduce CTL output dramatically, resulting in an increased reliance on imported
refined petroleum products, which would replace 80 percent of existing CTL production
by 2025. The remainder of the lost CTL production comes from increased production in
existing refineries. Although a 14 Gt limit allows the existing CTL facility to operate at full
capacity until 2025, there still is an increase in imports of finished petroleum products
owing to a lack of investment in new CTL capacity in the Waterberg region. In contrast,
the existing and planned coal power plants are less at risk under the 14 Gt limit, as these
coal assets remain operational for their entire production life, although no new coal
power plants would be commissioned under this scenario. In contrast, a 10 Gt limit
would reduce the operating life of the committed coal-fired power plants by at least
15 years, with decommissioning occurring by 2035. Their capacity would be replaced
by new nuclear plants. In addition, the 10 Gt limit shifts electricity production from the
Waterberg to the Orange River region, where the model calls for CSP technology instead.
   Both CO2 Cap scenarios also affect investment in water supply infrastructure in the
Waterberg region, since the region’s coal-based energy sector provides much of the
funding for the water infrastructure. If the sector’s water demands are greatly
reduced, the associated water infrastructure may not be built. As water demand from
non-energy sectors grows in this region, however, the missing investment from the
power sector pushes up the costs of water supply by 2035. Meanwhile, other users
have access to additional water, since the existing supply capacity is underutilized. This
again points out the connections between the energy sector’s water needs and appro-
priate sizing and timing for the associated infrastructure.
   Interestingly, both CO2 Cap scenarios increase the cumulative (2010–50) water needs
of the power sector significantly (by 21 percent and 25 percent). This occurs because
the model chooses wet-cooled CSP as the replacement for coal. However, the water
needs of the energy sector as a whole increase by just 4 percent and 3 percent, given
the decrease of activity in the coal industry (coal mining, CTLs) as the CO2 caps kick in.
   Figure O.5 depicts projected GHG emissions under various policy scenarios, includ-
ing the two CO2 Cap scenarios. Because the Reference scenario already includes
demand-side improvements in energy efficiency, the other scenarios examined show
only small changes from the Reference scenario. The shale gas scenario shows some
temporary reductions, but these rebound after 2040 and by 2050 are close to the
Reference value.

                                      system creates some resilience to the impact of climate change,
                                      but increasing temperatures may affect the efficiency of
                                      dry-cooled systems
                                      Projected changes in regional climate (reduced water availability and increased
                                      ambient temperature) are expected to shape investment in energy and water supply,
                                      compounding the effects of a policy limiting carbon emissions. Under the Dry
                                      Climate scenario, increases in water demand traceable to the warmer and drier cli-
                                      mate expected from 2030 will trigger faster and larger investments in water infra-
                                      structure, which will raise the average cost of water supply. However, the ability to
                                      meet demand will not be not strongly affected, owing to South Africa’s integrated
                                      water supply network, which enables the transfer of water from areas of high rainfall
                                      (such as Lesotho) or substantial urban return flows (such as Johannesburg) to water-
                                      scarce regions such as the Waterberg. On the other hand, rising temperatures may
                                      affect the efficiency of future dry-cooled coal and CSP plants and increase demand
                                      for water in older, wet-cooled plants, a possibility that was not factored into this
                                      analysis (see section 4). Further analysis of the effects of climate change on the
                                      water-energy nexus is required.




14  Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus   Overview
The development of csp in the arid orange river region does not appear
to be constrained by water supply, given the small share of the energy
sector in the region’s water consumption
A valuable insight gained from combining the CO2 Cap and Dry Climate scenarios is that
expansion of CSP capacity in the region supplied by the Orange River system does not
appear to be constrained by water supply, despite being an arid region generally. This is
because the bulk of the water comes from the highlands of Lesotho. Here, wet cooling
is initially favored even in the Reference (Water cost) scenario. A significant shift to dry
cooling occurs only after 2040, when the effects of climate change are compounded by
the added pressure of a dry climate or by the development of shale gas in the region.
   SATIM-W selects wet-cooled CSP in the Reference (Water Cost) scenario and also in
the CO2 Cap scenarios. However, in the combined Dry and 10 Gt CO2 Cap scenarios the
model selects dry-cooled CSP    . Lower water demand under the combined scenario rela-
tive to the Reference scenario is accompanied by a rise in water costs. This increased
cost is sufficient to have the CSP plants switch from wet-cooled to dry-cooled
technology.
   SATIM-W’s choice of wet-cooled CSP in the Reference (Water Cost) scenario appears
to reflect the small effect of CSP’s water demand on the region’s marginal supply costs
of water. Water demand in this region is dominated by non-energy demands, particu-
larly agriculture and a large interbasin transfer, which means that a significant water
supply scheme will have to be built regardless of changes in energy technology.
However, the cost of water from this supply scheme increases when dry-cooled CSP is
selected, because the investment cost must be amortized over a smaller base of users.
This suggests that the increased cost of water, not the scarcity of water in the region, is
a determinant in the choice of technology.
   The foregoing results demonstrate the value of the SATIM-W model as a component
of an integrated assessment methodology that can better inform decision makers of
the potential costs, benefits, and risks of alternative policies and technology choices
under a range of possible future conditions. In particular, the results demonstrate the
possibility of identifying major investments that could become stranded down the road.
Employing an integrated planning approach that looks systematically at the develop-
ment of both the water and energy sectors could help avoid such costly and unproduc-
tive outcomes.
   The SATIM-W model described in this report is an important first step toward an
integrated approach to water-energy planning, one in which trade-offs, synergies, and
opportunities are assessed together. The model’s initial applications, as described here,
have clearly demonstrated the importance and value of employing an integrated plan-
ning platform to ensure that water and energy investments are intelligently planned in
a least-cost manner. The comprehensive approach made possible by SATIM-W should
be further developed so that it becomes the norm in policy formulation. This will be
particularly important as countries determine how their GHG reduction commitments
will be realized in a way that contributes directly to achieving related Sustainable
Development Goals.

01
     Why the
     Water-
     Energy
     Nexus and
     Why South
     Africa?
                                         Water is a finite, vulnerable and essential resource, essential to sustain life, development
                                         and the environment.                                                  (Bates and others 2009)

                                         Energy, to be sure, is only one of the fundamental issues that challenge us. But if we don’t
                                         get energy right the other issues will be insoluble.                        (Patterson 2007)


                                      Vital for life, water and energy are critical aspects of any economy. They also are tightly
                                      entwined: access to one often depends on availability of the other, and the infrastruc-
                                      ture required to supply us with both resources is interconnected. Yet despite the strong
                                      interdependence of the two sectors, they are often managed independently (Hussey
                                      and Pittock 2012). Only an integrated approach to the links between the two sectors can
                                      yield national policies and regulations that will permit economic growth to proceed in
                                      a sustainable way (Bazilian and others 2011; Rodriguez and others 2013).
                                         In many places around the world, the energy required to meet water supply needs is
                                      significant and growing. In the United States, the state of California receives 30 percent
                                      of its water supply from groundwater sources. Demand for electricity to pump that
                                      groundwater during the summer is greater than the energy needed to power all other
                                      water conveyance systems combined (Bennett and Park 2010). In northern India, farm-
                                      ers abstract groundwater using heavily subsidized electricity, resulting in a vicious
                                      cycle of electricity demand and water scarcity as the water table drops and groundwa-
                                      ter must be pumped up from greater depths (IAEA 2009). In the Middle East and North
                                      Africa, desalinized sea water is an important source of potable wate for the region.
                                      However, it is produced using energy-intensive processes (Cooley 2011). Desalination
                                      technology is expanding to other regions as well. In China, vast quantities of water are
                                      moved from the country’s water-abundant south to the drier, energy-intensive north
                                      (DUT 2004), with the associated large energy needs to transport the water.
                                         Weather and climate change are affecting energy production. In the United States,
                                      the Brown’s Ferry Nuclear Power Plant on the Tennessee River (which uses once-
                                      through cooling), often experiences warm river flows. At such times, the temperature
                                      of the water at the plant’s cooling intakes approaches or exceeds the Alabama water-
                                      quality criterion (US DoE 2006; NRC 2012), requiring the plant to shut down.
                                         In 2013, all six units of the 1,130 MW Parli thermal power plant in Maharashtra,
                                      India, were shut down because of severe water scarcity across the Marathwada region,
                                      which caused the basin behind the Khadka dam supplying the plant to “almost dry up”
                                      (Rajput 2013). The economic damage was estimated at $4 billion.
                                          Ultimately the costs of water constraints on power are passed to consumers. In
                                      2010, the reduced availability of the Brown’s Ferry plant cost customers of the
                                      Tennessee Valley Authority $50 million (Ingram and others 2013). The cooling systems
                                      of the Brown’s Ferry, Sequoyah, and Vermont Yankee nuclear plants have recently been
                                      equipped with supplemental cooling towers to reduce outlet temperatures in the sum-
                                      mer months (NRC 2012)—at a further cost to customers. In Germany, “electricity price
                                      is significantly impacted by both a change in river temperatures and the relative abun-
                                      dance of river water” (McDermott and Nilsen 2012).
                                         In many parts of the world, growing demand, deteriorating water quality, and cli-
                                      mate change have combined to make usable water scarcer, posing a threat to energy
                                      production (WEC 2010). Similarly, growing demand for water requires investment in

more energy-intensive technologies such as interbasin transfers, desalination, and
rehabilitation and reuse of waste water (Hussey and Pittock 2012), all of which
increase demand for energy (and for the water needed to produce it). Unless these
additional demands can be met through alternative energy options, the increasing
energy demands will result in increased production of greenhouse gases (GHG), fur-
ther contributing to the problem of climate change and potentially worsening water
shortages.




Thirsty Energy: Toward Integrated Planning
for the Global Water-Energy Nexus
This networked system of resource trade-offs is known as the water-energy nexus—a
critical part of the larger “sustainability nexus” that includes food as well. Indeed, the
interconnected nature of energy and water supply infrastructure, the great uncertainty
associated with future water supply and energy needs in the light of climate change,
and the pressure on both energy and water to support (rapid) economic growth, partic-
ularly in less developed countries demands that an integrated approach be taken to
ensure optimal strategic water-energy resource planning. Recognizing the challenge it
poses, the World Bank has embarked on Thirsty Energy, an initiative designed to bring
together specialists in water and energy in key developing countries to explore
advanced approaches to integrated water-energy planning and to demonstrate the pol-
icy relevance of the analysis and findings emerging from those approaches.
   Launched in January 2014, Thirsty Energy helps countries integrate water constraints
into their energy sector planning and better address other water and energy challenges.
Under this initiative, the World Bank selected South Africa for its initial work to demon-
strate the importance of combined approaches to water and energy planning, develop-
ment and management, along with analytical methodologies that can be applied to
better inform coordinated decision-making in both realms. Investigating the signifi-
cance of water-energy linkages and how they affect water and energy planning requires
that energy-system models take water costs and constraints into account and, similarly,
that water supply models take full account of energy considerations. This report exam-
ines the impacts of including water supply and infrastructure costs into an energy plan-
ning model to support integrated decision making in one country—South Africa—and
offers a proof of concept for the integration of energy and water planning tools. The
results are presented as a first step toward understanding the implications of integrated
water-energy modeling and are not intended as a definitive policy study, which would
require more rigorous sensitivity analysis. Nevertheless, the findings presented here
should be of great interest to policy makers.
   This report documents the development of a “water smart” SATIM model (SATIM-W)
in which water supply and bulk infrastructure options are represented in relation to
energy infrastructure. The model is based on the wealth of water-related planning and

                                      Example of the Water-Energy Nexus
                                      South Africa is struggling to achieve an ambitious development agenda (box 1.1).
                                      Presently, it is consuming its resources in an unsustainable and emissions-intensive
                                      manner using aging infrastructure (Coetzer 2012; Gaunt 2010). Power shortages in
                                      2007–08 had a direct impact on economic growth (Eberhard 2008), and current short-
                                      ages of electricity are likely to have similar economic consequences (NERSA 2015b).
                                      The dilemma of planning for economic growth in an energy-constrained environment
                                      is exacerbated by the prospect of shortages of water. In the country’s economic and
                                      industrial heart, referred to as the Vaal Triangle, industry has expressed concern that a

             economic growth in a large portion of the world, including South Africa. GDP growth has
             averaged 1.9 percent since 2008, a value significantly below the development goals set out
             in the National Development Plan 2030, which specifies 5 percent per year (NDP 2012). The
             National Development Plan was drafted by the National Planning Commission and offers a
             long-term perspective on the future of South Africa. It envisages a desired destination and
             identifies the role different agents in the economy should play to achieve the end goal of
             eliminating poverty and reducing inequality by 2030.
                 Projections of growth for beyond 2014 have continuously been revised downward
             (standing at 2.1 percent for 2015; IMF WEO 2015), which is typically attributed to continued
             labor unrest and low global commodities prices, as well as slow growth in key trading part-
             ners and power shortages. In the short- to medium-term, GDP growth rates are projected
             to change very little, with projections to 2030 ranging from 2.5 to 4 percent (Merven and
             others 2015).
                 The South African population was 52 million people in 2011 (StatsSA 2011 Census), with
             60 percent living in urban areas (NPC 2011b). The population grew 21 percent between the
             1996 and 2011 censuses, and the National Development Plan identifies rapid urbanization
             as a major challenge: South Africa will need to make provision for eight million new urban
             residents by 2030 (NPC 2011b). Population growth—used in the model that is the subject of
             this report as a driver for a number of energy services, including passenger transport and
             household demand—is based on recently developed country-specific probabilistic popula-
             tion projections from the United Nations Population Division (Raftery and others 2012).
                 Throughout the twentieth century the South African economy shifted from a primarily
             rural, agricultural economy, to an urban, industrial one. This shift was initially based on
             mining, followed by a transition to an energy-intensive, minerals-based industrialized econ-
             omy based on coal and imported crude oil. Over the past 20 years, South Africa has been
             steadily transitioning toward an economy dominated by the tertiary sector, which has
             increased from 57 percent of GDP in 1984 to 70 percent of GDP today (Altieri and others
             2015).
                 From a sectoral perspective, the agricultural sector is unlikely to grow, partially because
             of water shortages. Mining activities, which dominate the secondary sector, face strong
             pressure from unions and uncertain government policies as well as global price fluctuation.
             However, as discussed below, the potential for shale gas exploration and development
             could result in a boost to the secondary sector.




          And, increasingly, the uncertainties introduced by global climate change further com-
          plicate the picture. To ensure that South Africa’s growth aspirations remain viable, coor-
          dinated planning of the supply and use of energy and water is essential.
             South Africa has processes for planning the infrastructure needed to supply both
          energy and water under the auspices of the Department of Energy and Department of
          Water and Sanitation, respectively. Planning for each resource has, to varying degrees,
          taken into account the cost and scarcity of the other, but modeling of the

                            Why the Water-Energy Nexus and Why South Africa?
                                      infrastructure of both systems has not yet been integrated. Eskom already has a policy
                                      of “zero liquid-effluent discharge”; it has made a historical investment in dry-cooling
                                      for thermal plants and embraced a policy of dry cooling for all future plants. South
                                      Africa is therefore uniquely positioned as a candidate for the Thirsty Energy Initiative to
                                      develop and demonstrate integrated water-energy planning.
                                         Energy demand forecasts rely heavily on assumed projections of growth of gross
                                      domestic product (GDP), including the relative contribution of primary, secondary, and
                                      tertiary sectors to that growth, along with population growth and improvements in
                                      energy intensity. The compounding effect of GDP and population drivers over a long
                                      planning horizon can have a very significant effect on energy demand. Economic sec-
                                      tors vary markedly in their energy intensity of GDP (metals processing is high, for
                                      example, and the services sector low), so understanding an economy’s evolving struc-
                                      ture is important to understanding future energy demand.
                                         The current update to the Integrated Resource Plan (DoE 2013) assumes GDP growth
                                      rates of 2.9 to 5.4 percent, resulting in a range of annual average electricity demand
                                      increases of 1.3 to 2.8 percent, depending on assumptions about energy efficiency.
                                      Currently, demand for electricity exceeds supply, resulting in planned load shedding,
                                      which hinders economic growth. The commissioning of two new coal-fired power sta-
                                      tions at Medupi and Kusile over the next few years will provide sufficient capacity to
                                      reduce load shedding.
                                         The water demands for electricity generation in South Africa are well documented
                                      by Eskom, the primary South African electric utility (Eskom 2008; SEI 2012). South
                                      Africa’s Integrated Resource Plan2 includes water availability as a criterion in assessing
                                      power-generation alternatives. In addition, the country’s generalized water scarcity
                                      was the main driver of Eskom’s decision to stop building wet-cooled coal power plants.
                                      Dry-cooling systems reduce by up to 90 percent the amount of water consumed by a
                                      power plant; however, they reduce the plant’s efficiency. The decision to shift to dry
                                      cooling reflected the utility’s social obligation not to shrink unduly the supply of water
                                      available for other uses, including the environment.

     Water in
     South Africa
                                      South Africa is a water-scarce country. Annual availability of fresh water is less than
                                      1,000 m3 per capita, compared with 4,000 m3 per capita or more in countries with
                                      abundant water resources. With average rainfall of about 450 mm/year (the world aver-
                                      age is 860 mm/year) and uneven distribution of water resources (DWAF 2004), South
                                      Africa has an annual mean runoff value of only 40 mm per capita, one-seventh of the
                                      global average of 260 mm, and rainfall and river flow are seasonal and highly variable.
                                      An indicator of the regional diversity of water supply is that about 20 percent of the
                                      country produces 70 percent of the runoff (CSIR 2012).
                                         In South Africa, as in many other developing countries, agriculture accounts for
                                      the largest share of water withdrawals (at about 60 percent of the total), followed
                                      by households (27 percent) industry (about 7.5 percent, including the power and
                                      ­
                                      mining sectors) and other (about 5.5 percent) (DWAF   , 2004). Water for power genera-
                                      tion, which represents about 2.5 percent of all water use in the country, is considered
                                      a strategic use and therefore is supplied at a very high level of assurance. The share
                                      of water allocated to the energy sector differs widely from region to region; for exam-
                                      ple, 23 percent of the water in the Olifants catchment goes to supply the coal-fired
                                      power stations in the region. The energy sector accounts for up to 54 percent of
                                      future water demand in the Lephalale area, largely because of planned development
                                      of new coal-fired power stations and other industries.
                                         Most of South Africa’s key economic centers, including the urban and industrial
                                      center of Gauteng and key mining areas and power stations, are located in areas of
                                      low water availability far from major water sources. As a result, local demand exceeds
                                      local supply. However, South Africa has a highly integrated bulk water supply system
                                      that includes large dams and many interbasin transfers to balance supply and demand
                                      (map 2.1). Given the complexity of water-resource management in South Africa, it is
                                      not surprising that the country has the most large dams in Africa and the eighth-­
                                      highest number of large dams globally (ICOLD 2015).
                                         Management of water resources is overseen by the Department of Water and
                                      Sanitation (DWS), formerly known as the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry.
                                      Water management areas (WMA) are administrative regions established by DWS to
                                      decentralize administration of water resources to the catchment level. The boundaries
                                      of WMAs do not necessarily align with provincial borders or catchment basins. There
                                      are 19 WMAs (shown clearly in map 2.2), but consolidation will soon reduce their num-
                                      ber to nine. For example, the Upper Vaal will be combined with the Middle and Lower
                                      into the Vaal WMA (DWAF 2009).
                                         Water resources are managed by the DWS in conjunction with municipalities. The
                                      DWS periodically conducts assessments to reconcile supply and demand using fore-
                                      casted growth in demand and constraints in supply to determine available manage-
                                      ment options. In a manner similar to the national transmission and distribution of
                                      electricity, interbasin water transfers mitigate regional supply constraints and have

                                      Water for Energy
                                      Demand for water varies greatly by region. For example, in the Waterberg coal region of
                                      Limpopo province, demand is dominated by the dry-cooled Matimba coal-fired power
                                      station (4.3 million m3 annually) and its supplier, the Grootgeluk coal mine, which uses
                                      water to wash coal (9.9 million m3 annually). Together these two demands account for
                                      approximately 40 percent of current water withdrawals in the district. Energy sector with-
                                      drawals may grow to 75 percent by the year 2030 if further developments in coal-based
                                      energy supply are pursued (Aurecon 2014). Approximately 20 percent of current water
                                      withdrawals in the Waterberg region are directly attributed to electricity generation,
                                      much higher than the national water balance, where the electricity sector accounts for
                                      approximately 2 percent of total water withdrawals (DWAF 2012). Given Eskom’s policy
                                                     effluent discharge, energy sector withdrawals equal consumption (that is,
                                      of zero liquid-­
                                      no water is returned to the water body).
                                         The water supply infrastructure in each WMA is highly localized and distinct. It
                                      includes the civil engineering undertaken to implement water supply systems that




26  Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus   Section 2
                                      Water in South Africa
            cater to multiple users across economic sectors. The supply systems typically com-
            prise multiple schemes that may span multiple WMAs. Schemes are an amalgam of
            discrete projects, such as an interbasin transfer for providing additional water to a
            water supply system.
               The term water supply region (WSR) is used in this study to refer to a geographic
            region of interest for purposes of the study, rather than a formal or legal entity. Five
            WSRs (A,B,C,D and R) were identified after an assessment of the locations of the
            energy resources in South Africa (discussed in section 3) and with consideration of sit-
            ing requirements for the power and refining sectors. The regions are shown in map 2.2,
            and the resources found in those regions are identified in table 2.1. A more detailed
            discussion of the selection of these WSRs is found in section 5.
                Each WSR is serviced by an integrated supply network or system that may span more
            than one WMA and consist of multiple schemes, each of which contributes to the total sup-
            ply system for that region. For example, the Vaal River Eastern Subsystem, a subsystem of
            the integrated Vaal River system, supplies water to users in the Upper Vaal, Olifants, and,
            in future, Limpopo WMAs. An example of the distinction between WMA and WSR is that
            shale gas mining and concentrated solar power generation may occur in the same WMA
            but incur different water costs because they will likely be supplied by different WSRs.

                                      Vaal System, the Waterberg region, the Mokolo Dam/Crocodile West System, and the
                                      Orange River System. The power stations built since 2013 under the Renewable Energy
                                      Independent Power Producer Programme or planned for development through 2021 are
                                      shown in table 2.2, together with their likely location, WMA, and primary water source.

   Generation sites were a key consideration in developing the South African TIMES
water-smart (SATIM-W) model because the energy-only version of the model was not
regionally disaggregated. To be water-smart, the model first had to be disaggregated
into regions aligned with the WMAs because water issues are consummately local
and because the cost of supplying water to an energy site depends on its location.
The locations for new generation shown in table 2.2 reflect the fact that resources for
power generation are regionally concentrated, with future coal reserves within the
Olifants and Limpopo WMAs and the best solar resources in the Lower Orange WMA.
Wind resources, by contrast, are far more distributed, but because wind power is a
marginal consumer of water plant locations have an insignificant impact on water
demand. Section 3 contains a discussion of water needs by type of energy
technology.
    The regional water demands are discussed in detail in appendix A, which includes
estimates of future demand. Energy sector demands are significantly less than domes-
tic and industrial demands in the Vaal System and less than irrigation demands in the
Orange System. They are more dominant in the Olifants system and, potentially, in the
Waterberg system.




Non-Energy Water Needs
Because SATIM-W focuses on major water delivery schemes that serve more than the
energy sector, it is essential to include projected non-energy demands. For that reason,
the water requirements of non-energy sectors are aggregated in SATIM-W. They are
specified exogenously based on estimates derived from basin-level models. Future
water demands for the non-energy sectors were then determined by regression analy-
sis of historical usage and midterm forecasts, as summarized in appendix A, and the
resulting estimates of non-energy demands were held constant throughout the a    ­ nalysis.
However, caution is needed when regressing against macroeconomic indicators in a
top-down approach to project demand for both energy and water as this could distort
regional water requirements. The water usage of the energy supply sectors is deter-
mined endogenously by the model. Agricultural demands were kept constant in accor-
dance with regional allocations (appendix A) on the assumption that these have likely
reached their practical limit.
   As the role of non-energy demands can be highly variable and has a major impact
on requirements for water infrastructure, an important area for future work is endoge-
nizing non-energy water demands to give SATIM-W some flexibility (within limits) to
reallocate non-energy water consumption—taking into account fees for the transfer of
water rights that could be used, for example, to promote water conservation.

     Energy in
     South Africa
                                      For decades electricity in South Africa was cheap, owing to overcapacity. But serious
                                      supply interruptions in March 2014, following several months of interruptions in 2008,
                                      brought energy to the forefront of public debate. Popular concern about the environ-
                                      ment and about the safety of nuclear power have complicated the picture, as has the
                                      need to spur economic growth to alleviate unemployment, poverty, and inequality.
                                      Today South Africa faces the daunting task of finding the best mix of energy solutions
                                      to achieve all of these goals.
                                         Energy planning in South Africa is highly centralized. Planning occurs at stipulated
                                      intervals for electricity and primary energy supply, both of which are mandated in law as
                                      functions of the Department of Energy (DoE). The planning processes have elicited vigor-
                                      ous public participation and brought a great deal of information into the public domain
                                      about the unfolding energy landscape and how policy decisions and trade-offs are made.
                                         This section summarizes South Africa’s energy supply sector to provide a context
                                      for the policy environment in which South African TIMES model “water smart”
                                      (SATIM-W) and other models can be applied. More details appear in appendix B.




                                      Resource Supply
                                      Coal is the engine of South Africa’s economy, accounting for nearly 70 percent of
                                      ­
                                      primary energy supply. Coal is an important international export (75 Mt/year) and fuels
                                      92 percent of South Africa’s electricity generation (IEA 2014; DoE 2006). In addition,
                                      about 16 percent of the country’s demand for liquid fuel is met by Sasol’s synthetic
                                      coal-to-liquids plant at Secunda. Estimates of South Africa’s recoverable coal reserves
                                      range from 32,000 Mt (Prevost 2014) to 49,000 Mt (SACRM 2013), the world’s sixth-­
                                      largest (SACRM 2013), with a reserve/production ratio of more than 200 years. Most of
                                      the water needed for coal mining is used to wash the coal before it is delivered to
                                      power plants.
                                         Exploration to assess the potential for shale gas extraction by hydraulic fracturing
                                      (fracking) is in the initial stages. In the absence of conclusive exploration data, esti-
                                      mates of reserves span a very broad range from 17 to 485 trillion cubic feet (US EIA
                                      2013; SAPA 2014; SAOGA 2014). Because large amounts of water are required for shale
                                      gas production, water’s availability, price, and treatment must be taken into consider-
                                      ation when assessing the potential of this form of energy. South Africa’s Karoo region,
                                      where the greatest shale gas potential is believed to lie, is an extremely water scarce
                                      and ecologically sensitive area in which municipalities and farmers depend on ground-
                                      water (de Wit 2011; WWF 2015). No data exists for South Africa on the costs of treat-
                                      ment and disposal of flow-back effluent from shale gas exploration and extraction.
                                      Alternative water-sourcing options such as on-site recycling and use of saline water
                                      were not part of the current analysis, but they should be considered in any follow-on
                                      analysis.
                                          In South Africa, uranium ore is generally low in quality and is extracted only

                            ore is exported. Eskom procures enriched uranium on the international market to fuel
                            its single nuclear power plant at Koeberg (IAEA 2010). As the extraction of uranium
                            occurs in conjunction with gold mining, both its water requirements and its produc-
                            tion of acid mine drainage (Naicker, Cukrowska, and McCarthy 2003) are grouped in
                            SATIM-W with gold mining as part of industrial energy demand and non-energy water
                            requirements.
                               Water consumption estimates for coal mining in the Waterberg (Region A in map 2.2
                            and table 3.1) are based on detailed analysis conducted by Golder and Associates for
                            the Exxaro mine, while the estimates for the Central Basin (regions B and C) are taken
                            from the South African Coal Road Map.
                               Data on water consumption for shale gas production were taken from the Barnett
                            shale region of the United States, which is one of the largest in the nation and similar
                            in geological composition to the Karoo region of South Africa, where significant shale
                            gas resources are believed to exist (Vermeulen 2012). To obtain an average or levelized
                            water withdrawal rate for shale gas extraction, the estimated total volume of water
                            withdrawn over a given production span for the Karoo region was used. Assuming
                            cumulative shale gas production of 1 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) (~1,000 PJ), the water-use
                            intensity of shale gas extraction in the Karoo is estimated at 17,000 m3/PJ. Of course,
                            the water intensity of extraction will be influenced by many factors, such as local geol-
                            ogy, so this value is subject to refinement.




                            The Electricity Sector
                            Electricity supply is dominated by Eskom, which also functions as the system operator
                            and owns and operates the transmission network and the distribution networks out-
                            side those owned and managed by the large cities. Eskom operates 27 power stations
                            with a total nominal capacity of 41.9 GW, of which 85 percent of the capacity is coal-fired.

                                      The balance of capacity is provided by nuclear, open-cycle gas turbine, hydro, and
                                      pumped-storage power plants (ESKOM 2013). In an attempt to address energy diversi-
                                      fication, environmental concerns, and economic growth aspirations, energy sources
                                      such as nuclear, gas, and renewables are being examined as alternatives by the DoE
                                      through legislated planning processes augmented by wide-ranging ministerial discre-
                                      tion, including the power to make “determinations” as to the future generation mix.
                                      Eskom retails directly to consumers and municipal distributors. As a monopolistic
                                      retailer, it is obliged to purchase from a growing pool of independent power producers.
                                      The purchase price is determined by the DoE through a competitive bidding process
                                      that is independent of Eskom.
                                         The granting of independent power generation licenses through public procure-
                                      ment has become a feature of electricity policy, with three rounds of the Renewable
                                      Energy Independent Power Producer Program awarded, a fourth round in process,
                                      and projects from Rounds 1 and 2 already generating electricity (see table 2.2).
                                      Procurement processes with predefined targets for independent fossil-fueled and
                                      nuclear capacity are also underway, with nuclear vendors’ offerings having been
                                      reviewed by the DoE (GCIS 2015) and the first respondents to the DoE’s request for
                                      proposals from coal-based independent power producers having passed the environ-
                                      mental approval stage.
                                          The 2010 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) is South Africa’s official generation capacity
                                      procurement policy. The plan’s Policy Adjusted Scenario, based on the results of mod-
                                      eling using a least-cost optimization systems model similar to SATIM, that maps out
                                      the capacity required to meet assumed demand through 2030. It includes an adminis-
                                      trative decision to impose 9.6 GW of nuclear capacity as a fixed assumption, with the
                                      first 1.6 GW to come online in 2023. The reasoning, as stated in the IRP , was “to account
                                      for the uncertainties associated with the costs of renewables and fuels” and to “pro-
                                      vide acceptable assurance of security of supply in the event of a peak oil-type increase
                                      in fuel prices and ensure that sufficient dispatchable base-load capacity is constructed
                                      to meet demand in peak hours each year” (DoE 2011). Three coastal sites for future
                                      nuclear plants—Banatamsklip and Duinefontein in the Western Cape and Thyspunt in
                                      the Eastern Cape—have been identified thus far, and they have undergone environ-
                                      mental impact assessments (Van Wyk 2013; World Nuclear Association 2015). It can be
                                      assumed that plants here would use seawater for cooling, as is the case with Koeberg.
                                      The cost of the seawater supply infrastructure is included in the nuclear plant costs,
                                      and the seawater itself is assumed to have no cost, so its use is not tracked in
                                      SATIM-W.
                                         Further complicating the policy landscape of future energy supply sources is the
                                      growth in distributed generation. The national energy regulator, NERSA, is drafting
                                      rules for small-scale embedded generation (NERSA 2015a). The Small-Scale Embedded
                                      Generation Programme of the City of Cape Town is now buying power fed to the grid,
                                      and total rooftop photovoltaics (PV) capacity in South Africa increased from 10 MW to
                                      over 30 MW over the 12 months ending March 2015 (Donnelly 2015).
                                        On average in South Africa, 1 kWh of electricity consumes about 1.4 liters of
                                      water (Eskom 2011), a water intensity that is within the range of the world average of

                               cal median intensity of about 1.7 liters/kWh, as reported by the National Renewable
                               Energy Laboratory for subcritical coal power plants cooled by wet recirculating cooling
                               (Macknick and others 2011). The detailed water consumption of existing power stations
                               and other key metrics are presented in appendix G.
                                  The country’s stock of large coal-fired power plants utilizes a mix of dry-cooling
                               and closed-cycle wet-cooling. Including the dry-cooled units of the Majuba and
                               Groovlei plants, which have both wet- and dry-cooled units, the existing net capac-
                               ity of dry-cooled units is approximately 9,700 MW. This accounts for about 30 ­ percent

                                      would increase the contribution of dry-cooled net capacity to about 18,000 MW,

                                      (Eskom 2011).
                                         The country possesses considerable solar energy resource potential in the arid
                                      north, as well as favorable wind resources along its coastline (Hagemann 2008; Fluri
                                      2009), and utility-scale concentrating solar (thermal) power (CSP), solar-PV, and
                                      wind power plants have emerged as coal alternatives. The arid Northern Cape prov-
                                      ince offers the highest potential for utility-scale CSP generation, estimated at 500
                                      GW in total (Fluri 2009), after considering sunshine availability, proximity to trans-
                                      mission lines, and suitable terrain, vegetation, and land use. Some analyses have
                                      projected a CSP capacity of close to 40 GW by 2045 under a scenario of high nuclear
                                      costs (DoE 2013). Under the country’s Renewable Energy Independent Power
                                      Producer Programme, which aims to reduce the country’s dependence on coal
                                      through renewable energy generation of up to 19 GW by 2030 (DoE 2013), a total of
                                      400 MW of renewable capacity has been allocated, and three plants totaling 200
                                      MW have been commissioned, although they are not yet operational. All three
                                      plants use dry-cooling technology; their primary water consumption is for mirror
                                      washing. Boiler make-up is estimated to account for 20 percent of the total water
                                      requirements.
                                         The power sector has been identified as a potential strategic consumer of gas as
                                      part of the strategy to move away from reliance on coal. With regard to existing and
                                      future generation technologies, both open-cycle gas turbine and combined-cycle gas
                                      turbine plants are considered. Several different sources of gas are possible, including
                                      Mozambique (imported over land), coastal imported liquefied natural gas, and indige-
                                      nous shale gas, should mining proceed. The “Big Gas” scenario of the yet-to-be-
                                      approved update to the IRP suggests that nearly 70 GW of gas-based generation
                                      capacity by 2050 could be possible, given that shale availability can drive the price of
                                      natural gas down to R50/GJ by 2035, with supply augmented by regional conventional
                                      sources (DoE 2013).
                                         South Africa has one 1.8 GW nuclear power plant, Koeberg, located approximately
                                      30 km north of Cape Town. Koeberg employs once-through seawater cooling for its two
                                      pressurized water reactors. Owing to the current practice of exporting domestic ura-
                                      nium ore and importing processed fuel rods, uranium extraction is essentially decou-
                                      pled from domestic energy supply. The demand for uranium as represented in
                                      SATIM-W is for processed fuel rods and does not reflect local mining activity.
                                      Therefore, as noted above, the energy and water requirements of uranium mining are
                                      grouped with gold mining in SATIM-W, as part of industrial energy demand and non-
                                      energy water requirements.
                                         Table 3.2 provides a summary of water-intensity data for existing and new power
                                      plant options in South Africa. For more details see appendix G. Note that owing to
                                      Eskom’s zero discharge policy, all power plant water use is consumptive.

                 Refining of Liquid Fuels
                 Liquid fuel production in South Africa involves six domestic refineries, four conven-
                 tional and two synthetic fuel (synfuel) plants:


                 •	 Three coastal conventional crude oil refineries: Sapref, Enref, Chevref
                 •	 One inland conventional crude oil refinery: Natref
                 •	 One coastal synthetic gas-to-liquids refinery: PetroSA (reduced gas supply has
                    necessitated supplementary light crude distillate feedstock)
                 •	 One inland synthetic coal-to-liquids refinery: Sasol-Secunda.

                 The coastal crude refineries are grouped together in SATIM-W because they have simi-
                 lar product slates and operating inputs. Diesel and kerosene dominate the product
                 slate of the inland crude refinery; gasoline that of the two synthetic refineries a gaso-
                 line heavy slate. For that reason, they are characterized separately in SATIM-W.
                 Synthetic fuel refining plants can use either the coal or natural gas resource discussed
                 above. These plants include numerous discrete chemical-processing units operating in
                 close interaction and requiring both ancillary energy and water services. The resulting
                 products are energy, water, and emissions intensive, particularly in the case of coal-to-
                 liquid refining. However, because no South African refinery uses once-through cooling,
                 oil refining in South Africa is, on average, relatively water efficient in global terms
                 (Pearce and Whyte 2005), although the synthetic refineries are considerably more
                 water intensive. Table 3.3 shows the relative production and water intensity of South
                 African liquid fuels refineries.

                                      This study involved integrating a representation of water supply into an energy
                                      systems model to better reflect the interdependent nature of the water–energy nexus.

                                      The water challenges facing the energy system were therefore of primary interest.
                                      This section explores important water-energy stress points from the perspective of
                                      the energy system.




                                      Water Consumed in the Production of Energy
                                      Although power generation directly accounts for only about 2 percent of South Africa’s
                                      demand for water (DWA 2013), it represents about 15 percent of gross domestic prod-
                                      uct (GDP) (GCIS 2015). Power generation is also considered to be a key strategic indus-
                                      try, requiring secure supplies of good-quality water. Many of the country’s interbasin
                                      transfer (IBT) schemes were developed specifically to supply water to power plants. An
                                      example of the complex system of IBTs developed to supply water to some of the coal-
                                      fired power stations is shown in figure 4.1.
                                         These IBTs ensure a reliable supply of water and, in many cases, are necessary to
                                      provide water of sufficient quality. Water available near the power stations is often nat-
                                      urally hard or of poor quality owing to mining and industrial activity.
                                         The extraction and utilization of energy commodities requires water. Coal mining,
                                      for example, in addition to typical uses such as dust suppression, requires water for
                                      coal washing, a process that raises the calorific value of mined coal by reducing its
                                      ash content. About half of the coal mines in South Africa are underground and
                                      require pumping for dewatering as they usually occur below the water table. To treat
                                      acid ­mineleachate, some mines have commissioned water treatment plants for the
                                      safe ­discharge of mine effluent or to supply potable water to neighboring municipali-
                                      ties.1 The Department of Water and Sanitation requires that all mines have a
                                      water-management plan.
                                         Although many mines are noncompliant, a more stringent legal environment is
                                      expected, as treatment of mine water comes to be seen as a mandatory practice, fol-
                                      lowing the model of air quality emissions, as discussed below.
                                         South Africa’s rights-based constitution places a responsibility on the state to
                                      ensure clean and safe air and water. Recently this has seen stricter enforcement by
                                      means of regulations stipulating minimum emissions standards for particulate mat-

                                          Currently, local coal-fired power plants, for example, do not control flue gas emis-
                                      sions, other than for particulate matter (Eskom 2009, 2012). Of the new capacity under
                                      construction, the Kusile plant will employ wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD), whereas
                                      Medupi will be retrofitted with this technology, which will be fully operational six years
                                      after commissioning (Eskom 2012, 2014). The Integrated Resource Plan of 2010 assumed
                                      all new coal capacity to be fitted with FGD, which suggests this is firm policy for coal
                                      capacity beyond Medupi and Kusile (DoE 2011). Existing plants, given low sulfur levels
                                      in the low-ash coal used, all meet the 2015 compliance levels for SO2 but would require
                                      FGD retrofitting to meet the 2020 compliance levels (Eskom 2009, 2012, 2014). However,
                                      after Eskom argued that high capital costs, long outage times (estimated at 120–150
                                      days), constraints on supply of limestone sorbent, and water scarcity militate against
                                      FGD retrofitting (Eskom 2009), applications for a five-year postponement of SO2 regula-
                                      tions were granted in February 2015 to all affected Eskom plants by the Department of
                                      Environmental Affairs (Mdluli 2015). It remains unclear whether any fleet retrofit of FGD
                                      will take place. But a scenario with stricter regulations that force new and old plants to
                                      be retrofitted with FGD systems was included in the analysis so as to understand their
                                      impact on the energy sector and on water resources. For more information on FGD sys-
                                      tems, see appendix H.
                                         Historically, cheap high-ash and low calorific-value coal for electricity has been
                                      supplied directly to “mine-mouth” generating plants via conveyor from adjacent
                                      mines, keeping electricity production costs relatively low. However, as existing mines
                                      approach their production limits, new exploitations of less-economical coal deposits,
                                      will be required to meet future growth in domestic electricity demand. The remaining
                                      economical reserves are in the Waterberg region, north of the existing mining-​
                                      ­ndustrial complex. New generation plants located here would all require investment
                                      i
                                      in transmission and distribution infrastructure, as well as water supply infrastructure.
                                      The extent of the latter is contingent on growth in coal-derived energy supply for both
                                      domestic and export markets. Coal supply for domestic use is modeled separately
                                      from coal for export. An upper bound is imposed on potential coal exports, but that
                                      bound is never reached because future exports decay as less-expensive options are
                                      depleted.
                                          At the same time, existing water supply systems are at or approaching their capac-
                                      ity, with 97 percent of existing water supply systems already allocated. Agriculture
                                      (irrigation) uses 60 percent of water withdrawals (DWAF 2004) (figure 4.2). However,
                                      ­
                                      as seen in the map of figure 4.2, the national water allocation masks regional dispari-
                                      ties in water supply. Also, the national summary does not reflect regional sectoral
                                      ­
                                      composition. For example, in the northern Limpopo (Waterberg) region, where
                                      vast new coal deposits are located, energy production accounts for close to half
                                      of water withdrawals and may grow to be the dominant regional water consumer
                                      should coal-based energy supply expand. In the populous industrial heartland of
                                      the Vaal region, by contrast, the energy sector is an almost insignificant consumer on
                                      a relative basis, accounting for less than 1 percent of withdrawals, although a
                                      ­
                                      significant portion is exported to other catchments to supply to energy producers.

                                           Shortfalls in regional water supply are compensated for by the construction (exist-
                                        ing and planned) of large-scale water transfers.
                                           Figure 4.3 represents the interconnected water supply schemes in each water basin,
                                        along with the power plants, water pumping demands, irrigation demands, and other
                                        water demands.
                                            Eskom’s practice of zero liquid-effluent discharge encourages the use of dry cooling
                                        in new coal plants, even though dry-cooled plants are on average 10 percent more capi-
                                        tal intensive and 2 percent less efficient than wet-cooled plants, and therefore more coal
                                        intensive, with higher atmospheric pollutant loads (EPRI 2007a; EPRI 2007b; Mielke,
                                        Anadon, and Narayanamurti 2010). Thus, the benefit of reduced water consumption at a
                                        dry-cooled power plant comes at the cost of increasing other environmental burdens.
                                           All this points to the need for regional data detailed enough to illuminate the water
                                        supply and transfer implications of alternative power plant location. South African
                                        TIMES model “water smart” (SATIM-W) accomplishes exactly this by embedding the
                                        various water supply options in the least-cost planning platform, so that the cost of
                                        water is fully captured as decisions about energy investments are made.

                                             Water Quality
                                             In addition to the volumes of water necessary and available, attention must be paid
                                             to the quality of water available, which affects its utility. The Council for Scientific
                                             and Industrial Research states that “the biggest threat to sustainable water supply
                                             in South Africa is not a lack of storage but the contamination of available water

resources through pollution” (CSIR 2012). Poor water quality affects power stations
by increasing the need for onsite water purification. At the Duvha power station,
a diversion pipeline was constructed to bypass polluted areas of the Olifants river
system at a cost of R1.5 billion. Desalination plants can increase water costs by R10
to R20 per megaliter (excluding brine disposal). Proposed water transfers from the
Crocodile River to the Waterberg would supply water of lower quality than the
existing local supply and would require further treatment for power plants. Poor
water quality would require power plants to manage additional effluent in order
to adhere to Eskom’s policy of zero liquid-effluent discharge. Moreover, degraded
water sources no only, but also require additional treatment in order to be used,
which requires additional energy, thus raising its cost. In this study, in response to
concerns along these lines expressed by stakeholders at a review workshop, p the
impact of poor water quality was examined by means of a sensitivity analysis that
assumes increased treatment needs in areas where it is known that there is a high
risk of water quality degradation (see appendix D).




Future Climate Change Impacts
Sub-Saharan Africa is considered to be highly vulnerable to climate change. But although
there is general agreement that temperatures will continue to rise, much uncertainty sur-
rounds the potential impact of climate change on precipitation (Schulze 2006). The prevail-
ing consensus is that drying is likely to occur in the western part of the South Africa,
particularly in the southwestern Cape, while the eastern parts of the country would receive
more precipitation, with some potential for seasonal shifts (DEA 2013a).
    Thus, climate change may or may not affect the availability of water for power plant
cooling and other uses, but it very well could affect the efficiency of cooling through
increased temperatures, which, in turn, could increase the relative benefits of wet-
cooled over dry-cooled power stations. However, an analysis of the efficiency response
to temperature for the new dry-cooled Medupi station showed that plant efficiency is
stable for more than a three-degree rise in ambient temperature. Because these coal-
fired plants are located in such arid environments, they have been over engineered, so
no impacts of increasing temperatures were modeled in SATIM-W. This is a potential
area for future research, however, especially if the potential for periodically very high
temperatures is considered.
   Rising temperatures are also likely to lead to higher demands from competing water
users, notably agriculture (irrigation). Increasing temperatures and changing stream-
flow dynamics could also negatively affect water quality, already a concern for power
stations and other water users in South Africa and requiring, in some cases, additional
water for dilution (DWAF 2009).

     Integrating

     Planning: The
     Satim-W
     Model
                                      The South African TIMES “water smart” (SATIM-W) model developed and applied in
                                      the study reported here is based on SATIM, which was derived from the TIMES model-
                                      ing platform developed, promoted, and used under the auspices of the International
                                      Energy Agency’s Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program (IEA-ETSAP).1 SATIM is
                                      a detailed representation of the supply and demand components of South Africa’s
                                      national energy system, from resource extraction to end-use services such as heating,
                                      cooling, lighting, passenger travel, powering of industrial motors. It contains a multi-
                                      tude of energy transformation technologies. For example, the model includes the
                                      extraction, transmission, and distribution of gas and coal for electricity generation; the
                                      transmission and distribution of electricity; and the consumption of electricity by end-
                                      use technologies to supply energy services, including the energy requirements for
                                      water pumping and water treatment. Technologies are linked by commodities and char-
                                      acterized by techno-economic parameters such as efficiency, investment (along with
                                      capital and operational costs), maximum availability, plant life, and so on. Technologies
                                      are further organized by sector (supply, refining, power, buildings/households, indus-
                                      try, and transportation) and type. The model solves for the optimal configuration of
                                      technologies and resources that will satisfy the growth in demand for electricity and
                                      other energy commodities at the subsector level in equilibrium, assuming perfect fore-
                                      sight and competition.
                                          Growth in demand for energy services in South Africa is projected for specific sec-
                                      tors in accordance with established drivers, such as overall gross domestic product
                                      (GDP) growth, the relative contribution to that growth of each demand sector, popula-
                                      tion growth, and other sector-specific growth factors or elasticities. For example, the
                                      representation of the residential sector divides households into electrified and nonelec-
                                      trified households and, within those categories, into low-, middle-, and high-income
                                      households. Demand for energy services within a category is assumed to be propor-
                                      tional to the population in that category, with GDP growth determining per capita
                                      income and thus demand. In SATIM, the demand for useful energy services is imposed
                                      exogenously, and the model determines which commodities and technologies to
                                      deploy to meet those demands at the least cost. In this way the model determines the
                                      size and sequencing of long-lived energy infrastructure investments, the rates of utili-
                                      zation of available resources, and the short-lived devices that are needed to deliver
                                      energy services to the consumer at the lowest present-value-cost over the planning
                                      horizon examined.
                                          Because SATIM solves for the least-cost chain of supply extending from resource
                                      extraction to transmission, distribution, and end-use demand devices, it could be read-
                                      ily modified to incorporate the representation of water infrastructure as a component
                                      of the energy system supply chain.

48  Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus   Section 5
                                      Integrating Water and Energy Planning: The SATIM-W Model
The Beginnings of the Satim-W Model
Historically, SATIM accounted for the water consumption of the power sector only by
including the estimated water-intensity of electricity generation plants. It did not con-
sider regional disparities in water supply and costs, nor the water usage of other
energy technologies, such as coal mining and shale gas production. Nor did it include
water treatment requirements.
   To remedy this shortcoming, individual water supply options, including major
investments in dams and transfer projects and water supply energy needs, were incor-
porated into the model to capture the water-energy interplay. The modified model was
dubbed SATIM-W. Incorporating a regional water costs and quality allows SATIM-W to
examine potential trade-offs arising from:

•	 Fuel extraction and processing (e.g., coal washing and shale gas extraction)
•	 The consumption and treatment of water for cooling and steam circuits in thermal
   plants
•	 Cleaning and other water services required by all types of power plants
•	 The additional (marginal) treatment required for water of poorer quality entering the
   supply system as new water supply schemes are implemented in response to grow-
   ing demand
•	 Air quality standards and end-of-pipe technologies that require water (e.g., flue gas
   desulfurization).

Figure 5.1 illustrates a section of the water-energy diagram for SATIM-W, showing
the supply, conversion, and end-use processes for supply of energy and water to the
power sector. Specifically, this diagram shows how water-energy complexities are
handled including, from left to right and top to bottom:

•	 Regional water supply cost (WSC) curves (including the cost and incremental supply
   of new infrastructure) from which the marginal cost of water supplied in each region
   and for each period is endogenously determined
•	 Water and energy requirements for coal mining and cleaning, as well as the treat-
   ment of discharged water.
•	 Coal is transported and water moved as needed to meet demand.
•	 The water consumption demands of the power and liquid fuel sectors are endoge-
   nously determined, whereas non-energy water needs are fixed exogenously; the
   combination determine how much water must ultimately be delivered.
•	 Electricity, liquid fuels, and renewables (not shown in the figure) then provide the
   final energy needed to meet energy service demands in each of the end-use sectors
   (agriculture, residential, commercial, industry, and transport).

SATIM-W is thus responsive to the regional cost and availability of water and energy
supply, connecting them to a single national representation of the energy demand sec-
tors and providing complete coverage of the water-energy nexus.

50  Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus         Section 5
                                            Integrating Water and Energy Planning: The SATIM-W Model
Spatially Aligning the Water-Energy
Systems in Satim-W
To produce a water-smart model of the energy system we needed to match energy
options with their respective water regions. The spatial dislocation between water and
energy supply options, and the fact that some energy technologies are located in areas
with easier and cheaper access to water, are good reasons for representing water
­
supply with appropriate regional detail. The availability of water and the cost of
supplying it vary greatly from region to region. The need to transfer water over large
­
distances to supply power stations can be very costly, pushing up the cost of supplying
energy. Competing demands from other sectors, treatment requirements, and utilities’
financing costs for existing bulk-supply infrastructure also influence the cost of the
water needed to produce energy.
   With increasing demands over time, the costs of supplying water are likely to
increase as existing options are exhausted and more expensive options are required.
The costs of future schemes will vary by location, potentially resulting in very different
costs for water that may influence the choice of optimal energy supply options. In addi-
tion, significant external costs may arise in connection with water quality and ecologi-
cal risk, particularly in dry regions. These are important considerations that are best
handled by water-basin models, and one of the challenges of this study was determin-
ing how best to represent all of the costs associated with the delivery of water for
energy based on the water supply prices provided from the basin models.
   One of the factors behind the choice of South Africa for this study was that industrial-
ization in a water-scarce environment has resulted in a strong legacy of water engineer-
ing, planning, and modeling, with crucial information available in reports published by
the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS). Our depiction of future water infrastruc-
ture schemes has drawn extensively from a DWS report that estimates the ultimate mar-
ginal cost of water supply for different regions of South Africa (DWA 2010a), developing
regional cost curves for water supply as a function of total demand. After accounting for
recent developments, we integrated these into the energy supply chains represented in
SATIM-W as the costs of the different options, solving for an optimal future water-energy
supply mix that accounts for a realistic future cost of water supply, as reflected by cur-
rent plans and knowledge of local practitioners.
    The first step in developing SATIM-W was to determine the appropriate level of spa-
tial disaggregation required to explore WSC impacts and interdependencies on the
energy supply side. As discussed in Section 2, the regional spread of recent and com-
mitted power generation projects and their proximate water supply systems show four
regions of interest (A,B,C and D). A fifth region (R) was added to give the model the
option of transporting coal by rail to the coast and using seawater to cool future coal-
fired capacity in the event that fresh water costs become high enough to make this via-
ble. Thus five water supply regions (WSR) corresponding to major water supply
systems were identified and deemed sufficient to represent the likely spatial spread of
fresh-water-intensive energy supply infrastructure over the time horizon of 2050.
Separate WSCs were developed for each of the regions and integrated into SATIM-W.

                                          The water needs of existing and future coastal crude oil refineries are not explicitly rep-
                                      resented in the regions of interest in this study, since the existing coastal refineries are
                                      relatively water efficient and, in the case of Durban’s SAPREF and Cape Town’s Chevron
                                      refinery, already make extensive use of recycled municipal waste water, as discussed in
                                      section 3 (SAPREF 2011; Chevron 2015; Pearce and Whyte 2005). New refineries are most
                                      likely to be located along the coast and can potentially use seawater cooling. Water use by
                                      the existing inland refineries, notably the crude-fed Natref located in the Upper Vaal water-
                                      management area (Region C in map 2.2) and the Sasol Coal-to-Liquids plant located in
                                      the Upper Olifants area (Region B in map 2.2), are included in SATIM-W. A detailed
                                      parameterization of the refinery technologies in SATIM-W is presented in appendix G.
                                         Modeling water-treatment requirements for coal power plants was not needed, as all
                                      Eskom plants (wet- and dry-cooled) operate under Eskom’s zero discharge policy. This study
                                      addressed the treatment of acid mine drainage from coal mines only. Expansion of the
                                      model to include wastewater treatment from other sectors is a possible follow-on activity.




                                      Regional Water Supply Cost Curves
                                      The cost of supplying water for energy is determined from four separate components:
                                      the supply, infrastructure, delivery (transmission and distribution), and treatment
                                      requirements. The latter three are presented here as amortized annual costs:

                                          Scheme Supply Cost = Capital(Scheme + Delivery) + Fixed OM (%Capital)(Scheme + Delivery) +
                                          Var OM1 (Energy cost of conveyance (endogenous))(Scheme + Delivery) + Var OM2
                                          (Administrative & Water Treatment charges)

                                         The capital, fixed, and variable operating and maintenance (O&M) components are
                                      calculated separately in each WSR for each water supply scheme (e.g., dam, interbasin
                                      transfer) for purposes of determining the potential regional WSC—also called the unit
                                      water cost (UWC) in traditional water basin models2—which takes into account the cur-
                                      rent and future water supply options identified for each region (DWA 2010a). SATIM-W
                                      then weights each water supply and delivery option (or scheme) and chooses the com-
                                      bination and timing that deliver the needed water at the least cost, resulting in the
                                      determination of the marginal water supply cost (MWSC). As a result, the MWSC as
                                      determined by the model will vary from period to period in response to constraints
                                      placed on the system by specific policy scenarios.
                                        The cost of delivering water to power plants is based on estimates of the cost of
                                      deploying and managing major water supply and transfer schemes, but it does not
                                      capture final details (and associated costs) that can be determined only when a specific

                                        WSC in SATIM-W differ slightly from conventional UWC in that the WSCs use the technical rather than
                                      ­ conomic lifetime to amortize capital construction cost. Given the relatively long physical lifetime of water
                                      e
                                      infrastructure, SATIM-W currently undercosts the annualized payments for these investments (though it
                                      ­
                                      does so evenly for each scheme). Adjustment to use the economic lifetime is an important follow-on action.




52  Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus   Section 5
                                      Integrating Water and Energy Planning: The SATIM-W Model
site is identified. This is also true for fracking and concentrating solar (thermal) power
(CSP), where the exact locations and method of water delivery have not been deter-
mined. But in both cases these details are rather small compared with the other costs
of each scheme.
   The water supply schemes are developed according to the Revised Water Pricing
Strategy for Raw Water (DWA 2013), using data provided in the analysis of the ultimate
cost of supplying water in South Africa (DWA 2010a). Where possible these costs have
been updated with more recent cost estimates for specific schemes and regions
(Aurecon 2011; Coleman and others 2007; DWA 2010b, 2010c, 2013; DWAF 2009). The
same studies were also used to update non-energy demands in each WMA.
    Looking more specifically at the components of the WSC, each individual component
is determined on an annual basis in rands per cubic meter (R/m3), as described below.
The cost of each scheme, organized by WSR, is the sum of all component costs, where:


•	 Capital consists of (a) infrastructure costs of water supply schemes, which cover the
   development and use of bulk water supply infrastructure, including the cost of plan-
   ning and design, capital loan repayment, and annual depreciation, and (b) water
   delivery costs, which include the capital costs for transporting water from the near-
   est bulk water source to the location of a power plant or mine.
•	 Fixed O&M consists of (a) water-resource-management charges, that is, the charges
   required to manage water resources within the designated WMA, and (b) the O&M
   costs involved in transporting water from the nearest bulk water source to a power
   plant or mine.
•	 Var O&M1 consists of the energy costs (EC) of supplying water, which include the
   water-pumping costs associated with (a) the raw water supply scheme and (b) the
   delivery of water to the power station or mine. The electricity cost for water supply
   is calculated within SATIM-W based on the power sector technology and fuel
   choices made in each scenario.
•	 Var O&M2 consists of the following additional charges as appropriate: (a) waste-­
   discharge mitigation, which cover the charge incurred for discharging water con-
   taining waste into a water resource or onto land, and (b) primary and secondary
   water-treatment costs, which include the additional cost of treating water to a basic
   water quality standard (primary) plus the additional treatment (secondary) of a por-
   tion of the water requirements to a higher level of quality through, for example, the
   use of reverse osmosis (RO) to reduce the salinity of the source water.


Table 5.1 presents the estimated infrastructure costs of bulk supply of water for various
schemes identified by DWS in each region. The table also includes a breakdown of the
estimated UWC of each water supply scheme in terms of capital repayment (CUC),
depreciation (ADC), O&M costs (OMC) and EC, the last of which, for these estimates, is
based on the weighted average cost of generation. Note that the data for each step
represent the incremental cost and supply for implementing that step. The net UWC is
the weighted average of all water schemes up to that point. The variability in the net
UWC for each region is an indication of the relative scarcity of water and the costs
associated with developing the resource or transporting additional water in to the

region to meet increasing demands for energy and other users. Table 5.2 provides simi-
lar information for major schemes for delivering water to the four regions critical to
future power generation.
   What is interesting is that the cost of future bulk water supply infrastructure in the
Waterberg is an order of magnitude higher, for lower yields, compared with the
Orange River supply schemes, highlighting the sometimes extreme regional disparities
in the cost of water supply. The tables also show how the cost of supplying water can
rise steeply with the deployment of discrete schemes to meet water supply require-
ments. It is also interesting to note the very high costs of delivering water from the
Orange River for hydraulic fracking, whether by truck or pipeline. Finally, note that the
energy required for desalination includes the energy needed to pump water from the
coast. Hence it is significantly higher than the energy required for the desalination
alone. This is considered as the ultimate marginal cost of water supply for all readions
in South Africa (DWA 2010a).




Incorporating the Cost of Water into Satim-W
As part of an integrated water-energy planning approach, the SATIM-W model can help
to ensure timely delivery of water supply and treatment infrastructure for the energy
sector. It is an energy sector planning tool that considers water supply as a critical
component of decision making. SATIM-W is not a tool that can be used for water plan-
ning (which must be done at a more granular basin level). Furthermore, it considers
non-energy water needs as fixed inputs.
   That said, water needs for energy often determine the timing and provide critical
capital for expansion of water infrastructure. Therefore, because SATIM-W can assess
the impact of changes in water needs for energy, it is highly useful for planning
purposes.
   The cost of supplying water is shown in figure 5.2 in the form of WSC curves for the
supply schemes identified for each WSR as a function of the total yield supplied by
each additional supply option. These curves show the incremental increase in water
supply attained and the cost of the next water supply scheme necessary to meet
increasing demand in each of the critical WSRs.
   Figure 5.2 illustrates the estimated costs of supplying water supply based on fixed
assumptions about the price of electricity required to treat and transport water and the
implementation timeline of specific supply schemes. Note that in some cases a more-
expensive scheme must precede a less-expensive one in order to deliver additional
water (e.g., in Waterberg and Upper Olifants).
   All water supply components characterized by the WSC curves in each region are
incorporated into SATIM-W. This approach makes it possible to compute a scenario-
specific dynamic cost curve, since the price of energy is endogenously determined and
water supply schemes are commissioned as needed to meet the requirements of the

                                         explained in appendix A.) Thus by choosing the appropriate schemes, SATIM-W gener-

                                         the water-energy nexus. SATIM-W also represents interregional water transfer schemes
                                         by linking specific regional supplies to water demands throughout the country.
                                            Because the commissioning of schemes is done within the national energy supply
                                         system, the investment choice and timing of energy supply technologies are influenced
                                         by the cost and timing of water supply schemes. The reciprocal water-energy invest-

                                      The nine scenarios selected for this case study provide important insights into the
                                      pressing policy questions raised by South Africa’s water and energy systems. The sce-
                                      narios are described in the next subsection. The ensuing subsections present answers
                                      to a series of policy questions arrived at by running the scenarios through the South
                                      African TIMES model “water smart” (SATIM-W) model. A detailed explanation of the

                                      The primary value of integrated water-energy planning is to support decision making.
                                      This is done here through the exploration of scenarios that simulate the impact of possi-
                                      ble policies and technology choices of significance to the country. The scenarios shown
                                      in table 6.1 capture the main areas of investment uncertainty in water and energy supply.
                                      The process by which these scenarios were developed is discussed in detail in appendix D.

                                      policy formulation and decision making in the energy sector, and the interdependency
                                      between energy sector planning and water infrastructure planning.
                                         The following sections summarize the analysis results through answers to a series
                                      of questions, arising from key decisions that could shape the future of South Africa’s
                                      energy and water systems. For each of the scenario clusters a summary metrics
                                      table, along the lines of table 6.2, highlights the cumulative change in key results

Shale Gas                              Shale-gas extraction occurs in the Orange River region. A total of 40 Tcf of gas is estimated to be
                                       economically recoverable.

Dry Climate                            Regional water supplies and non-energy water demands are adjusted from the Reference scenario
                                       to reflect a drier climate (increasing water demand and decreasing water supply), affecting the unit
                                       water supply cost of regional schemes (see appendix D, table D.1)

Water Quality                          The quality of the water transferred from Regions B and C to Region A (see figure 2.3) is lower than
                                       that of local supplies, requiring additional treatment costs for demineralization (e.g., of make-up
                                       water for boilers).

                                      Key Features of the Reference (Water Cost)
                                      Scenario
                                      The SATIM-W Reference scenario with water costs included—referred to as Reference
                                      (Water Cost)—is the modeled evolution of the integrated water-energy system in the
                                      absence of alternative policies or technology advancement and assuming water
                                      demands and yields are not significantly affected by climate change over the study’s
                                      time horizon. It serves as the point of comparison against which the costs and benefits
                                      of the other scenarios will be evaluated.
                                         The evolution of South Africa’s electricity generation mix between 2010 and 2050
                                      under this scenario is shown in figure 6.1. The 2010 mix is almost 90 percent coal-
                                      based, with a variety of renewable, nuclear, natural gas, and oil technologies supplying
                                      the remainder. By 2050, the share of coal-based power has diminished from almost
                                      90 percent to 65 percent, while the renewable share, comprised of concentrating solar,
                                      solar photovoltaics (PV), wind, and hydropower technologies, accounts for 25 percent
                                      of generation. Imported electricity grows from 3.4 percent to 8.2 percent, while nuclear
                                      shrinks from 5 percent to less than 1 percent, given the costs assumed for this
                                      scenario.
                                         The portfolio of technologies supplying this electricity comprises 42 GW of
                                      new supercritical coal, 3 GW of fluidized bed combustion capacity utilizing dis-
                                      card coal, 9 GW of wind, 30 GW of utility-generated and distributed solar PV,
                                      and 10 GW of concentrating solar (thermal) power (CSP) with storage. Note that
                                      hydropower, both domestic and imported, remains the same, at about a 5 percent
                                      ­
                                      share.
                                         Regional water supply in the Reference (Water Cost) scenario varies significantly by
                                      region in both volume and end-use applications, as shown in figure 6.2. The Waterberg
                                      region has the lowest total consumption and the greatest share of water going to
                                      energy activities, growing from 36 percent in 2015 to 82 percent in 2050, split between
                                      power plant cooling, coal mines, and coal-to-liquids (CTL) plants. The Olifants region,
                                      which initially has 10 times the amount of consumption, sees water for energy decline
                                      from about 50 percent to about 7 percent in 2050 because new coal power plants are
                                      dry-cooled. In both the Vaal and the Orange River regions, water consumption is four
                                      to eight times that in the Olifants region, and water for energy in both regions is an
                                      insignificant percentage of the total.
                                        The price of water supply also varies significantly by region, as shown in ­ figure 6.3.
                                      The prices in the Waterberg are higher by up to a factor of ten than in other regions,

             primarily owing to the lower volumes of water being supplied, but the price also
             fluctuates with periodic investments, which increase unit water cost in steps, followed
             ­
             by declining unit costs as demand increases over time.

             South Africa’s first foray into dry cooling for coal-fired power plants occurred in the late
             1960s in response to concerns over water security. Dry cooling for new coal thermal
             plants is Eskom’s current policy. As demonstrated below, it is indeed the least-cost
             policy for the country.
             ­
               In the Reference (No Water Cost) scenario, water supply costs and constraints are
             not factored into planning. Figure 6.4 illustrates this scenario, showing a clear prefer-
             ence for new wet-cooled coal power plants1 owing to their higher operating efficiencies
             and lower capital costs. In the Reference (Water Cost) scenario, by contrast, where full

             Exploring South Africa’s Water-Energy Planning Challenges: The Scenarios
                                      consideration is given to the costs of supplying water to power plants and energy
                                      resource industries, there is an all-out shift to dry cooling (figure 6.5).
                                         Figure 6.4 also shows that in the Reference (No Water Cost) scenario, the water-intensity
                                      of generation increases from an average value of 1.4 l/kWh in 2015 to 1.7 l/kWh in 2050.
                                      Although the average water-intensity of generation decreases from 2015 to 2030, as exist-
                                      ing wet-cooled plants are retired and 8.6 GW of committed dry-cooled plants are commis-
                                      sioned, the fact that all new coal plants after that date are wet cooled causes the water
                                      intensity of generation to increase steadily. However, in the Reference (Water Cost) sce-
                                      nario (figure 6.5), the preference for dry-cooled technology leads to a dramatic decline in
                                      water intensity as the dry-cooled coal power plants replace the retiring wet-cooled stock.
                                      This modal shift to dry-cooled technology is primarily driven by the availability of rela-
                                      tively cheap coal in the water-scarce Waterberg region, where expensive water-transfer
                                      investments would have to be made to support wet-cooled coal power plants. Therefore,
                                      when water costs are taken into account, the most cost-effective option is new dry-cooled
                                      power plants that utilize the cheap coal available in the Waterberg.
                                        This result reinforces the understanding that Eskom’s noneconomic decision to
                                      employ dry cooling for new coal power plants is indeed the least-cost policy for the
                                      country.
                                         The electricity generation mix in the two scenarios is essentially the same except
                                      for the method of cooling coal-fired power plants. Interestingly, in both of the refer-
                                      ence scenarios there is a notable increase in water consumption in 2050 owing the
                                      commissioning of wet-cooled CSP plants in the Orange River region. Approximately

                                      Exploring South Africa’s Water-Energy Planning Challenges: The Scenarios
             110 Mm3/year of water would be required to support 10 GW of wet-cooled CSP capac-
             ity, providing about 10 percent of electricity supply. However, the water required for
             wet-cooled CSP in that region is dwarfed by the demands of the non-energy sectors,
             which total 4,200 Mm3/year (figure E.1 in appendix E). Electricity generation in this
             region would consume only 3 percent of total water requirements in 2050, and
             investment decisions in water infrastructure are driven by the needs of the non-
             energy sectors. SATIM-W does not currently consider value-based allocations of
             water to energy versus agriculture, and one of the follow-on activities is to develop
             more economic and demand linkages between energy and non-energy water
             demands.
                The Reference (Water cost) scenario increases total system cost by only about
             1.1 percent over the Reference (No Water Cost) scenario, owing to the relatively small
             proportion of water supply infrastructure costs compared with all other investments
             and expenditures for energy in the supply and demand sectors. Investment for water
             supply infrastructure accounts for 40 percent of this increase, while water-system
             supply and operating costs account for the remaining 60 percent.
             ­
                Because such a large share of the water available in the Waterberg region goes to
             the energy sector, many of the following results will focus on that region, which
             often showed the greatest response to the scenario being examined. Figure 6.6

                                      shows the breakdown of total water consumption in the Waterberg region for the
                                      Reference (No Water Cost) scenario. Power plant water consumption dominates,
                                      approaching 80 percent of total supply by 2050. Figure 6.7 shows that when
                                      water costs are included, power plant consumption drops by a factor of seven,
                                      while coal mines consume very slightly less (as coal remains the main power
                                      plant fuel, with only the cooling technology switching). The other sectors are
                                      unaffected.

                                      Reference scenarios. The total system cost, energy supply expenditures, and pri-
                                      mary and final energy consumption are quite similar, with the most dramatic
                                      difference being the water consumed by power plants, which is cumulatively
                                      ­
                                      77 ­percent lower (more than 9,300 Mm3) in the Reference (Water Cost) scenario.
                                      Interestingly, this does not result in significantly higher power plant investment
                                      costs. The Reference (Water Cost) scenario also produces slightly higher CO2
                                      emissions despite generating 1.3 percent less electricity with coal and 2 percent

                                      more with renewable technologies. This results from the higher unit emissions
                                      associated with the dry-cooled coal plants that are adopted when water costs

                             How Do Stricter Environmental Controls
                             Affect Coal Investments in the Waterberg
                             Region?
                             Economical coal deposits in the Waterberg region are the key driver for siting new coal
                             mines, coal power plants, and CTL plants in the region. Measures to improve air and
                             water quality, as embodied in the Environmental Compliance scenario, require flue gas
                             desulfurization (FGD) for existing coal power plants and all CTL plants. This require-
                             ment affects the operating efficiency and water intensity of both types of plants, an
                             effect that is particularly critical in the Waterberg. Although the Reference (Water Cost)
                             scenario increases capacity derived from CTL plants by more than 500 PJ per year, the
                             Environmental Compliance scenario limits it to 100 PJ/year (­    figure 6.8). Water quality,
                             which is a component of the Environmental Compliance scenario, slightly reduces the
                             capacity of CTL plants owing to the increased cost of supplying water. However, the
                             greatest impact is due to the FGD requirements. For this initial study, only wet FGD
                             systems were modeled (see appendix H), based on the detailed information from the
                             Medupi plant, and Eskom’s current preference for the proven wet technology. Also, the
                             cost of waste disposal and sorbent still needs to be incorporated into the model, and
                             the total increase in system costs needs to be further examined.
                               Figure 6.9 shows that the lack of new CTL capacity under the Environmental
                             Compliance scenario reduces the requirement for new water supply schemes in the
                             Waterberg as compared with the Reference (Water Cost) and Water Quality scenarios.

                  Figure 6.10 shows the impact on new coal power plant capacity in the Waterberg,
              where the increased cost of water treatment begins to decrease new coal plant capac-
              ity after 2040, resulting in a drop of ~7 GW from the Reference (Water Cost) scenario.
              However, in the Environmental Compliance scenario, which includes water quality,
              new coal power plant capacity is slightly higher because of water freed up by CTL
              plants that are not built. This somewhat intuitive result highlights the value of employ-
              ing a multi-sector planning model of the energy system, one that captures and quanti-
              fies the interplay between the sectors.




              How Does a Dry Climate Affect Coal
              Investments in the Waterberg Region?
              The Dry Climate scenario has a CTL build-out similar to that of the Reference (Water
              Cost) scenario. Similarly, the Dry Climate + Environmental Compliance scenario also
              limits the construction of CTL capacity to 100 PJ/year. The Dry Climate scenario alone
              has little impact on new CTL capacity, largely because of the limited impact of climate
              change on bulk water supply.

              Exploring South Africa’s Water-Energy Planning Challenges: The Scenarios
                                          One impact of the Dry Climate scenario is early retirement of wet-cooled coal
                                      capacity in the Olifants and Upper Vaal regions owing to increased water demands
                                      from the non-energy sectors. This results in an additional 2 GW of dry-cooled coal
                                      capacity in the Waterberg in 2050 relative to Reference (Water Cost) scenario
                                      (figure 6.11).
                                         However, this small change in capacity hides the change in the coal power plant mix
                                      that results from the Dry Climate scenario, particularly starting in 2030. Under the Dry
                                      Climate scenario, all existing wet-cooled plants and the older, less efficient, dry-cooled
                                      plants, as well as the 800 MW of new wet-cooled plants, are replaced by new dry-cooled
                                      plants (figure 6.12). This is due primarily to the competition for water from the non-energy
                                      sectors, which, as discussed in appendix C, increases by an average of 11 percent from
                                      2030 to 2050 in the Central Basin, where the existing plants are located. In the Dry Climate
                                      and CO2 constrained scenarios, there is almost no new investment in coal-fired genera-
                                      tion, so a dry climate has no significant impact on investment in coal-fired power
                                      generation.
                                         Table 6.4 summarizes the key cumulative metrics (2010 to 2050) from the Dry
                                      Climate and Environmental Compliance scenarios. The Dry Climate scenario acceler-
                                      ates the shift to dry-cooled coal plants through early retirement of existing wet-cooled
                                      plants; cumulative water use decreases by 6.4 percent. By contrast, the Environmental
                                      Compliance scenario reduces investment in both new coal and new CTL capacity in the
                                      Waterberg, thereby cutting the requirement for new water supply schemes in that

                                      How Does the Cost of Water Affect Shale
                                      Gas Production?
                                      For this report, the data on water supply costs were suspect, and no data were avail-
                                      able for the cost of treating return-flow effluent from shale gas production in South
                                      Africa. Therefore, the current SATIM-W treatment of shale gas production and the fol-
                                      lowing scenario results must be viewed as preliminary. Under the Shale Gas scenario,
                                      shale gas production increases to just over 15 billion m3 per annum and comes to
                                      account for more than 6 percent of total primary energy.
                                         In the Shale Gas scenario, there is an initial reliance on groundwater (~1 Mm3/year)
                                      and trucking (~300 km per round-trip) for water delivery in the absence of a pipeline,
                                      resulting in a relatively high water supply cost (figure 6.13). The construction of a pipe-
                                      line in 2030, at a cost of R7.5 billion ($600 million), dramatically lowers the cost of
                                      water and accelerates shale gas development in the region. However, as noted, the
                                      costs of treatment and disposal of flow-back effluent from shale gas exploration and

              extraction are not fully reflected in the current analysis. Later iterations of the model
              shall include these costs.
                 The Shale Gas scenario significantly increases power generation from natural gas
              compared with the Reference (Water Cost) scenario (figure 6.14). Use of shale gas utili-
              zation for power generation grows at a similar rate whether or not the cost of water is
              taken into account (figure 6.15). The slight increase in the capacity of shale gas power
              plants when water costs are included results from a corresponding decrease in coal
              power plant capacity. The new combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants built under
              the Shale Gas scenarios are all dry cooled, as CCGT plants have lower water require-
              ments and suffer less efficiency loss with dry cooling. However, this result may change
              once more accurate water cost data and the cost of treating shale gas return-flow efflu-
              ent is included in the model.
                  Table 6.5 summarizes the key cumulative metrics (2010 to 2050) for the Shale gas
              scenario. It is interesting to note that cumulative water supply for shale gas production
              is 9.8 percent of all water use for energy in that scenario. The overall water needs for
              energy actually drop slightly under the Shale Gas scenario, as less water is devoted to
              the coal industry and power plants (since CCGT plants require less water than Coal
              plants).

                             In a Carbon-Constrained World, what Is the
                             Likelihood of Stranded Assets?
                             Building a system-wide carbon constraint into SATIM-W in the form of a cumulative
                             CO2 cap makes it possible to identify the most cost-effective path to mitigating energy
                             sector CO2 emissions in response to international climate change obligations and
                             national policy. Two scenarios were investigated: a cumulative cap of 14 Gt of CO2
                             equivalent by 2050, which is in line with the country’s current international
                             commitments,2 and a 10 Gt CO2 equivalent cumulative cap, which models a more
                             aggressive policy that might be followed if South Africa’s trading partners mitigated
                             aggressively and applied pressure to limit embedded emissions in the country’s
                             exports. These scenarios highlight the potential impact of the two policies on energy
                             sector and water supply investments, as well as the potential for stranded assets as a
                             consequence.

                             Exploring South Africa’s Water-Energy Planning Challenges: The Scenarios
                                         Regarding energy supply investments, both scenarios produce no new
                                      ­nvestment in CTL capacity, compared with more than 500 PJ per year in the
                                      i
                                      Reference (Water Cost) scenario. In addition, the operation of the existing CTL plant is
                                      affected (figure 6.16). The 14 Gt CO2 Cap scenario reduces production at the plant to
                                      zero by 2040, five years earlier than in the Reference scenario. If a 10 Gt CO2 Cap is
                                      implemented, production at the plant is completely halted by 2025, 20 years before the

                                        The reduction in CTL capacity is substituted by an increased reliance on imported
                                      petroleum products (figure 6.17) and crude oil (figure 6.18).
                                         The 10 Gt CO2 Cap scenario relies heavily on early imports of refined petroleum
                                      products, substituting for 80 percent of existing CTL production in 2025, with the
                                      remainder coming from increased production in the existing refineries. Although the
                                      14 Gt CO2 Cap scenario allows the existing CTL plant to operate at full capacity in 2025,
                                      there is still an increase in imports of finished petroleum products owing to a lack of
                                      investment in new CTL capacity in the Waterberg. The bulk of refinery capacity is situ-
                                      ated along the coast (~80 percent) and therefore does not affect the water supply sys-

                                         Unlike CTL facilities, which have very high CO2 emissions per unit output, existing
                                      and committed coal power plants are less at risk of being stranded under the 14 Gt CO2
                                      Cap scenario. In the Waterberg, the existing plants remain operational for their entire
                                      technical life (figure 6.19), although their operation stops by 2050. In the Central Basin

                                           (Upper Vaal and Olifants), existing coal plant utilization is highly variable from 2040
                                           onward. After 2040 only 4 GW of existing coal plants remain operational in the Central
                                           Basin, comprising both wet- and dry-cooled plants in roughly equal shares. Soon after,
                                           the wet-cooled plants are effectively mothballed. The capacity factor of the residual
                                           coal fleet increases in 2050 once the wet-cooled plants reach the end of their life and
                                           the 1.22 GW of dry-cooled coal plant remains operational.
                                              Under the 10 Gt CO2 constraint, by contrast, there is indeed a risk of significant
                                           stranded coal assets because the scenario requires early retirement of the existing coal
                                           plants, which are replaced by new nuclear plants. In addition, the 10 Gt CO2 Cap sce-
                                           nario shifts electricity production from the Waterberg to the Orange River region.
                                           Although the capacity of wet-cooled stock in the Central Basin is similar to that of the
                                           Reference (Water Cost) scenario in 2025, electricity production drops by 30 percent.
                                           The stock is retired by 2035, with idle capacity of 4 GW from 2040 onward.
                                               New coal power plants in the Olifants appear most at risk under the 10 Gt CO2 Cap
                                           scenario, as they cease production earlier than plants located in the Waterberg
                                            figure 6.20). The regional coal price is a likely factor in the preferential early retirement

                                           of plants in the Olifants, because Waterberg coal is more economical. In both scenar-

                               Water supply infrastructure for the Waterberg is also at risk of being underutilized if
                            a CO2 mitigation policy is implemented. The cost of water supply increases markedly
                            after 2040 for the 14 Gt scenario and after 2030 for the 10 Gt Cap scenario (figure 6.21)
                            because of the early closure of coal-fired capacity. This effectively increases costs for
                            the remaining users, as the supply system is being underutilized. Conversely, the
                            figure shows that the cost of water in the Olifants region under the carbon-constrained
                            ­
                            scenarios decreases relative to the Reference scenario, with the stricter 10 Gt CO2 cap
                            also reducing costs relative to the 14 Gt cap in both cases owing to the early retirement
                            of older wet-cooled coal plants.
                               The summary metrics for the two carbon-constrained scenarios relative to the
                            Reference scenario are shown in table 6.6. Notable are the large increases in power
                            plant investments: 24 percent for the 14 Gt scenario and 82 percent for the 10 Gt
                            scenario. The system cost differences, which aggregate and discount all supply and
                            ­
                            demand side costs, show a much smaller overall impact, although the 2.86 percent
                            increase for the 10 Gt scenario is significant relative to the impact of the other

                                         Significant increases in water consumption by power plants reflect the shift to wet-

                                      although, as discussed in the next section, when the stresses of climate change and
                                      shale gas mining in the region are factored in, the model shifts to dry-cooled CSP,
                                      which is less water intensive.

                             tion in water demand is accompanied by an increase in water cost (figure 6.22).
                                The reason for the increased water cost can be understood by examining the invest-
                             ment decisions for water supply infrastructure in the Orange River region under these
                             scenarios. A stricter carbon cap results in increased investment in water supply infra-
                             structure in the Orange River region relative to the Reference scenario (figure 6.23).
                             These incremental water supply investments in the Orange River are due to a shift to
                             CSP rather than coal under a carbon-constrained scenario, which shifts generation to
                             the Orange River region. These investments begin in 2030 to support large-scale imple-
                             mentation of CSP starting in 2040.
                               However, water demand in this region, which is still dominated by non-energy
                             demands, requires construction of a significant water supply scheme in all scenarios.

                                      Exploring South Africa’s Water-Energy Planning Challenges: The Scenarios
                                   However, this water supply scheme is not operating at full capacity when the decision
                                   is made to invest in dry-cooled CSP. This suggests that the increased cost of water is a
                                   determining factor in the choice.
                                      Figure 6.24 illustrates the increased demand from non-energy sectors under the Dry
                                   Climate scenario, which causes a degree of regional water stress in the Orange River
                                   region. This stress is slightly exacerbated by the advent of shale gas extraction, which
                                   takes place largely in this region. The increased demand triggers further investment in
                                   water infrastructure, which causes average water costs to rise enough to move some
                                   of the investment in CSP to dry-cooled technology (figure 6.25).
                                      The summary metrics for the 14 Gt Cap scenario under the effects of climate
                                   change (14 Gt Cap + Dry Climate scenario) show only small reduction in the
                                   increased water intensity from the shift to CSP based production in the Orange River
                                   region (table 6.7). Essentially, the water supply system appears to be resilient to cli-
                                   mate change’s effects on water supply and demand as currently understood,
                                   although increased water costs provoke changes in the optimal mix of wet- and dry-
                                   cooled coal and CSP technologies.

                                                               Exploring South Africa’s Water-Energy Planning Challenges: The Scenarios
07
     Conclusions
                                      The study reported here used new tools to examine the water-energy nexus and to
                                      explore the possibilities of integrated energy and water planning. The approach applied
                                      to the case of South Africa can be readily adapted to enable other countries to tackle
                                      their water-energy management challenges in a more integrated manner. A second
                                      study is already underway in China.
                                        Conclusions about the general approach to modeling the water-energy nexus and
                                      specific conclusions relating to the South African case study are summarized below.




                                      General Findings
                                      A critical finding of the study is that a national-level model for the optimization of
                                      energy systems can be readily regionalized to represent the locations of energy
                                      resources and power plants. The regional costs and constraints of water supply can be
                                      incorporated into the energy model to create a water-smart energy sector planning
                                      tool. In this study, options for new infrastructure to supply water to the energy sector
                                      were explicitly represented with their costs and availability.
                                         For the first time, as a result, a representation of the full cost of water supply has
                                      been incorporated into a sectorwide energy system expansion plan that takes into
                                      account the regional variability of water availability that needs to be addressed
                                      through the development of additional water supply infrastructure.1 The case study
                                      highlights the importance of the spatial component of energy and water resources—
                                      particularly in a country such as South Africa, where water availability varies widely
                                      from region to region—and the potential impacts this has on the overall cost of differ-
                                      ent energy technologies.
                                         The model used in the study, known as South African TIMES model “water smart”
                                      (SATIM-W), makes it possible to understand what water infrastructure will be needed for
                                      the energy sector, while continuing to meet non-energy water needs; when and where
                                      investments will have to be made; and how much it will cost to supply the needed water.
                                         Given that the planning, design, and construction of infrastructure requires long-
                                      term engagement, the case study demonstrates that the SATIM-W model is a valuable
                                      tool within an integrated planning approach that can help to ensure timely investments
                                      and delivery of water supply and treatment infrastructure for the energy sector.
                                         Another important finding is that water-system planning models, which generally
                                      take a basin-level approach, can provide data on the costs and feasibility of specific
                                      options for bulk water supply and infrastructure. Such cost and availability information
                                      is explicitly represented in the SATIM-W framework to derive water supply cost curves



                                       A recent study by National Renewable Energy Lab (http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy15osti/64270​

                                      power plant water consumption. It estimated water costs from various sources, but did not consider major
                                      water infrastructure investments.




90  Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus   Section 7
                                      Conclusions
pertinent to decisions about energy production. As noted in section 5 of this report,
SATIM-W separately calculates the capital, fixed, and variable operating and mainte-
nance costs and energy requirements of each water supply region and every water
supply scheme to arrive at the regional cost of supplying water. SATIM-W then weights
each water supply and delivery option (or scheme) and chooses the combination that
delivers the needed water at the least cost, resulting in a determination of the marginal
water supply cost. Thus, the model takes into account the spatial locations of proposed
energy technologies and the water-related factors (availability and infrastructure) on
which these technologies will depend.
   The model generates significantly different energy technology investment results
when the cost of water supply infrastructure is taken into account (compared to the
case where the costs of supplying water are not considered. For example, dry cooled
power plants are selected in water-scarce regions and significant reductions in water
consumption are achieved.
   The study investigated several policy scenarios specific to South Africa. The results
show that specific energy sector policies can have significant implications for new
investment in water supply infrastructure and, in some cases, can strand water supply
investments (and vice versa), reinforcing the importance of planning the water-energy
nexus in an integrated manner. Further development of the SATIM-W model and its
application to water and energy planning should be explored in subsequent phases of
the World Bank’s Thirsty Energy Initiative, which produced this report.




Findings for South Africa
Water for power in South Africa is supported by major interbasin transfers. Water and
energy planning must therefore take into account the significant regional variability in
water availability and the associated cost of water supply infrastructure. Even though
the amount of water consumed by the energy sector is a small percentage of all water
used nationally, it has already changed the regional water picture in South Africa—in
one region, Waterberg, energy comprises over 40 percent of all water demand.
   In addition to demonstrating the benefits of integrated energy and water manage-
ment planning, this report provides important insights into the costs and benefits of
policy scenarios that reflect the uncertainties of water and energy supply in South
Africa. These scenarios showcase how SATIM-W can inform energy sector policy mak-
ing, giving full consideration to the costs of supplying water. In addition, as noted, the
study results identify conditions that could result in stranded water or energy assets.
   Decisions about South Africa’s future energy mix will have significant consequences
for water-resource planning. SATIM-W identifies the water needs of the energy sector
by region and quantifies the amount and timing of specific investments in water infra-
structure needed over time. Virtually all water in South Africa is allocated, and future
demands will require new infrastructure to avoid taking water away from existing
users or compromising social and ecological sustainability in the relevant catchment.

                                           Figure 7.1 shows the timing of water infrastructure investments in key regions and
                                        under several scenarios. Olifants does not show much variation from one scenario to
                                        another, but Upper Vaal and Orange River will require significant new investments, par-
                                        ticularly under the Dry Climate scenario. An integrated approach to water-energy plan-
                                        ning can help to ensure timely investment and delivery of water supply and treatment
                                        infrastructure for the energy sector, while also reducing the likelihood of stranding
                                        major energy or water assets.
                                            When water costs are not taken into account in energy planning, SATIM-W calls for
                                        building wet-cooled coal-fired power plants, generating a 77.34 percent increase in
                                        cumulative water consumption for power generation and a 57.87 percent increase in
                                        cumulative water needs for the energy sector as a whole. But, given the distance
                                        between coal reserves and available water supplies in South Africa, as well as interre-
                                        gional variability in water availability, SATIM-W demonstrates that dry cooling makes
                                        economic sense in South Africa once the cost of water supply infrastructure (e.g., inter-
                                        basin transfers) is taken into account, even though dry cooling decreases power plant
                                        efficiency. This finding confirms the soundness of the decision by South Africa’s primary
                                        utility, Eskom, to employ dry cooling, a decision originally made for environmental and
                                        social reasons.

                                        Conclusions
   The generation mix is roughly similar for the Reference scenario, whether or not
water cost is incorporated.22 Renewable energy generation contributes less than
10 percent until 2040, and no new nuclear power capacity is built. However, in the ref-
erence scenario with water costs the power sector generates 1.3 percent less electricity
with coal and 2 percent more with renewable technologies.
   The additional investment cost of requiring flue gas desulfurization (FGD) sys-
tems at existing coal power plants33 and new coal-to-liquids (CTL) refineries under
two scenarios—Environmental Compliance and Dry Climate + Environmental
Compliance—dramatically reduces investment in CTL plants. Under these scenarios,
coal-powered capacity declines by 75 percent in 2050 as compared with the
Reference scenario. In addition, the FGD requirement leads to earlier retirement of
2 GW of wet-cooled coal power plant capacity by 2030 and reduces investment in
new coal plants by 3 to 4 GW in the 2045 and 2050 periods. In the Environmental
Compliance scenario, overall water use by the power sector actually increases by
just 2.3 percent, as CTL refineries and coal plants are replaced by more than 5 GW
of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity and 1.2 GW of concentrating solar (thermal)
power (CSP).
   The development of shale gas resources under the Shale Gas scenario signifi-
cantly increases power generation from natural gas compared with the Reference
(Water Cost) scenario. Although significant investment in water supply is required
for major shale gas development, the cost of water as represented in SATIM-W does
not appear to enter into the decision of whether to invest in shale gas for power
generation. The model shows a preference for shale gas generation over generation
from wind and CSP—it calls for neither of the latter when shale gas is utilized. In the
Shale Gas scenario, cumulative water consumption (2010–15) of the power sector
decreases by 14.9 percent as coal power plants are replaced by combined-cycle gas
turbine plants. Cumulative water needs for the overall energy sector also drop by
9.76 percent. However, the authors consider this finding preliminary, because the
cost of treating return-flow effluent is not yet included in the model for lack of data.
This analysis also does not include pollution risks for other water users from shale
gas development. A deeper dive into the issues posed by shale gas production
is planned.
  National climate change policy will have consequences for water-resource and
energy planning:


•	 The study’s two CO2 Cap scenarios reduce coal consumption and increase renew-
   ables from wind, solar PV, and wet-cooled CSP with storage. These scenarios also
   defer any new investment in CTL plants. Interestingly, both CO2 Cap scenarios sig-
   nificantly increase the cumulative water needs of the power sector over the 2010–50
   period (increases of 21 percent for the 14 Gt scenario and 25 percent for the 10 Gt
   scenario) because the model chooses wet-cooled CSP generation. However, the

                                                                   Conclusions
                                         overall water needs of the energy sector rise by just 4 percent and 3 percent with
                                         lower activity in the coal industry (coal mining, CTLs). In the 10 Gt CO2 Cap + Dry
                                         Climate scenario, some CSP capacity shifts to dry cooling, pushing down water use
                                         for power by 10 percent.
                                      •	 The CO2 Cap scenarios have the potential to strand coal assets. The 14 Gt CO2 Cap
                                         scenario reduces production at the existing CTL plant from 96 percent to 30 per-
                                         cent by 2035, with the plant decommissioned five years earlier than in the
                                         Reference scenario. In the 10 Gt CO2 Cap scenario, production at the plant is com-
                                         pletely halted by 2025, 20 years before scheduled decommissioning. Existing and
                                         committed coal power plants are less at risk under the 14 Gt CO2 Cap scenario and
                                         remain operational for their entire production life. By contrast, the 10 Gt CO2 Cap
                                         scenario entails early retirement of the existing coal plants and shifts electricity
                                         production from the Waterberg to the Orange River region. The stock of existing
                                         coal plants is retired by 2035, with idle capacity of 2 GW in 2050 under both CO2
                                         Cap scenarios.
                                      •	 The CO2 Cap scenarios also have the potential to strand water supply assets. These
                                         scenarios affect the cost of supplying water differentially, by water basin. Investment
                                         in coal power plants in the Olifants region appears most at risk under the 10 Gt CO2
                                         Cap scenario, as such plants cease operation earlier than those located in the
                                         Waterberg region. As a consequence, the cost of water in the Olifants region
                                         decreases. However, the cost of water in the Waterberg region rises as the water
                                         supply system comes to be underutilized owing to the early closure of coal-fired
                                         capacity, which effectively increases costs for the remaining users. This suggests
                                         that water supply infrastructure for the Waterberg is also at risk of being overbuilt if
                                         CO2 mitigation policy is carried through. However, if water and energy resources are
                                         planned in a more integrated manner, this issue could be foreseen and the water
                                         could be redirected to other uses.

                                       Planning for a drier climate (owing to climate change) would move investments for-
                                       ward, according to the model. Earlier investments in solar PV increase its capacity by
                                       1 GW in 2050. Approximately 2 GW of new dry-cooled coal capacity are added in the
                                       Waterberg region early on, offsetting the retirement of 3 GW of existing coal capacity
                                       by 2050. Under the Dry Climate scenario, accelerated investments in solar PV (which
                                       requires minimal amounts of water) and in dry cooling for thermal power plant
                                       result in a 6.39 percent decrease in water consumption for power generation and a
                                       5 percent decrease in the water needs of the energy sector as a whole. Under this
                                      ­scenario, CO2 emissions are also reduced by 1.6 percent, suggestion that early
                                       ­
                                       mitigation and adaptation policies could make South Africa more resilient to a
                                       drier climate.
                                         In contrast to coal capacity, wet-cooling is favored for CSP plants under the
                                      Reference (Water Cost) scenario. The results from the combination of the CO2 Cap, Dry
                                      Climate, and Shale Gas scenarios suggest why wet-cooled CSP is favored in the
                                      Orange River region, despite its general aridity: the region’s water supply comes from
                                      Lesotho and does not depend on local runoff. That supply, however, is highly depen-
                                      dent on future demands from other users. For example, when the effects of climate

             change are compounded by the added pressure of shale gas mining in the region, the
             model calls for a significant shift to dry-cooled CSP as the cost of water rises because
             of added demand from shale gas producers. In the Dry Climate + CO2 Cap scenario, the
             shift to dry-cooled CSP is accompanied by an increase in the cost of water tied to unde-
             rutilization of infrastructure built largely in response to non-energy needs. Therefore,
             although the model chooses wet cooling for CSP plants under the Reference scenario,
             dry-cooling policies may still make sense in order to ensure make the system more
             resilient to future uncertainty.
                South Africa’s water supply already demonstrates substantial resilience to regional
             climate change effects as these are currently understood. Regional water supply dis-
             parities that could result from climate change are mitigated by the flexibility of a
             nationally integrated water supply network. Indeed, most scenarios, with the exception
             of the 10 Gt CO2 Cap scenario, result in changes in system cost that are less than
             1 percent. At almost 3 percent, the change induced by the 10 Gt CO2 Cap is a notable
             outlier. In the context of the study, this finding highlights the potential resilience of the
             national system, but not necessarily of individual regional systems, particularly those
             that are not well integrated. In addition, trade-offs between the power sector, urban
             water supply, and water for agriculture need to be further explored, particularly for the
             key systems (e.g., the Vaal and Orange River).
                As shown in figure 7.2 the water intensity of the power sector under other scenar-
             ios is close to the intensity level generated by the Reference scenario with water
             costs, except in the case of the scenarios based on targets for reducing green-
             house gas (GHG) emissions, where the model favors use of some CSP plants using
             wet cooling.

                                          These findings exemplify how integrated and regionally disaggregated water-energy
                                      modeling and analysis can better inform decision makers of the potential costs, bene-

                                      water and energy conditions. In particular, the analysis demonstrates the importance of
                                      identifying a water-smart energy development plan in which infrastructure investment
                                      levels and water supply cost are taken fully into consideration. The analysis also dem-

                                      become stranded by future policy changes, shifting demands, or the relative efficiency
                                      of technologies used in different regions of the country, enabling planners to formulate
                                      hedging strategies aimed at minimizing the likelihood of such potentially costly and
                                      economically suboptimal missteps.




                                      Next Steps
                                      The SATIM-W model described in this report is an important first step toward an inte-
                                      grated approach to water-energy planning, one in which trade-offs, synergies, and
                                      opportunities are assessed together. Several different policy regimes were examined,
                                      and some limited sensitivity analysis performed. Although this case study captures the
                                      main uncertainties needed to prove the concept, institutional and technical follow-on
                                      activities have been identified to improve the quality of the results. A workshop is
                                      planned to bring energy and water stakeholders from government and the private sec-
                                      tor together to review the case study results and discuss appropriate next steps.
                                         Additional work in the following technical areas would improve various aspects of
                                      the model and further expand the coverage and insights to be derived from its use.
                                      These areas include:


                                      •	 Harmonizing the growth assumptions driving non-energy water demands and
                                         energy demands, which currently come from two different modeling frameworks
                                         (SATIM-W and water-use models) that are only broadly internally consistent.
                                      •	 Examining in more detail the economics of FGD retrofits for existing coal plants.
                                         This will require refinements to model the costs of FGD feedstock and disposal and
                                         the reduction in plant availability during FGD retrofitting.
                                      •	 Evaluating the impact on the energy sector of delays in the commissioning of water
                                         infrastructure.
                                      •	 Incorporating into SATIM-W a more detailed and disaggregated representation of
                                         non-energy water consumption in order to examine water-reallocation schemes,
                                         demand elasticity to cost, and the impact of water-use efficiency and demand side
                                         management interventions.
                                      •	 Incorporating wastewater streams, treatment plants, and related infrastructure from
                                         other sectors in addition to coal mining.
                                      •	 Incorporating into SATIM-W the cost of treatment options and handling of return-
                                         flow effluent in connection with shale gas production.




96  Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus   Section 7
                                      Conclusions
•	 Linking to an economic model to assess the impact of water-energy trade-offs on
   the economy as a whole, including the impacts on jobs, gross domestic product,
   and affordability.
•	 Linking water to a variety of biofuel feedstocks and other aspects of land use and
   food production in terms of both water and energy,
•	 Exploring approaches to incorporating the externality costs of power production,
   including health and environmental effects and the opportunity costs of water
   ­
   allocation and use.
•	 Better exploring the potential impacts and associated risks of future climate change.
•	 Using multiple techniques to examine future uncertainties—among them scenario
   sensitivity analysis, multi-stage stochastics, and Monte Carlo analysis.

The foregoing results demonstrate the value of the SATIM-W model as a component
of an integrated assessment methodology that can better inform decision makers of
the potential costs, benefits, and risks of alternative policies and technology choices
under a range of possible future conditions. In particular, the results demonstrate the
possibility of identifying major investments that could become stranded down the
road. Employing an integrated planning approach that looks systematically at the
development of both the water and energy sectors could help avoid such costly and
unproductive outcomes.
   The model’s initial applications, as described here, have clearly demonstrated the
importance and value of employing an integrated planning platform to ensure that
water and energy investments are intelligently planned in a least-cost manner. The
comprehensive approach made possible by SATIM-W should be further developed so
that it becomes the norm in policy formulation. This will be particularly important as
countries determine how their GHG reduction commitments will be realized in a way
that contributes directly to achieving related Sustainable Development Goals.

     Demand in
     South Africa
                                       Upper Olifants
                                       The Olifants catchment is almost fully utilized (table A.1), with a deficit predicted by
                                       2030 (table A.2), This shortfall will be hastened with the introduction of an ecological
                                       reserve (2020–25), which will reduce the water available for abstraction (that is, the
                                       process of taking water from a source) by about 200 Mm3 per year. Power generation
                                       ­
                                       now accounts for 23 percent of demand in the Upper Olifants. Despite plans for
                                       ­
                                       additional power generation in the catchment, Eskom foresees little growth in total
                                       demand because water-cooled power stations will be replaced by dry-cooled plants.
                                       Planners expect that after about 2025 water demand for power generation in the catch-
                                       ment may even decrease.

100  Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus   Appendix A
                                       Water Demand in South Africa
   There exists only limited potential for water resources development to meet the
future water supply deficit within the catchment, after which the demand will have to
be met by transfers from outside the catchment. The options include:


•	 Olifants River Dam: To be built in the middle Olifants, near Rooipoort.
•	 Ekurhuleni effluent: East Rand effluents, treated for phosphate levels, could be
   pumped into the Olifants.
•	 Acid mine drainage (AMD) reuse: The acidic water that is being discharged from
   unused coal mines in the upper Olifants can be treated and reused to meet the
   water demand in municipalities;
•	 Vaal Dam imports: Transfers from the Vaal River System to the Upper Olifants are
   another option; the infrastructure would require a pipeline and pump station
•	 Desalination: Technically feasible, seawater desalination may be prohibitively
   expensive
•	 Transfer from the Zambezi: For this to be feasible from a cost perspective it would
   need to be part of a scheme that supplied Lephalale and Pretoria as well as the
   Upper Olifants.

The Ekurhuleni effluent and Vaal Dam options would expedite augmentations to the
Vaal. In addition, water yields in the Upper Olifants could increase by 16.1 Mm3/a if
invasive alien plants (IAPs) are eradicated and illegal irrigation suppressed.




Integrated Vaal System
The Integrated Vaal System extends beyond the catchment boundaries of the Vaal River
and supplies water to approximately 12 million people, mainly in Gauteng. The system
also supplies water for Eskom’s coal-fired power stations, Sasol’s petrochemical plants in
Mpumalanga, and various mines in the North West and Free State provinces. The
Waterberg coalfields being developed near the town of Lephalale in the Limpopo water
management agency (WMA) (DWAF 2009) will also get their water from the Vaal.
   Currently, many of Eskom’s coal-fired power stations are supplied with water from
the Integrated Vaal System (table A.3). Although Kusile power station is under con-
struction and an additional power station is planned for the Olifants catchment, the
water transfers from the Upper Komati and Vaal Systems will be increased to meet the
demands of these new power stations and the water balance of the Olifants River sys-
tem itself will not be affected by these developments. The water supply to the existing
coal power stations in the Upper Olifants is estimated at 228 Mm3/a (Aurecon 2011).
   Transfers from the Lesotho, Thukela, Zaaihoek, and Usutu schemes all affect the
water quality for the Grootdraai and Vaal dams. Although the water quality of the trans-
fers is currently of an acceptable quality, there is a concern that in the future the quality

                                       require significant additional releases of high quality water from the Lesotho Highland
                                       Water Project (LHWP) to maintain an acceptable water quality standard.
                                           To meet the increasing water demand driven by development in Gauteng, the Vaal
                                       River System was augmented via major inter-basin transfer schemes from higher rain-
                                       fall areas such as the upper Thukela and Usuthu River and the Orange River in Lesotho
                                       via the LHWP  . See table A.4 for the water requirements in the Vaal system.
                                         Because the system is already overallocated, augmentation is the only way forward.
                                       Options include:


                                       •	 Treatment and reuse of AMD water: The acidic water that is being discharged from
                                          coal mines can be treated and reused to meet water demand;

                                  Lephalale (Waterberg) Area—Crocodile
                                  West/Mokolo System
                                  Water demand in the area will leap with the development of the Waterberg coalfields
                                  west of Lephalale, the construction of several coal-fired power stations and the estab-
                                  lishment of other industrial users such as Sasol. The expected growth in demand is
                                  presented in table A.5. Although power generation currently accounts for about 18 per-
                                  cent (or 4.3 Mm3/year), of overall water demand, by 2030 Eskom’s power stations will
                                  demand 79 Mm3/year, with an additional 20 Mm3/year required for coal mining and 15
                                  Mm3/year for independent power producers (IPP). This is a total 113 Mm3/year, or 54
                                  percent of the future demand.
                                     As with developments elsewhere in the region, demand has been stalled by con-
                                  struction delays related to the water-transfer pipeline. See the recalibration of demand
                                  for the early period (2009–15) and the extrapolation in appendix C (figure C.3, regional

                                           The available water resources in the area are already over allocated. Future demand
                                       will be met, initially, from the underutilized Mokolo Dam and then via transfers from
                                       the Crocodile West catchments. Transfers of water from the Crocodile to the Waterberg
                                       coalfields will come from the return flows from Gauteng’s northern urban and indus-
                                       trial areas (DWA 2010c). The Crocodile West reconciliation study shows, however, that
                                       this return flow may be insufficient; impacts on the Reserve and flows to the Limpopo
                                       must therefore be considered (DWA 2010c).

                             Orange River System
                             The Orange River System has a 0.9 million km2 catchment area and flows west from
                             the Lesotho Highlands to the Atlantic Ocean. The catchment has a west–east rainfall
                             gradient; with mean annual precipitation (MAP) in some areas of the Northern Cape
                             being below 100 mm per annum near the Atlantic coast. In Lesotho some parts of the
                             Orange catchment have MAPs in excess of 1,200 mm per annum (Schulze 2006). The
                             natural runoff for the Orange River basin has been estimated at 11,600 Mm3/year. The
                             current day runoff that is discharged at the river mouth has been estimated at 5,500
                             Mm3/year.
                                Concentrated solar power (CSP) and the recovery of shale gas will be the principal
                             drivers of future energy and water demand in the Lower Orange catchment. The
                             Orange River water requirements are summarized in table A.6.
                                Hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) to access the shale gas deposits in the Karoo
                             requires water, and water is scarce in this region, with many towns already facing
                             water shortages. The Orange River (or one of its tributaries) is the nearest large sur-
                             face-water source. In order to develop a provisional total regional marginal cost
                             (TRMC) for fracking, it has been assumed that water will be obtained from the Gariep
                             Dam and transported to the likely site. The alternative of using local groundwater
                             resources is also considered, although the availability of groundwater is uncertain and
                             requires detailed analysis.
                               With agriculture and industry both creating higher demand, the Orange River catch-
                             ment is seeing its water quality deteriorate. The water quality is also dependent on the

                                          Currently the water balance of the Orange River system shows a slight surplus
                                       (DWA 2010b). By 2020, however, the system is expected to be in deficit due to expected
                                       increases in demands and additional augmentation options will be required. The feasi-
                                       ble augmentation options include:


                                       •	 Boskraai Dam,
                                       •	 Mzimvubu-Kraai transfer: Ntabelanga Dam, and

     South Africa
                                       After decades of cheap electricity due to over-capacity, supply interruptions occurring
                                       for a few months in 2008 and restarting with greater intensity in March 2014, have
                                       brought energy to the forefront of public debate. This together with public concerns
                                       about environmental degradation and the safety of nuclear power, have made energy
                                       supply a contested policy arena. Meanwhile, the country struggles with evaluating the
                                       many options for creating future supply, while facing immense pressure to grow the
                                       economy and alleviate developmental problems wrought by unemployment, poverty,
                                       and inequality. Strategic energy-supply planning in South Africa is highly centralized;
                                       planning processes are scheduled at stipulated intervals for electricity (Integrated
                                       Resource Plan, IRP) and primary energy supply (Integrated Energy Plan, IEP) mandated
                                       in law as functions of the Department of Energy (DoE). These processes prompt vigor-
                                       ous public participation and also introduce vast amounts of information into the public
                                       sphere not only about how policy is made as a general matter but also the tradeoffs
                                       considered in South Africa’s unfolding energy landscape. This section summarizes this
                                       context for the policy environment where models like South African TIMES model
                                       “water smart” (SATIM-W) can be applied.




                                       Resource Supply
                                       The major energy-supply options are described in the subsections that follow.




                                       Coal
                                       Coal is the engine of South Africa’s economy, accounting for nearly 70 percent of the
                                       country’s primary energy supply. It is an important export product at 75 Mt/year and
                                       provides 92 percent of the fuel for electricity generation (DoE 2006; IEA 2014). In addi-
                                       tion, around 16 percent of domestic liquid fuel demand is produced by Sasol’s syn-
                                       thetic coal-to-liquids (CTL) plant at Secunda. Estimates of South Africa’s recoverable
                                       coal reserves range from 32,000 Mt (Prevost 2014) to 49,000 Mt (SACRM 2013), making
                                       them about the world’s sixth-largest (SACRM 2013) with a reserve/production ratio of
                                       more than 200 years.
                                          In 2012 South Africa’s total salable coal production was 258 Mt, of which 76 Mt was
                                       exported; Eskom utilized 125 Mt and Sasol 44 Mt, while the remaining 13 Mt was used
                                       directly in local industry (including pulp and paper, cement, and iron and steel; Chamber
                                       of Mines of South Africa 2013). On top of salable production, a further 25 percent of
                                       uneconomical mine product is stored as discard material. Coal discards are largely
                                       a byproduct of the export beneficiation process whereby ash content is minimized
                                       through mostly water-based washing to improve the calorific value of coal (SACRM 2011).
                                         The water needs for coal mining mainly take the form of water needed to wash the
                                       coal prior to delivery to the power plants.

                                       Energy and South Africa
Oil and Gas
In 1965 the South African government agency Soekor undertook exploratory drilling
to assess the country’s onshore oil and gas resources. Exploration of the inland Karoo
region was most active from 1965 to 1975; 24 boreholes were developed, leading to
the discovery of shale gas deposits (Vermeulen 2012). Although economically unvi-
able in an era of conventional drilling technology, the deposits may have potential for
extraction by hydraulic fracturing (fracking); government and industry have been
engaged in protracted negotiations over rights, and reserves are estimated at 17–485
trillion cubic feet (SAOGA 2014; SAPA 2014; US EIA 2013). This broad range reflects
the lack of conclusive data from exploratory forays.
   Water needs and impacts of oil and gas extraction. Shale gas production requires
large amounts of water. Its availability, price and treatment requirements need to be
taken into consideration when assessing a potential role for shale gas in South Africa,
particularly considering that the Karoo region is an extremely water scarce and eco-
logically sensitive area supporting a vulnerable marginal agriculture dependent on
groundwater (de Wit 2011; WWF 2015). Alternative water sourcing options such as
on-site recycling and use of saline water have not been considered in the current
analysis, but will be investigated in any follow-on analysis.



Uranium
Uranium is extracted in tandem with gold and copper (World Nuclear Association
2015). Although the quality of the uranium ores is generally low in South Africa, it is
cheaply extractable; beneficiation (the recovery of material from low-grade ore) has
been sporadic depending on the world market. Eskom procures enriched uranium for
its single nuclear power plant Koeberg from the international market (IAEA 2010).
   Water needs and impacts of uranium mining. The extraction of uranium is identified
as an additional source of water pollution with escalating levels of dissolved uranium
in surface waters reported where gold and uranium mining occurs (Winde 2009).
Furthermore, gold mining, which is the dominant activity, is another source of acid
mine drainage (AMD) and contamination of ground water with heavy metals (Naicker,
Cukrowska, and McCarthy 2003). The impact of gold and uranium mining on the quality
of water resources requires further study to better inform assessments of the impact of
these mining activities with models like SATIM-W. Therefore, the energy and water
requirements of uranium mining are grouped with gold mining, as part of industrial
energy demand and non-energy water requirements in SATIM-W.




Electricity Sector
Eskom dominates electricity supply in South Africa. Acting as the system opera-
tor, Eskom also owns and operates the transmission network and the distribu-
tion networks outside those owned and managed by the large cities. Its 27

                                       power stations produce a total nominal capacity of 41.9 GW, of which 85 percent is
                                       coal-fired. The balance of capacity is provided by nuclear, open-cycle gas turbine
                                       (OCGT), hydro, and pumped-storage power plants (Eskom 2013). In an attempt to
                                       address energy diversification, environmental degradation, and economic growth,
                                       the DoE is examining nuclear, gas, and renewables as alternatives through the
                                       ­
                                       legislated planning processes of the IEP and IRP; these processes are bolstered
                                       by wide-ranging ministerial powers that include the scope to determine the
                                       future ­generation mix. Eskom retails directly to consumers and municipal
                                       distributors. More recently, as a monopolistic retailer, Eskom is obliged to pur-
                                       chase from a growing pool of independent power producers (IPPs). The DoE deter-
                                       mines the purchase price through a competitive bidding process independent of
                                       Eskom.
                                          The granting of independent power-generation licenses by public procurement
                                       ­ rocess has become a feature of electricity policy. Three rounds of the Renewable
                                       p
                                       Energy Independent Power Producer Program (REIPPP) have been awarded, and a
                                       fourth is underway. Projects arising from rounds 1 and 2 are already generating
                                       electricity (see table 2.2). Procurement processes with predefined capacity targets
                                       are underway for independent, fossil fueled and nuclear power plants (nuclear is
                                       more controversial); nuclear vendor offerings have been reviewed by the DoE (GCIS
                                       2015). The first respondents to the DoE’s coal IPP Request for Proposals have passed
                                       the environmental approval stage (see II-2, above).
                                          South Africa’s procurement policy for generation capacity can be found in the
                                       2010 IRP. This takes the form of the “Policy Adjusted Scenario” (which is based on
                                       the results of modeling using a similar least-cost optimization systems model to
                                       SATIM) that maps out the capacity required to meet assumed demand to 2030.
                                       A decision was made to impose 9.6 GW of nuclear capacity as a fixed assumption
                                       with the first 1.6 GW of capacity to come online in 2023. The IRP explains that this
                                       assumption was “to account for the uncertainties associated with the costs of
                                       renewables and fuels” and to “provide acceptable assurance of security of supply
                                       in the event of a peak oil-type increase in fuel prices and ensure that sufficient dis-
                                       patchable baseload capacity is constructed to meet demand in peak hours each
                                       year” (DoE 2011).
                                          Three coastal sites for future nuclear plants, Banatamsklip and Duinefontein in the
                                       Western Cape and Thyspunt in the Eastern Cape have been identified thus far, and they
                                       have undergone Environmental Impact Assessments (Van Wyk 2013; World Nuclear
                                       Association 2015). It can be assumed that plants here would use seawater cooling as is
                                       the case with Koeberg.
                                          Further complicating the policy landscape of future energy supply sources is the
                                       growth in distributed generation; the National Energy Regulator (NERSA) is drafting
                                       the regulatory rules for Small-Scale Embedded Generation (NERSA 2015a). The
                                       Small-Scale Embedded Generation Programme (SSEG) of the City of Cape Town is
                                       now buying power fed to the grid, while total rooftop photovoltaics (PV) capacity
                                       in South Africa increased from 10 MW in 2014 to over 30 MW in March 2015
                                       (Donnelly 2015).

                                       Energy and South Africa
Water Needs of the Power Sector
On average in South Africa, 1 kWh of electricity consumes about 1.4 liters of water
(Eskom 2011). The world average is 1.2–1.5 liters/kWh (UN WWAP 2014). Furthermore,
water demands from the predominantly wet-cooled closed loop thermal power plant
fleet are somewhat below the typical mean intensity of 1.7 liters/kWh reported by
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for subcritical coal power plants cooled
with wet-recirculating systems (Macknick and others 2011). Water consumption and
other metrics for existing power stations are detailed in “Coal mine wastewater treat-
ment” section in appendix G.



Coal-Fired Power Plants
The country’s fleet of large coal-fired power plants utilizes a mix of dry-cooling and
closed-cycle wet-cooling. Including the dry-cooled units of the Majuba and Groovlei
plants, which have both wet- and dry-cooled units, the existing net capacity of dry-
cooled units is approximately 9,700 MW. This accounts for about 30 percent of Eskom’s
coal plant stock. The commissioning of the Medupi and Kusile plants would increase
the contribution of dry-cooled net capacity to ca. 18,000 MW, approaching 50 percent
of Eskom’s coal-based capacity. As in the case of the Kusile and Medupi plants, all new
power plants are to feature supercritical design (Eskom 2011).




Renewable Energy Plants
The country possesses considerable potential for solar energy in the arid north; the
coastline has favorable wind resources (Fluri 2009; Hagemann 2008). As a result,
the commissioning of utility-scale plants that rely on concentrated solar power (CSP),
PV, and wind power have emerged as alternatives to coal. The arid Northern Cape
Province offers the highest potential for utility-scale CSP generation, estimated at
500 GW in total (Fluri 2009), after considering available sunshine, proximity to trans-
mission lines, terrain, vegetation, and land use. Thus, the challenge for solar power
(and CSP in particular) is no different in South Africa than elsewhere: The best loca-
tions are far from water and transmission infrastructure. These are not insurmount-
able barriers, however, as we can see from our analysis here and from the plans
under consideration. For a scenario with high nuclear costs, the as-yet unapproved
IRP (DoE 2013) projected a maximum CSP capacity of close to 40 GW by 2045.
   South Africa’s REIPPP aims to reduce the country’s dependence on coal by allocat-
ing up to 19 GW in capacity to renewable-energy generation by 2030 (DoE 2013). Of a
potential allocation of 3.3 GW of CSP capacity by 2030, a total of 400 MW has been
allocated in the recent, third round of the program’s bidding process. Of this pool,
200 MW of CSP has already been commissioned, though it is not yet operational.
The 200 MW of CSP commits to build three plants in the Northern Cape, including

                                       150 MW of parabolic trough (KaXu), 50 MW central receiver (Khi), and 50 MW of
                                       parabolic trough (Bokpoort). For these dry-cooled plants, water is needed for mirror
                                       washing; boiler makeup water is estimated at 20 percent of the total requirement
                                       for water.




                                       Gas-Fired Plants
                                       The power sector is a potential strategic consumer of gas in the future as part of the
                                       move away from coal. Existing and future generation technologies include both
                                       open- and combined-cycle gas turbine (OCGT and CCGT) plants. Gas can be sourced
                                       in a number of ways, including the inland import of gas from Mozambique, coastal
                                       imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), and indigenous shale gas in the event fracking
                                       proceeds. Although not yet approved, the IRP’s big gas scenario suggests nearly
                                       70 GW of gas-based generation capacity by 2050 could be achieved given that shale
                                       could drive the price of natural gas down to R50/GJ by 2035, with supply boosted by
                                       regional conventional sources (DoE 2013).

                                       north of Cape Town. Koeberg employs once-through seawater cooling for its two pres-
                                       surized water reactors. Owing to the current practice of exporting domestic uranium ore
                                       and importing processed fuel rods, uranium extraction is essentially decoupled from
                                       the domestic energy supply sector. The demand for uranium in SATIM-W is that of pro-
                                       cessed fuel rods and does not reflect local mining activity. Therefore, as noted above,
                                       the energy and water requirements of uranium mining are grouped with gold mining
                                       as part of industrial energy demand and non-energy water requirements in SATIM-W.

                                       Liquid fuel production in South Africa involves six domestic refineries, four conven-
                                       tional and two synthetic fuel (synfuel) plants:


                                       •	 Three coastal conventional crude oil refineries: Sapref, Enref, Chevref
                                       •	 One inland conventional crude oil refinery: Natref
                                       •	 One coastal synthetic gas-to-liquids refinery: PetroSA (reduced gas supply has
                                          necessitated supplementary light crude distillate feedstock)
                                       •	 One inland synthetic CTL refinery: Sasol-Secunda.

                The coastal crude refineries are grouped together in SATIM-W because they have
                similar product slates and operating inputs. Diesel and kerosene dominate the product
                slate of the inland crude refinery; gasoline that of the two synthetic refineries a gaso-
                line heavy slate. For that reason, they are characterized separately in SATIM-W.
                Synthetic fuel refining plants can use either the coal or natural gas resource discussed
                above. These plants include numerous discrete chemical-processing units operating in
                close interaction and requiring both ancillary energy and water services. The resulting
                products are energy, water, and emissions intensive, particularly in the case of CTL
                refining. However, because no South African refinery uses once-through cooling, oil
                refining in South Africa is, on average, relatively water efficient in global terms (Pearce
                and Whyte 2005), although the synthetic refineries are considerably more water inten-
                sive. Table B.1 shows the relative production and water intensity of South Africa’s
                liquid fuels refineries.
                   South Africa’s first CTL plant, or Sasol 1, was fully operational in the mid-1950s.
                In the wake of the 1973 oil crisis, the country commissioned Sasol 2, followed by
                Sasol 3 in 1983 with rising crude oil prices. Located in the Upper Vaal, Sasol 1
                was converted to non-energy chemical production from natural gas feedstock and is

                                       sector. Sasol 2 and Sasol 3 in Secunda are the country’s remaining CTL plants. The
                                       Secunda plants rely on coal feedstock, supplemented with natural gas; plant design
                                       limits the share of gas. In 2006, the total CTL production capacity in South Africa was
                                       approximately 125,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, or roughly 246 petajoules (PJ)
                                       per annum. Of the total output, 93 percent is used for liquid fuels. Although located in
                                       Secunda, in the Upper Vaal water management agency (WMA) (Region C), water
                                       supply for the CTL refineries is sourced from the Upper Olifants.
                                          In 2006 the PetroSA plant in Mossel Bay had a GTL production capacity of
                                       approximately 45,000 barrels per day, or around 60 PJ per annum. By 2011 produc-
                                       tion decreased to around 45 PJ per annum owing to declines in indigenous gas
                                       production. The PetroSA refinery is on the coast and uses reaction and cooling water
                                       from the Wolwedans Dam, discharging treated effluent through an ocean outfall pipe.
                                       The plant does not use seawater for cooling, other than in times of drought when it
                                       can be supplied by an auxiliary desalination plant (Cloete 2015).




                                       Air Emissions from South Africa’s
                                       Coal-Intensive Energy Supply
                                       South Africa’s coal-intensive electricity generation and synthetic liquid fuels production
                                       have high environmental and health externalities that taint their economic and energy
                                       security benefits. This analysis does not report on the local air pollutants from coal use,
                                       although it examines the impacts brought by flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems.
                                       The study reports on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions given their importance to
                                       potential future policy decisions. In 2010 national GHG emissions were estimated to be
                                       on the order of 500 million tons (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq.). Coal-based
                                       electricity generation directly contributed 60 percent to the total, while CTL synfuel
                                       production contributed 5 percent (DEA 2013c). The release of CO2 owing to the sponta-
                                       neous combustion of discarded coal stores, in addition to methane (CH4) released
                                       through coal extraction, add another 1 percent to the national GHG inventory (Cook
                                       2013). fuel combustion alone, CO2 emissions made South Africa the 18th-highest
                                       emitter worldwide in 2010 (IEA 2012).
                                          In 2010 South Africa’s per capita fuel combustion CO2 emissions of 6.94 tons/capita
                                       placed lower, at 40th in the world; by comparison the United States and Australia
                                       emitted over 17 tons/capita (IEA 2012). South Africa was, however, ranked the 15th
                                       most carbon-intensive economy in the world, emitting 0.73 kg CO2/USD(2005) gross
                                       domestic product (GDP) purchasing power parity. The global average was 0.4. This
                                       ranking reflects continued dominance of exports by energy-intensive sectors, in partic-
                                       ular mining and metals processing. The coal-intensive energy supply furthermore
                                       results in comparatively high emissions of particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen (NOx),
                                       oxides of sulfur (SOx—predominantly SO2) although South African coal on average
                                       exhibits relatively low sulfur content (<1 percent).

     Future
     Climate
     Change
     Impacts
                                       With respect to climate change, Sub-Saharan Africa is thought to be one of the more
                                       vulnerable regions in the world. Although there is general agreement that temperatures
                                       will continue to rise, uncertainty remains about precipitation trends. Four possible
                                       scenarios have been identified by the Long-Term Adaptation Scenarios (LTAS)
                                       developed by the flagship research program of the Department of Environmental
                                       Affairs (DEA 2013a):

                                       •	 Warmer (<3˚C above temperatures for 1961–2000) and wetter, with more frequent
                                          and extreme rainfall
                                       •	 Warmer (<3˚C above temperatures for 1961–2000) and drier, with increasingly
                                          frequent drought and somewhat more frequent extreme rainfall
                                       •	 Hotter (>3˚C above temperatures for 1961–2000) and wetter, with much more
                                          frequent extreme rainfall
                                       •	 Hotter (<3˚C above temperatures for 1961–2000) and drier, with substantial increases
                                          in drought and somewhat greater frequency of extreme rainfall.

                                       The LTAS concluded that temperatures will continue to rise, but the level of increase
                                       would be dependent on the outcomes from global mitigation efforts. Under a
                                       business-as-­usual scenario, South Africa faces a hotter future, with average increases
                                       of >3˚C by the end of the 21st century. In the event of improved global cooperation,
                                       then significant reductions in Greenhouse gases (GHGs) will mean merely a warmer
                                       future for South Africa. For both scenarios, potential impacts would affect all regions;
                                       inland areas would experience greater increases than coastal zones and the
                                       mountains.
                                         Under both the “hotter” and “warmer” futures, precipitation remains the great
                                       unknown, although it was generally agreed that variability would increase under
                                       both scenarios; the hotter scenario would bring greater variability. Precipitation
                                       and its impacts would vary across regions.

                                       The LTAS studied the biophysical impacts across a range of climate futures, using a
                                       rainfall runoff model at a quaternary scale. Also of use was a water-resources yield
                                       model configured at a secondary-catchment scale for all of South Africa, including
                                       the major water-supply infrastructure, dams, and Interbasin transfers (IBTs) (DEA
                                       2014). These national models were used to investigate the potential impacts on water
                                       supply to the urban, industry and agriculture sectors in each water management
                                       agency (WMA), and they were used to contribute to an Integrated Assessment Model
                                       (x) assessing the potential economic impacts of climate change at a national scale
                                       and at the level of individual WMAs. This study found that South Africa national

                                       under the unconstrained emissions scenario (UCE). On average, the results show
                                       the potential for slight increases in total water supply (+2.3 percent) by 2050 and a
                                       range of impacts on different WMAs. For example, all scenarios show a likely
                                       ­
                                       reduction in the average annual water supply to Cape Town, part of the Berg WMA
                                       (WMA 19).
                                          Water supply to Gauteng (WMA 3 and 8) is not significantly impacted by climate
                                       change, primarily as a result of the integrated nature of the Vaal system, as well as
                                       the increase in supply as a result of the construction of the Polihali Dam in Lesotho.
                                       In short, the economic model found climate change had only a limited impact on the
                                       national economy through the water sector (DEA 2014).
                                          It is important to note that the above results are based on a national-scale analysis,
                                       although results are presented at the secondary-catchment and WMA levels. This
                                       analysis simplified the water-supply infrastructure and other local impacts on precipita-
                                       tion, catchment runoff, and water supply. The analysis used time-series simulations to
                                       model impacts on the average annual supply; it did not consider the effects of particular
                                       occurrences during critical periods nor the potential for more frequent droughts or
                                       extreme events. More specific results in selected WMAs or catchments would require
                                       more detailed water-supply models, as well as stochastic analysis of alternative baseline
                                       and future scenarios.




                                       Coal-Fired Power Stations
                                       Coal-fired power stations would likely be built in catchments A (Limpopo), B (Olifants)
                                       and C (Vaal). Although there is uncertainty regarding the average annual runoff by 2050,
                                       these catchments can anticipate median impacts ranging from no change to small
                                       increases.
                                          Future concentrated solar power (CSP) plants will be located in the Orange River
                                       basin (D). There, the median impact of only 5 percent reduction in catchment runoff
                                       will be complicated by a range of potential impacts that in some areas will bring as
                                       much as 50 percent reductions.




                                       Irrigation Demand
                                       While there is a wide range of uncertainty regarding the impacts of climate change
                                       on precipitation and catchment runoff across the country, the consensus is that higher
                                       temperatures will almost certainly mean more evaporation (and thus more irrigation)
                                       across all regions of the country.

                                       Future Climate Change Impacts
  In the UCE scenario, average median increases in evaporation (at 6.4 ± 1.9
percent) are predicted across secondary catchments. Some wet scenarios show
small reductions in irrigation from the Limpopo (A), Olifants (B), Vaal (C) and
Orange (D) catchments; dry scenarios show average annual irrigation increasing
by 25 percent.




Hydropower Potential
Hydropower does not play a major role in the country’s energy production. Although
reduced hydropower production at existing stations is a possibility; more hydropower
could be gained by retrofitting existing dams where models predict more rain and run-
off (DEA 2014). This latter scenario should be investigated further. Another major source
of hydropower is from outside of South Africa where the potential impacts of climate
change, particularly on the flow in the Zambezi River, should also be considered as this
provides a potential large renewable energy source for South Africa.
    Summarizing, climate change will likely reduce the availability of water and increase
its relative cost given competing needs, and likely increases from other users, particu-
larly agriculture. However, the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) has a range
of potential water supply augmentation options available in order to meet future
increases in demand. Given the importance of power production to the country, if there
is a reduction in the available yield from existing water sources due to climate change,
South Africa will likely see the implementation of alternative, more expensive water
supply augmentation options, as well as higher unit costs of these schemes as they
will deliver less water at the same price.




Catchment Runoff
Regional climate modeling of possible climate futures to assess t impact on the
average annual runoff for different catchments across the country is summarized in
figure C.2. The results show impacts of the unconstrained scenario from 2040 to
­
2050 for secondary catchments, indicated by the horizontal axis. A reduced streamflow
is shown for the western half of the country (D to K) and in particular the catchments of
the southwestern Cape (F  , G, and H), where all the climate models show reduced
streamflows. In contrast, large increases in runoff are possible for the east coast
(Q to W), which could result in greater flooding.

                                       The South African TIMES “water smart” (SATIM-W) model was used to examine the
                                       choice of future energy supply technologies in a water-constrained landscape. Figure D.1
                                       illustrates the intersecting dimensions that affect policy for the water-energy sectors. In
                                       this section we look at different scenarios for policy and investment strategies to help
                                       gain insights into the South Africa energy sector. Outcomes are then compared with
                                       the Reference scenario (Water Cost) in an effort to evaluate the costs and benefits of
                                       different policy options, and their possible impacts.
                                         Policy themes are collated into five cases that highlight the main drivers of invest-

             Scenarios
             Greenhouse Gas Mitigation
             In December 2015 at the Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework
             Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), South Africa committed to an emissions
             pathway termed peak-plateau-decline (PPD), which is the country’s Intended Nationally
             Determined Contribution (INDC) to this world body. This commitment was modeled as
             the imposition of carbon budgets limiting cumulative national Greenhouse gas (GHG)
             emissions to 14 Gt by 2050. A more restrictive budget of 10 Gt, which is indicative of
             South Africa’s contribution to limit the global temperature increase to 2°C, was also
             examined (see figure D.2).

                                       Dry Climate Scenario
                                       As explained in Annex C, Climate change will stress South Africa’s water supply and
                                       demand across regions and table D.1 summarizes the assumptions that SATIM takes
                                       into account for the “Dry Climate Scenario” for water supply and demand. These are
                                       modeled for the four regions of interest, utilizing the 0.25 percent estimates from the
                                       long-term adaptation scenarios (LTAS) (see appendix C). A sensitivity analysis was
                                       done for the water stress scenario to help identify possible risks or necessary alterna-
                                       tive decisions relative to the energy sector. In the model, changes in supply and
                                       demand as outlined below are applied from 2030. This scenario is not an exhaustive
                                       exploration of climate change impacts. It does intend, however, to analyze the effects
                                       of a potential drier climate.




                                       Shale Gas Scenario
                                       Explored in this scenario is the role shale gas might play in the supply of primary
                                       energy, and the consequent improvement of South Africa’s energy security and diversi-
                                       fication. Although not yet comprehensively surveyed, recoverable shale gas reserves in
                                       the Karoo region are estimated at 30 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of potential reserves by the
                                       Petroleum Agency of South Africa (SAOGA 2014) and as much as 390 Tcf of unproved
                                       technically recoverable resources by the US Energy Information Administration (US
                                       EIA 2013), with the latest public figure at 36 Tcf (Peyper 2015). This study limits shale
                                       gas extraction to 40 Tcf.




126  Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus   Appendix D
                                       Scenario Development and Key Assumptions
                                    Environmental Compliance Scenario
                                    This scenario examines recent legislative amendments requiring stricter air emissions
                                    controls for power plants, along with best practices in water management for coal mines.
                                       At present, water management best-practices are only applied to coal mining.
                                    A similar approach to shale-gas mining will be included in the next phase, examining
                                    the processing and disposal of produced water.
                                       Power plant emissions controls have focused on reducing flue stack emissions of
                                    particulate matter (Singleton 2010). Recent legislation to improve local air quality
                                    includes restrictions on combustion byproducts. Of particular concern is the emission
                                    of sulfur dioxide (SO2) owing to its high concentration in flue gas and its deleterious
                                    effects on the environment and public health.
                                       The legislative provisions relevant to coal thermal power plants are summarized in
                                    table D.2.
                                       Existing power plants had been expected to comply with the new emissions stan-
                                    dards by 2015; new plants will have to comply by 2020. A petition to the government
                                    has, however, postponed the application to most of the existing fleet of coal plants
                                    (SAOGA 2014). SATIM-W includes flue gas desulfurization (FGD) for new power sta-
                                    tions; the Environmental Compliance scenario (ENV) applies the minimum emissions
                                    standards to existing power plants. To date, none of the existing plants have FGD
                                    retrofits, and in light of the delay, the ENV is applied only in 2025.

                                          In addition to FGDs’ cost and water requirements, the ENV inflates the cost of coal
                                       production to reflect the management of mine water. A cost of 3 ZAR/ton of coal with
                                       an electricity requirement of 3 kWh/m3 is estimated.




                                       Water Quality
                                       Preliminary analysis of water quality is limited to the Waterberg (Region A) and is
                                       based on Eskom’s analysis of water from the Crocodile River for demineralized water
                                       production (Eskom 2008). Furthermore, water quality remains constant over the plan-
                                       ning period.
                                          The question of whether available water resources will limit futureenergy-supply
                                       choices in South Africa depends on the policy decisions made for an uncertain future.
                                       The selected model scenarios serve to inform such policy dialogue by highlighting key
                                       areas of focus and the factors that may affect future policy decisions.




                                       Key Assumptions
                                       Expectations for exogenous growth over the planning period are shown in figure D.3,
                                       and they assume a national average gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of
                                       3.1 percent per annum. The tertiary sector, which relies predominately on electricity,
                                       is expected to be the main driver of economic growth. The transport sector, which
                                       consumes the bulk of liquid fuels is expected to grow fourfold.1
                                       ­
                                          In this study, GDP was projected to grow at an annual average rate of 3.3 percent,
                                       with the relative share of the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors changing little
                                       over time.

                                          It is important to note that at present there is high demand for diesel from OCGT plants, which are utilized at
                                       mid-merit capacity to assist with the current deficit in electricity capacity.

                                        As shown in figure E.1, demand from the non-energy sectors is the main driver of new
                                        infrastructure for water supply (that is, with the exception of the Waterberg region). The
                                        demands of the energy-supply sectors are dwarfed by the demand for water in the
                                        Orange and Upper Vaal regions, largely because of agricultural activity in the Orange
                                        River and the expected growth in domestic and industrial demand in the Upper Vaal.
                                          The (Upper) Olifants is the sole region to experience a decline in water demand
                                        because the existing wet-cooled power plants are predominately located in that region,
                                        and their retirement is responsible for the reduction in demand. Agricultural demand

dominates in the region, accounting for approximately 50 percent of the total water
requirement; household and industrial demand is 30 percent of the total. A small por-
tion of the decline in water demand from the energy supply sector is due to the retire-
ment of the existing coal-to-liquids (CTL) facility, and a migration of coal mining to the
Waterberg from the period 2030–35 as less-economic coal deposits are abandoned in
the Olifants and Upper Vaal in favor of Waterberg coal.
   The water requirements in the Upper Vaal for energy supply are less than 1 percent
of the total. The two existing coal plants will be retired between 2040 and 2045. In addi-
tion, the country’s sole inland crude oil refinery consumes 0.65 Mm3/year, or 0.02 per-
cent of the total water demand predicted through 2050.
   As discussed above, the Orange River region will add 10 GW of wet-cooled
Concentrating solar power (CSP) capacity by 2050. The additional wet-cooled capacity
will call for less than 3 percent of the total regional water supply.
   In contrast, more than 80 percent of future water supply to the Waterberg is attrib-
uted to the energy-supply sector. Power generation accounts for 40 percent of this
total. New CTL plants in the region would consume close to 20 percent of the water
supply, while coal mines that use wet-beneficiation would total 25 percent. Water
demand in the Waterberg will spike due to continued demand for coal and the con-
struction of new coal plants. Dry-cooled plants will curtail demand, as previously dis-
cussed, reducing the total water-supply requirements to a potential maximum of
260 Mm3/year by 2050.
   The contrast between the Waterberg and other regions in the annual investment
expenditure required for bulk water supply is shown in figure E.2. The regional expen-
diture on infrastructure for water supply to reconcile projected demand is concentrated
in the Waterberg. Figure E.2 shows the breakdown of the water-conveyance infrastruc-
ture required in the Waterberg for water transfers to this arid region. Additional supply
options are facilitated by the interconnected regional system.
   The lack of natural causeways around the Waterberg will require substantial invest-
ment in supply pipelines for interregional water transfers. This is evident in the relative
sizes of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 supply schemes (figure E.2). The Phase 2 supply
schemes refer to multiple pipelines commissioned to meet local demand, whereas
Phase 1 relates to the investment in local pipeline infrastructure to fully utilize the
existing local supply system. The additional investment required to establish supply
options, such as the transfer of return flows from the City of Johannesburg (that is,
reuse and transfer from Vaal), represent a much smaller expenditure.
    Investments in water-supply infrastructure will lead to increased water-supply costs.
The cost of water in the Waterberg can be expected to leap if the growth of coal supply
proceeds unabated. Figure E.2 shows the annualized average unit cost of water supply
in each region, and these costs can be compared to the expenditures shown in
figure E.1. For the Waterberg region, the peaks for the average water-supply cost arise
from the lump sum invested in pipelines for water transfers. The peaks in the supply cost
are observed as the newly commissioned water supply infrastructure is initially under-
utilized, or operated at a low supply capacity. The unit cost of water-supply decreases
with gains in water volumes; transferred until the existing supply capacity is reached,
necessitating new investment for continued exploitation of coal in the Waterberg.

134  Modeling the Water-Energy Nexus   Appendix E
                                       Detailed Modeling Results
                In contrast, the average supply cost for the other regions is not expected to experience a
             similar escalation (figure E.3). Non-energy demand is responsible for cost increases for
             water supply to the Olifants. The expenditure stems from additional water transfers
             from the Vaal River system with interim use of treated acid mine drainage (AMD) water as
             2020 nears. The option of an additional dam in the Olifants is avoided. The average cost of
             water in the Olifants effectively doubles over this period from a base cost of R1.3/m3. The
             base cost is derived from the existing weighted average tariff to power plants (weighted by
             generation), which regionally ranges from 50c to R4/m3. The weighting is required as in this
             analysis power plants are not individually modeled, but represented by regional categories.
               The Orange River region is home to agriculture. The incremental demand for water
             here will increase the supply cost by approximately 40 percent through to 2050, from a
             base of 17c/m3 to 25c/m3. The increases predicted for 2045 will be driven by demand for
             wet-cooled CSP in this region.
                In the Waterberg, the average supply cost of R4.70/m3 in 2015 assumes the imple-
             mentation of a fully operational Phase 1. The cost is an approximate 700 percent
             increase to the existing local supply tariff of 60c/m3 (2010 ZAR) for the local dry-cooled
             Matimba power plant.
                A point of clarification: the supply cost would not necessarily reflect the price paid
             via the tariff. The tariff is usually structured to recover costs over 20 years; thereafter
             one sees a return-on-assets component. Furthermore, tariffs differ by consumer

                                                                 Detailed Modeling Results
                                       category. In reality, the energy-supply sectors in the Waterberg may be liable for tariffs
                                       higher than the costs tabled in this analysis, as the bulk of investment relates to energy
                                       supply. Agriculture and domestic consumers reliant on the local supply system would
                                       be subject to a lower tariff. Therefore, the average supply costs in this analysis are
                                       indicative of future water tariffs that may be required for timely investment in regional
                                       water supply infrastructure.
                                           It is also important to note that current water demand from the non-energy sectors
                                       is included in aggregate, modeled without consideration for reallocations or interven-
                                       tions to reduce demand. A refinement of the model incorporating the disaggregation
                                       of water demand from the non-energy sectors may therefore result in deferred invest-
                                       ment in regional water-supply infrastructure as water-use efficiency and value-added
                                       usage improve. But because investment in the arid Waterberg requires conveyance
                                       infrastructure (and demand is primarily driven by energy supply), one doubts that
                                       further consideration would affect investment needs in this region.




                                       Carbon Cap Scenarios
                                       Carbon policies seek to limit total cumulative emissions over the planning horizon, in
                                       line with the nation’s United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
                                       (UNFCCC) intended nationally determined contributions (INDC) and share in a future
                                       where the mean increases in global temperature are no more than 2oC.
                                          In all regions except the Upper Vaal, water-supply costs rise over time when a car-
                                       bon cap is applied. The Carbon Cap scenarios (green and orange) cut the use of
                                       hydrocarbon fuel—coal, gas, and crude oil from refineries (figure E.4). Decreased use
                                       of hydrocarbon fuels will lead to the underutilization of the Waterberg’s water con-
                                       veyance infrastructure; this in turn would cause spikes in the unit cost of water. The
                                       more carbon-restrictive scenario (10 Gt CO2 cap) would involve mothballing existing
                                       and newly commissioned coal plants, and in turn drastically cut water supply
                                       requirements in the Waterberg and Olifants, the regions of coal-intensive energy sup-
                                       ply. In the Waterberg, the Carbon Cap scenarios produce the highest water costs, but
                                       in the Olifants region these scenarios cut water costs because existing coal plants are
                                       retired early. As previously discussed, the cost of water in the Olifants region is
                                       driven by demand from the non-energy sectors, and this remains true across all sce-
                                       narios. A restriction on new investment in coal due to the carbon cap effectively
                                       shifts the cost of supply to the Orange River region owing to greater impetus for CSP
                                       capacity. A rise in the unit water cost is observed from 2030 under the 14 Gt CO2 cap,
                                       and even sooner, 2025, for the stricter 10 Gt CO2 cap. Although the unit water cost
                                       approximately doubles over the planning period, the Orange River region remains
                                       the lowest-cost region for water supply, with the maximum cost of bulk water supply
                                       approaching 50 c/m3.

                                In the Carbon Cap scenarios, earlier investment in the renewable energy technol-
                             ogy portfolio (solar and wind) is required. A 10 Gt carbon budget would also require
                             investment in 10 GW of new nuclear power capacity by 2035. The Carbon Cap scenar-
                             ios raise the cost of electricity by 30 to 50 percent in the near-term (2015–25), and by
                             40 percent to 70 percent in the latter period (2020–35), with the higher range attrib-
                             uted to the more restrictive 10 Gt carbon budget. Both the 14 Gt CO2 cap and the 10

                                       The Dry Climate + Environmental Compliance scenario, which represents the extreme
                                       water stress scenario, is shaped primarily by Environmental Compliance scenario and to
                                       a lesser extent by climate-induced changes to water supply and demand. Figure E.5 high-

                Model results for the regional impact of climate change on water demand suggest
             that a change in the unit cost of water cost would likely manifest in the Upper Vaal and
             Orange River which is largely because of increased demands by the non-energy
             sectors (figure E.6).
             ­
                The dip in water cost seen for the Waterberg stems from the early retirement of the
             older wet-cooled coal plants under a “warmer and drier” climate in the Olifants and
             Upper Vaal and the shift to new dry-cooled coal plants in the Waterberg. Approximately 2
             GW of new stock will be added to the Waterberg, and 3 GW of existing plant will be retired
             early by 2050. The decrease in cost reflects the increased utilization of water infrastructure.
                The Environmental Compliance scenario introduces treatment of lower water quality
             water transfers to the Waterberg, which reduces power sector investment after 2040
             (section 6). The increased cost of treatment associated with demineralized water produc-
             tion for boilers further reduces the attractiveness of coal-based energy supply (section 6).
             In addition, we include flue gas desulfurization (FGD) technology on new CTL plants that
             are not considered in the Reference scenario. The FGD technology, unlike the wet-based
             process for power plants,11 is presumed to be of semidry circulating fluidized bed design
             due to concerns over space restrictions for the existing plants (SRK 2014).


             1 
                The current model represents the cost of FGD as an annualized cost incurred over the technical life of the
             plants. Since emissions regulations are enforced in 2025, the model implementation may be responsible for the
             earlier investment in new CTL for the Environmental Compliance scenarios as compared to the reference in
             2020. The model has perfect foresight of commodity demand and supply costs over the planning horizon and
             opts for new CTL capacity without environmental costs by 2020 in order to minimize the cost of liquid fuel sup-
             ply over the planning period. The earlier capacity results in a marginally cheaper cost of production for diesel in

                                                                   Detailed Modeling Results
                                           Furthermore, as discussed in section 6, additional water treatment costs as inter-
                                       region transfers are presumed to be of lower quality. The lower quality water requires
                                       pre-treatment for demineralized use as boiler makeup fluid and for process use
                                       (i.e., stream generation for the Fischer-Tropsch process). The associated cost increase
                                       for treated water is equal to the marginal cost of water treatment for demineralized use
                                       for water transferred from the Crocodile River (Eskom 2008).22
                                          Retrofitting existing coal plants with FGD technology results in an earlier retirement
                                       profile, which reduces the regional water demand and defers investment in new water
                                       supply (see Appendix D.2.1). The added cost of FGD retrofits makes the existing wet-
                                       cooled power plants less economically attractive compared with the Reference sce-
                                       nario, where life extension of these plants is seen.

                                       Desulfurization Retrofits on Power Stations
                                       This appendix explores in some more detail the environmental compliance issues fac-
                                       ing the electricity sector (section 6).
                                          South African coal power plants have not yet installed (FGD) technology. But, as
                                       noted in the previous section, recent legislative amendments to improve local air quality
                                       include stipulations to control the emission of combustion byproducts. Dry FGD systems
                                       have lower capital costs but higher maintenance costs: the reagent is more expensive
                                       and waste disposal is required. Singleton (2010) identified a local preference for wet FGD
                                       systems because of lower lifecycle costs. Therefore, the FGD control technology repre-
                                       sentation in South African TIMES model “water smart” (SATIM-W) is presently restricted
                                       to the wet FGD process for all coal power plants. But this raises the following questions:


                                       •	 Is water supply a limiting factor on FGD retrofits, and if not, when could water be
                                          supplied?
                                       •	 Will the additional demand significantly affect regional water cost?
                                       •	 How will retrofits affect electricity prices?




                                       in 2020 than in the reference. This artifact suggests that a refinement to the CTL parameterization may be war-
                                       ranted in future, although this should have a minimal effect on the model results as it would only forestall the
                                       additional capacity until 2025.
                                       2 
                                          The model supplies water consumers with equal priority. As a result, due to the lower cost of supply, lower
                                       quality imported water is effectively transferred to the local non-energy sectors, while higher-quality local water
                                       is utilized for electricity and synfuel production. The water quality is unchanged over the planning period in the
                                       model, and therefore the results discussed here are indicative of how one level of water quality would alter
                                       planning decisions. In future work, the model could be refined to include a variation in water quality with time.
                                       This could result in either a further reduction in new coal and CTL capacity, or an escalation in local production
                                       (e.g., electricity and diesel) if regional capacity is increased as the energy supply sector would incur the cost of
                                       treating imported water of lower quality.

                                       Detailed Modeling Results
             In considering the above questions, it is useful to start by examining the retirement
             profile of existing coal capacity after the minimum emissions standards are applied
             (Environmental Compliance scenario) and under changing climate (Dry Climate sce-
             nario) (figure E.7, top). Located in the Upper Vaal and Olifants, the existing stock
             competes with the non-energy sectors, for which the water demands are greater.
             Starting in 2025, FGD retrofits result in earlier retirement of existing wet-cooled
             plants—compared with the Reference case, approximately 2 GW by 2050 (figure E.7,
             bottom). For the Dry Climate case, life extension of existing plants by retrofitting
             FGD only appears attractive for existing dry-cooled plant in the Waterberg where
             coal costs are lower.

                                                      Detailed Modeling Results
                                                 The regional lump sum investment cost for water supply is displayed in figure E.8.
                                              Investments are largely influenced by the dry climate case and the FGD retrofits to
                                              occur in 2025. The near-term water supply requirement in the Olifants is met with
                                              treated local AMD and additional transfers from the Vaal. These supply schemes are
                                              commissioned in the Reference scenario and appear sufficient for the Environmental
                                              Compliance and Dry Climate cases as well.
                                                 The increased water investments in the Upper Vaal and Orange regions are driven
                                              by the non-energy sectors response to the Dry Climate scenario. The decrease in the
                                              cost of water for an Environmental Compliance case results from the earlier retirement
                                              of existing wet-cooled capacity allowing for the reallocation of the water. Investment in
                                              water supply infrastructure in the Upper Vaal is delayed as a result.
                                                 Figure E.9 summarizes the key water and energy performance indicators. With the
                                              FGD retrofits by 2025, power generation becomes more water intensive. The value of
                                              1.25 l/kWh is 10 percent higher than the reference 1.14 l/kWh. By 2040 the earlier retire-
                                              ment of stock decreases the water intensity by a similar amount
                                                 Interestingly, the rise in water intensity by 2050 is attributed to the commissioning
                                              of a large wet-cooled plant in the Olifants (4 GW) for the Environmental Compliance
                                              scenario. Also contributing to the rise is the additional 1 GW of CSP   , which appears
                                              by 2045. As a result, the water intensity rises 25 percent from the reference value of

                                    Shale Gas Scenario
                                    By reducing imports, shale gas could increase energy security and diversification. By
                                    displacing coal, it could lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. But at what cost, with
                                    how much more water, and by realizing how many of these possible benefits? The
                                    availability of shale gas results in an earlier and sharper rise in water supply costs in
                                    the Olifants and Orange river regions as additional investment in water distribution is
                                    needed via pipeline and trucking. In contrast, the Shale Gas scenario lowers the invest-
                                    ment required in the Waterberg’s water supply and defers new investment until the lat-

                                                                   Detailed Modeling Results
                                          The main differences in the Shale Gas scenario, as compared with the Reference
                                       scenario, is the reduced investment in wind generation, with no further CSP com-
                                       missioned beyond committed capacity. The preliminary assessment suggests that a
                                       scenario of shale gas availability with an extraction cost of 55 ZAR (2010)/GJ lowers
                                       the cost of electricity generation by approximately 10 percent in 2030, when electric-
                                       ity generation from shale gas appears with 5 GW of capacity. A potential of 30 GW of
                                       capacity appears in 2040, which provides 50 percent of electricity supply. The esti-
                                       mated reserves are fully exploited by 2040, with annual shale gas consumption for
                                       power in the order of 1,700 PJ/year. In response to growing demand, the share of
                                       supply declines to 35 percent in 2050 as new dry-cooled coal plants in the Waterberg
                                       are selected as the next preferred economic alternative. The addition of new coal
                                       plants result in a lower utilization of the gas plants, which go from a 90 percent to a
                                       75 percent capacity factor. This is potentially due to the increased competition for
                                       shale gas by the other economic sectors such as transport and industry, where gas
                                       consumption displays an increasing trend. Shale gas consumption is primarily for
                                       electricity generation, which consumes 50 percent of available gas in 2030 and
                                       increases to 80 percent in 2040, thereafter declining to 70 percent of total shale gas
                                       consumption in 2050.
                                          A comprehensive consideration of water management for shale gas extraction was
                                       not possible for this analysis, so the results are preliminary. It is noted, though, that the
                                       water intensity of the Shale Gas scenario exhibits a sharp decline, departing from the
                                       Reference in 2030, to approach 0.2 l/kWh for the national average. The decline in water
                                       intensity is monotonic over the period, with the rate of change approximately 0.2 l/kWh
                                       as a result of the new dry-cooled coal plants.

                                       Both Carbon Cap scenarios result in higher water intensities than the Reference
                                       (figure E.10). The Carbon Cap scenarios limit the ability of the model to reduce water
                                       ­
                                       intensity of generation below ~0.9 l/kWh. For the 10 Gt CO2 Cap, the earlier investment
                                       in 10 GW of CSP capacity in 2030 (compared to the Reference case of 2050) results in
                                       an increase in water intensity of 10 percent. The inclusion of nuclear power in the
                                       10 Gt CO2 Cap case mitigates a further increase in water intensity, causing the water
                                       intensity to approach the Reference value of 0.64 l/kWh in 2035. The increase in water
                                       intensity attributed to the investment in wet-cooled CSP is offset by the large expan-
                                       sion of capacity in solar photovoltaics (PV) in the late term (2040–50). Almost 50 per-
                                       cent (25 GW) of the 55 GW of total capacity appears during this period for both
                                       Carbon Cap scenarios.

              CO2 Emissions
              The effect of the Carbon Cap scenarios is also evident in the GHG emissions over time
              (figure E.11). The 14 Gt CO2 cap prevents further CTL expansion, and the plant is fully
              utilized until its scheduled decommissioning in 2040. Emissions from the power sector
              exhibit the advocated Peak-Plateau-Decline trajectory, with emissions peaking at
              approximately 275 Mt CO2eq by 2030. For the 10 Gt CO2 cap, emissions from both the
              refineries and the power sectors plummet after 2020.

                                           Emissions from the Shale Gas scenario depart from the Reference in 2030 with the
                                       onset of shale gas utilization for power. Emissions are reduced by 30 percent (250 Mt
                                       CO2eq) compared to the Reference case of 356 Mt CO2eq in 2040. However, if the esti-
                                       mated reserve of 40 Tcf is fully allocated by 2040, a resort to economical coal for elec-
                                       tricity supply erodes the emissions savings to 12 percent of the Reference (375 Mt
                                       CO2eq). Within the refineries sector, reduced demand for liquid fuels owing to the
                                       introduction of gas-combustion vehicles reduces further investment in CTL from 2045
                                       with a concomitant decrease in emissions of 20 percent by 2050 as compared to the
                                       Reference case (95 Mt CO2eq).
                                           Although the Dry Climate scenario has little effect on the Reference emissions
                                       baseline for both sectors, the Dry Climate + Environmental Compliance scenario has
                                       interesting implications for CTL refineries (see figure E.12). The Environmental
                                       Compliance scenario causes an earlier investment in new CTL capacity in the
                                       Waterberg than in the Reference case. This is most likely a model decision that deems
                                       it cost-effective to offset the future cost of environmental compliance in the prevailing
                                       five years. The stricter 10 Gt CO2 cap causes existing CTL plants to retire ahead of
                                       schedule by 20 years, which slashes the emissions from refineries, with crude oil
                                       refineries emitting the remaining ~3 Mt CO2-equivalent.

                                       approach permits additional categories.

                                                          region D.
                                       U1WA-H1-D:	        Cost for a specific mode of delivery (e.g., by pipeline) attributed to

                                       Note: Region D has different delivery modes for the technologies represented and this
                                       results in a sub-regional water supply system that is differentiated by an additional
                                       regional index. The subregional supply systems are labeled D1 and D2. The remaining
                                       regions combine supply and delivery costs, a move that simplifies the implementa-
                                       tion and naming conventions adopted.

Regional Water Supply Systems and
Individual Schemes
Each regional water supply system is distinguished by an appended region code.
Where possible, the supply and delivery (transmission) costs as elaborated in Task 1
are combined to simplify implementation.
  In region D, the different delivery costs for the shale gas and concentrated solar
power (CSP) sectors rendered this impossible. Delivery is modeled as a distinct com-
ponent, as explained below.

•	 Shale gas may bring additional development of the energy sector in the region,
   possibly including gas-to-liquids (GTL), open-cycle gas turbine (OCGT), and com-
   bined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) technologies. Because CSP technologies are located
   in the North Cape, delivery costs for shale-gas mining include all these technologies,
   assuming they would be co-located.
•	 The REWS for region D is more complex than for other regions because of the
   multiple delivery options. This is especially true for shale-gas mining, which has
   three delivery routes: bulk pipeline, truck, and piped onsite groundwater. In the
   model this is represented as modal shares, which can vary over time. For example,
   truck delivery would most likely dominate the initial development phase of shale
   gas sector, with a bulk pipeline potentially reducing the requirement for vehicular
   transport as the sector matures and additional energy-supply-sector technologies
   emerge, such as gas-fired electricity generation and/or GTL production.
•	 For the above reasons, as depicted in the REWS diagram for Region D, the water
   supplied to consumers is split into subregional systems: D1, CSP region; and D2,
   shale gas energy technologies (such as GTL and CCGT) and shale gas mining.
•	 Each scheme has a commodity attribute water quality with the existing supply
   system set as the reference (level 0).




Parameterization of Water Supply Technologies
The model parameters for implementing the regional water supply systems in
SATIM-W are summarized below in table F      .1. For the treatment technologies, a simpli-
fied expression is given as an alternative should levelized costs be preferred. This may
occur if a treatment cost is relatively small and would apply to primary treatment. As
previously discussed, Region D requires the delivery component to be separated.
   Some schemes have construction lead times. For example, this applies to the case
of the use of acid mine drainage (AMD) as an interim option should the cheaper Vaal-
Usutu scheme be unavailable when the DWA water demand forecast need for addi-
tional supply. The construction lead times are mostly derived from the Department of
Water Affairs (DWA) study of the marginal cost of water for future supply options and
modified where more recent data exists (DWA 2010a).

                                 Coal Mines
                                 With the exception of the Majuba plant, all coal-fired plants are linked to a coal mine
                                 which supplies the plants via a run-of-mine design, the majority of which are conveyor
                                 systems. In the aggregated representation, coal supply to the power sector incurs no
                                 distribution cost (see figure G.1). Also shown in the figure are the associated fugitive
                                 emissions and additional upstream supply. In South African TIMES model (SATIM),
                                 commodity demand for coal-mining activity is captured in the mining subsector under
                                 industry while supply and distribution are implemented in the supply sector. Work is
                                 underway, however, to place coal mining—both opencast and underground—in the
                                 supply sector.
                                    SATIM-W conforms to the current SATIM representation of coal commodities,
                                 which define three calorific grades of coal—high, low, and discard. Current power-
                                 generation technologies rely on low-grade coal. Future Fluidized Bed Combustion
                                 technologies will however use discard coal. Table G.5 lists the calorific value
                                 design range of the fleet of plants built for low-grade coal. An average calorific
                                 value of 21 MJ/kg is obtained for low-grade coal by weighting plant capacity and

                                           Regional distribution costs are taken from the South African Coal Road Map
                                       (SACRM) study, as shown in table G.6. For the coastal coal build option, additional dis-
                                       tribution cost is required for transport beyond the Richards Bay Terminal (RBT). The
                                       cost for intraregional coal distribution within the Central Basin is used as an estimate.
                                          Estimates of water consumption for coal mining are given in table G.7.
                                          Table G.8 lists, in energy units, the estimated consumption of energy commodities
                                       by coal mines per unit of coal produced. The values are estimated from data obtained
                                       from the annual reports of large coal mines (Exxaro 2013; Anglo American 2007).

                                       In order to attribute a cost of treating water for environmental discharge in SATIM-W,
                                       data from The Olifants River Project was used to assess the feasibility of processing
                                       mine water in the Olifants water management area (WMA). It examined a number of
                                       collieries with respect to two water-treatment scenarios: (1) treat and discharge, and (2)
                                       treat and supply to towns (Golder and Associates 2012). The costs of the first option for
                                       selected collieries are summarized in table G.9. The costs are indicative of the treat-
                                       ment required for 146.5 ML/day (53 Mm3/a).
                                          In SATIM-W, Option 1, which is the lower cost option, is chosen as the Reference
                                       case for coal mining environmental best practice. The costs are indicative for
                                       Region B in SATIM-W, but are applied to Regions A and C as well. The costs in
                                       table G.9 are adjusted to reflect the new capacity required, and therefore only the
                                       capital costs for new plants are used. The effect is to increase the unit cost of treat-
                                       ing effluent. The adjusted costs required for implementation in SATIM-W are given
                                       in table G.10.
                                          The volumes of mine decant do not necessarily correlate with the amounts required
                                       for coal washing; aside from coal-washing slurry, totals may include water pumped out
                                       after mining has ceased. To mitigate acid mine drainage (AMD) after the mining has
                                       ceased, mine operators are required to remove any remaining water via pumping. This
                                       cost is attributed to mining activity, so the volume of acid mine drainage (AMD) treated
                                       over the production life of a region is estimated per ton of mined coal. This volume
                                       assumes an average lifetime of 100 years of mining, which includes removal of excess
                                       water via pumping. Regional coal reserves are estimated from Prevost (2014).
                                          A first-order estimate is achieved by factoring the annual treatment of effluent at
                                       53 Mm3/annum (The Olifants River Project) needed to extract 20,000 Mt of coal over
                                       a 100-year production life for the Central Basin. The Highveld coalfields (ca. 30 per-
                                       cent of reserves) are estimated to have a storage or residual volume of 653 Mm3 of
                                       mine water produced by past and future mining activity (Golder and Associates
                                       2012). The residual volume represents the accumulated mine water in existing and
                                       abandoned mines. An estimate of 1,300 Mm3 (double the existing volume) for the

                                       Central Basin is used. This gives a factor of 0.33 liters of effluent treated per kg of
                                       coal mined (or 0.33 Mm3/Mt); this factor is applied to the three coal mining regions in
                                       SATIM-W. The sensitivity to the residual volume gives a range of -10 percent to +30
                                       percent for the factor.
                                          For a 20-year treatment plant life, using a discount rate of 8 percent, the cost
                                       amounts to about 6 (ZAR)/t of coal mined. For a weighted average calorific value of 20
                                       MJ/kg and a net efficiency of 33 percent for electricity generation, this equates to a cost
                                       of 3c/kWh of electricity to address water pollution. This base cost would vary with the
                                       price of electricity, energy intensity of treatment, and increasing volumes of effluent
                                       being treated. The modeling framework allows these factors to be considered.
                                       Nkambule and Blignaut (2012) attribute an externality cost of coal mining and transport
                                       in South Africa in the range of 20.24 c/kWh and 39.3 c/kWh. Their analysis attributes
                                       less than 1 percent of the cost to water pollution, with the opportunity cost of water
                                       dominating the price.

                                       System (REWS)
                                       See below for a simplified REWS diagram for coal mining in SATIM W. The water
                                       needs for coal mining is taken to be of basic quality. As with power plants, coal mines
                                       are disaggregated by regional water supply systems. Coal is delivered to power plants
                                       is via regional distribution. Region A contains the Waterberg deposits; Regions B and
                                       C cover the Central Basin. The distribution technologies are color-coded in the REWS
                                       to show similar costs. Also included is the rail link to the Richards Bay Export Terminal
                                       (RBT). A coastal-build scenario near the RBT is selected as the most likely given the
                                       area’s existing high-capacity transport infrastructure. As the cost for transport to RBT
                                       from either B or C is similar, only transport from either region is necessary in the
                                       model. In the REWS, Region C is chosen. As shown in figure G.2, the REWS diagram
                                       and selected for SATIM-W is the inclusion of the cost of a water treatment facility for
                                       discharge mine water.

                                       Water and Shale Gas Extraction
                                       Figure G.4 displays the cumulative gas produced, and the volumes of water required,
                                       for the Barnett shale production region in Texas. The chart indicates a strong correlation
                                       between total gas production and water use. Although the Karoo region is geologically
                                       similar to the Barnett region, a Soekor exploration found dolomite dykes (Vermeulen
                                       2012); these present a challenge as they might act as conduits for fracking fluid and gas
                                       to migrate into shallow aquifers.
                                          To obtain an average or levelized water-withdrawal rate for the extraction of shale
                                       gas, this analysis used the estimated total volume of water withdrawn for a given pro-
                                       duction life for the Karoo region. Assuming that 1 Tcf ~ 1000 PJ, the water intensity
                                       required for shale gas extraction in the Karoo is estimated at 17,000 m3/PJ. The local
                                       geology and other factors (such as water quality and extraction methodology) will
                                       influence water intensity, and so that this value is subject to refinement.
                                          Aside from the quantity of water required, the chemical composition of the volume
                                       of returned fracturing fluid might be a source of water pollution (Royal Academy of
                                       Engineering 2012). Vengosh and others (2014) reported of number environmental
                                       breaches caused by shale gas extraction in Pennsylvania therefore recommend that the
                                       industry adopt a zero liquid effluent discharge (ZLED) policy due to the potential

                                       cient fleet provides additional incentive for the life extension beyond their planned
                                       decommissioning without the FGD option. Therefore existing large plants that
                                       undergo FGD retrofits in SATIM-W have their decommissioned schedule deferred by
