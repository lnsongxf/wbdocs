1. The Malaysian economy accelerated to 5.6 percent (y/y) in 1Q 2017 (4Q 2016: 4.5 percent),
   led by stronger domestic demand (Figure 1). Private sector consumption continued to be
   the main driving factor behind the robust growth during the period. On the external front,
   despite higher export growth, underpinned by strong manufactured exports and
   improvement in commodity exports, strong imports reduced external contributions to
   GDP growth. There was also additional support coming from higher public consumption
   and investment during the period.

2. Private consumption remains the primary anchor of economic growth (Figure 2). Private
   consumption keeps expanding strongly (1Q 2017: 11.7 percent, 4Q 2016: 8.1 percent, q/q,
   saar), broadly driven by stable labor market conditions and continued wage growth. Also,
   ongoing government income-support measures, particularly the Bantuan Rakyat
   1Malaysia (BR1M) cash transfers, saw an increase in the transfer amount. Additionally,
   seasonal factors, such as festival spending, provided a further boost to private
   consumption. Reflecting this, the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research Consumer
   Sentiment Index rose to 76.6 in 1Q 2017, up from 69.8 in from 4Q 2016.

3. Private investment growth accelerated supported by a more optimistic external and
   domestic environment. Private investment has accelerated (1Q 2017: 12.9 percent; 4Q
   2016: 4.9 percent, y/y) supported by capital spending in machinery and equipment,
   following the implementation of several large-scale projects in the manufacturing sector
   and ongoing investments in the services sector. Investments in the manufacturing sector
   came largely from the electrical and electronics (E&E) subsector, while the transport and
   storage subsector led the investment in the services sector. The stabilization in global
   commodity prices also reinvigorated investments in the oil and gas sector. Furthermore,
   improved business sentiment, following a better international economic environment and
   strong domestic demand, was also a positive factor in supporting private investment.

4. Public sector consumption and investment has accelerated in early 2017. Public
   expenditure increased (1Q 2017: 7.5 percent; 4Q 2016: -4.2 percent, y/y) mainly driven by
   spending in salaries/emoluments, and supplies and services. Public investment also grew
   (1Q 2017: 3.2 percent; 4Q 2016: -0.4 percent, y/y) due to increased spending by public
   corporations on fixed assets. During 1Q 2017, Parliament passed a supplementary bill for
   government expenditures in 2016 amounting to RM4.1 billion, mainly to fund for
   additional expenditures in selected ministries including Education, Transport, and
   Health. Nonetheless, the approved bill does not affect the government’s fiscal deficit target
   of 3.1 percent of GDP for 2016.1

5. On the supply side, turnaround in the agriculture sector was a key contributor to
   economic growth. As the negative effects from El Niño waned, the agriculture sector,
   including a surge in rubber production, outperformed the rest of the sectors (1Q 2017: 23.6
   percent, q/q, saar). The services sector also accelerated (1Q 2017: 7.4 percent, q/q, saar),
   largely driven by the information and communication, and finance and insurance subsectors.
   In the manufacturing sector, the E&E subsector continued to lead the growth of the sector,
   in line with the continued increase in global demand for semiconductors. The construction
   sector was largely supported by civil engineering projects (petrochemical, transportation,
   utilities) and residential buildings segments, while the mining sector recorded a small
   contraction following lower oil production in Sarawak and West Malaysia, due to OPEC’s
   agreement in January 2017 to cut production.

6. For 2016, the Malaysian economy grew at 4.2 percent (y/y) (2015: 5.0 percent) against a
   more challenging economic environment. Economic growth performance in Malaysia
   was affected by adjustments to lower commodity prices and lower economic growth in
   advanced economies, which affected external demand. Private sector consumption grew
   at 6.1 percent in 2016 (2015: 6.0 percent), remaining the main engine of growth. This was
   bolstered by stable labor market and steady wage growth, as well as various income-
   supporting measures including higher minimum wages and civil servants’ salaries. Public


1
 The supplementary bill approved the transfer of surplus allocation in development expenditure (DE) to operating expenditure (OE), and the use
of funds which have been allocated for Contingency Spending. As such, no additional expenditures were incurred by the government.
        consumption grew at a slower pace to 1 percent (2015: 4.4 percent) driven by ongoing
        fiscal consolidation efforts. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) expanded moderately by
        2.7 percent in 2016 (2015: 3.7 percent) supported by investments in the manufacturing and
        services sectors. Investment in the mining sector continued to be constrained by lower oil
        prices.

7. On the supply side, all economic sectors expanded in 2016, with the exception of the
   agriculture sector. The services sector recorded a higher growth of 5.6 percent in 2016 (2015:
   5.1 percent) while the manufacturing sector grew by 4.4 percent in 2016 (2015: 4.9 percent),
   led by firm growth of the E&E segment and steady demand for food-related products and
   construction-related materials. Growth in the mining sector moderated to 2.2 percent
   (2015: 4.7 percent) given the low global commodity prices. The construction sector
   moderated slightly to 7.4 percent (2015: 8.2 percent), supported by ongoing construction
   of transportation and utilities projects as well as expansion of the residential sub-sector.
   In the agriculture sector, growth contracted by 5.1 percent (2015: 1.2 percent), as the
   production of crops, particularly palm oil was affected by El Niño phenomenon.

8. Inflation peaked in 1Q 2017, driven by higher transport and fuel prices (Figure 3).
   During the quarter, inflation was on an uptrend before peaking at 5.1 percent (y/y) in
   March 2017, the highest level since November 2008. This was explained by the increase in
   the index of transport group, driven by the upward adjustment in domestic fuel prices.2
   Other reasons were the low base effect from last year, and higher food prices due to
   increase in prices of fish and other seafood due to unfavorable weather conditions at the

    The average price of 1 liter of RON95 petrol was RM2.29 in March 2017, compared to RM1.60 in March 2016.
        beginning of the year as well as increase in the prices of cooking oil following the removal
        of cooking oil subsidy in November 2016. The higher inflation trend is expected to
        continue throughout 1H 2017 before gradually easing subsequently. In April 2017,
        inflation moderated to 4.4 percent (y/y).

9. Although indications of second-round effects of inflation are minimal, concerns about
   increases in the cost of living remain. This is the case in particular of the lower-income
   group, which allocates almost 40 percent of its monthly expenditure on food. This is more
   pronounced especially among those in highly urbanized states which saw higher increases

10. Labor market conditions remain strong. As at March 2017, the unemployment rate
    declined to 3.4 percent from 3.5 percent in January and February 2017. Similarly, the labor
    force participation rate was sustained at 67.7 percent as at end March (Figure 5). Private
    sector wage growth during 1Q 2017 was sustained at 4.5 percent (y/y). Stronger wage
    growth in the services at 5.1 percent (4Q 2016: 3.7 percent) helped to mitigate the
    moderating wage growth in the manufacturing sector during the quarter.

11. The report on annual salary and wages3 showed that overall wage growth remained
    steady and above inflation in 2016 (Figure 6). Median nominal monthly wages increased
    by 6.2 percent in 2016 (2015: 6.3 percent) and remaining well above inflation, which was
    below 2 percent over the same period. The median wage growth in urban areas of 7.5
    percent outpaced growth in rural areas (4.6 percent). The growth in men’s average wages

        The increase in the amount of BR1M’s cash handouts has further provided support to
        household income.

12. Stable labor market conditions and steady wage growth was accompanied by an
    increase in labor productivity in 2016. For 2016, unemployment rate remained low at 3.5
    percent, albeit slightly higher than its long-term average of 3.0 percent. Labor force
    participation also was stable at about 67 percent. The steady wage growth observed in
    2016 was in tandem with a slight improvement in labor productivity, which increased
    from 3.4 percent in 2015 to 3.5 percent in 2016,4 with the manufacturing and services sectors
    registering the highest level of labor productivity at 1.4 percent and 2.8 percent,
    respectively. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the labor productivity still trails regional
    and other high-income economies.

    Malaysia Productivity Corporation estimate (http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/msia-labour-productivity-growth-unsatisfactory).
13. Gross exports performed strongly due to both manufacturing and commodities exports.
    Exports significantly increased (1Q 2017: 21.8 percent; 4Q 2016: 11.8 percent, q/q, saar),
    with manufactured exports mainly driven by higher exports of semiconductor devices to
    the US, China and regional economies. The broad-based improvement in commodity
    prices also contributed to higher commodity exports, which also benefitted from higher
    export volumes of crude palm oil (CPO), liquefied natural gas (LNG) and crude oil.

14. Gross imports rose due to larger imports of capital and intermediate goods (Figure 8).
    Capital imports increased (1Q 2017: 42.0 percent, y/y) largely due to purchases of high-
    value items, including oil and gas vessels and several aircraft. Reflecting the higher
    manufacturing exports, intermediate imports also rose by 27.8 percent (y/y). At an
    aggregated level, gross imports in 1Q 2017 rose 48.5 percent (q/q, saar) (4Q 2016: 11.7
    percent).

15. A widening services deficit contributed to the declining of the current account. The
    current account surplus declined to 1.6 percent of GDP in 1Q 2017 (4Q 2016: 3.8 percent)
    (Figure 7), primarily driven by a lower goods surplus, as the increase in imports outpaced
    the increase in exports. Also, the services deficit continued to grow during the quarter and
    increasing by 15.3 percent from 4Q 2016, led by higher payments for transportation and
    construction services despite an improvement of the travel surplus.

16. The central bank (Bank Negara Malaysia, BNM) kept the overnight policy rate at 3.00
    percent in the most recent monetary policy committee meeting. In its May monetary
    policy statement, BNM indicated that it expects the expansion in the global economy to
    continue with growth in emerging economies continuing, supported by strong external
    demand. For Malaysia, BNM expects growth to be mainly driven by domestic demand
    amid continued wage and employment growth, and the implementation of new and on-
    going investment projects. In addition, it expects the higher headline inflation in the first
    half of 2017 to moderate in the second half of the year.

17. Growth of outstanding loans to the banking system was higher in 1Q 2017. The growth
    rate of outstanding loans in the banking system accelerated (1Q 2017: 6.0 percent; 4Q 2016:
    5.3 percent, y/y) in line with the stronger economic growth. The higher growth in
    outstanding loans was driven by loans given to businesses (1Q 2017: 7.3 percent; 4Q 2016:
    4.9 percent, y/y) (Figure 9) mainly channeled to the finance, insurance, and business services,
    transport, storage and communication, and construction sectors. Outstanding loans to small
    and medium enterprises (SMEs) continued to outpace average loan growth, growing at
    9.2 percent (y/y) in 1Q 2017. The contraction in loan applications by businesses slowed
    down (1Q 2017: -1.6 percent; 4Q 2016: -14.1 percent, (y/y), signaling improvement in
    overall business sentiment.

18. The moderation in household credit growth continued in 1Q 2017. The growth rate of
    outstanding household debt moderated further (1Q 2017: 5.2 percent; 4Q 2016 5.4 percent,
    y/y), driven by a decline in passenger cars loans, and purchase of securities loans (Figure
    9). Residential property financing continued to drive household credit growth (1Q 2017:
    8.5 percent; 4Q 2016: 9.1 percent, y/y), reflecting sustained demand for affordable housing.
    Higher loan application (11.2 percent) and approval (13.3 percent) rates during the quarter
    also partially reflected the ongoing demand for affordable housing (Figure 10). The quality
    of the household debt portfolio remained stable, as affordability assessments indicate that
    about 42 percent of borrowers with newly-approved loans have debt service ratios of less
    than 40 percent. Both aggregate impaired and delinquent loans ratios remained
    unchanged at 1.6 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively.


19. The banking system continues to remain resilient. Financial indicators continue to show
    that the banking system remains well-capitalized, and the banking system’s net impaired
    loans rate remained below 2 percent in 1Q 2017. While external debt recorded an increase
    amid the strengthening of the ringgit, the bulk of external borrowings continue to
    comprise of inter-bank and inter-company obligations, minimizing funding and rollover
    risk. Liquidity in the banking system remained sufficient, and the liquidity coverage ratio
    rose from just under 124 percent in 4Q 2016 to 131 percent in 1Q 2017, far above the
    statutory minimum of 80 percent. Further underscoring the resilience of the banking
    system, BNM indicated that banking institutions are no longer required to maintain a
     reserve fund5, given that banking institutions have begun a four-year phase to maintain a
     capital conservation buffer, which have the same purpose as the reserve fund requirement.




20. Large portfolio outflows were recorded in 1Q 2017, driven by developments in the
    ringgit bond market. During the quarter, non-resident holdings of government bonds fell
    from 30.6 percent of total outstanding government bonds6 in 4Q 2016 to 24.7 percent in 1Q
    2017, contributing to the portfolio outflows in 1Q 2017 to RM31.9 billion (4Q 2016: RM19.1
    billion) (Figure 11). The decline was mainly driven by unwinding of non-deliverable
    forward (NDF) positions by non-resident financial institutions, and the two MGS
    maturing, of which RM11.5 billion was held by foreign investors. However, the presence
    of domestic institutional investors helped to mitigate the impact of the outflows,
    particularly on MGS yields. While the 3- and 5-year MGS yields rose by 6.4 and 12.4 basis
    points, the 10-year MGS yields declined by 7.9 basis points. Net inflows of foreign direct
    investment (FDI) increased to RM17.0 billion in 1Q 2017, largely channeled into the mining
    sector and non-financial services sub-sectors. There has been a noticeable increase in FDI
    from China from 2.4 billion in 3Q 2016 to RM3.1 billion and RM3.2 billion in 4Q 2016 and
    1Q 2017, respectively, with Chinese investments in key transportation and urban
    development projects.

21. The ringgit appreciated by 1.3 percent against the US dollar in 1Q 2017 (Figure 12). The
    appreciation was in part due to the weakening of the US dollar, following uncertainty of
    US trade and fiscal policies going forward. Similarly, regional currencies also appreciated
    against the US dollar during the period. Against other major currencies, the ringgit
    remained unchanged against the Euro and weakened against the UK pound and Yen.

  In the past, Malaysian banks were required to set aside a percentage of their profits as buffers (known as reserve fund) before any distribution of
dividends can be made. This buffer serves as a prudential tool for banks that can be used during period of stress to ensure that banks can
continue to provide financial services without any disruption.

22. Since the introduction of the exchange rate measures by BNM in November 20167,
    volatility in the foreign exchange (FX) market has subsided (Figure 13). Following the
    announcement by BNM on FX measures in November 2016, volatility in the exchange rate
    spiked, given the rising uncertainty prevailing during that period. Subsequently, BNM
    has held several rounds of engagements with financial market participants, businesses,
    and the general public to clarify the measures and provide regular updates. BNM’s
    Financial Markets Committee also regularly published statements on BNM’s website,
    providing latest developments in the domestic FX market, as well as discussing further
    initiatives to develop the market. In its latest statement in May 2017, the Committee
    indicated that the onshore FX market recorded an increase in trading volume for ringgit
    from USD5.2 billion in February to USD6.3 billion in April. Additionally, there has been
    more balanced FX flows between exports and imports, with exports conversion exceeding
    imports by USD919 million (Figure 14).

  In November 2016, BNM introduced a series of measures to develop the onshore FX market, and introduced measures which require exporters
to convert most of their proceeds to ringgit.

23. The GDP growth rate is expected to accelerate in 2017 to 4.9 percent, slightly above the
    government’s projection range of 4.3-4.8 percent (Tables 3 and 4). This is an increase
    from the previous forecast of 4.4 percent.8 The strong momentum in private consumption
    is expected to continue to anchor economic growth, with a stable labor market and wage
    growth, coupled with income-support measures, including the BR1M cash transfers.
    Private investment will also provide steady support to growth, driven by ongoing capital
    spending in the manufacturing sector and various infrastructure projects, while stabilizing
    commodity prices are expected to revive investments in the oil and gas sector. Furthermore,
    improvement in commodity prices, particularly in crude palm oil and rubber, coupled
    with the recovery in the agriculture sector, would also help to provide additional
    disposable income, particularly to smallholders. Concurrently, growing global trade
    growth, supported by recovery in global economic growth, is expected to contribute
    positively to exports. The upgrade in the World Bank’s growth estimate for 2017 is in line
    with consensus estimates, which expects a faster expansion in the economy (Figure 15).

24. Over the near term, GDP growth is expected to be between 4.9 and 5.0 percent in 2017
    and 2018, respectively. Domestic demand, led by private consumption, is projected to
    remain the main driver of economic growth, supported by a strong stable labor market,
    steady wage growth, and ongoing income-support measures, including increased cash
    transfers. Major transportation infrastructure projects are expected to shore up both
    private and public investment, as the country approaches the final stages of its current
    national development plan. Further recovery in global commodity prices could also
    contribute to export growth and boost capital expenditures, particularly in the oil and gas
    sector. External headwinds are expected to continue to affect Malaysia’s economic outlook
    over the medium-term, especially uncertainty regarding US trade and fiscal policies,
    China’s ongoing economic rebalancing, and fluctuations in the global commodity prices.

25. Global economic growth is projected to strengthen to 2.7 percent in 2017.9 Global activity
    is firming broadly. Manufacturing and trade are picking up, confidence is improving, and
    international financing conditions remain benign. Activity in advanced economies is
    expected to gain momentum in 2017, supported by an upturn in the United States.
    Obstacles to growth among commodity exporters are gradually diminishing, while
    activity in commodity importers remains generally robust. Despite substantial policy
    uncertainty, global economic growth is projected to accelerate to 2.7 percent in 2017, up
    from a post-crisis low of 2.4 percent in 2016. In the US, GDP growth is expected to recover
    to 2.1 percent in 2017, following a slowdown in 2016 that reflected investment and export
    weakness. GDP growth in the euro area is expected to remain at around 1.7 percent in
    2017, helped by accommodative monetary policy and stronger exports. GDP growth in
    Japan is projected to accelerate to 1.1 percent in 2017 from 1 percent in 2016, reflecting
    strengthening domestic demand and exports. China’s economic growth is projected to

    Unless noted otherwise, all GDP forecasts are taken from the June 2017 Global Economic Prospects (World Bank, 2017).
    slow to 6.5 percent in 2017, as the economy rebalances. This forecast envisages
    strengthening trade, gradual acceleration of exports, amid robust domestic demand.

26. Global growth is to strengthen further to 2.9 percent in 2018-19 (Figure 16). In advanced
    economies, economic growth is expected to moderate to 1.8 on average in 2018-19, with
    output gaps narrowing and inflation gradually converging toward central bank targets.
    U.S. monetary policy normalization is expected to proceed at a measured pace. Global
    outlook is predicated only on legislated fiscal and trade policies. Growth in commodity
    exporters is projected to accelerate firmly from 1.8 percent in 2017 to 2.7 percent in 2018,
    while commodity importers growth is projected to remain stable, at an average of 5.7
    percent. The aggregate growth rate for emerging markets and developing economies is
    projected to accelerate to 4.5 percent in 2018 and 4.7 percent in 2019. Nonetheless, weak
    investment and slow productivity growth pose a challenge to developing economies’
    medium-term prospects.

 surveyed forecast
27. Inflation is expected to average higher in 2017, due to the recovery of global oil prices,
    which translates into higher domestic fuel prices. BNM is projecting inflation to be
    between 3-4 percent in 2017 (2016: 2.1 percent), with inflation trending upward in the first
    half of 2017, before gradually subsiding in the second half of the year. Indirect impact from
    higher domestic fuel prices could also contribute to higher inflation. Any further
    weakening in the ringgit is expected to have limited impact, given that domestic
    production and consumption contain relatively-modest import content. Additionally, no
    second-round effects are currently anticipated, as wage pressures remained contained.
    Nonetheless, sustained upward pressure on inflation could prevail, should global oil
    prices trend higher than anticipated.

28. The current account surplus is projected to narrow further to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2017
    (2016: 2.4 percent). While the recovery in global growth and stabilization in commodity
    prices bode well for external demand and subsequently the current account surplus, this
    is expected to be partially offset by higher capital imports, given ongoing investments in
    the economy and higher intermediate imports in tandem with improvement in exports.
    Furthermore, the services deficit is expected to remain at its current level, following
    continued reliance for foreign service providers, particularly in the oil and gas,
    transportation, business services and energy sectors. The confluence of these developments
    would have a notable impact on the current account surplus.

29. Monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative and supportive of economic
    growth. Acknowledging that growth is forecasted to be higher in 2017 and that inflation
    is expected to average higher in 2017 compared to 2016, the monetary policy committee
    (MPC) in its recent statement also noted that the ringgit has continued to stabilize, and
    banking system liquidity remains sufficient. Concurrently, the MPC also indicated that
    risks to global growth arising from protectionism, geopolitical developments, and
    commodity price volatility could heighten financial market volatility.

30. Fiscal consolidation is to continue, and the government remains committed to achieving
    its deficit target of 3.0 percent of GDP in 2017. The government is expected to continue
    to rein in on its expenditures, and continue to work on achieving efficiency in spending,
    including focusing on more targeted subsidies and on projects with higher impact, such
    as public infrastructure, for development expenditures. Nevertheless, expenditure for
    pension and salaries are expected to continue to grow and constitute the biggest portion
    of government spending. On the revenue side, the stabilization of global commodity
    prices would benefit the government positively, and the goods and services tax (GST) will
    provide diversification in revenue.
31. The Malaysian economy has been able to weather a challenging economic environment
    in 2016 effectively. The government was pro-active in responding to the decline in oil
    prices at the beginning of the year, by recalibrating its budget and ensuring that fiscal
    consolidation remains on track. In addition, the government’s income-support measures,
    including targeted cash transfers such as BR1M, supported private consumption. The
    reduction of interest rates by the central bank also provided further relief to indebted
    households. On the external front, the well-diversified economy has helped to cushion the
    impact of lower commodity prices on trade, as manufacturing exports continued to
    provide support to the economy. For 2016, the economy grew at 4.2 percent, within the
    government’s target; fiscal consolidation continued, unemployment remained low at 3.4
    percent, and wage growth remained healthy.

32. Growth will continue to be broad-based in 2017, and Malaysia is progressing from a
    position of strength. Private consumption is expected to remain robust and be the main
    engine for growth, supported by a stable labor market and ongoing income-support
    measures. Private and public investments are also projected to contribute to GDP growth,
    given the expansion in the manufacturing and services sectors, as well as the
    implementation of various infrastructure projects. The stabilization of global commodity
    prices would contribute positively to exports and trade in general and help to reignite
    private investments particularly in the oil and gas sector.

33. The higher growth trajectory projected for 2017 opens up room to undertake further
    reforms to achieve larger reductions in the fiscal deficit. The stability in global
    commodity prices, and recovery in external trade, could prove opportune for the
    government to undertake further measures to accelerate fiscal consolidation. To date, the
    government’s fiscal consolidation efforts have focused on re ducing operating
    expenditures, especially untargeted subsidies and transfers, and introducing the GST.
    Going forward, given higher petroleum revenues, which provides an additional buffer to
    government finances, the government may consider additional reforms to improve
    public-sector efficiency and raise additional revenue. This could include reforming the
    civil service pension, gradually eliminating GST exemptions, and broadening the coverage
    of the personal income tax, which could further diversify the revenue base. Given the
    expected robust growth, any further accommodative policies such as income-support
    measures could be scaled down or adjusted to be leaner and more targeted. Concurrently,
    while monetary policy continues to remain accommodative and supportive of growth,
    continuous monitoring over incipient signs of financial imbalances should remain in
    place. These signs include any marked and sustained uptrend in credit growth and
   indications of speculative property purchases such increases in the number of households
   purchasing more than two properties.

34. Risks to growth in the short-term stem mainly from external developments. Many of
    these risks are from the arising threats of protectionism, as well as uncertainty regarding
    the potential US fiscal stimulus and trade policies, and their prospective impact on global
    economic growth and trade that could hamper business sentiment in the economy.
    Moreover, uncertainties over US policies, as well as geopolitical developments, could have
    reverberations in the financial markets and result in higher financial volatility. Another
    possible risk to growth is the commodity price volatility. A sudden downward reversal in
    the global commodity prices could affect external demand while constraining the policy
    space, particularly on the fiscal side, due to the decline in petroleum revenues.

35. Marked short-term risks will continue to put a premium on fiscal consolidation and
    weak long-term productivity growth calls for structural reforms. The country’s
    macroeconomic management has been constantly proactive, and effective in navigating
    near-term challenges in the economic environment. Nevertheless, of equal importance is
    the need to accelerate structural reforms in the economy particularly raising the level of
    productivity, and addressing some of its key challenges. This include looking into
    addressing distortions in markets of goods and services, strengthening its competition
    policy and adopting competitive neutrality in regulatory stance, particularly with respect
    to Government Linked Companies’ operations. In addition, efforts to overcome the skill-
    gaps in the economy through more intense use of labor market information to inform skill
    development policies and programs and increasing female labor force participation
    should continue. The recently-launched Productivity Blueprint provides a good platform
    to anchor further work on these topics. Ongoing efforts to improve efficiency of social
    assistance programs should also continue, including a shift toward more-targeted social
    policies, which could also provide immediate support to vulnerable households.
36. Data is increasingly relevant for economic development. In the public sector, data is used
    by authorities to formulate, monitor and evaluate policies as well as to improve public
    service delivery. In the research communities and academia, the use of data has been
    important in undertaking empirical analysis and testing of hypotheses, conducting case
    studies, and the discovery of key findings which could feed into other parts of the
    economy. The private sector uses data for multiple purposes, from product development,
    to market analysis, to evidence-based decision-making or assessment. Over the years, the
    amount of data and its quality has increased exponentially, and today we live in a data-
    rich environment. Realizing this, there have been greater efforts to disseminate data in a
    timelier, more granular and more usable manner. Concurrently, the availability and
    accessibility of data has also improved over the years, leading the push to continue to have
    a more transparent data ecosystem.

37. An increased volume of high-quality data is highly correlated with development. One
    way to measure the availability of data for economic development is by countries’ data
    openness ranking10. At the current juncture, data gaps remain especially between
    developed and developing economies. There are also obvious differences in data openness
    at the regional level, whereby the more-developed North America region has more data
    openness in comparison to other regions (Figure 17). Indeed, more openness and better
    accessibility in data is positively correlated with higher GDP per capita (Figure 18).

38. With rapid improvement of technologies, a greater volume and a wider range of data is
    increasingly available. The world is witnessing an unprecedented explosion of data.
    Digital data overtook analog around 1998, and in 2013 amounted to 46 billion trillion bytes
    (Figure 19). Telecommunications capacity has also grown exponentially over the last
    decade (Figure 20). For the past three decades, computing power has been doubling about
    every 18 months. By 2020, four billion people are expected to be online, with 31 billion
    connected devices and trillions of gigabytes of data generated11. It is estimated that 90
    percent of the data in 2014 was created starting 201212, and it will continue to grow rapidly
    in the future. Data improvement via new technology creates favorable and exciting
    opportunities for policymakers, researchers, companies, and citizen groups to make
    decisions, enhance accountability, and solve development challenges.

39. The demand for data is also changing with users demanding more detailed, and
    timelier data. Firstly, there is a continuous demand for data to reflect the current state of
    the environment, be it economic, social or science. For example, when a country at its
    initial stage of development first establishes its national statistical office, one of the first
    statistics generated would usually be the aggregate consumer price index (CPI). As the
    economy and users such as policy makers become more sophisticated, there is a need for
    the statistical office to publish more detailed statistics, such as regional CPI and
    component level CPI, for example, food and transportation. Similarly, the demand for
    detailed and timelier statistics also moves in tandem with the rapid change in the global
    landscape. For example, with the rising population in urban areas, the demand for key
    timely data such as the current traffic and crime information is critical both for the public
    and for public service delivery. Concurrently, with climate change becoming a key focus
    for the society, timely and measurable data such as on greenhouse gas emissions is
    necessary for the private sector to meet certain environmental regulatory requirements
    and for authorities to ensure compliance.

40. Enhanced data is both an input and a result of the digital economy. Data collection,
    management, and dissemination are evolving rapidly, streaming into a digital economy
    in today’s world, which is expected to add US$1.4 trillion into the global economy by
    2020.13 In the case of Malaysia, the digital economy is estimated to account for 18 percent

   of GDP. Many governments, research groups, companies, and citizen groups have made
   considerable progress to capture newly-generated data and use it for economic
   development. New ways of collecting data using innovative technologies are continually
   explored to improve the quality of data. For instance, platforms such as geographic
   information systems are continuously enhanced to integrate data, in order to collect,
   manage, and disseminate data more effectively. Indeed, the process of digital economy
   development is slowly progressing, through the evolution of collecting, managing, and
   disseminating data. The introduction of big data offers a new path of accessing
   unstructured data such as those from social media and e-commerce, allowing an
   unprecedented amount of knowledge that was not previously known to be discovered.
   Without adequate data, the progress of the digital economy would be constrained.

41. Data systems, including collection, processing, analysis, and dissemination, are also
    evolving to accommodate the data needs of the economy. The use of data for
    development involves (i) making data available, (ii) building public trust in the data, and
    (iii) expanding people’s ability to use data so that their needs are fulfilled th roughout the
    process of collecting, managing, and disseminating data. Recognizing the importance of
    data for decision-making and development, most countries continuously look for ways to
    reform their data policies, and develop new data sources and systems, in order to meet
    the needs and demands of data users in the 21st century.




42. Accessible and reliable data is at the core of the Eleventh Malaysia Plan “Anchoring
    Growth on People”, which aims to develop the country as a high-income nation by 2020.
    This plan is ambitious, covering social, economic, and spatial development. In addition to
    the Eleventh Malaysia Plan, Malaysia is also a signatory to the UN-led Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDG). In order to fulfil these development plans, the national
    statistical system must assist in producing the data for monitoring and evaluation. As the
    Eleventh Malaysia Plan and the Sustainable Development Goals are both comprehensive
    in nature, the data and information will have to come from the entire system.

43. The Malaysian government has started working on several initiatives to produce the
    data and statistics to meet the policy needs in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan. One of the
    initiatives is to review Malaysia’s statistical system and bring forth the full potential of the
    national statistical system in meeting the policy needs of Malaysia. This would serve to
    translate data into effective public service delivery. For instance, information on
    employment is currently collected and managed separately by DOSM, the Ministry of
    Human Resources, the Institute for Labor Market Information and Analysis, the
    Employees Provident Fund, and others. Technical and institutional barriers limit the
    sharing of this information across agencies. More robust and routine data sharing across
        agencies, under the ambit of a revised Statistics Act and a new Malaysia Bureau of Labor
        Statistics, will help better leverage this information for policy making, monitoring, and
        evaluation. In another initiative, DOSM has reviewed the availability of green growth
        indicators and applied the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA). This
        permits better monitoring of the interactions between the economy and the state of
        environment to help inform decision making.

44. These policy and public service delivery data reforms are necessary steps but need to
    be matched by a broader ecosystem approach. This section of the report aims to present
    some of the impact that data has on several aspects and components of Malaysia’s
    development narrative, and identify ways to make the data ecosystem in Malaysia more
    effective. To do so, it presents some of the main uses that data has in key areas such as (i)
    public service delivery; (ii) research and development; and (iii) private sector growth. It
    presents the analysis of the current ecosystem for data management in Malaysia, its
    aspirations, and the opportunities and challenges to meet them.




45. Effective data management is crucial for policy making. A study by the World Bank
    shows that approximately 40 percent of developing countries are not able to measure their
    poverty trends over the last decade.14 Lack of high-quality data could lead to misleading
    information for decision makers, possibly hindering the drive to improve economic
    growth and development of a nation as a whole. Although data collection, management,
    and dissemination activities have shown improvements globally, much more work needs
    to be done to ensure availability of data and its use for effective planning, implementing,
    monitoring and evaluating policies and programs in the public sector.

46. International experience shows that governments that invest in data collection and
    availability tend to be more transparent, which contributes to more effective public
    service delivery. Digital technologies are further facilitating data collection and
    dissemination. Governments’ ability to share data internally through Integrated Financial
    Management Information Systems (IFMIS), Human Resources Management Information
    Systems (HRMIS), or other systems greatly facilitate this process. Indeed, countries with
    well-developed IFMIS are more likely to have open budgets, or those with HRMIS are
    better-placed to have more transparent hiring and remuneration policies in civil service.
    Enhanced data systems may also improve interagency cooperation and coordination, and
    countries with national monitoring and evaluation systems reinforce the coordination
    across units within government to provide and share administrative data.

47. Data availability and access to information can improve service delivery outcomes
    when certain conditions are met. In particular, open data matters when: (i) information
    or poor access to information are the main barriers to improving service outcomes; (ii)
    specific, measurable and attributable service delivery failures occur, and incentives for
    citizen voice and government action are aligned; and (iii) when a strong and vibrant
    community of data users within government, civil society, business and academia keeps
    demand pressure high. For example, government service providers (e.g., government
    veterinarians in Punjab) significantly improved service delivery when their work was
    rated, and the information on their ratings was disseminated among beneficiaries such as,
    farmers.15 Also, smartphone monitoring reduced absenteeism among doctors in Pakistan,
    reflecting the importance of demand pressure from citizens in politically competitive
    constituencies, aligning incentives for citizens and government actors to improve
    services.16




       More openness and data availability can impact service delivery through various
       channels:

       Informing citizens. There have been significant advances around the world in the use
       of data and digital technologies to improve public health outcomes. This includes point
       of sale (POS) data collection, disease surveillance, or telemedicine. In emergency cases,
       such as the Nepali earthquake in April 2015, information was mapped from data input
       from social media, satellite pictures and drones.17 Access to information was crucial to
       improve the disaster response, especially in mapping the damages, identifying passable
       roads, collapsed houses, stranded, shelter-less and starving people, and the contact
       details of those willing to help. In other instances, mobile technologies such as
       geotagged photos have been used to document, control, and prevent corrupt practices
       in Pakistan after periods of flooding.

       Citizen feedback on service delivery. Digital and mobile technologies facilitate
       citizens’ reporting of service delivery issues, as well as to report back to citizens when
       issues are addressed. If the collected data is made public, surveys are far more effective
       than general complaint systems. For example, the evaluation of the large-scale effort in
       Pakistan to solicit feedback from citizens shows that citizen engagement helps shift
       negative perceptions of the government among citizens. After three years of operation,
       the government contacted more than seven million users of public services, and

      perceptions of corruption in service delivery declined by 9.3 percent among those that
      recalled being contacted.

      Improving management through data. Absenteeism among service providers
      (teachers, doctors, nurses etc.) can be addressed by using digital technologies to record
      attendance and transmit data, although this must be accompanied by good management
      practices.18 However, simply showing up for work does not guarantee the quality of the
      delivered services. In more complex services, such as education, showing up is still a
      prerequisite for teaching, but external citizen engagement is necessary to further
      address quality issues. Appropriate data must be collected to monitor goals and
      operational performance for organizations and workers.19 In some cases, the effect of
      using smartphones to geotag government vaccinators has had a significant effect in
      improving the delivery of vaccines.

      Accountability. Service delivery can be affected by weak accountability, especially
      where citizens face significant informational barriers in assessing performance. Open
      data has perhaps been less transformative than expected in raising accountability,
      because the impact of technical innovation and openness are conditional on the quality
      of institutions. Internal information flow within the governments can serve to align
      incentives for reform at the top of the hierarchy with the information of how to change
      processes available to the rank-and-file service providers. Once those internal flows are
      functional, then citizens can help further in holding service providers to account. For
      instance, in the US, UK, and Canada, open data initiatives have had some take-up, but
      mostly limited to sectors of consumer demand (e.g., real estate, transport, health care).
      In the developing world—including Kenya, Moldova, and the Philippines—the results
      have been mixed.

48. Good quality data has also been essential in implementing key reforms in various
    countries; for instance, in the business environment. Since its inception, a central
    objective of the Doing Business report has been to provide policymakers objective and
    actionable measures of efficiency and quality of business regulations in their economies
    through benchmarking. The report offers economic data on business regulations from
    2003 onwards. This data covers 11 areas of the lifecycle of a small- or medium-size
    company, and helps countries identify priorities for reform. Namely, starting a business
    and labor market regulation indicators analyze the regulations pertinent to entrepreneurs
    looking to start-up and formally operationalize a company. Since 2003, the number of
    indicators and data points have expanded significantly, reaching 24,120 indicators (120

  indicators per economy) and more than 115,000 data points in the latest edition in 2017.
  The Doing Business indicators provide data that is actionable, and allows policymakers to
  pinpoint the areas in the business environment which need updating or a complete
  revamp. The benefits of publishing objective measures, and in this way, urging the public
  sector to reform, can be enormous—far from just improving on the Doing Business
  ranking, but actually making a big difference for the business community and the
  economy as a whole.




Reforms inspired by the indicators in the Doing Business Report have been implemented
in every region. Since 2004 onwards, the number of reforms peaked in 2009 when the
global financial crisis had intensified, and reforms were badly needed (Figure 21). The
number of reforms also increased after 2015 when the Doing Business report introduced
a number of additions to the dataset pertaining to the regulatory quality of regulations.

The Doing Business Report has served to catalyze reforms across all regions (Figure 22).
This has also been the case of Malaysia, which, for example in 2016, improved the getting
credit indicator by beginning to provide consumer credit scores—data that is very helpful
as it pools information across many creditors and public information sources. Credit
scores may improve market efficiency and provide borrowers with more opportunities to
obtain credit. The availability of credit scores allows lenders that would otherwise not be
capable of analyzing the raw credit data to extend credit to under-served markets at lower
cost.

49. Research in the social sciences keeps demanding additional and more granular data.
    Social sciences have evolved over the past several decades toward greater emphasis on
    empirical work, as granular data is being used to pose new questions. While economic
    theory provides a conceptual framework, better data facilitate more rigorous testing of
    theories and assessment of their relevance20. As a result, the share of empirical papers in
    top journals has climbed to more than 70 percent in 2011. These empirical papers use data
    assembled by public agencies, obtained directly by the authors, or generated through
    controlled experiments, enabling new research designs that can offer insights in the
    consequences of different economic policies and events.

50. Reliable and timely microdata is an essential ingredient for research and policy
    analysis. Often, analysis for policy and research purposes requires more detailed data
    than the summary tables that are published in reports or on the statistical offices’ web site
    provide. Microdata or granular data permits in-depth analysis, such as assessing the
    impacts of a program on different types of households (for example, low-income versus
    high-income, urban versus rural, those without children versus those with children). In
    most high-income countries, and in many middle-income countries, national statistical
    offices share anonymized microdata with analysts, both inside and outside of government,
    who are able to conduct in-depth studies that are outside the mandate of the statistical
    office.21 This contributes to knowledge and more effective policies, and increases the
    return on the costly investment of collecting detailed survey data.

51. Malaysia’s research productivity and quality is significantly lower than many regional
    and advanced economies. The relevance of available data for research is evidenced by the
    positive correlation (0.46) between a country’s open data ranking and the number of
    publications published in the country. Indeed, high-income countries with higher degree
    of data openness have more publications per capita (1.9 on average, compared to the
    overall average of 0.8) (Figure 23). Furthermore, the association between the citation ratio
    and open data is positive, which is consistent with the idea that data openness is needed
    to produce quality research (Figure 24). Malaysia’s indicators for the quantity and quality
    of research output are comparable to those of middle-income neighbors such as China, the
    Philippines, and Thailand, even though Malaysia’s Open Data Score is lower. Howeve r,
    Malaysia’s indicators lag behind those of high-income countries, and some middle-income
    countries, that have higher Open Data Scores.

52. Access to granular data, such as household or firm-level data, emerges as a key
    constraint to research in Malaysia. A survey conducted by the World Bank in Malaysia22
    shows that more than 75 percent of the respondents agree that data availability contributes
    to Malaysia’s research capacity. Indeed, the majority of respondents found publicly-
    available data relatively easy to access online, and half of them also consider the quality
    and format to be average. However, the nearly all of the respondents (95 percent) reported
    that the granularity of available data is not adequate for rigorous economic research.

     Furthermore, many of the respondents who said that granularity is an issue work in
     professions that use data intensively, such as academics, researchers, consultants and
     analysts.




53. The private sector uses both structured and unstructured data from various sources,
    including administrative records, mobile telephony, and social media. Structured data
    such as macroeconomic statistics and accounting information have always been crucial for
    the private sector environment to make key business decisions such investing in new
    projects or improving business operations.23 With the explosion of social media and
    telecommunications, many businesses or companies, such as Facebook or Twitter, are
    increasing the use of various unstructured data sources to understand consumers’
    behavior and expectations. A major challenge for the private sector is how to rapidly
    analyze the growing volumes of data and discover new findings from the existing data.
    One way to do so is through data mining, a widely-used practice in areas such as financial
    data analysis, retail, telecommunications, biological data analysis, intrusion detection etc.
    to extract hidden information from data (Table 5).

      Focus Areas                                                      Data Mining Applications


                             Data mining allows e-commerce businesses to understand the patterns hidden inside past
                             transactions, assisting the businesses to plan and launch new marketing campaigns in a prompt and
                             cost-effective way. Amazon is a good example, and is well-known for its strategy of “Things that other
                             consumers bought” which recommends complementary items to users through data analysis, by
  Business                   tracing similarities and patterns.

                             Retailers collect customer information, related transaction information, and production information, to
                             improve the accuracy of product demand forecasting, assortment optimization, product
                             recommendation, and ranking across retailers and manufacturers.



                             Insurance organizations and banks use data mining to assess borrowers’ credit worthiness in
  Industry
                             advance during the credit evaluation process to reduce default risks.


                             Treatment record data such as information of payers, medicine providers, pharmaceuticals
                             information, prescription information, doctor’s notes, clinic notes, etc. are used to do clinical text
  Health Care

54. Governments have recognized the value of big data for the private sector. To help
    improve businesses’ productivity, the Malaysian government is helping companies use
    data analytics to stay competitive on the global stage. Malaysia is one of the few countries
    with a structured big data analytics (BDA) roadmap to unleash the value of big data,
    spearheaded by MDEC. MDEC has been engaging with the private sector to promote data
    sharing through several platforms. These include the National Big App Challenge, which
    is a competition that requires participants to develop apps that showcase the importance
    of BDA in solving Malaysia’s pressing issues for the good of society through data, while
    highlighting the talents of homegrown software specialists. MDEC also organizes Big Data
    Week with the intention of fostering networking among vendors and end-users, enriching
    the ecosystem for the big data community. To further encourage the use of BDA in the
    private sector, MDEC has also established ASEAN Data Analytics eXchange (ADAX)
    which functions as a platform for companies to get trained, build analytics products, and
    test new ways to improve their business with data.

55. Malaysia is a pioneer in South East Asia in adopting a Personal Data Protection Act
    (PDPA). As concerns around privacy, national security, and local competition arise, many
    countries are putting in place policy and regulatory restrictions around cross-border
    flows, especially of sensitive personal data. Malaysia is no exception, and in 2010 adopted
    the PDPA,24 which came into effect in 2013. The Act requires that companies can only
    transfer personal data out of Malaysia to countries that have been pre-approved by the
    Ministry in charge of data protection.25 After challenges in implementing PDP’s
    regulations, the Department of Personal Data Protection (PDP) is now taking proactive
    steps to facilitate international data sharing. Since January 2017, and following the
    footsteps of the approach taken by the European Union (EU), the PDP has convened a
    public consultation to solicit feedback about a proposed whitelist of places for transfer of
    personal data outside Malaysia, which includes the eurozone countries, the UK, US,
    Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Philippines.

56. At the current stage, the private sector in Malaysia is seen to be less open and prefer to
    work individually. One of MDEC’s main observation is that private-sector firms in
    Malaysia tend to work and build analytics in-house, rather than leveraging from one
    another. The private sector in Malaysia has not warmed up to the idea of sharing its data
    for two key reasons: one, it does not see the immediate business benefits that data sharing
    could bring. Second, it is afraid of violating existing regulations around the Personal Data
    Protection Act (PDPA).




24
   The PDPA specifies that certain data users, such as licensed insurers, professional firms (e.g. legal, auditing, accounting, engineering and
architecture), housing developers, and medical clinics, must register with the Department of Personal Data Protection (PDP).

     A number of companies and industries in the world, including those in Malaysia, are
     embracing open data principles as part of their larger business strategies, rather than as
     one-off opportunities. While only a relatively-small number of companies are sharing
     their data so far, private sector data sharing can be beneficial to governments, individual
     organizations, entire industries and the general public. A recent report by the Open Data
     Institute describes three industry-leading enterprises that have embraced an open
     approach – open source, open standards, open data and open innovation – to help retain
     their competitive edge.

     An even more altruistic approach is “data philanthropy”, a new movement in corporate
     social responsibility, in which private-sector organizations allow access to their data
     holdings for the public good. This emerging concept was first proposed at the World
     Economic Forum in Davos in 2011, and popularized through a United Nations data
     project known as Global Pulse. While acknowledging potential complications, including
     privacy risks, proponents of data philanthropy argue that the rapidly-growing quantities
     of “data exhaust” (passively-collected data deriving from daily usage of digital devices)
     held by the private sector can be shared and leveraged to protect communities against the
     impacts of crises and keep global development on track.

     Although still far from prevalent, some examples of corporate data sharing exist. In Côte
     d’Ivoire and Senegal, Orange Telecom hosted a challenge that allowed researchers to use
     anonymized, aggregated data to help solve various development problems, including
     those related to transportation, health and agriculture.

     Despite the benefits, many businesses may be reluctant to share data that they view to be
     proprietary, out of concern that government agencies would release it publicly and erase
     a potential market advantage. Much research remains to be done on the value proposition
     for corporations doing the sharing, and on ways to maximize the potential, and
     importantly, minimize potential harms of shared data.

57. Most Malaysian companies do not allocate enough funding for employee training and
    development, including in data management and analytics.26 Across the globe, countries
    are experiencing a talent crunch in data management and analytic skills, and Malaysia is
    no exception. According to a study by Microsoft27, the lack of digital skills is one of the


26
   According to the study by MDEC on talent supply and demand for MSC26 and non-MSC companies, for example, more than 40% of the 1000
companies surveyed did not allocate funds for employee training and development.

Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.
        main barriers holding back Asian organizations from embarking on data-driven
        transformation. Another study by PIKOM, the National ICT Association of Malaysia,
        highlights the mismatch between skills and qualifications of job seekers and the industry.
        The skills shortage includes not only technical skills, but also soft skills such as problem-
        solving, confidence, leadership, communication and English proficiency, especially
        among fresh graduates.28

58. The government of Malaysia has initiated a host of initiatives to close the talent skills
    gap. As part of the National BDA Framework, Malaysia has put in place the necessary
    steps to produce sufficient talent to meet the demand for data analytics. Talent
    development initiatives have been put in place by working closely with both the public
    and private sectors. MDEC, working closely with institutions of higher learning (IHLs),
    has been able to introduce various data analytics related courses in local universities, with
    12, offering programs at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In addition, to
    address the growing demand for immediate data analytics expertise, it has introduced
    various related courses from well-regarded sources such as Harvard Business School and
    Data Incubator for professional development, as well as massive open online courses
    (MOOC) content from Coursera and Data Camp. To accelerate professional development
    programs further and to maintain the quality of the trained data analytic professionals,
    Malaysia has developed its own BDA training framework to guide local training providers
    to produce relevant talent. Another agency, the Human Resources Development Fund
    (HRDF) operates a Pool Fund for re-skilling and up-skilling the workforce. Through the
    Pool Fund, HRDF has allocated funds to support digital adoption and skills initiatives in
    data science, data professional training, and women’s empowerment through ICT, some
    of which is carried out in partnership with MDEC. (See Box 4 on Singapore’s experience
    in developing and closing the skills gap).




      Singapore has always had global reputation for being a talent hub of Asia; it ranked
      second in the INSEAD’s Global Talent Competitiveness Index and 15th in IMD’s Talent
      Competitiveness Ranking. Since 2016, Singapore has been implementing the SkillsFuture
      program to boost digital skills.

      The program is a mix of conditional cash transfers and a market place of courses that
      maximizes flexibility, as well as encourages individual ownership of skills development.
      Each Singaporean above 25 years old is given a SkillsFuture credit of SGD500 and can
      choose from more than 18,000 courses to retrain and upskill. The courses range from
      mobile app development to a fine arts degree, and providers include educational
      institutes, public agencies such as the Ministry of Health and People's Association, and
      MOOCs players such as Udemy and Coursera. These providers have been curated and

       vetted by SkillsFuture Singapore, a statutory body leading the movement, to ensure they
       "offer high-quality and industry-relevant training.”29

       The competency-based skills framework, which underpins the SkillsFuture program,
       serves as a reference point for employers, employees, job seekers and training providers.
       Training providers can use the framework to develop and align their training courses,
       while businesses can use it to monitor their employees’ capacity development.

       As part of the overall Singapore’s Workforce Qualification scheme , the Workforce
       Development Agency and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), in
       consultation with the industry counterparts, have developed the National Infocomm
       Competency Framework (NICF). To date, NICF has identified 631 competency standards
       of 334 job roles in the ICT and multimedia industries, including in emerging areas such as
       data analytics, Green ICT and Cloud Computing, and its website refers to SkillsFuture as
       a source of retraining and upskilling.30

       The cross-agency coordination of SkillsFuture is worth noting. The development of the
       NICF was led by IMDA, under the Ministry of Communications and Information, while
       SkillsFuture is under the Ministry of Education. At least on the publicly available
       materials, these initiatives clearly cross-reference each other, which helps to ensure that
       they complement and add value to each other.

59. The quality of available data is as important as the quantity made available. To ensure
    efficiency in data production and usage, data must be of high quality, disaggregated at an
    appropriate level, and be accessible on time to those who want or need it (Figure 25).
    Hence, high-quality data is crucial to provide accurate information, and to assist in its
    effective use. A large volume of data is produced but goes unused, or is not usable or
    available for potential users, limiting the effective use of data by different parties within
    or outside of specific countries.

60. A well-functioning data ecosystem that produces quality data can be traced back to the
    role of the country’s data producers and its key collaborators.31 The role of data
    producers and key collaborators is crucial in enabling data access and usage, to close data
    gaps between developed and developing countries, between information-rich and
    information-poor people, and between private and public sectors. Essentially, assessing
    how well the data ecosystem functions can be done by understanding how well the data
    producers are able to capture its four main roles; collecting data, disseminating data,
    fostering collaboration among the various data producers, and engaging with the users
    and general public (Figure 26).




31
  In addition to data producers, in some countries including Malaysia, there could also be agencies responsible in ensuring wider accessibility to
data.
61. The following section discusses the evolution of data producers and its key
    collaborators in Malaysia, and its effectiveness in undertaking its four main roles.
    These four roles are as follows;
    i.     Data collection
    ii.    Data dissemination
    iii.   Collaboration across institutions and agencies
    iv.    Engagement with users

  Central banks’ functions are vastly driven by data, and similarly for Bank Negara
  Malaysia (BNM), a diverse spectrum of datasets are compiled to support its core mandate
  of maintaining monetary and financial stability, and other related functions. BNM is
  tasked with various functions in addition to maintaining monetary and financial stability,
  including ensuring a sustainable growth of the financial sector, and overseeing the
  implementation of efficient payment systems. Recognizing the importance of quality
  statistics in decision-making processes (Figure 27), BNM’s data quality assurance
  governance is framed within internationally-accepted standards.

 The statistics compiled to meet the functional needs of BNM are compiled from three main
 institutional sectors, namely banking institutions, insurance companies and
 intermediaries, and other reporting institutions (such as development financial
 institutions, payment systems operators, and corporations).

 Recognizing that aggregated data, while informative, could be insufficient to inform
 optimal policy across the various functions of BNM, granular datasets are also utilised to
 conduct assessments and inform decisions. For instance, in upholding monetary stability,
 entity-level financial information and market transactional records are used to monitor
 liquidity conditions, and the transmission of the policy interest rate to the broader
 economy. In implementing prudential policies to ensure financial stability, granular
 information from the Central Credit Reference Information System (CCRIS) database was
 critical to determine the appropriate levels of policy, in order to effectively curb
 unsustainable behaviour without hindering access to financing.

 BNM has put in place a data governance framework to ensure quality of the statistics and
 to balance the needs of introducing new statistics, weighing the additional effort and
 financial burden on both compiler and reporting agents. The data quality requirements
 adopted by BNM takes into consideration seven key quality components; namely,
 timeliness, relevance, reliability, coherence, accessibility, confidentiality and auditability
 (Table 6).

  Data quality is assured through three layers of checking, where data quality assurance
  begins at source with standardized system functionalities at the data providers,
  conforming to data reporting guidelines issued by BNM, and enforced by the Statistical
  Reporting Enforcement Framework. Micro- and macro-level data analyses are performed
  on a periodic basis on data submitted by data providers to eliminate data anomalies.
  Finally, the data is subject to further review and deliberation by an independent quality
  assurance panel, comprising cross-sectional subject matter experts to ensure data
  consistency vis-à-vis other indicators, economic and financial developments. The
  finalized statistics are published in various BNM periodic reports and reports by
  international agencies such as IMF and World Bank.

62. In Malaysia, the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) is the primary entity
    responsible for the collection and dissemination of socioeconomic data and statistics.
    By virtue of Section 2 of the Statistics Act, 1965 (Revised 1989), DOSM is authorized to
    collect and interpret statistics for the purpose of furnishing information required in the
    formation or carrying out of government policy in any field required for government.
    Furthermore, DOSM has the power to communicate statistics collected, or interpretation
    of statistics, that may be useful to the government or the general public.
63. The scope and sophistication of DOSM’s operations has expanded in line with
    Malaysia’s development. DOSM’s collection, management, and dissemination of data
    have evolved to meet the growing information needs for the formulation and monitoring
    of government policies. As the New Economic Policy (NEP) brought a new focus to
    improving the labor force and reducing poverty, DOSM launched its first national
    Household Income Survey (HIS) and Household Expenditure Survey (HES) in 1973,
    which continue to be important instruments for assessing the well-being of Malaysians.
    As information needs and technology have advanced, DOSM has adapted, for example,
    adding online data collection to the 2010 Population and Housing Census, implementing
    online e-surveys for economic establishments, introducing Computer-Assisted Telephone
    Interviews (CATI) in the Labor Force Survey and Computer-Assisted Personal
    Interviewing (CAPI) in the prices survey for the CPI.

64. The government, led by DOSM and MAMPU, has also looked into ways of adopting
    BDA in the public sector. In 2016, DOSM launched its Statistics Big Data Analytics
    (StatsBDA) project, which provides opportunities to develop a longer term strategy for
    using big data in official statistics as well as to understand the challenges of using it.
    Through StatsBDA, it also has initiated a platform for online price collection to give better
    insight in DOSM consumer price analysis, as it modernizes price collection methodology,
    where the price is extracted from various relevant websites. This project is expected to be
    completed at the end of 18 months and use a high volume of data from a large variety of
    sources. DOSM's StatsBDA is expected to increase the use of new data sources as well as
    simplify the process of decision making based on facts. Concurrently, MAMPU has
    created a governance structure for BDA initiatives comprising a Steering Committee,
    Technical Committee and project team for the implementation of open data and BDA in
    the public sector. Subsequently, a public sector data-driven program has been established
    to create the national ecosystem for proliferating the use of BDA as a catalyst for further
    economic growth. The key deliverables for the program includes creating a framework for
    supporting public sector BDA adoption and providing consultancy services for public
    sector agencies in initiating BDA programs.32

     See Appendix 2 for MAMPU’s big data initiatives
Statistics Big Data Analytics (StatsBDA) project was kicked off in 2 December 2016. The
StatsBDA encompasses three main modules namely Trade by Enterprise Characteristics
(TEC), Price Intelligence (PI) and Public Maturity Assessment on Official Statistics
(PMAOS) and supported by three other modules namely Real Time Business Status
(RTBS), BizCode@Stats Mobile Apps and Real Time News on Official Statistics (RTOS).
This project is expected to be completed at the end of 18 months and utilize voluminous,
high velocity, numerous variety and valuable data sources. The impact of DOSM's
StatsBDA will increase the use of new data sources as well as simplify the process of
decision making based on facts and produce new insights products and services.

Since big data holds great potential for revolutionizing statistics, the big data platform has
been used to integrate Malaysia Trade Database with Malaysia Statistical Business
Register (MSBR) to come out with new statistics without having additional surveys which
is being implemented in TEC module. MSBR is a fundamental property in maintaining
the comprehensive list of businesses and companies operating in Malaysia. The
exploration of BDA for this TEC initiative can inform the decisions about the future of
international trade performance by using advance analytics. Extracting information from
MSBR and existing trade data sets can determine the patterns and predict future trade
outcomes and trends.

DOSM also has initiated a platform for online price collection through PI module in
STATSBDA to give better insight in DOSM consumer price analysis. PI offers
modernization in price collection methodology, where the price is extracted from various
relevant websites. It mainly consists of the adoption of web scraping techniques by using
web crawler. The data collected can be used as research reference in establishing new price
basket analysis where later it can be used as a value added to the current Consumer Price
Index (CPI) published by DOSM.

These three main modules are then supported by three other modules. RTBS is an
integration of Companies Commission of Malaysia (CCM) data to DOSM environment to
enable DOSM to get direct access of latest business entities information at any time. The
information is vital for DOSM in order to keep the MSBR updated. MSBR is a tool to
prepare and coordinate the surveys or censuses. It is an essential component in the core
statistical infrastructure that supports collection of economic data and production of
economic statistics.

As mobile application has been recognized as an impressive channel for delivering
information in easy way, BizCode@Stats is being developed specifically for statistical
codes and classifications. It allows users to access the statistical codes application via
handheld devices and can be accessed even without internet connection. The standard
statistical codes and classifications make statistical comparison possible and bring
uniformity to the data collection and statistics production. In short, BizCode@Stats
supports TEC and PI modules in order to have a better quality of statistical classification.
  Given the rapid speed of how things developments, DOSM is expected to know what is
  happening in the world in real time, especially news on official statistics published by
  other National Statistical Offices (NSOs). Thus, daily comprehensive up-to-date news on
  official statistics is aggregated from worldwide sources is gathered in RTOS module, in
  which the module uses the same platform as PMAOS. The news is ranked based on
  certain characteristics such as topic, freshness, location, relevance etc. for analysis or
  reference purposes. On top of that, this module offers in depth analysis of opinion from
  news media cluster.

65. The DOSM Transformation Plan 2015–2020 details its ambitions and guidelines for
    upgrading its systems and performance. In line with Malaysia’s development objective
    of becoming a high-income economy, DOSM aims to continue its modernization efforts to
    meet the increasing demands for accurate, timely, and comprehensive statistics to inform
    public policy. DOSM’s Transformation Plan is built around four strategic thrusts (Figure
    27). The DOSM Transformation Plan 2015–2020 is complemented by an ongoing strategic
    review of the entire national data statistical system, which will propose steps to transform
    the wider network of producers and users of socioeconomic data throughout Malaysia.

66. DOSM has adopted the Generic Business Process Model (GSBPM) to standardize its
    processes in line with international standards. DOSM is among the 50 leading national
    statistical offices that have adopted GSBPM recommended by the United Nations
    Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). The GSBPM provides a standard framework
    and harmonized terminology to help statistical organizations modernize their statistical
    production processes, as well as share methods and components. The GSBPM can also be
    used for integrating data and metadata standards, as a template for process
    documentation, for harmonizing statistical computing infrastructures, and to provide a
    framework for process quality assessment and improvement. DOSM began adopting
    GSBPM in 2013, though its efforts to establish an integrated process framework predate
    its formal adoption of GSBPM. The adoption of GSBPM has improved harmonization and
    communication across DOSM’s various statistical departments.

67. DOSM has made efforts to improve its operations and coordination. In recent years,
    DOSM has introduced several new database management systems to foster greater cross-
    departmental communication and collaboration within DOSM and across government
    agencies, as well as public dissemination of statistical data. Four of these initiatives include
    NEWSS, StatsDW, MysDIC, and MySocialStats (Figure 28). Like other advanced national
    statistical offices, DOSM has begun addressing emerging areas such as the digital
    economy, sharing economy, environment, as well as indicators for the Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDG). Furthermore, from time to time, DOSM produces new data
    such as the index of services, green economy indicators and System of Environmental-
    Economic Accounting (SEEA).

68. DOSM has a cadre system across ministries, where statisticians from DOSM are
    deployed to different ministries and agencies. The DOSM staff posted to the various
    ministries and agencies are responsible for providing technical assistance for collecting
    analyzing, interpreting and disseminating data. They also give other services related to
    statistics such as consultancy. The number of statisticians deployed depends on the
    statistical needs of a given ministry. The number of statisticians from DOSM in different
    agencies varies from one to 24 people, indicating a considerable variance in statistical
    capacity among government agencies in Malaysia.

69. The composition of DOSM’s workforce has not evolved in similar pace with
    technological advances and increasing demands for information. The staff structure is a
    legacy of the time when much of DOSM’s work depended on manual clerical skills.
    DOSM’s organizational structure has been very stable over time , and the majority of
    DOSM’s staff is in lower-grade support staff positions. Lower-grade support staff
    positions account for more than 80 percent of DOSM’s staff positions (Figure 29). In
    contrast, management and technical staff represents only 13 percent of total DOSM staff,
    significantly lower than the ratio observed in high-income countries (Figure 30). By
    international standards, DOSM may be considered a medium-sized national statistical
    organization, with a total of about 3,500 staff positions. Approximately one-third of DOSM
    staff are based at headquarters, while 60 percent are based in DOSM state offices and 6
    percent are based in other government agencies.

70. The open data movement is rapidly growing across the globe. Open data is a policy that
    aims to make government-held data publicly available, with very few restrictions on
    access, and in formats that both people and software can easily read and use for any
    purpose. Open data is not only a tool for transparency and accountability, but also a
    powerful catalyst for innovation, entrepreneurship, and improved public service delivery.
        Early experiences confirm that opening data can drive smarter development, better
        decision making, and contribute to improving the lives of millions of people.33




       Indonesia’s movement to open up its government started in 2008, when, in an effort to
       promote good governance and transparency, the country passed the Public Information
       Disclosure Act. The Act created a paradigm shift. Data which was previously closed by
       default, and were only made public when requested, became open by default. In 2011,
       Indonesia became one of the eight countries who initiated the Open Government
       Partnership, to promote governments to take concrete actions towards enhancing
       transparency, accountability and citizen empowerment.

       The country’s online One Data Portal (www.data.go.id) was established to serve as a
       “one-stop shop” to access and obtain government data. Efforts were also made to
       encourage central government agencies, as well as local, to open up their data. In 2014,
       the data portal opened to the public. Currently, the portal has made available over 1,200
       datasets provided by 32 central and local government institutions. Following the national
       government’s lead, some local governments have even launched their own open data
       portals in Jakarta, Bandung and Banda Aceh. Not only has this improved transparency,
       but also facilitated citizen feedback, which in turn improves the delivery of services. For
       instance, residents can send reports using a mobile device by way of the Qlue mobile app,
       which the city administration system then forwards to local authorities for follow up.

       Greater transparency is also changing the political landscape. Open data helped empower
       citizens to monitor the results of Indonesia’s 2014 legislative and presidential elections, as
       well as the district elections in 2015. As a result of the widespread use of the electoral data,
       the General Elections Commission passed in 2015 a regulation that mandates election
       results to be made available in an open data format.

       The current government administration is now preparing a presidential decree on open
       data, allowing the public greater access to data and to standardize the data generation
       process in government institutions.

71. There are two international assessments of data openness around the world. The first is
    the Open Data Barometer (ODB), and the second is the Global Open Data Index by the
    Open Knowledge International (OKI). These two assessments define open data as public
    information that can be “freely used and shared by anyone for any purpose”.
    Concurrently, data quality is equally important, as together, the availability, accessibility,
    and quality of data determine the usefulness and usability of data. Users find significant

     Produced by the World Wide Web Foundation as a collaborative work of the Open Data
     for Development (OD4D) network, and with the support of the Omidyar Network,34 the
     Open Data Barometer (ODB) analyses global trends, and provides comparative data on
     countries and regions, using an in-depth methodology that combines contextual data,
     technical assessments and secondary indicators.35

     The Open Data Barometer score is based upon three kinds of data assessments;
        i. A peer-reviewed expert survey with a range of questions about open data
           contexts, policy, implementation and impacts, and a detailed dataset survey,
           which touched upon issues of data availability, format, licensing, timeliness and
           discoverability.
       ii. A government self-assessment in the form of a simplified survey.
      iii. Secondary data taken from the World Economic Forum, World Bank, United
           Nations e-Government Survey and Freedom House, selected to complement the
           expert survey data.

     The Global Open Data Index is evaluated using a set of questions that examine the
     openness of the datasets, based on the Open Definition and the Open Data Charter.36 In
     2016, the index was measured through a new survey, where each survey question
     measures a crucial aspect of either the legal, technical, or practical ‘openness’ of data.

72. Malaysia’s degree of data openness is still lagging behind many countries. As of 2015,
    Malaysia’s ODB ranking was at 51 from 92 countries, while in 2016, Malaysia’s ODB
    ranking was at 53 out of 114 countries, lower than most advanced economies and many
    Southeast Asian economies (Figures 31, 32, and 33). Recognizing the room for
    improvement, the government indicated that accelerating implementation of the Public
    Sector Open Data Initiative is one of the government’s key strategic thrusts, and this was
    outlined in the Malaysian Public Sector ICT Strategic Plan 2016-2020. As of 1 June 2017,
    2025 data sets have been made available in the public-sector open data portal,
    (www.data.gov.my).37 The government’s target is to increase it to 7000 datasets by 2020.
    Improving this platform is key to unlocking its value through community usage and
    creation of applications.

73. In Malaysia, government agencies have access to anonymized microdata held by
    DOSM for policy formulation and monitoring purposes. Anonymized microdata has
    been shared with stakeholders as well as organizations such as the World Bank, which
    jointly conducts studies with the government in various areas such as productivity and
    investment. DOSM evaluates all requests for microdata on the basis of the proposed
    research questions and analytical methods. These are assessed together with the
    characteristics of the requested microdata, such as the appropriateness of the sample
    design for the research questions, the reliability of the data at the level of disaggregation
    proposed for the study, and disclosure risk (especially for establishment-level surveys).
    Based on this evaluation the agency requesting the microdata may receive a subset of data
    (e.g., selected observations, variables, or survey rounds) that DOSM considers appropriate
    for the particular study and data.

74. DOSM provides subsets of micro datasets to selected universities. DOSM’s data sharing
    activities with universities are governed by its microdata released policies, and are
    formalized as bilateral memoranda of understanding (MOU). DOSM’s standard
      microdata release policies apply. At present, DOSM has MOUs with 12 universities38 in
      Malaysia, with more in progress.

75. Additionally, at the end of 2016, DOSM established a data enclave to facilitate secure
    data access for researchers. In the secure room, known in DOSM as the “external lab,”
    approved users are allowed to access of the requested microdata. To prevent unauthorized
    disclosure of the anonymized data, the secure data room is equipped with computers not
    linked to the Internet or an external network, and from which no information can be
    downloaded via USB ports or other drives. The summary outputs generated are examined
    by way of a disclosure review before release to the user. Such arrangements are routinely
    employed by statistical offices in a wide range of middle- and high-income countries.

76. DOSM has taken steps to make it easier for the public to work with micro datasets.
    DOSM’s Statistics Data Warehouse (StatsDW) which was launched in 2016, provide tools
    for public users to generate their own statistical tables, graphs, and maps. StatsDW is an
    Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) of DOSM. StatsDW stores historical data from as early
    as 1974 from various censuses and surveys conducted by the DOSM, as well as compiled
    data for economic indicators. StatsDW enables fast and easy access to stored data, and
    facilitates wider access for users according to user requirements and level of access
    permitted. The StatsDW allows users to compile aggregate tables and graphs according to
    their needs. These data are ready to be exported in different file formats such as Excel and
    comma-separated values (CSV) text.

77. Many of the statistical outputs and data for Malaysia are now available online. In its
    initial stages, most of DOSM and other government data outputs were thick books filled
    with hundreds of dense tables. With the rapid expansion of Internet and mobile phone
    usage, the government’s public outreach has emphasized online communications.
    Statistical publications are available to download free of charge as PDF files, while a large
    and growing proportion of their statistical results and underlying data are available as
    spreadsheets or in other formats that facilitate further analysis that can be downloaded
    from DOSM’s website. In line with the open data initiative, all of DOSM's publications
    were uploaded in a portal for free access since 2012. DOSM's eStatistik platform provides
    fast and easy access to all of DOSM’s publications. As of May 2017, almost 1,000
    publications are available for free download. This user-oriented facility ensures that all
    DOSM publications and can be accessed easily and quickly.

78. Providing access to more granular data sets would help to close existing data gaps
    currently faced by many data users inside and outside of government. Closing the data
    gaps enables effective evidence-based decision-making at the individual, institutional,

national, and international levels. Hence, enhancing development in the country by
ensuring wide access to data, while honoring confidentiality and privacy requirements,
should be a high priority for the producers and custodians of data. When data is not
confidential, the access should be made available and usable to the public. However, rules
and standards should be aimed at protecting privacy and reducing information inequality.




Detailed survey data is often needed to understand the impacts of policies and programs.
For example, the introduction of a consumption tax such as the GST will affect the real
incomes of consumers as well as their purchasing behavior, and the effect is likely to vary
by income level and possibly area of residence. Similarly, the removal of fuel subsidies
will have different impacts on population sub-groups, depending on how much
households spend on fuel and products for which fuel is an important intermediate input.
The analysis of productivity trends and interventions to increase productivity requires
detailed firm-level data. To assess these impacts, decision makers usually rely on
microdata from sample surveys that often cover hundreds of variables on tens of
thousands of households or business establishments.

While National Statistical Offices (NSO) are usually the first users of detailed survey data
sets, in many advanced countries, the main users of NSO survey data are other
government departments, universities, and researchers. Survey data is costly to collect,
and NSOs generally do not have the resources to undertake in-depth analyses beyond the
main survey reports and official statistics. NSOs in high-income countries, and even many
middle-income countries, have leveraged the public investment in collecting microdata,
by streamlining procedures for others to access the microdata, effectively multiplying the
analyses, information, and knowledge generated by the survey. This is also the case of
administrative microdata, such as tax data. All NSOs take measures to protect confidential
data. They remove personal identification information to anonymize microdata, with
some variation in the thoroughness and sophistication of methods. Many NSOs create
standard public-use data files that can be widely shared without compromising
confidentiality. Data access logistics are evolving rapidly, as NSOs move away from the
sharing of data discs and increasingly use secure on-site data rooms or secure Internet
connections to provide access to data. Almost all NSOs require data users to sign a
declaration—either in hard copy or online—agreeing to obey the confidentiality
provisions of the national statistical act.

The extent of microdata access varies considerably, not only from country to country, but
also within countries according to the category of user (e.g. NSO, government, research
institution, public) and the type of data (e.g. consumer prices, household incomes,
population census). Procedures for obtaining access also vary. Some NSOs require
detailed research proposals, while others allow free access to the public simply by logging
in to a web site. (See Appendix I for microdata accessibility in a small sample of advanced
countries.)

79. The government aspires to enhance its degree of data openness. There is a clear
    aspiration by the government to be among the top 30 countries in the Open Data
    Barometer, advancing from its ranking of 53 in 2016. This is in line with the 11MP's
    aspiration of becoming a digitally strong and mature society. The visible public Ministerial
    support for open data is evidenced by an open data program, which is coordinated by
    Malaysian Administrative Modernization and Planning Unit (MAMPU), a government
    agency under the Prime Minister’s Department that is responsible for modernizing and
    reforming the public sector. MAMPU has adopted the role of “Network Leader” for the
    open data sector in Malaysia, including by becoming the liaison point between the Prime
    Minister’s Office and the rest of government; and between government and data use
    communities. In addition to this program, the government has also established other
    related initiatives, such as a big data program led by the Malaysia Digital Economy
    Corporation (MDEC).

80. Malaysia has the necessary building blocks to improve its data accessibility and
    openness. In particular, these building blocks include having an emerging senior
    leadership support for open data, and having the necessary fundamentals such as skills
    and ICT capabilities, adequate funding, and technology infrastructure. Moreover, there is
    a growing actual demand for open data, and an increasing level of civic engagement for
    open data. The Open Data Readiness Assessment (ODRA) results highlight areas where
    Malaysia should focus in order to move forward. These include refining the current legal
    and regulatory framework, and providing better clarity for both government and the
    public on data accessibility and usability.
     The World Bank Open Data Readiness Assessment (ODRA) is an action-orientated
     assessment of the readiness of a national, regional or municipal government or even an
     individual agency to evaluate, design and implement an open data program. An open
     data program goes beyond the design and launch of an open data portal, aiming to drive
     the development of a dynamic open data ecosystem, rich in both the supply and reuse of
     open data that fuels innovations by many types of public and private sector stakeholders.

     Thus, the ODRA evaluates readiness based on eight dimensions considered essential for
     an open data program; namely, i) senior leadership; ii) policy and legal framework; iii)
     institutional structures, responsibilities and capabilities within government; iv)
     government data management policies and procedures; v) demand for open data; vi) civic
     engagement and capabilities for open data; vii) funding an open data program; and viii)
     national technology and infrastructure. Within each dimension, the assessment considers
     a set of primary questions, noting evidence that favors or disfavors readiness, and
     proposes a set of actions that can form the basis of an open data action plan. The
     recommendations and actions proposed are based on global best practices, while also
     incorporating the needs and experiences of the government to date.

81. MAMPU is largely responsible for Malaysia’s open data strategy. While Malaysia does
    not yet have specific policies on open data, MAMPU has spearheaded the implementation
    of open data since 2014.39 The General Circular No.1/2015 on Implementation of Public
    Sector Open Data, developed based on global best practices of open data, was issued to
    provide guidance in the implementation of open data for public sector agencies to
    promote data sharing, improve government service delivery system to be more user-
    friendly, fast and transparent. In line with the government’s aim to be in the top 30 of the
    ODB rankings, MAMPU has formulated its open data strategy anchored to the three main
    scopes of the ODB rankings; readiness, implementation and impact. MAMPU’s open data
    program consists of the 14 strategies that have been identified, comprising 22 action plans
    and programs for both the short-term (quick wins) and long-term. 40

82. Malaysian civil servants have the necessary skills and ICT capabilities for
    operationalizing open data. MAMPU has been able to attract and retain a group of
    technically-strong ICT professionals. It is supported by 50 expert ICT support staff and
    100 technicians and administrative staff. They have already successfully coordinated a

   Based on the mandate from The Government IT & Internet Committee (GITIC) Bil.1/2014, The Panel on Humanising the Public Service
(Merakyatkan Perkhidmatan Awam (MPA)) Bill. 1/2016. The General Circular No.1/2015 on Implementation of Public Sector Open Data was issued
to provide guidance in the implementation of open data for public sector agencies to promote data sharing, improve government service delivery
system to be more user-friendly, fast and transparent. Nonetheless, it is worth to note that 1) the circular is not yet systematically implemented
across the government and 2) the circular only applies to those government agencies that have agreed to release data (kind of an opt-in format)
limiting its effectiveness in supporting the open data efforts in the country.
40
   The circular followes 10 principles: primary source, timely, accessible, machine readable, non-discriminatory, use of open standards, data
permanent, licensing and usage costs.
     number of cross-government ICT projects, including the Malaysian Government Open
     Data portal, as well as the Malaysia Corporate Identity (MyCoID) Gateway, which enables
     simultaneous registration for businesses across a range of government agencies. In
     addition to MAMPU, other agencies including DOSM, Ministry of Health, and Ministry
     of Finance also have well-developed data competencies. Furthermore, all government
     officials receive ICT training through several main channels. The Malaysian National
     Institute of Public Administration (INTAN) provides general government training to all
     incoming civil servants across a range of different topics, including ICT use and basic
     analytics. Also, individual agencies provide more targeted ICT training for officials on an
     ongoing basis, especially related to newly-implemented or revised ICT tools and
     platforms.

83. Malaysia’s open data program has adequate funding. Malaysia already runs an open
    data program with dedicated resources. There is also government funding for big data
    programs and e-government projects with the aim of creating societal impact with data.
    These e-government projects include the MYEG portal, which provides services from
    various government agencies to the public, JobsMalaysia, a platform by the Ministry of
    Human Resources to connect employers with job seekers, and E-Syariah, an online portal
    to assist the public on questions regarding Syariah law. On the demand- or user-side,
    innovation funding is also available. Both MAMPU and MDEC have organized
    hackathons41 where prize money was available, as well as resources to assist winners in
    working more closely with the relevant data holders and/or scaling their projects.




     The Malaysian Government Open Data Portal, (www.data.gov.my) was developed in-house
     by MAMPU and serves as an online one-stop-center to access and download open
     government data. The portal was launched in August 2014 and went live on 23 May 2016.
     The data set is divided into 18 clusters, such as budget, education and agriculture, and
     users are able to download the available data into a spreadsheet format.

     The portal is accessible by the public. The data sets published in the portal as raw data
     format with quality assurance, fulfilling the eight characteristics of the open data quality
     assessment.42 The data sets are provided in 100 percent machine readable format such as
     Excel, CSV, and JSON. Over the years, the number of sets of data that were published
     from 2014 has gradually increased (Figure 34), although there is still room for
     improvement, given the government’s target of 7000 data sets by 2020.

Various activities have been planned and carried out by MAMPU to encourage more open
data to be published effectively into data.gov.my. These activities include:

      i.   In May 2016, features to improve and enhance the portal in accordance with global
           best practices were successfully launched. The new portal is now equipped with a
           range of the latest features, including facilities for creating new data sets
           application.
      ii. An awareness program to encourage ministries and agencies to publish their data,
           as the government’s target is to achieve 7,000 data sets by the year 2020.
      iii. Appointing 60 open data champions across ministries and agencies. The data
           champion is responsible as a consultant to advise on the implementation of the
           open data initiative in their respective agencies. The data champions’ roles are:
                a. Act as agency advisor and champion for public sector open data
                   implementation
                b. Study and identify suitable datasets for agency open data
                c. Obtain relevant approvals from heads of departments to allow public
                   access to the datasets
                d. Ensure agencies’ open data datasets are uploaded to public sector open
                   data portal
      iv. Engagement programs with government agencies, the business community, data
           providers and data champions to increase the quantity and improve quality of
           datasets. As of now 31 series of engagement had successfully been put in place.
             v. Organizing Hackathon programs in 2015 and 2016, where the contestants pitting
                  skill and creativity using the open data portal as well as other relevant data to
                  develop an innovative product of applications.
             vi. Publicizing eLearning modules on data.gov.my, and inviting and continuously
                  educate users to access the course.
             vii. Conducting collaborative programs in 2016 with open data experts from the Open
                  Data Institute, United Kingdom, and the World Bank Group, in order to
                  successfully explore knowledge- and experience-sharing in implementing open
                  data initiatives with more efficient and viable practices.

84. Malaysia’s open data program also benefits from having an adequate technology
    infrastructure. In terms of hardware and connectivity, mobile penetration as at end 2015
    is at 144 percent, and 71 percent of Malaysian households have access to the Internet.43
    This surpasses most regional comparators, and even the average of upper-middle income
    countries. Furthermore, the number of secure internet servers, an indication of how many
    companies conduct encrypt (secure) transactions over the Internet, is also higher than
    comparators (see Figures 35 and 36) In addition, the ICT sector is well-developed,
    constituting about 18 percent of GDP44 and growing. A national agenda, the Human
    Capital Strategic Initiatives, also exists to improve technical skills amongst the general
    population to meet the demand of companies.

Traditional methods of collecting traffic data rely either on labor-intensive fieldwork or
capital-intensive data sensor networks. The former is slow and results in low-quality data,
and the latter requires substantial capital and maintenance outlays, while only covering a
small portion of metropolitan data. In the era of big data, should we not be able to do better?

Responding to this need, Easy Taxi, Grab, and Le.Taxi, three ridesharing companies—which,
combined, cover more than 30 countries and millions of customers—are working with the
World Bank and partners to make traffic data derived from their drivers’ GPS streams
available to the public through an open data license. Through the new Open Transport
Partnership, these companies, along with founding members Mapzen, the World Resources
Institute, Miovision, and NDrive, will empower resource-constrained transport agencies to
make better, evidence-based decisions that previously had been out of reach. Issues that this
data will help address include, among others, traffic signal timing plans, public transit
provision, roadway infrastructure needs, emergency traffic management, and travel demand
management.

The Open Transport Partnership builds upon the success of Open Traffic, the pilot program
launched in the Philippines in April 2016. In the Philippines, the World Bank collaborated
with Grab, with support from the Korea Green Growth Trust Fund, to develop an open-
source platform for using anonymized GPS data generated by more than 500,000 Grab drivers
to analyze traffic congestion peak patterns and travel times. Using this platform and road
incident data, city governments in the Philippines could, for the first time, answer the
fundamental questions necessary to address safety and congestion—Where and when is
congestion most acute? Where and when are our citizens most vulnerable to road incidents?
And most fundamentally, when we invested in interventions to mitigate accidents or
congestion, did these investments work? What was their impact? Could we have done better?

A similar initiative was launched in Malaysia (OpenTraffic Initiative) by MDEC, Grab and
the World Bank Group on April 10 2017. The initiative will provide traffic data from Grab’s
GPS data streams to Malaysia’s traffic management agencies and city planners. It will enable
them to better manage traffic flow, addressing traffic congestion and improving road safety
and to make investment decisions on local transport infrastructure with access to an open
dataset.

Through these global public data goods, governments, together with the private sector, will
be able to effectively shape their transportation futures, ensuring equitable and safe access
for all.

85. The existing legal and regulatory framework could benefit from refinement. Currently,
    the legal environment for data collection, management, and sharing is a source of some
    uncertainty and caution. Data holders are not always confident about the application of
    general rules and regulations related to privacy and confidentiality, and individual
    agencies may also face specific internal data management regulations. This creates a
    fragmented environment for data management that lacks clarity for both government and
    the public on how data can be requested, shared and used. It also means that majority of
    data exchanges, whether inter-agency or with non-government stakeholders, are decided
    on a case by case basis, with senior managerial approval necessary for most decisions.

                                                               remains an area of concern among data users in Malaysia. The
                                                               legal framework is fragmented, and poses an obstacle to more

86. The current national statistical system can best be described as a “federated system”
    with multiple production units. It is a system with many parts but no formal central
    control mechanism, although DOSM is the largest statistical agency in the country. While
    the Statistics Act gives DOSM wide authority to collect and interpret statistics, the Act
    does not empower DOSM with any legislated mandate to manage or direct the national
    statistical system. Hence, individual ministries can and do conduct their own statistical
    activities for their own use, as directed by their own governance structures. While it is not
    legally required for the ministries to work closely with DOSM, it has been involved as a
    member of steering and technical committees for the implementation of projects or studies
    in the agencies. Amongst DOSM’s roles is to give advice on statistical methodology,
    providing social and economic statistics, and endorsing other agencies’ studies.

87. In Malaysia, the national statistical activities are coordinated through the Main User
    Committee (MUC). The MUC meets twice per year to “identify and establish the priorities
    and statistical needs” and “to coordinate the technical, collection, and statistical
    dissemination” activities. Beyond Malaysia, DOSM is also the coordinating international
    body for statistics. In addition to its national role as the producer of official statistics,
    DOSM also represents Malaysia regionally, ensuring adequate collaboration and data
    sharing within ASEAN (Box 13) as well as at the global stage (Box 14).




  At the regional level, data about ASEAN is crucial to ensure the sustainable development
  of the region, in order to achieve the One Vision, One Identity, One Community motto. A
  hub of ASEAN statistics was envisaged to provide statistics for the ASEAN Member
  States, and the ASEAN Community Statistical System (ACSS) Committee was officially
  established at the 43rd Meeting of the ASEAN Economic Ministers (AEM) in August 2011,
  in Manado, Indonesia.

  The ACSS is the highest regional policy-making and coordinating body on ASEAN
  statistics. It aims to provide relevant, timely and comparable ASEAN statistics in support
  of evidence-based policy- and decision-making, and enhances the statistical capacity of
  the Member States and the ASEAN Secretariat. The National Statistical Systems of all
  ASEAN Member States, through the National Statistical Office (NSO), are the country
  focal point, while the ASEAN Secretariat, through ASEANstats, functions as the regional
  focal point, as well as the technical arm and secretariat of the ACSS Committee.

  The ACSS Strategic Plan 2016-2020 provides the framework for an effective facilitation,
  coordination, production, harmonization, dissemination and communication of ASEAN
statistics. It charts the mechanisms in ensuring sustainable development in the
dissemination of statistical information, delivery of statistical information needs, and
statistical capacity building in the AMSs.

The ACSS had endorsed the policy and guidelines of data sharing, data transmission
protocol and developed the interactive website with more than six hundred indicators.
With regards to regional data sharing, technical working groups on selected economic
and social statistics, as well as data communications (the Working Group on Data Sharing,
Analysis, Dissemination and Communication of Statistics), have been established.

ASEAN Statistics are made available in regular publications and online databases on trade
in goods and services, FDI, tourism, populations, GDP and other indicators. Moreover,
detailed data is made available through online request at www.aseanstats.org.

In November 2016, DOSM, representing the Malaysian government, bonded an
agreement with the International Statistical Institute (ISI) to organize the 62nd World
Statistics Congress of the International Statistical Institute (ISI WSC) in Kuala Lumpur in
August 2019.

The Congress will gather 3,000 statistical practitioners in Kuala Lumpur and will be jointly
organized by DOSM, BNM and the Institute of Statistics Malaysia (ISM) with the support
of Malaysia Convention & Exhibition Bureau.

Participants are expected to come from various fields including academia, businesses and
statisticians, and this will ensure cross-fertilization of ideas across disciplines. Eminent
personalities, experts, researchers and students from more than 130 countries are
expected, providing opportunities to expand and deepen professional networks.

The ISI WSC will be a significant avenue for strengthening global statistical networks
within countries and across regions. It will bring together members of the statistical
community to share and disseminate the best practices and research in the field of
statistics.

88. Databases that are maintained by various ministries are sometimes not fully integrated
    at the national level. Some ministries and agencies collect their own data and have their
    own databases. For example, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, the
    Ministry of Finance, and the Implementation Coordination Unit all maintain their own
    respective databases and have full responsibility for control of their own databases. Some
    aggregated data is shared publicly across government agencies, including through the
    data.gov.my site managed by MAMPU.




  Data fragmentation and lack of data integration in Malaysia has been a long-standing
  issue, and has presented additional challenges for policy making.

  Addressing the issue of immigrant labor in Malaysia
  A fragmented migration system with duplicative roles undermines efforts to get the right
  number and profile of immigrant labor, and to control irregular immigration. Current
  problems related to the demand and supply of immigrant labor in Malaysia can be
  attributed to the absence of coordination in determining the profiles of workers that the
  economy demands. The focus has been on the quantity of foreign labor needed in each
  sector, rather than on the suitability of the worker to fill market demands. As a result,
  agencies have been forced to act in silos, which in turn contributes to the oversupply and
  undersupply of immigrant labor in different sectors of the economy. The Ministry of
  Home Affairs and Ministry of Human Resources maintain separate databases on
  immigrants that do not necessarily coincide. This hampers further coordination, and has
  the potential to undermine policy formulation and implementation.

  Improving urban transport planning
  Numerous reports, models, and guiding documents underpinning urban transport
  planning and delivery in the Greater Kuala Lumpur area are almost always based on
  unique, non-comparable data series, data definitions, units of measure, and temporal
  horizons. This has resulted in different conclusions of what current travel demand levels
  are, and what their future behavior is likely to be in response to a defined set of
  interventions (or lack thereof). Subsequently, this makes it difficult to unequivocally
  answer important questions, such as the number of people entering the central business
  district (CBD) at morning peak every day, how this number is likely to grow over time,
  and what the current and expected future highway capacity in/out of the CBD is.

  Managing social protection programs
  A large number of agencies, at both the national and state levels, are involved in both
  policy development and program implementation of social protection in Malaysia,
  creating and contributing to fragmentation, lack of coordination and duplication of
  programs. As a result, there has been a proliferation of small and similar type of programs
  across multiple agencies. There is also fragmented data management across agencies and
  programs. Though there have been welcome efforts to consolidate data, the systems have
  yet to become inter-operable in a way that would enhance real-time beneficiary
  assessment, program management, and cross-program synergies.

  Planning for smart cities
  More and better use of data can improve policymaking at the local level. The National
  Key Results Area in crime reduction has demonstrated the potential of data analysis to
  provide improved service delivery, but much more can be accomplished through
  increased use of data in policy-making. Data is also needed to assess the greenhouse gas
  emissions of Malaysia’s cities, so that baselines can be established and progress monitored
  and reported periodically.

89. Data fragmentation also exists at state and local government level. Even though local
    authorities and state governments collect some data, they are often not up-to-date. They
    lack well-developed database systems to store and manage data, and a large portion of
    the data is recorded manually in log books and is not digitized. In addition, the dispersion
    of data collection responsibilities between different levels of the government creates
    asymmetries concerning which agencies are producing and using different data sources.
    The asymmetric information sometimes leads to repetitive work on collecting the same
    data by multiple agencies, leading to a waste of resources.
  DOSM has established a branch office in every state and federal territory in Malaysia.
  Branch offices assist DOSM to produce national statistics, and thus they undertake all the
  surveys and field work as required by the headquarters. These branch offices are not
  designed or intended to support the states to produce state-level statistics. Their main task
  is to collect data for national surveys or censuses. While some of the data is shared with
  the state agencies, it is not done uniformly, and the usefulness is often limited by the
  adequacy of the sampling scheme. For example, most national surveys are only
  representative at the state and rural/urban levels, so they are not reliable sources of
  information for statistics at the district level or below.

  Many state governments and local authorities do not have an explicit data collection and
  information management apparatus. As a result, they have to rely on DOSM branch
  offices for support or rely on published data from DOSM. It is important for state and
  local authorities to have greater access to data for the matters under them to meet their
  own decision-making requirements. More developed states, for example Penang, have
  think-tanks such as the Penang Institute, which collects and conducts research at the
  request of the State Economic Planning Division. However, not all states in Malaysia have
  such state-focused research institutes.

  DOSM has taken the initial steps to improve the data access at the state level and has
  developed the mobile application “MyLocalStats” that provides detailed statistics at
  district level. The statistics will assist the state governments, district offices and local
  authorities in development planning and implementation in terms of economic, social and
  the environment.

90. Initiatives are currently underway to integrate two critical databases; one for trade data
    and businesses, and the other for the population. DOSM has recently integrated trade
    data with the Malaysia Statistical Business Register (MSBR). The integration of trade and
    business statistics helps DOSM to connect trade information with Malaysia’s economic,
    social, environmental and financial dimensions. DOSM has embarked on using big data
    techniques, leveraging its well-developed MSBR to integrate it with detailed trade data.
    On the population side, DOSM has established Malaysia Integrated Population Census
    Framework (MyIPCF). The objective is to save labor costs for collecting census data, by
    relying more on administrative data and online data collection for Census 2020. One goal
    for this database is to have all living quarters in Malaysia geocoded. The population
    database integrates several databases: the population and housing census; databases from
    other government agencies such as the Department of Immigration, the National
    Registration Department, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Education; the
    Malaysia Statistical Address Register; and geographic information systems (see Box 17 for
    examples of DOSM’s engagements and collaborations with other agencies).
  DOSM has long standing collaboration with a number of agencies. Collaboration among
  DOSM with various agencies has generally been formalized through a multi-stakeholder
  or inter-agency platform or committee. The function of the committee is to coordinate the
  strategic development and production statistics and to preserve continuity over time.
  These inter-agency platforms bring together users and producers to identify users’ needs
  and ensure the production of the necessary statistics from a variety of data sources in a
  coordinated manner. Among the agencies that DOSM has collaborated with are:

     i. National Registration Department (NRD)
        NRD have been supplying registered records on births, deaths and marriages &
        divorces of Non-Muslims to DOSM since 1963 in order for DOSM to produce and
        disseminate statistics on Births, Deaths, Cause of Deaths as well as Marriages &
        Divorces of Non-Muslims. Statistics on births and deaths is also used as input for
        the Current Population Estimates.

    ii. Royal Malaysians Customs Department (RMCD)
        DOSM is the sole agency responsible for producing and disseminating Malaysia
        External Trade Statistics (METS) since 1949, with the main data source for METS is
        the Customs Declarations provided by the RMCD. RMCD provides electronic
        declarations to DOSM through their Sistem Maklumat Kastam (SMK) on a daily
        basis by transmitting to DOSM’s server which is located at RMCD Headquarters,
        Putrajaya. More recently, DOSM was involved in the study on GST
        implementation in Malaysia by providing related data to the RMCD.

    iii. United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD)
         DOSM is working closely with UNSD in strengthening the compilation of
         environment statistics. DOSM has been appointed as a focal point to execute the
         pilot project on Green Economy Indicators for the period of 2014-2015.

91. In order to fill data gaps as well as to improve the coverage, timeliness, and availability
    of indicators identified in the 17 SDGs, various agencies need to coordinate closely with
    each other. DOSM has been assigned as the focal point in Malaysia to facilitate the
    coordination of SDG indicators development. Numerous engagements were conducted
    since 2015 with various agencies such as the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education,
    Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Ministry of Energy,
    Green Technology and Water, Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, and
    Ministry of Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government in order to identify data
    availability. The SDGs are categorized into three areas; namely, social, environment, and
     economy. Of the 244 listed indicators in the SDGs, Malaysia currently has 99 indicators
     (41 percent) that are available, 42 percent of indicators that still need further development,
     and 17 percent of indicators that are not available and/or not applicable in the Malaysian
     context. Moving forward, DOSM will actively discuss with related agencies the
     development of new SDGs indicators that are currently not available.




     The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) form an international initiative adopted by
     the National Assembly of the United Nations on September 25, 2015 that aims to end
     poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity by 2030. These 17 Goals build
     on the Millennium Development Goals that ended in 2015, while including new areas
     such as climate change, economic inequality, innovation, sustainable consumption, and
     peace and justice.

     Achieving the 17 SDGs requires integration of environmental, social, and economic
     aspects to achieve inclusive development that leaves no one behind. This calls for more
     high-quality data for governments, civil society, and companies to plan, monitor, and be
     held accountable for their actions. Also, because of their “leave no one behind” objective,
     the SDG call for much greater collection and analysis of sub-national data than previous
     initiatives. The SDGs demand more data to measure progress in economic development.
     These new goals are further extended from narrower MDGs, expanding to include new
     areas such as environmental issues key for sustainable development. The SDGs envision
     data generation to enhance evidence-based policy design and monitoring, while in
     parallel increasing efforts to strengthen country-level statistical systems. Capacity
     improvement at government, institution, and individual levels is needed to produce and
     use the data well.

     However numerous data gaps remain, some of them at a fundamental level. For example,
     data on gender inequality, as well as women’s activities and priorities at the country level,
     is often non-existent or very incomplete. Also, many of the issues relevant for women are
     not captured by existing data. For example, only a little more than half of all countries
     report data on intimate partner violence. Even among countries capturing the
     information, the quality of some data reported lacks consistency and makes comparison
     difficult.45 In order to fill data gaps in the 17 SDGs and to improve the coverage, timeliness
     and availability of indicators in identified SDGs, data providers, academics and
     stakeholders need to identify available and missing data and indicators in each of the SDG
     areas. This requires a good understanding of the methods used to process them and how
     data are shared. Only with close collaboration from various agencies and areas, can the
     process of policy making and monitoring be improved, and thus beneficial for the
     development of the country.

92. Civil society, the business community and academia in Malaysia are avid customers of
    various types of data. Pro-active publishing by government agencies is taking place, such
    as in the websites for the Department for Civil Aviation (DCA) and the Ministry of
    Tourism, and agencies have mechanisms for data requests. For example, data from the
    Institute of Public Health can be requested through an application form available on the
    ministry’s website (Figure 37). Geospatial data can be requested through a similar process
    from the official Malaysia geospatial website (www.mygeoportal.gov.my).

93. There is a growing civic engagement on the data ecosystem in Malaysia. MAMPU has
    conducted hackathons over the last two years as a platform to bring together government
    data holders, the private sector, as well as civil society, to come up with various solutions
    using government data. Some of the interesting solutions that have come out from these
    hackathons include presenting data on dengue in a way that the public could benefit from
     it, and an app to help households calculate efficient energy usage. In addition, MAMPU
     has also taken steps to improve engagement with government, the community and private
     sector through publishing stories on releases and uses of open data, running workshops
     with the release of new suites of data sets/or sector related workshops, including seeking
     feedback on what data they need and in what format. Participants in these events have
     continually indicated an appetite for more opportunities to work and interact with
     government data.

94. Similarly, DOSM is also actively engaging with the public through various channels. It
    is increasingly making use of infographics to communicate official statistics to laymen
    audiences, and also expanding its use of social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, to
    engage directly with data users DOSM is planning interaction sessions with stakeholders
    around data, and how to be more responsive to demand. DOSM has conducted a
    Customer Satisfaction Survey annually to understand users’ needs and the information
    given is used to enhance the quality of DOSM's products and services. In addition,
    BizCode@Stats, a mobile application which contains the Malaysia Standard Industrial
    Classification (MSIC) would be able to assists government agencies, private sector and
    researchers in understanding the classification of businesses.

95. There have also been initial steps taken by government agencies to manage occasional
    feedback from the public on data accuracy, perception and misinterpretation. In recent
    times, many of the feedback pertains on the conflicting low and stable inflation data and
    the rising costs of living expressed by the public. Recognizing this, BNM has produced
    several articles in its publications46, to address public skepticism on the CPI as their
    personal experiences suggest larger increase in the cost of living. Going forward, more
    active public engagements could help to further clarify the public’s misperception and
    queries on data made available to them.

96. Data is relevant for economic development and there is strong correlation between
    availability of high-quality data and development. Cognizant of this, accessible and
    reliable data is at the core of the Eleventh Malaysia Plan “Anchoring Growth on People”
    which aims to develop the country as a high-income nation by 2020. The Malaysian
    government has started working on several initiatives pertaining this, but these initiatives
    should to be matched by a broader ecosystem approach.

97. International experience shows that countries that invest and disseminate data have
    more productive research, policy analysis and service delivery. In academic research,
    reliable and timely microdata is an essential ingredient for research and policy analysis as
    it permits in-depth analysis, such as assessing the impacts of a program on different types
    of households. With regard to Malaysia’s own academic research, productivity and
    quality is significantly lower than many regional and advanced economies, and in part
    due to limited access to granular data.

98. The private sector is a key data user, using both structured and unstructured data from
    various sources, including administrative records, mobile telephony, and social media.
    The Malaysian governments has put in place various initiatives to develop data analytics
    including for big data, aiming to create a conducive environment for private sector
    companies to collaborate in the use of data. Despite the various efforts, the private sector
    fragmented construction and use of data analytics remain, hampering business
    opportunities. Also, skills for the analysis and use of data remain and additional efforts
    can be done by many Malaysian companies to allocate additional funding for employee
    training and development, including in data management and analytics.

99. Overall, the data ecosystem in Malaysia needs to evolve to further facilitate data sharing
    among public, private sector and research community. Considerable efforts have been
    made, led by DOSM, to improve statistics production, meet the demand of users and
    ensuring that data produced are in line with international standards. Many steps have also
    been taken by agencies like MAMPU to improve accessibility and degree of openness in
    the data ecosystem. Nevertheless, several areas of improvement remain for achieving a
    data ecosystem that further facilitates the exchange of granular data among public, private
    and research community. Many developed economies have shown that creating such a
    conducive environment for data sharing leverage on the growing opportunities that policy
    analysis, service delivery or the digital economy offer.
   A. The workforce and work process of data collection should move in line with the country’s
      economic progress and growing demand for data

100. In tandem with Malaysia’s steady growth and level of development the work process
    of the national statistical system will likely need to evolve. Over time, statistical offices
    in more developed countries have gradually moved from units which focus on the
    production of individual data sets (e.g. labor statistics, inflation), towards one that
    specializes in processes (e.g. data collection and maintenance) that support the production
    of different data sets. This set-up, complemented with an increased use of administrative
    data to reduce the need of dedicated surveys, have effectively reduced the overall cost of
    data collection in statistical offices of more advanced countries.

101. The statistical workforce will likely need to better reflect current and future demands,
    and technology needs. In the near term, Malaysia should strive to have a more balanced
    share between technical and support staff, in line with national statistical offices in other
    upper-middle- and high-income countries. For example, in Statistics Singapore, the
    Spanish Statistical Office, and Statistics Netherlands, at least 60 to 75 percent of staff are
    of management or professional grades. As professional staff are more highly paid, the
    transition to a more professional statistics office in those countries was accompanied by a
    leaner workforce, less dependent on supportive staff and more dependent on technology
    to support technical staff. To support this transition, training by the Malaysia Statistical
    Training Institute can continue helping staff in lower grades to acquire the new skills for
    specialized tasks related to specific statistical products.

102. Ongoing work to fill identified data gaps should continue. This refers, for instance, to
    areas such as price indicators for residential property. Also, labour market statistics, such
    as monthly/quarterly wage indicators for all industries, could be strengthened to provide
    more granularity and timeliness. On this, laudable efforts have been made, led by DOSM
    to establish a bureau of labor statistics for Malaysia. Similarly, there is a growing demand
    for data from policy-makers at the state and local municipal level, which could improve
    public service delivery and detailed firm -level data, which could enhance productivity
    analysis in the country.

   B. Efforts to improve data dissemination should focus on improving access to more micro data and
      refining the current legal framework

103. There have been considerable efforts to mobilize more publication of government
    data, led by both DOSM and MAMPU. The number of data sets in user-friendly format
    published over the years have gradually increased. Furthermore, Malaysia has the
    necessary building blocks which the country should take advantage of to enhance data
    dissemination and achieve a higher degree openness.
104. The current constraints and limitations in accessing micro and granular data should be
    removed over time. Survey data among Malaysian data users have indicated that while
    publicly available data is relatively easy to access, almost 90 percent of the respondents
    also said that the level of granularity in inadequate for rigorous analysis, which is key in
    producing quality and meaningful research. Expanding the current MOUs with 12
    universities on microdata access to more accredited universities, think-tanks as well as
    international academic institutions could be a first step in this direction.

105. The legal environment for data management in Malaysia calls for further refinement
    to facilitate open data. Data holders are not always confident about the application of
    general rules and regulations related to privacy and confidentiality, and individual
    agencies may also face specific internal data management regulations. This creates a
    fragmented environment for data management that lacks clarity for both government and
    the public on how data can be requested, shared and used. It also means that the majority
    of data exchanges, whether inter-agency or with non-government stakeholders, are
    decided on a case-by-case basis, with senior managerial approval necessary for most
    decisions.

   C. The scope for strengthening the collaborations among government agencies and other producers
      should focus on addressing data fragmentation issues

106. Establishing a coordinating mechanism to address data fragmentation issues across
    government ministries and agencies should be a top agenda for the Malaysian data
    ecosystem. While some aggregated data are shared publicly across government agencies
    through the data.gov.my site managed by MAMPU, many data sets still reside in
    individual ministries and agencies’ databases, which do not always share them, given
    unclear dissemination policies. This has led to various inefficiencies for authorities to
    tackle key policy issues such as immigrant labor or improving urban transport planning.
    Moreover, reducing data fragmentation at the state and local government level could also
    reduce redundancy of work and waste of resources.

107. The network of experts and researchers with government data holders and producers
    could also be strengthened. The scope of existing partnerships and collaborations with
    universities, research institutes and other external experts could expand beyond
    providing access to data, to include also collaboration on the analysis as well as dialogue
    to improve the data sets available, and ensuring the data meets a certain standard and is
    responsive to emerging issues.
   D. Engagement with users should be fluid to meet the growing appetite for more opportunities to
      interact and work with government data

108. There is need to strengthen the interaction between data provider and user to better
    understand current and future data demands. One way this can be achieved is by
    government agencies actively seeking out stakeholders with demand, seeking to provide
    more granular data for high-demand areas, publishing data inventories, and having
    standardized and streamlined procedures for requesting data. Currently, external
    stakeholders have offered assistance to agencies to better understand demand, and help
    increase availability and quality of data provision. In addition, improved access to
    statistical products can be done by: (i) increasing sharing of microdata with more users
    within the government sector, and within the scientific and research domain by “remote
    access”; (ii) increase the potential of the secure room by releasing more microdata to
    enhance research capacities and findings; and (iii) liberalizing more products through a
    forward-looking microdata release policy that sets clear principles for dissemination and
    anonymity protection. As an initial step, MAMPU is looking into the possibility of
    establishing a program that could create an information-sharing coordination mechanism
    and data exchange infrastructure.

109. Reinforcing on-going efforts to strengthen data providers’ website. DOSM’s recent
    undertaking to improve data access for the public has been noteworthy. New tools such
    as StatsDW and e-Statistik platforms are clear examples that allow data users to visualize
    and download the available statistics for free, moving beyond previously-published
    aggregate indicators and tables. Users expect ongoing improvements to the website and
    expanding it to an array of other electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, etc.
    Consultations with users, website evaluation surveys, visitor pattern analysis, and web-
    based metrics provide complementary sources of information to understand web
    presence, and gather up-to-date information on user expectations.

110. Efforts to educate the users and the general public on understanding data could be
    amplified. While efforts have been made to engage with the general public to inform
    about the availability of data through events like hackathons, a more continual, interactive
    and collaborative engagement between government data holders and users should be
    made regularly, particularly on explaining its methodology and calculations. Such
    engagements can help users better understand the data, and improve the quality of how
    the data is being analyzed; and concurrently, minimize the incidences of data being
    misinterpreted or viewed as being inaccurate. This also provides an opportunity for data
    users to provide feedback and input to data holders on how data can be made even more
    useful and targeted.

In line with global trend of data driven transformation, Malaysia is rigorously pursuing the
power of data for public service delivery enhancement, and strengthening Government
transparency and accountability. MAMPU has embarked on several big data analytics (BDA)
programs since 2015. We started our BDA initiatives with pilot and proof of concept projects.
Based on the experiences and lesson learnt in those pilot and proof of concept projects, we
embarked of few more BDA initiatives.

Spurring Big Data Analytics (BDA) in Malaysia

Malaysia has developed a Public Sector Big Data Analytics (BDA) framework with the vision of
Malaysia as a Leading Regional BDA solution hub and deliver new value to all sectors. MAMPU
has created a governance structure for data driven (BDA and Open Data) initiatives comprising
of Steering Committee, Technical Committee and project team for the implementation of Open
Data and Big Data Analytics in the public sector.

Public Sector Data Driven Program has created the national ecosystem for proliferating of the
use of BDA as a catalyst for further economic growth. The key deliverables of the programs are
as follows:

       Framework for supporting public sector BDA adoption in every cluster since the
        development of the National BDA Framework.

       Governance structure comprising of Steering Committee, Technical Committee and
        Project Team for Implementation of Open Data and Big Data Analytics (BDA) in the
        public sector to monitor the development and implementation of Public Sector Data
        Driven initiatives.

       Methodology for the development of Public Sector BDA leveraging on the Public Sector
        Open Data (Data Terbuka Sektor Awam - DTSA) platform and Public Sector BDA (Analitis
        Data Raya Sektor Awam - DRSA) platform established by MAMPU that can be used by
        the Public Sector agencies as sandbox for developing data products and innovations.

       Public Administrative Transformation Circular and Guidelines No.1 Year 2017 –
        Implementation of Public Sector BDA to encourage Public Sector agencies to implement
        Big Data Analytics towards enhancing public service delivery effectiveness and
        productivity. Moreover, all agencies are encouraged to leverage on the existing platform
        of DRSA provided by MAMPU.

       Innovation – MAMPU has organised Hackathon programme since 2015 to provide space
        and knowledge sharing for developing innovative products among civil servants,
        industry, academia, high school students and citizens to improve the quality of digital
        services.

       Capability Development – BDA project provide the opportunity for various public
        sector agencies on training, coaching and development of data analytics by using Open
        Source data analytic tools such as R.

       Consultancy Services - MAMPU also provide consultancy services for Public Sector
        agencies in initiating BDA programmes.

       Open Data initiated by MAMPU has created the data lakes which finally contribute to
        the establishment of Public Sector Data Ocean. Currently our open data portal achieves
        to have 2,026 datasets available to be access and used by the general public to data held
        by national governments.
