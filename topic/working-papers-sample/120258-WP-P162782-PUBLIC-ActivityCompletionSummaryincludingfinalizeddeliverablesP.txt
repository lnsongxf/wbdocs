                         BRIEF ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION

                         The Ministry of Petroleum of Egypt has recently embarked in a comprehensive Modernization Program of the Petroleum
                         and Gas Sector in Egypt. Phase 1 of the Modernization Program has been completed, including a comprehensive design
                         of key priorities: (a) Enhancing investment attraction through streamlining concession agreements, (b) sector restructuring
                         into separate policy, regulatory and operational entities, (c) improving human resource practices, (d) optimizing
                         downstream performance, (e) redesigning the upstream contractual frameworks, and enhance operational efficiency
                         across the oil and gas value chain, (f) promoting Egypt as a regional gas hub. These prioritized activities are intended to
                         attain the three objectives of reducing fiscal deficit, attract private sector capital especially foreign investments in the
                         petroleum and gas sector in Egypt, and demonstrate a role model for improving public sector governance within Egypt. In
                         addition, a detailed institutional structure with a fully staffed Modernization Realization Office as the core nucleus of the
                         program has been set up, along with pre-identified activities as quick wins over 3-9 months backed by a strategic
                         communication program.
                         This activity was funded through the Extractives Global Programmatic Support (EGPS) multi-donor trust fund and consisted
                         of capacity building aimed at the Modernization Realization Office (MRO), primarily on how to manage the transition

                         supported the engagement of relevant counterparts in the MRO as well as supported the organization of two capacity-
                         building workshops for MRO staff on how to manage the transition of the petroleum and gas sector.



                         DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE

                         Strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Petroleum and its Modernization Realization Office to manage the transition
                         during the petroleum sector modernization program.

                         Lessons Learned
                         It was critical to the success of this project that it received the clear endorsement and support of the Minister
                         of Petroleum, who attended the opening of the workshops and expressed to all attending the importance of
                         this capacity building efforts.

                         Moreover, the project benefitted from a strong sense of ownership of the Ministry of Petroleum and its
                         Modernization Office, who actively participated in the definition of the workshop content and its participants.

                         In addition, working with a team of consultants that had a deep knowledge/understanding of change the
                         broader context of the reform in Egypt and some familiarity with the participants. This allowed for quick
                         implementation and facilitated information sharing/team building efforts.

                         Finally, the team accompanied project implementation closely, attending both workshops and keeping regular
                         contact/communication with the Ministry of Petroleum and its Modernization Realization Office.
