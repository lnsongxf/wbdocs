1. Introduction
Purpose
This learning note contains the first systematic stocktaking by the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) of joint projects within the World Bank Group. It aims to offer
insights on both benefits of, and challenges in, developing, structuring, supervising,
monitoring, and evaluating World Bank Group joint projects. Specifically, this review
identifies: What are the core characteristics of these projects? What is the essence of the
“jointness” being analyzed? What are the push-pull factors at play? What counts as the
key value-added from a World Bank Group joint project? How is jointness factored in,
from initial project design and structuring to implementation, monitoring and
evaluation, and outcomes? And, what enables and inhibits successful World Bank
Group joint projects?

Providing interim answers to these questions required analytic focus on one of three
subsets of World Bank Group joint projects. Those that receive cofinancing from two or
more World Bank Group institutions form Type 1 joint projects, while Type 2 and Type
3 joint projects (which are collaborative sequential or parallel projects among World
Bank Group institutions) fall outside this review. Through this review of joint projects,
IEG hopes to contribute to better understanding of how the “One World Bank Group”
approach works in practice and at the basic operational level.

As noted, cofinanced (Type 1) projects provide the material for evaluation. These
projects have formal approval from the Board of Executive Directors and support from
at least two of the three World Bank Group institutions (World Bank 2016a).1 For joint
projects involving International Finance Corporation (IFC) Advisory Services or the
World Bank Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA), the projects’ formal Concept Notes
assisted IEG in determining jointness. As noted, parallel and sequential projects do not
appear in this learning note, although (subject to the Committee on Development
Effectiveness, Management of the World Bank Group institutions, and IEG priorities)
IEG’s future work program may evaluate these categories as well.


Context
The World Bank Group’s October 2013 strategy sets out how the three constituent
institutions should work in partnership for the World Bank Group’s development goals
(helping end extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable




                                                                                              1
CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
manner). “Operating as One World Bank Group” forms a central component of the 2013
strategy, which envisages increasing collaboration right across the World Bank Group.

Meanwhile, at the country level, the new Systematic Country Diagnostic and the
Country Program Framework tools have begun to put joint diagnostic and business
planning into the institutional mainstream. The World Bank Group Corporate
Scorecard also tracks institutional collaboration, and the 2013 strategy envisions more
joint projects within the World Bank Group. A planned review of World Bank’s
portfolio of products and services intends to improve synergies and eliminate overlap.
Numerous joint World Bank Group initiatives have followed since then. Most recently,
the $75 billion financing pledge of the 18th Replenishment of the International
Development Association (IDA) includes a $2.5 billion “IDA 18: IFC—Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) Private Sector Window” to support private
sector investment in IDA and fragile and conflict-affected situation (FCS) countries.

The rationale in this note for joint projects rests on three premises: (i)
complementarity—the three institutions’ instruments, resources, and assets
complement each other in various settings and contexts; (ii) commonality—World Bank
Group institutions work on common development challenges, countries, or types of
clients; and (iii) comparative advantage—the institutions combine their resources based
on respective competence or efficiency (transaction costs) in relation to internal or
external partners.

Each World Bank Group institution has a distinct business model, operational mandate,
internal process, organizational structure, institutional culture, budget, particular
clients, and unique staff expertise. They also have overlapping and complementary
development tools. These include financing, guarantees, and other risk-sharing
instruments provided to governments both at the national and subnational levels, and
to the private sector. Within the World Bank Group, the World Bank and IFC also
provide advisory services for the public or private sector. Not least, both possess
specialist knowledge—such as structuring and advising on public-private partnership
(PPP) transactions and improving investment climate.

At the same time, the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA subscribe to a common mission
embedded in their respective articles of agreement or convention: promote economic
development and encourage the flow of investments in productive purposes.2 The three
institutions also share the “One World Bank Group” goal of eliminating extreme
poverty and promoting shared prosperity sustainably.

World Bank Group joint projects epitomize the highest form of internal collaboration at
the operational level. Two or all three World Bank Group institutions combine

instruments and resources to deliver solutions to clients. Jointness is a means to (i) add
value for the client and (ii) increase the World Bank Group’s development effectiveness.

From a corporate perspective, of course, joint projects offer potential for offsetting
institutional, operational, and capital constraints as well as complementing the
strengths of each World Bank Group institution. To take one example, MIGA has a
limited reach. Its small staff based in Washington, D.C., cannot match the reach and
scope of IFC and World Bank staff, with their extensive Regional and country presence.
But MIGA enhances its portfolio by partnering with the IFC and World Bank. Joint
projects can also mobilize much-needed funds for development and help countries
achieve World Bank Group’s development goals.


Initiatives to Promote World Bank Group Joint Projects
During the last 20 years, successive policy and operational initiatives have sought to
increase the number of World Bank Group joint projects (figure 1.1). Aligning
development strategies, policies, operational structures, and practices form one
management objective: to promote collaboration among the three institutions as a
means to achieve the World Bank Group’s development mission. The following make
up the most prominent initiatives in the past two decades.

Joint country assistance strategies appeared in fiscal year (FY) 1996 to exploit better
synergies among the three institutions. These strategies formed the foundation of the
World Bank Group’s country programs until FY2014. A “new country engagement”
approach followed. Other intra-World Bank Group cooperation evolved. Prior to
FY2000, IFC had conducted environmental and social appraisals for MIGA projects
before MIGA established its own environmental and social unit and adopted its own
Safeguards Policy in FY2000. Yet another effort toward greater intra-World Bank
collaboration began in January 2000, with the merger of several private sector
development units across the World Bank Group into joint IFC-World Bank “Global
Product Groups.” These groups merged relevant IFC and World Bank sector staff into
the Information and Communication Technologies Department and the Oil, Gas,
Mining, and Chemicals Departments.

There has been no shortage of top-down intra-World Bank collaborative efforts.
Another occurred with the creation of a new IFC-World Bank Private Sector
Development Vice Presidency in May 2003. The objective: coordinate investment
climate–related activities and integrate private sector development issues into the
country assistance strategy process. This joint vice presidency evolved into the Finance
and Private Sector Development Vice Presidency, which then merged into various
Global Practice groups set up in the FY2014 World Bank reorganization. In March 2005,
a Working Group on Management of Guarantee Instruments of the World Bank and
MIGA was created to propose solutions to the fragmentation of World Bank Group
guarantee product offerings and exploit their full potential. The working group
recommended that the management structure of MIGA and World Bank guarantees
programs be unified under the MIGA Executive Vice President, but this was not
pursued.

These internal changes came on top of other collaborative initiatives and organizational
changes. All aimed at maximizing World Bank Group synergy and eliminating
institutional constraints (see figure 1.1).

Thus, in December 2006, MIGA’s Technical Assistance and Investment Promotion
Services unit merged with IFC’s Foreign Investment Advisory Service Department. This
later became IFC Advisory Services. An IDA-IFC Secretariat emerged on February 2008,
having a two-year mandate and aiming at improved intra-World Bank Group
collaboration.3 In early 2009, IFC and MIGA signed a Joint Business Development
Agreement targeting its joint support to financial institutions in Europe in response to

the global financial crisis. During the same year, a joint IFC-MIGA unit was created to
oversee the agreement’s implementation (see box 1.1). More improvements to the joint
agreement followed. In March 2010, IFC and MIGA expanded the agreement to cover
all sectors globally, and in July 2014, a revised agreement allowed MIGA to compensate
IFC for its support in processing potential joint transactions. The World Bank and
MIGA also piloted a similar agreement. In July 2010, a one-year marketing and
cooperation agreement joined the World Bank and MIGA to cross-market their
guarantee products and services. Although not renewed, periodic moves to harmonize
World Bank Group guarantee instruments continue to occur.

Procedural and locational impediments to project cofinancing by World Bank Group
continue to demand attention. In FY2013, for example, Operational Policy and World
Bank Procedure 4.03 emerged with the title, “Performance Standards for Private Sector
Activities.” These concerned the application and compliance by World Bank projects
involving the private sector (including PPPs) with IFC’s Environmental and Social
Performance Standards. Co-locating World Bank and IFC staff in country offices helped
address practical difficulties that hinder collaboration, as did the integration of various
IFC business lines and staff with several World Bank Global Practice departments (for
example, Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice and Finance and Markets Global
Practice) and Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas.

 Box 1.1. IFC-MIGA Business Development Agreement: Providing Incentives for Joint Projects
 Following the 2008 global financial crises, IFC and MIGA entered into a Joint Business
 Development Agreement to promote a joint World Bank Group response as part of the
 multilateral Vienna Initiative. The agreement, signed on February 26, 2009, allows IFC to
 market MIGA political risk insurance products and develop business with financial sector
 companies based in Western Europe. IFC’s marketing efforts targeted existing IFC clients,
 and new business opportunities and potential new IFC and MIGA clients. On March 5, 2010,
 the agreement was extended and broadened to cover sponsors, lenders, and private equity
 funds in all sectors. In July 2014, the agreement was revised to expand the scope of
 cooperation with MIGA, allowing it to compensate IFC for providing due diligence support
 to projects originated under the joint agreement. The agreement aimed to develop innovative
 approaches to business development, mobilize private capital, and find private sector
 solutions to emerging market issues through close collaboration between IFC and MIGA.
 To support implementation and achieve the desired results, several accountabilities,
 supporting structures, and incentive mechanisms were embedded in the agreement. In
 particular, IFC (i) provides marketing support to MIGA with respect to its products, targeting
 IFC’s new or existing clients and new potential business opportunities; or (ii) takes the lead in
 processing joint transactions and, with client consent as required, shares substantial project-
 related information with MIGA, both during the investment processing phase and the
 supervision phase. In turn, IFC is compensated for its role and contribution to MIGA’s
 operations. As incentive, MIGA pays IFC a fee for its role in IFC’s client referral and support



                                                                                                     5

INTRODUCTION
    activities. At the corporate level, IFC counts the amount of issued MIGA guarantees in its
    annual mobilization targets, which is then reflected in IFC’s Corporate Scorecard. At the staff
    level, joint project teams are recognized in the cross-corporate or team awards at IFC and
    MIGA. More important, IFC staff can include their work with MIGA in the “achievement”
    part of their annual work performance review.
    An IFC-MIGA business development unit serves as the focal point and one-stop shop for staff
    and clients. The unit is accountable for results delivery. The unit gets support from a network
    of IFC-MIGA Global Champions, comprising 20 volunteer IFC staff across IFC headquarters
    and field offices in the financial markets, infrastructure, manufacturing, agribusiness, and
    services sectors. These champions serve as the knowledge experts, liaison officers, and
    business developers for MIGA products across IFC Regional and sector units.
    From FY2011 to FY2015, the Joint Business Development Agreement generated 32 IFC-MIGA
    joint projects (IEG’s mutually exclusive count), which translated into $2.5 billion of MIGA
    mobilization. This amount accounted for 19 percent of MIGA gross exposure during this five-
    year period. Beyond the amount mobilized, the agreement provides a platform for both IFC
    and MIGA to meet their strategic commitments and enhance operational efficiency.
    Sources: Joint Business Development Agreement between IFC and MIGA; IFC-MIGA Business Development Unit.

Finally, and parallel to all these organizational changes, a new country engagement
approach received approval in 2014. This mandated a formal integration of IFC and
MIGA into the country diagnostics and country programming processes. A “One World
Bank Group” approach—tied to the Systematic Country Diagnostics, Country
Partnership Framework, and the Joint Implementation Plans—emerged, providing a
strategic platform for increasing World Bank Group joint projects.

Parallel to these two decades of operational and policy initiatives, intra-World Bank
Group collaboration continues to occur at different levels: in strategy, policy, and
operations. The previous paragraphs show the incremental and structural changes
inculcating the need for institutional jointness. In today’s World Bank Group, informal
and formal consultations happen routinely among and between management and
operational staff. Numerous initiatives continue to facilitate and institutionalize
jointness among IFC, MIGA, and World Bank staff. These affect the corporate, Regional,
and sectoral levels as well as in-country programs and specific projects.4 Within the
World Bank Group, coordination and collaboration at every level, including at the
project level, have become familiar concepts and familiar practice.


World Bank Group Joint Projects: A Theory of Change
A theory of change originating in the 2013 World Bank Group strategy was developed
as the rationale for joint projects for purposes of this learning note (World Bank 2013c).
The theory recognized that (i) the World Bank Group has a comprehensive package of

                                                                               CHAPTER 1
                                                                            INTRODUCTION
complementary tangible and nontangible instruments, resources, assets, and intellectual
capital, allowing it to fashion bespoke solutions to public and private sector clients’
complex development problems; (ii) the World Bank Group can maximize the
comparative advantages of each of its three institutions, thereby achieving synergies as
a collective entity meeting complex development challenges; in other words, the entire
World Bank Group is greater than the sum of its constituent parts when it comes to
meeting today’s complex global context; and (iii) joint projects can achieve objectives
and outcomes otherwise not possible if pursued separately by the respective
institutions. Figure 1.2 illustrates the simplified theory of change for joint projects
derived from the 2013 World Bank Group Strategy.

Defining Joint Projects
Prior to the October 2013 World Bank Group Strategy, a collaborative vision had
emerged in a 2009 IDA-IFC Secretariat document on models of collaboration (World
Bank 2009a). This document separated joint World Bank Group projects into three types


                                                                                       7

INTRODUCTION
as illustrated in figure 1.3. The concept note for this learning note explains the
distinction between the three types in detail (World Bank 2016a). In practice, however,
joint projects have operated under varying definitional and reporting regimes, despite
the apparently direct categorization.5,6 As a result, systematic tracking of approved
World Bank Group joint projects had become difficult.

Keeping this stocktaking of recent collaborative efforts in mind, this learning note
focuses—as noted—on cofinanced Type 1 projects, having formal approval from the
Board of Executive Directors of at least two of the three World Bank Group institutions.
Focusing on Type 1 joint projects provides solid comparative material. Each project has
won approval as a designated joint project by the board—an unambiguous sign of
intent—and because these projects align with the typology of joint projects in the 2013
World Bank Group strategy document (World Bank 2013c).

Methodology
Identifying World Bank Group joint projects. This learning note rests on a review of
all 112 cofinanced (Type 1) joint projects approved by the three institutions from FY1995
to FY2015 (table 1.1). This total reflects a mutually exclusive count of the related
individual projects by each of the two or three World Bank Group institutions. A stand-
alone portfolio database for all joint projects does not exist. IEG created a database of
Type 1 joint projects as extracted from project portfolio data held by IFC, MIGA, and
World Bank regarding projects approved, committed or issued from FY1995 to FY2015.

approved/committed/issued from FY1995 to FY2015 and evaluated from FY2000 to FY2015. If based on project ID number
count, these 112 paired projects correspond to 301 individual projects of World Bank, IFC, and MIGA. Amounts represent actual
commitments by World Bank and IFC and gross exposure by MIGA. World Bank non-ASA products include investment project
financing, project-based guarantees, development policy operations, and program-for-results. IS = investment services; PRI =
political risk insurance.

This note also contains the first systematic review and analysis of World Bank Group
joint projects involving MIGA. The process of project identification was not easy: IFC
and World Bank project portfolio data sets tagged joint World Bank and IFC projects (a
legacy from the IDA-IFC Secretariat), whereas the record of MIGA’s joint projects was
extracted from its annual reports and the MIGA executive vice president’s quarterly
reports to the board. (To eliminate false positives, IEG cross-checked the identified Type
1 joint projects from board and other approval documents, sharing the list with IFC,
MIGA, and Operations Policy and Country Services for verification.)

Identifying World Bank Group joint projects results. Other data relevant to this
review were gleaned from records about development outcomes, drivers, and lessons
learned from 35 World Bank Group joint projects evaluated by at least one of the
partner World Bank Group institutions (and validated by IEG)7 during the period
FY2000 to FY2015. The review of project documents was supplemented with a review of
World Bank Group strategies and collaboration initiatives as well as IEG country
program, sector, and thematic reports. IEG also reviewed the literature on collaboration
theory and on collaboration evaluation, which helped provide the organizing
framework for the analysis (appendix B). To enrich the learning note, IEG
supplemented the desk review with related interviews and discussions with World
Bank Group staff with experience in joint projects.

INTRODUCTION
Terminologies used. The terms World Bank Group joint projects and joint projects are
used interchangeably in the rest of the learning note to refer to World Bank Group
cofinanced (Type 1) joint projects. The term cofinanced joint projects used in this note
means using different combination of IFC, MIGA and World Bank products and
instruments—from loans, guarantees, equity, risk-sharing facilities, ASAs, and technical
assistances—in a single project. This catch-all term is consistent with that used in the
World Bank Group Strategy (World Bank 2013c).

Limitations. This learning note has assessed World Bank Group cofinancing of a single
type of project only—the Type 1 joint project. Parallel and sequential joint projects are
not part of this review and must await separate study. This note recognizes there are
other forms of internal World Bank Group cooperation or collaboration endeavors, but
this initial stocktaking exercise did not include such activities. This note also covers the
20-year period, FY1995 to FY2015, and excludes the most recent intra-World Bank
Group collaborative activities as their results have not been evaluated yet. Although the
past may not necessarily inform present events, taking a long view helped IEG
understand better the characteristics of joint projects as well as the motivations of
“pioneering” World Bank Group staff who worked on joint projects when the enabling
environment for collaborative work across the institutions was not well defined.

IEG distilled some generalized findings from the desk review, but it could not perform
further quantitative analysis to test robustness. IEG learning products are confined to a
review of existing evaluation materials and cannot include additional data. Obtaining
data on the cost of developing, supervising, monitoring, and evaluating joint projects
proved difficult, primarily because accounting and budget processes lack coordination
across the World Bank Group. On the other information gaps, IEG benefited from a
group discussion with several IFC, MIGA, and World Bank staff who have experience
in developing, structuring or underwriting, appraising, supervising, monitoring, and
evaluating World Bank Group joint projects. Their experiences and lessons are
integrated herein.

The remainder of this note is organized as follows: Chapter 2 presents the profile of
World Bank Group cofinanced projects based on IEG’s portfolio review. Chapter 3
identifies the contributions and challenges in World Bank Group joint operations,
summarizing the value-added and the challenges of joint projects from the perspective
of clients, World Bank Group staff, and IEG. Chapter 4 reviews the presence or absence
(intensity) of World Bank Group project teams’ interactions in joint operations
throughout the project cycle—from project scoping or concept to evaluation. The
chapter then presents IEG’s analysis of development outcomes and drivers of the
evaluated joint operations and compares these with the intensity of World Bank Group
project team interactions throughout the project cycle. IEG also reviewed related project

documents to learn more about the motivation for jointness and the varying intensity of
interactions at the project level. Chapter 5 summarizes the lessons on effective World
Bank Group jointness and sets out the implications for working as One World Bank
Group going forward.


1 Details on the different types of joint World Bank Group projects are discussed in the concept
note for this learning note (World Bank 2016a).
2 IDA’s Articles of Agreement (2012 version) states its purpose is “to promote economic

development, increase productivity and thus raise standards of living in the less-developed
areas of the world included within the Association’s membership.” (IDA Articles of Agreement
2012). IBRD’s Articles of Agreement varies slightly but nevertheless affirms the purpose of the
Bank is “to assist in the reconstruction and development of territories of members by facilitating
the investment of capital for productive purposes, including the restoration of economies
destroyed or disrupted by war, the reconversion of productive facilities to peacetime needs and
the encouragement of the development of productive facilities and resources in less developed
countries.” IFC’s Articles of Agreement (2012 version) also affirms its purpose is “to further
economic development by encouraging the growth of productive enterprise in member
countries, particularly in the less developed areas” thus supplementing the activity of the Bank.
MIGA’s objective and purpose as stated in its convention supplements the activities of IBRD
and IFC by “encouraging the flow of investments for productive purposes among member
countries” (MIGA Convention, Article 2).
3 The IDA-IFC Secretariat closed officially on December 31, 2010.
4 By way of example, in the Human Development sphere, the Health-in-Africa (HiA) initiative,

a joint work between World Bank and IFC, and growing collaboration on the Jobs agenda are
illustrative examples. In the Middle East and North Africa Region, while there are no
cofinanced World Bank Group joint projects, there are several other types of collaborative joint
projects on jobs and productive inclusion with Jobs and Trade and Competitiveness Global
Practice (GP) (led by Social Protection and Labor GP in Tunisia and Lebanon, by Trade and
Competitiveness in Jordan, and by Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience GP in Morocco). These
programs were developed in consultation and synergy with IFC. Another example is the
Program-for-Results support in Jordan (Jordan: Economic Opportunities for Jordanians and
Syrian Refugees), which complements IFC activities (e.g., IFC and International Labour
Organization Better Work initiative) and paves the way for follow-on IFC activities in Jordan.
5 As an example, IFC defines a joint project with the World Bank as follows: a project with

“shared World Bank and IFC objectives and [with] cofinancing by the World Bank through one
or more of the following: (i) loan, equity, other financial product; (ii) Advisory Services
(Advisory Services) or technical assistance; (iii) resources provided through grant or financial
allocation; and (iv) joint staffing or cross-support for Advisory Services projects.” In this regard,
joint IFC-World Bank projects differ from “IFC-World Bank Complementary Projects,” which
IFC defines as an “IFC project having shared objectives with [an] interdependent or parallel
World Bank project requiring active coordination.”
6 The World Bank Group Strategy consolidated “joint World Bank Group projects” into two

types: cofinanced (Type 1) and sequential (Type 2) projects (World Bank 2013a, 31).
7 Independent project evaluations by IEG (Project Evaluation Report, Project Evaluation

Summary) were also part of the evaluative materials used.

2. World Bank Group Joint Projects: A Portfolio
Snapshot
Despite numerous initiatives to facilitate joint projects, the number of approved World
Bank Group joint operations with commitments1 had not risen in a commensurate way,
making projections of future World Bank Group joint projects challenging. Considering
the number of past initiatives toward this result, notably the October 2013 strategy for a
One World Bank Group approach, it seems reasonable to assume that joint project
approvals would rise steadily, year-on-year. Past trends, however, have been otherwise,
as the numbers in figure 2.1 reveal. Over the 20-year period, FY2013 and FY2014 saw
the highest number of joint project approvals, with 11 joint projects approved. But joint
project approvals declined the next year, FY2015, to just five. Looking ahead, the World
Bank Group’s “New Country Engagement” approach (involving Systematic Country
Diagnostics, Country Partnership Frameworks, and Joint Implementation Plans) may
push the figure back up again.

Nearly three-quarters of approved joint projects (83 of 112 joint projects) supported
investment projects through a blend of IFC investments, MIGA guarantees, or World
Bank non-ASA instruments. Another 16 joint projects combined investment financing
and ASA products. Cofinanced projects employing a combination of IFC investments
and MIGA political risk insurance (PRI) have a longer history and remained relatively
stable during the past 20 years. By contrast, joint operations financed by a blend of
World Bank non-ASA instruments (investment project financing and project-based
guarantees [PBGs]) and IFC investment had been sporadic—the first occurring in
FY1998 and then again in FY2002, FY2005, and FY2009 onward. The World Bank Group
product mix in cofinanced joint projects began to diversify only in FY2005 (see figure
2.1). IFC supported over half of World Bank Group joint operations, followed by MIGA
and then by the World Bank (figure 2.2). Joint projects with IFC consisted mostly of
investments, primarily loans. The World Bank, on the other hand, deployed mainly its
PBG instruments (13 of 23 joint projects involving the World Bank—see figure 2.2) and
in four joint projects, World Bank guarantees were blended with investment project
financing.2

The cofinancing of projects by World Bank Group institutions is not new. In general, it
has tracked broader investment flow trends. Ninety-one joint projects (81 percent of the
total) received approval, commitment, and started implementation before the “One
World Bank Group” mandate in October 2013. Prior to FY2000, World Bank Group
jointness reflected private investor demand for IFC financing linked to MIGA PRI. This
period also reflects the opening of Europe and Central Asia economies to private
investment and several Europe and Central Asia countries’ entry into the European
Union. Similarly, joint projects approved for the Africa Region before FY2000 supported
the first waves of private foreign direct investment (FDI) into Kenya, Mozambique, and
Uganda, as well as the inception of the Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline.

World Bank Group joint projects for the Africa Region have increased markedly in the
last five years (FY2011–15, see figure 2.3). Of the 18 joint projects in Africa approved
during this period, seven received cofinancing from all three World Bank Group
institutions, all aiming to increase electricity generation in Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire,
Kenya, Nigeria, and Senegal. A mix of IFC loan and/or equity, MIGA PRI, and World
Bank PBGs supported private independent power producers in these countries. For the
other six joint projects in this Region, blended financing came in the form of World
Bank ASA, World Bank Development Policy Financing, or World Bank Specific
Investment Loan combined with IFC advisory, all aimed at improving the investment
climate in Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Rwanda, Sao Tomé and Principe, South Africa, and South
Sudan. In addition, three joint projects (to improve the enabling environment for

agriculture in Cameroon, Rwanda, and Tanzania) were financed by a mix of IDA grants
or IFC loans or advisory support. Finally, the World Bank Group has also provided a
blend of IFC advisory and World Bank ASA support for Region-wide programs such as
Lighting Africa and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa.

Cofinancing Middle East and North Africa area projects also has increased, albeit
slightly, in the past 10 years. Joint project approvals rose from two to nine, thanks to
cofinancing of power projects in Jordan and Lebanon, and a manufacturing project in
Iraq. These projects were the result of the IFC-MIGA business development agreement.
The Middle East and North Africa small and medium enterprise financing facility, part
of the Arab World Initiative (or AWI), also boosted the number of World Bank Group
joint projects in this Region. This small and medium enterprise facility had blended
financing from an IFC risk-sharing facility and a World Bank Adaptable Program Loan.

the same, indicating that the country’s income classification does not drive demand for
World Bank Group cofinancing. Half of these joint projects (58 of 112 projects) are
located in IDA countries while the rest (54 of 112 projects) are in IBRD-blend countries.

Nearly half of the World Bank Group’s cofinanced projects supported infrastructure
sector. These joint projects mostly support PPPs plus some project-finance type
infrastructure projects, a financing structure commonly applied to projects involving
private investment (see figure 2.4). This partly explains the paucity of World Bank
Group cofinanced projects within the ambit of the World Bank’s Human Development
network. Sectors within the human development network are still considered the main
domain of government or public sector. In the past 20 years only one World Bank
Group cofinanced project has emerged in the health sector—a hospital project
supported by an IFC investment and a PRI from MIGA.

Although World Bank Group joint projects have increased in recent years, they still
account for a modest share of overall World Bank Group project approvals and
commitments. With the exception of MIGA, joint projects among other World Bank
Group institutions accounted for a very small share of overall World Bank Group
project volume. It is a different situation for MIGA, however; joint projects with the
World Bank and IFC formed a significant part of its total portfolio, measured by volume
and amount (table 2.1). For MIGA, joint projects have helped expand reach, allowing
the agency to increase interaction with IFC and World Bank clients. By way of contrast,
cofinanced projects involving the World Bank amounted to less than one percent of
total committed projects during the past 20 years. IFC’s joint projects, supported by
investment or advisory services, figured only slightly higher in its portfolio than in that
of the World Bank.

However, only a third of joint projects involved exclusive support from World Bank
Group institutions—the majority involved other international finance institutions (IFIs).
Seventy-six of the 112 joint projects had financing, or co-provision of technical
assistance, from other IFIs.1 These include bilateral development assistance agencies,
regional development banks, and national export credit agencies. In nearly two-thirds
of these joint investment projects, private sector clients already had support from their
national or regional development or export credit agencies when entering into
negotiation with the World Bank Group. Foreign engineering procurement and
construction contractors (for infrastructure projects financed or guaranteed by the IFC,
MIGA, and World Bank), had already secured trade financing or guarantees from their
national export credit agency before seeking World Bank Group support. A pulp mill
project, for example, had already arranged loans, trade financing, and investment
guarantees from the sponsor’s national investment bank and its export credit agency
when it sought support from MIGA and then IFC. Several joint projects had multibillion

U.S. dollar investments beyond any single IFI’s capacity to support. For example, one
transnational oil and gas project receiving partial support from the World Bank Group
had $6.5 billion investment requirement. Joint financing with external partners have
also allowed for better distribution of risks.

3. World Bank Group Joint Projects: Value-
Added and Challenges
The first part of this chapter discusses the value-added made by World Bank Group
joint projects based on the portfolio review of cofinanced projects. The second part
describes challenges in developing, structuring or underwriting, supervising, and
monitoring joint projects—as seen by clients and World Bank Group staff. There are
also challenges for IEG in evaluating joint projects.


Joint World Bank Group Projects’ Additionality
ADDITIONALITY 1: FACILITATING INVESTMENTS IN HIGH-RISK SITUATIONS
World Bank Group joint projects contributed to a significant de-risking of client
investments in otherwise high-risk countries. Using Institutional Investors Country Risk
Ratings data, 86 of 112 joint projects (or 77 percent) operate in countries having below-
average country risk scores at project approval stage. Only 25 of these 112 joint projects
(22 percent) are located in the current list of FCS countries while another 30 joint
projects (27 percent) have been located in countries considered by the World Bank
Group to be fragile, conflict-affected, or post conflict countries at the time of project
approval.1 The below-average Institutional Investor Country Risk Rating ratings for
non-FCS countries reflect severe economic downturns, weak legal and financial
institutions, or other vulnerabilities.

For these risky projects, the World Bank Group has provided a comprehensive and
complementary financing and technical assistance package unavailable from
commercial sources as well as risk-mitigation products to abate or ameliorate
commercial, environmental, human capacity, political, regulatory, and social risks. The
Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline project involved countries with low institutional capacity.
This joint project included capacity building and technical assistance through IDA
credits and IFC advisory support to address the investment’s “soft” but essential
developmental components.

Similarly, World Bank Group support for the Nam Theun 2 project combined an IDA
partial risk guarantee (PRG) plus an IDA grant, and a MIGA PRI for a comprehensive
commercial, political, and environmental and social risk-mitigation package. The IDA
grant financed (i) a portion of the hydropower project works, on behalf of the equity
financing contributions of the government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic; (ii)
the management of the project’s environmental and social impacts; and (iii) the


                                                                                       19
CHAPTER 3
WORLD BANK GROUP JOINT PROJECTS: VALUE-ADDED AND CHALLENGES
monitoring and evaluation of environmental and social conditions in the affected areas
and of the achievement of project objectives by panels of experts (for example, the Dam
Safety Review Panel and the Social and Environmental Panel of Experts), independent
monitoring agencies, and other monitoring and evaluation activities. Project monitoring
by the panels of experts were required under the World Bank’s Safeguard Policies. In
another example of joint project packaging, the Afghanistan Investment Guarantee
Facility rests on another IDA grant—the aim being to lower political risks impeding
private FDI flows into that country. The Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility’s
first-loss coverage allowed MIGA to distribute risks which lowered investment
insurance costs for private investors. More important, the joint support package opened
a window for political risk coverage of investments in Afghanistan hitherto unavailable
from private and most public investment insurers.

Another value-added from World Bank Group joint projects comes in the lowering of
risk in investments with an overlapping or multilayered risk profile. High-risk
characteristics include environmentally sensitive investments having Category A
environmental and social risk classification, and PPP-type projects in infrastructure and
extractive industries. Additional high risks attach to various types of pioneering
investments or a private sector client’s first cross-border, or greenfield investments. In
financial sector projects, on-lending or risk-sharing facilities enabled by joint funding
from the World Bank and IFC target beneficiaries seen as having high credit risk, such
as micro, small, and medium enterprises and low-income households. By way of
example, IFC Advisory Services and World Bank ASA have partnered to develop
financial infrastructure in Afghanistan and to jumpstart capital market development in
Vietnam.

The menu of World Bank Group complementary products or services and instruments
is best suited to high-risk projects and to clients or investors seeking to mitigate these
risks. Risky projects require long-term concessional financing and guarantees not
readily available from foreign or local commercial sources. For World Bank Group joint
projects focused on boosting project finance, there is often a financing package that
includes an IFC B loan, a MIGA PRI, and a World Bank PRG. For the Sasol-ROMPCO-
Southern Africa Regional Gas project, products from different World Bank Group
institutions eased cross-border risks. In addition to an IBRD PRG and a MIGA PRI, IFC
provided both South African and Mozambican investors with an additional layer of risk
mitigation. Indeed, the IFC’s equity investment in the state-owned company allowed
Mozambique, which possesses natural gas resources, to take an ownership stake in the
project.2 In countries or states with underdeveloped business enabling environments, a
World Bank development policy loan (DPL), which targeted policy reforms and
institutional and human capacity building, sometimes combined with IFC advisory
support to facilitate inward investments. Combining instruments like this occurred in

                                           WORLD BANK GROUP JOINT PROJECTS: VALUE-ADDED AND CHALLENGES
joint projects for the Bihar DPL-Investment Climate Reform, the Sao Tomé and Principe
Governance and Competitiveness Development Policy Operation-Investment Climate,
and for the Ukraine DPL 2 and 3-Business Enabling Environment.

World Bank Group joint projects have also supported environmentally sensitive
investments in infrastructure and extractive industries. The World Bank Group has
recognized expertise and experience (a comparative advantage) in ensuring that
projects meet environmental and social standards. Twenty-eight of World Bank Group
joint investment projects (25 percent) were Category A projects—a larger proportion
compared with Category A nonjoint projects of IFC and the World Bank (figure 3.1).
Category A joint projects included a mix of loans and guarantees (PBGs and/or PRI) for
several mining operations, and for oil and gas projects, hydropower plants, and toll
road projects. Joint projects supporting infrastructure and extractive industries
investments mostly fell into the category of project financing. Among the 10 joint
projects supported by all three World Bank Group institutions, seven were Category A
projects.

CHAPTER 3
WORLD BANK GROUP JOINT PROJECTS: VALUE-ADDED AND CHALLENGES
ADDITIONALITY 2: SUPPORTING PIONEERING INVESTMENTS IN MEMBER COUNTRIES
Ground-breaking first-time investments represented nearly half of all World Bank
Group joint projects. These investments have an untested quality, and are seen as risky
ventures with overlapping environmental, financial, operational, regulatory, social, and
technical challenges. Pioneering joint projects of this type included the following first-
movers:

        The first privatization of a state-owned electricity distribution company in the
         Sub-Saharan Africa Region (Umeme Limited, in Uganda)
        Guatemala’s (and central America’s) first privately financed geothermal power
         plant (Orzunil 1 geothermal project)
        Tajikistan’s first PPP, enabling Pamir Energy to serve remote populations
        Sri Lanka’s first independent power producers—achieved notwithstanding civil
         strife—pioneered by Asia Private Power Ltd., Sri Lanka
        Honduras’ first privately developed and owned power plant (for Electricidad de
         Cortes, Honduras)
        East Africa’s first modern bulk-handling and storage facility for imported grains
         and fertilizers (for Grain Bulk Handlers Ltd., in Kenya)
        Sub-Saharan Africa’s first cross-border, regional natural gas market (for South
         Africa and Mozambique)

Several World Bank Group joint projects have pioneered FDI inflows in client countries.
By way of example, a Europe and Central Asia country lacked a regulatory regime for
non-oil sector FDI up until the approval of a joint manufacturing project involving IFC
investments and MIGA guarantee for this type of FDI. The joint project initiated the
approval of tax and accounting rules for non-oil foreign investment. Another example
appeared when IFC and MIGA joined to support a smelter plant in Mozambique—the
country’s largest foreign investment after its civil war. The project became a catalyst for
significant additional FDI into Mozambique. Other examples of pioneering IFC and
MIGA joint projects include support for the first hotel privatization in Burkina Faso,
and a mining investment considered at the time as the largest FDI in the Kyrgyz
Republic.

The World Bank Group’s different technical assistance products have joined to design
and fund an experimental initiative. The Lighting Africa program, relying on IFC
advisory and World Bank ASA support, aimed to transform the solar lighting market to
meet the need for basic lighting by the ‘base of the pyramid.’ The joint initiatives have
demonstrated the feasibility of sustainable commercial markets for quality off-grid
lighting in Africa, and globally.

ADDITIONALITY 3: FACILITATING FDI FOR FIRST-TIME CROSS-BORDER INVESTORS
World Bank Group joint projects have supported first-time private investors in
developing markets—often in projects involving large amounts of equity. Several
World Bank Group–assisted investments of this type marked the largest-ever FDI
inflow—raising the risk of political backlash. One example is the pulp mill project in
which a private foreign company had substantial equity invested in its first overseas
investment, also the largest FDI ever brought into the country. In the aftermath of a
regional financial crisis, the investor found it hard to acquire long-term financing from
commercial sources. Because of a neighboring country’s opposition to the project, the
investor first sought a MIGA PRI. The investor also chose IFC for its long-term B loan,
as well as for its technical and environmental due diligence and supervision
experiences. MIGA was able to provide long-term PRI and dispute resolution support—
a good example of the complementarity of World Bank Group products and
comparative advantage.

In a South-South agribusiness joint project supported by IFC and MIGA, a small
company investor tried to revive a failed state-owned joint venture rice farm that was
just privatized. Although highly consistent with IFC’s and MIGA’s strategic priorities,
the project’s risks factors were multilayered:

      It was the sponsor’s first venture into rice production;
      The high start-up risk required for large-scale rice farming, especially developing
       a long-idled farm land; and
      The project’s remote location close to a border rife with armed insurgency.

The private investor has failed to win approval for long-term financing from local or
foreign banks. The issue: country and project risks. Commercial insurers hesitated to
provide long-term PRI, due to the small guarantee amount and high-risk premium. In
this situation, an IFC senior loan coupled to a MIGA guarantee, both issued with long-
term maturity, allowed the proposed investment to proceed.

Another investment involved a start-up beverage manufacturing plant, a first step in
the investor’s ambition to become a major beverage producer in the Europe and Central
Asia Region. The investor wanted both IFC financing and the IFC’s technical,
marketing, and environmental advice. Although IFC’s investment package included a B
loan, the foreign investor also sought MIGA coverage given expropriation risks and the
investee country’s weak private investment regulatory regime.

ADDITIONALITY 4: SUPPORTING COMPLEX AND COMPLICATED TRANSNATIONAL PROJECTS
The World Bank Group has jointly supported complex single projects in two or more
countries. Seven transnational projects, forming large-sized, Category A projects are


                                                                                           23
CHAPTER 3
WORLD BANK GROUP JOINT PROJECTS: VALUE-ADDED AND CHALLENGES
primarily in the oil and gas sector. World Bank Group joint project support appealed to
both public and private sector clients for the recognized institutional competencies and
complementarity of products and services, namely,

        the ability to offer long-term, concessional financing and guarantees not available
         from commercial sources;
        the variety of World Bank Group products addressing different risk layers in
         transnational projects, including policy aspects;
        technical expertise or experience in project design and in navigating
         environmental and social issues, an especially critical consideration in resource
         extractive industries; and
        supervisory support for project implementation and monitoring.

These competencies have been prominent in transnational World Bank Group joint
projects, including

        the Bolivia-Brazil Gas Transmission,
        Sasol-ROMPCO-Southern Africa Regional Gas (Mozambique and South Africa),
        the Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline,
        Nam Theun 2 (Lao PDR and Thailand),
        the West Africa Gas Pipeline (Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo), and
        the Africa Railway project (Kenya and Uganda).

More recently, the three World Bank Group institutions cofinanced and guaranteed the
construction of two hydropower plants that would export electricity using the first
cross-border transmission line between Georgia and Turkey.3

Project sponsors also valued World Bank Group expertise or experience with policy
aspects, capacity building, and government dialogue, especially for projects in the oil
and gas and energy sectors. The range of investors includes large multinational
corporations and lenders seeking World Bank Group joint support for transnational oil
and gas projects. For the Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline, the World Bank Group initially
confined its involvement to an IFC investment and immediately after, World Bank
guarantees. However, because World Bank guarantees were not allowed for such
projects at the time, the World Bank offered an innovative solution to provide a loan
that could be used by the two countries as equity financing in the project—effectively
making the respective governments shareholders in the project along with the private
investors. In addition, World Bank Group and sponsors concerns about policy and
institutional capacity gaps in Cameroon and in Chad prompted the IFC and World
Bank (with sponsor urging) to offer capacity building and technical assistance or
advisory support. For the Nam Theun 2 project, the approved World Bank Group

                                 WORLD BANK GROUP JOINT PROJECTS: VALUE-ADDED AND CHALLENGES
package included an IDA PRG, an IDA grant, and a MIGA PRI. The IDA grant
component, which supplements other project resources, funded a portion of the
hydropower works, the social development plan, watershed and environmental
managements of the affected (including downstream) areas on the Lao PDR side. The
IDA grant also funds the required monitoring and evaluation arrangements designed to
meet sound engineering practices, fiduciary responsibilities, and the respective
oversight requirements of the participating IFIs. A vital project feature, although not
part of the project per se, pertains to the agreement between the Lao PDR government
and the World Bank on a detailed revenue management arrangement to ensure that
government revenues from the project are allocated to priority expenditure programs
for poverty reduction and environmental conservation management (the World Bank’s
involvement in the project was predicated on the Lao PDR government’s commitment
to apply project revenues to these two priorities). Capacity building and tracking of this
agreement is also funded by the IDA grant.

The World Bank Group also jointly supported several Regional initiatives outside of the
oil and gas, and power sectors. Among these projects was the World Bank Group
support for the West Africa Economic Monetary Union Capital Markets Development
project—financed by a World Bank Financial Intermediary Loan that combined
technical and institutional support from IDA (with MIGA technical assistance), an IDA
line of credit, and a proposed guarantee facility from IDA, MIGA, and the Agence
Française de Développement. Other Regional initiatives include the Lighting Africa
program and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa
Implementation, both funded by IFC Advisory Services and World Bank technical
assistance or ASA. For the Arab World Initiative Middle East and North Africa Small
and Medium Enterprise Lending Program, World Bank Group support came by way of
an IBRD Adaptable Program Loan or Financial Intermediary Loan and an IFC risk-
sharing facility to support micro, small and medium enterprises lending in Jordan,
Morocco, and Tunisia.

“SUPPLY-DRIVEN” FACTORS IN JOINT PROJECTS
Market test figured in many cofinanced joint projects, but supply-push factors also
facilitated World Bank Group joint projects. Some push factors arose logically, as when
the same public or private sector clients figure in different World Bank Group projects,
or when World Bank–funded sector and economic policy studies identify future
opportunities (for example, in PPPs), or when the same World Bank Group institutions
have financed earlier phases of the same projects. Successive investment climate,
capacity building, and DPLs followed past World Bank Group interventions. The same
institutional “supply-side” factors also applied to joint projects in the power and
financial sectors. At the level of strategy, the World Bank Group’s internal dynamic



                                                                                         25
CHAPTER 3
WORLD BANK GROUP JOINT PROJECTS: VALUE-ADDED AND CHALLENGES
leads to a push by leadership to formalize jointness among World Bank Group entities.
During the past two decades, Management of the World Bank Group institutions has
taken action to facilitate intra-World Bank Group cooperation and to increase the
number of joint projects (refer to figure 1.1). This began in 2010 in the aftermath of the
global financial crisis and continues today.4

Although some joint projects may have a supply-driven origin, demand from public or
private sector clients ultimately drives World Bank Group cofinancing of a project. In a
number of such joint projects, it was clear that the clients or investors specifically
requested the support of two or all three World Bank Group institutions. It is equally
apparent that providing prospective clients with tailored and comprehensive solution
(and retain the business) motivated World Bank Group staff who worked on joint
projects to bring the other World Bank Group institutions into the transaction.

Whether joint projects are demand or supply-driven, these projects have implications
for how the different parts of the World Bank Group synchronizes its processes,
supporting structures, and provides incentives to staff. IEG’s portfolio analysis of 20
years of approved and committed World Bank Group joint projects (table 2.1) shows
these joint projects have a very small share of overall World Bank and IFC project
portfolios. The situation is otherwise for MIGA. The number of approved and
committed joint projects varies from year to year (figure 2.1). Jointness may elude most
projects because coordination, policy, process, and resource challenges cannot be
overcome.

Challenges in World Bank Group Joint Projects
CLIENT CHALLENGES AND FEEDBACK
Joint projects entailed added transaction costs due to more coordination, overlapping
processes, and differing requirements. These often delayed project completion,
requiring extra project preparation, appraisal, and intra-World Bank Group
coordination. Clients complained about having to comply with two different sets of
World Bank and IFC environmental and social requirements. (This led to the adoption
of IFC’s performance standards for World Bank projects involving the private sector in
June 2012).5 Complying with two sets of environmental and social requirements figured
as a prominent business development difficulty, as identified in an IDA-IFC Secretariat
progress report. The World Bank Group’s separate accountability mechanisms have
dismayed clients and some stakeholders, especially those involving cofinanced PPP
projects. On one occasion, both the World Bank Inspection Panel and the IFC/MIGA
Compliance Advisor Ombudsman investigated separate complaints about the same
issue in a joint project. The absence of formalized claims cooperation agreement in
projects where MIGA is the equity insurer and IFC the senior lender, emerged as


26
                                                                                CHAPTER 3
                               WORLD BANK GROUP JOINT PROJECTS: VALUE-ADDED AND CHALLENGES
another transaction-related delay. Prior to the 2009 IFC-MIGA joint claims cooperation
agreement, various side agreements dealt with these conflict-of-interest issues on a
project-by-project basis, but the process still hampered efficiency.

Standardization of World Bank Group documents could also accelerate joint projects’
timelines and for clients, minimize expensive legal fees. These challenges emerged in
addition to differing nondisclosure requirements and other caveats negotiated among
the World Bank Group partners, especially private sector clients. Overall, intra-World
Bank Group coordination challenges delayed project implementation and completion
and, thus, the benefits from joint projects.

Inadequate explanation to the implementing agencies (about the pros and cons of the
various World Bank Group instruments) hindered client understanding about the suite
of World Bank Group products. Increased efforts to explain the nuances of different
World Bank Group instruments and financing package, especially to government
agencies involved, would go a long way in their understanding about the potential
additionality of blended World Bank Group support. At the same time, knowledge and
realism by World Bank Group staff about the country’s internal legal and parliamentary
processes and procedures can avoid long delays. This applied especially to World Bank
PBGs, the understanding of which required higher levels of financial structuring
knowledge by government counterparts. In the Bolivia-Brazil Gas Development Project,
for example, an innovative IBRD guarantee product—the “Partial Credit Guarantee
Note”—formed part of the joint project’s financing package. After six years’ delay, the
World Bank suspended the partial credit guarantee component, which was not issued.6
The experience left the project company raising questions about the counter guarantees,
endorsements, and other associated agreements required from client governments by
the World Bank. The project’s Project Performance Assessment Report also noted that
the delay and eventual cancellation of the partial credit guarantee component had
costly consequences—for the concession company and, ultimately, for gas consumers.
In most cases, government counterparts failed to understand the implications of these
requirements. The nearly two years delayed signing of World Bank Group support for a
power generation project also reflects, among other challenges, a lack of understanding
by the implementing government agency about the required counter guarantees and
other related agreements. The implementing agency complained about the inadequate
explanation by the World Bank Group on the nuances of guarantee instruments and the
lack of clarity about the complexity and lengthy process involved in PBGs.

At the same time, government actions can equally exacerbate the lengthy process. In the
same power generation project, the government’s legal opinion also called for
renegotiating broader issues of sovereign immunity, which was beyond the scope of the
legal opinion being sought by the lenders as condition precedent to the financing


                                                                                         27
CHAPTER 3
WORLD BANK GROUP JOINT PROJECTS: VALUE-ADDED AND CHALLENGES
package. This action triggered months of impasse between the lenders and the
government that delayed the signing and effectiveness of the project financing
agreements.

In some joint projects, clients have agreed to the blend of World Bank Group
instruments, even if they did not want all of the instruments offered in the financing
package. They did so because of concerns about losing the entire World Bank Group
financing package. Government representatives interviewed by IEG for the Chad-
Cameroon Oil Pipeline Project Performance Assessment Report subsequently explained
they had serious misgivings about the requirements of the two IDA capacity building
credits in the financing package. But refusing to accept these would have meant losing
the IBRD and IFC loans because of the capacity building conditionality (nonetheless, the
project’s private sponsors wanted them).

WORLD BANK GROUP STAFF PERSPECTIVE
Among World Bank Group staff, joint projects have required more staff time and
processing and therefore higher appraisal, implementation, and monitoring and
evaluation costs. Evaluations highlighted additional time and resources required for
internal coordination, appraisal and supervision of joint projects. In a complex joint
manufacturing project with IFC, MIGA’s processing fee didn’t cover the extra due
diligence, monitoring, and supervision costs, which rose as the project became
increasingly politicized. Underestimating the budget for supervision, calculated as a
coefficient of the amount of commitment, reduced the World Bank’s effectiveness in
several joint projects. The Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline, the West African Gas Pipeline
and to a lesser degree, Pamir Private Power joint projects provide examples.

Differing business models, mandates, procedures, organizational cultures, and mind-
sets within the World Bank Group have created disincentives, magnified differences of
approach, and spawned perceptions of conflicts of interest.7 Within the joint projects
reviewed here, these issues originated from three sources: (i) differing mandates and
business models; (ii) different internal processes; and (iii) different organizational
cultures and mind-sets. The pledge of shares problem8 in IFC and MIGA joint projects,
which have caused delays in several joint projects in the past, epitomized the challenge
arising from different internal processes before it was resolved in FY2010. Regarding
the challenge posed by differing mandates and business models, a perception persists
that IFC could gain unfair access to information when partnering with the World Bank
on projects with policy or regulatory reforms, particularly relating to PPPs (box 3.1).

 Box 3.1. Higher Costs in World Bank Group Joint Projects
 Pulp Mill Project: The cost of due diligence and underwriting of this complex, large project
 exceeded MIGA’s normal processing fee for such projects. The project required intensive
 environmental and social due diligence and monitoring than MIGA would otherwise
 undertake. A high degree of MIGA (and IFC) management attention was also required
 because the project had become highly controversial. A lesson from this project’s evaluation
 urged MIGA to continue and increase its support for complex projects but cautioned
 management to consider mechanisms for coping with the higher cost associated with the
 appraisal and monitoring of such complex projects and to carefully consider its cost recovery
 policy in such cases.
 Pamir Private Power: Although the IDA and IFC teams had sufficient budget and staff
 resources allocated that allowed them to adequately supervise the project jointly, the budget
 for the supervision staff costs required significantly more resources than the World Bank’s
 average supervision coefficient.9 The sufficient budget and staff resources allowed the IDA
 and IFC teams to respond promptly to two unexpected major crises that arose at
 implementation: the deteriorating financial situation of the company during 2006–08 by
 developing the Financial Restructuring Plan; and the catastrophic flooding in February 2007,
 which severely damaged the hydropower plant.
 West African Gas Pipeline: A lesson from evaluation of the World Bank PRG urged that the
 supervision of a transformational Regional project should be comprehensive and requires
 more resources regardless of the instrument used and amount of World Bank support.10
 Supervision budget was based on the relatively small amount of World Bank PRG calculated
 as a coefficient of World Bank commitment amount for this large transnational project. As a
 result, supervision of the project was not given priority during the first 18 months following
 board approval, until a request for an Inspection Panel review was filed.

Different procedures, organizational cultures, and mind-sets can entrench practices that
hinders jointness. By way of example, issuing Operational Policy/Bank Policy 4.03 in
2012 was intended to remove a burden to clients of complying with both the World
Bank Safeguards Policies and IFC Environmental and Social Performance Standards in
joint projects involving the two institutions. However, IEG’s review of World Bank-IFC
investment joint projects approved from FY2013 to FY2015 did not find a cofinanced,
Type 1 joint IFC-World Bank PPP project that applied the IFC Environmental and Social
Performance Standards, following Operational Policy/Bank Policy 4.03. Despite the
administrative directive, internal procedures (including templates in the World Bank’s
Operations Portal) have yet to be developed, and decision-making rules in joint projects
are not aligned. Unfamiliarity by World Bank staff and managers with IFC’s
performance standards also prevent its adoption.11 Likewise, decision-making processes
of each participating World Bank Group institutions in a joint project remain separate.
Similarly, integrity due diligence processes are often conducted separately and not


                                                                                                  29
CHAPTER 3
WORLD BANK GROUP JOINT PROJECTS: VALUE-ADDED AND CHALLENGES
aligned across the three World Bank Group institutions although due diligence
information are shared eventually in some cases.

Post approval project and portfolio tracking metrics have yet to be adjusted to integrate
and recognize the complexity of developing, structuring or underwriting, and
supervising World Bank Group joint projects. Feedback from World Bank Group joint
project practitioners have pointed to the misalignment between the World Bank Group
leadership signals for greater World Bank Group jointness with prevailing portfolio
performance metrics, which are designed for single institution projects. Such metrics
have dampened staff initiative and creativity for working in World Bank Group joint
projects, which tend to be complex, time-consuming, and entail high coordination cost.

Information sharing remains a big hurdle. Knowledge exchange falls short among some
joint project teams, partly because of different ranking of rights in a project. Different
definitions of the ‘client’ create diverging views about contractual obligations and
positions, including the levels of access to information on the same project. For the
World Bank, its client is the government or the country. For the most part, IFC and
MIGA clients are private sector companies. But even with the same private sector client,
access to project information depends on whether IFC, and especially MIGA, supported
an equity holder (which also depends whether it is a majority or minority shareholder)
or a lender. As an insurer, MIGA’s access to company information, especially financial
information, is limited irrespective of its guarantee to an equity holder or a
shareholder—unless a claim situation arises. Numerous past examples abound where
client confidentiality is invoked by IFC when it comes to sharing information on the
same project that MIGA insured. Ironically, the nonsharing of project information
documents has become a recommended solution (as in the Bank Group’s conflict of
interest guidelines) in the management of conflicts of interest and also to comply with
private client confidentiality needs. Although there are valid reasons for not sharing
project information,12 greater project information and knowledge sharing can improve
project development outcomes. Whatever the legal imperatives, failure to share project
information has prevented closer intra-World Bank Group engagement and knowledge
exchange. It has limited the World Bank Group’s value-addition to its clients. Thus,
assuaging client confidentiality concerns has prevented collaboration after project
approval, and hinders overall joint project effectiveness.

World Bank procurement rules seen as complicated and rigid affect the IFC Advisory
Services’ ability to implement their segment of joint projects with the World Bank. Rigid
procurement rules delayed implementation of the IFC component in several joint
projects. Experience of this nature had become common among joint IFC Advisory-
World Bank ASA projects in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Mali, and South
Sudan—all FCS countries.

                              WORLD BANK GROUP JOINT PROJECTS: VALUE-ADDED AND CHALLENGES

Challenges for Monitoring and Evaluation
World Bank and IFC portfolios do not consistently or even accurately record joint
World Bank Group projects. Nor are MIGA’s joint projects within the World Bank
Group identified systematically in MIGA’s guarantees database or in World Bank and
IFC project databases. The IFC and World Bank have procedures for identifying their
mutual joint projects—a legacy of the former IDA-IFC Secretariat. But their joint
projects with MIGA go unreported and not tagged. Beyond that, the tagging of projects
as joint appears arbitrary. Some projects fall into “cooperation,” “collaboration,” or
“joint” categories—simply because of a phone call, a meeting, or query. Assessing
World Bank Group effectiveness as a “Solutions World Bank Group” needs the
systematic identification of Type 1 joint projects.

Evaluative evidence and lessons about how to work as One World Bank Group are
scarce. Evaluation methodology remains focused on each World Bank Group
institution; a One World Bank Group perspective remains elusive. The three World
Bank Group institutions have differing business models and operational timelines, and
evaluation or sampling methodologies. On environment and social aspects,
harmonizing the different evaluation methodologies between the three institutions
remain. The World Bank’s Implementation Completion and Results Reports (ICRs) and
Implementation Completion and Results Report Reviews (ICRRs) treat and rate
environmental and social aspects differently compared with IFC’s Expanded Project
Supervision Reports and MIGA’s Project Evaluation Reports. And although IFC and
MIGA have similar performance standards, environmental and social monitoring
timelines and bases differ. Notwithstanding the successive initiatives to encourage
jointness, these separate evaluation methodologies have not been harmonized to assess
the development effectiveness of World Bank Group joint projects from a One World
Bank Group perspective. A One World Bank Group perspective informed the
evaluation of the joint Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline project, but recent evaluations of
intra-World Bank Group joint projects reflect only a single institution’s perspective.

Conflicting ratings and narratives about joint project performance have occurred
because of different evaluation methodologies used (in World Bank Group self-
evaluations as well as in IEG validations). Assessment of project outcomes often
overlooked contributions from another World Bank Group institution. Many evaluation
documents sometimes failed to mention support from another World Bank Group
member. Different ratings for the same indicator appeared in the evaluation of projects
with IFC investment and MIGA guarantees although these employ a similar bench-
marked based methodology for determining project development outcomes. For
example, the environmental and social ratings in the Expanded Project Supervision
Report Evaluation Note and the IEG Project Evaluation Report of a joint IFC-MIGA


                                                                                      31
CHAPTER 3
WORLD BANK GROUP JOINT PROJECTS: VALUE-ADDED AND CHALLENGES
support to an agriculture project lacked consistency although the evaluations happened
within two months of each other. It is likely that the ratings and outcome narratives
would change if a joint project is evaluated from a One World Bank Group perspective.

Outcomes and lessons regarding joint projects supported by World Bank guarantees
and ASAs are not known. Seventeen of the 112 World Bank Group joint projects (15
percent) blended IDA or IBRD PRG with IFC and/or MIGA support. Five PRG projects
have closed status with ICRs, but only one of the self-evaluated PRG-supported project
was reviewed by IEG.13 Another 11 of the World Bank Group joint projects (10 percent)
had World Bank ASA support. Currently, projects supported by these two World Bank
instruments, including in World Bank Group joint projects, are excluded from IEG’s
existing project evaluation framework. Little is known about their effectiveness, results,
value-added, and lessons learned that can inform future projects supported by these
two instruments.

the respective governments providing financing of their own equity shareholding in the project.

7 Different perceptions can cause friction or disagreement among the joint project team
members or the institutions involved but may not necessarily qualify as conflict of interest in its
strict legal definition. The World Bank Group created in January 2012, a conflicts management
function with a conflicts of interest office in each of the IFC, MIGA, and World Bank to facilitate
the identification and management of inter-institutional conflicts of interest. Since their 2012
inception, the conflicts of interest offices have assisted management and staff in over 100 cases;
in all but one case, conflicts of interest issues were successfully managed, paving the way for
each institution to pursue its projects. Nevertheless, feedback from joint project teams identified
such inter-institutional disagreements and differing mindsets as barriers to increased World
Bank Group “jointness.”
8 A situation that emerges when IFC (or other IFIs) is a senior secured lender and MIGA is the

equity insurer in projects where both are involved. This situation is known as the pledge of
shares and arbitral award issue or subrogation—an accepted term in insurance law that
provides the assignment of shares of the equity investor insured to the insurer (MIGA, in this
case). In the event of a claim, the equity insurer (MIGA) acquires the same rights to the project
assets as the senior lenders. Therefore, if there is a claim event (or a guarantee is called) in a
project where IFC is a lender and MIGA is the equity insurer, IFC’s senior lender status is
diminished as MIGA, acting as subrogee of the equity holder, can recover the assets (in the
event of an arbitral award) before the lenders—which effectively dilutes IFC’s ability to recover
its loan.

information is kept confidential. Another example is a situation where MIGA has already
insured the guarantee holder or foreign project sponsor and IFC is still negotiating a claims
cooperation agreement with its client in a joint project. In this stage of joint project negotiations,
IFC and MIGA can have opposing business interests.

4. World Bank Group Jointness and Project
Outcomes
This chapter offers an IEG review of the intensity of interaction within World Bank
Group joint project teams, using project examples. The purpose was to understand the
extent of World Bank Group staff interaction in joint projects—from project origination
to monitoring and evaluation—and explore the hypothesis in the theory of change that
collaboration by the constituent parts of the World Bank Group resulted in better
outcomes and more value-added to clients. The remainder of the chapter reveals some
outcomes from evaluated joint intra-World Bank Group projects.

Intensity of Interactions in Joint World Bank Group Projects
The intensity of World Bank Group interactions varied in joint projects. IEG has defined
“intensity of interaction” as the extent of mutual engagement within World Bank Group
joint project teams during the entire project cycle, from upstream to downstream project
phase. The intensity of interactions follows a continuum, from high to low intensity, in
both upstream and downstream phases of the project cycle.

High-intensity interactions in joint projects during the upstream phase comprise joint
due diligence taking the form of joint scoping or appraisal missions. High-intensity
interaction also emerges in collaborating to prepare and submit joint project appraisal
documents for board approval, and in preparing project concept documents for World
Bank ASA and IFC Advisory Services joint projects. IEG has examples of World Bank
and IFC undertaking in joint project design. In the downstream project phase, intensity
of interaction appears in various joint implementation arrangements, including cross-
support, direct funding, joint monitoring and supervisory visits and reporting, and in
regular exchange of project information (see appendix A for the intensity of joint project
team interactions in the 35 evaluated joint projects). The difference between high and
low-intensity interaction lies in the continuity of engagement maintained in the
downstream phase. At the extreme end of the continuum lie various joint projects—for
which the only indication of jointness seems to be a sentence or notation in project
approval documents, usually stating that another World Bank Group institution will
provide some financing to the project.

High-intensity interactions in joint projects can arise from the project design itself and
occur typically at the early stages of the project cycle. Joint projects with a mix of World
Bank investment project financing, development policy operation, or ASA support or
IFC advisory, and aimed at public sector entity clients, usually have high-intensity

                                              WORLD BANK GROUP JOINTNESS AND PROJECT OUTCOMES
interactions. This results from IFC advisory involvement in implementing a World Bank
project component. Cross-support, budget resources sharing, joint team meetings,
project documents sharing, joint supervision, and reporting tend to be the norm in joint
projects with this combination of World Bank Group instruments. The IFC advisory
team implements a component of the World Bank lending program. It receives World
Bank funding for this implementation. In a few cases, IFC contributed financing from its
own funds for its advisory support. Scoping missions by joint project teams with World
Bank non ASA and IFC advisory support happen often. A high intensity of joint project
team interactions throughout the entire project cycle characterized the Afghanistan
Financial Sector Strengthening, Cambodia Trade Facilitation-Cambodian Investment
Board Capacity Building, Côte d’Ivoire small and medium enterprise investment
climate, Mali Growth Support, South Sudan investment climate, and the Ukraine DPL 2
and 3-Enabling Environment joint projects. Interactions started with joint scoping
missions or, in the case of the Cambodia Trade Facilitation-CIB Capacity Building
project, the IDA and IFC advisory teams formulated project design together (box 4.1).


 Box 4.1. Intense Interaction by Design in Projects with World Bank ASA and IFC Advisory Support
 Lighting Africa Kenya: The partnership rested on a clear division of labor that focused on the
 respective strengths of IFC and World Bank teams to implement an innovative experiment
 intended to develop the market for solar lamps for consumers without access to electricity.
 The World Bank focused on the policy and reform agenda while IFC tackled the development
 of a commercially sustainable market for the solar lamps by building capacity for market
 players and absorbing the initial risks of market development. IEG’s evaluation noted that
 the “overall program became truly World Bank Group collaboration with strong efforts to
 divide activities based on each institution’s core competencies in the design and having
 regular communication between the teams involved.”
 South Sudan Private Sector Development—Removing Barriers to Investments:1 The project is a
 prime example of a high-risk, high-return World Bank Group operation, with the risk-reward
 trade-offs highly appropriate to the country context. The World Bank Group intervention was
 part of a rapid response to address the investment needs of a new country formed from
 decades of conflict. Central to the realization of sustainable peace and development in South
 Sudan was promoting private sector development, which required substantial policy and
 program efforts especially in trade and investments.

Joint lending-investment projects have followed a different mode of intra-World Bank
Group interactions. Much depends on the projects’ risk intensity. For certain types of
project, more intense interactions occurred in response to need. Large-sized Category A
and transnational investment projects showed a higher intensity of interaction among
World Bank Group project teams focused on due diligence and supervision. As
warranted in complicated, controversial projects, the interactions among the

CHAPTER 4
WORLD BANK GROUP JOINTNESS AND PROJECT OUTCOMES
collaborating World Bank Group partners became closer. Joint supervision visits
became more common. Information exchange and team communication arose more
frequently, from project appraisal to supervision.

In complex joint projects, accountability mechanisms and reputational risks concerns
also motivated intense interactions among project teams. Coordination became more
frequent. So did exchange of project-related updates between project team leaders and
among other financiers. The World Bank Group’s reputation plays a role in these high
profile projects, which in several instances generated complaints investigated by the
IFC-MIGA Compliance Advisor Ombudsman and/or the World Bank Inspection Panel.
The Bujagali Electric Limited project, supported by three World Bank Group
institutions, spawned eight Inspection Panel complaints in addition to seven other
complaints filed with the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman. In another complex
manufacturing project, complaints reached the International Court of Justice, the Inter-
American Commission for Human Rights, and the IFC-MIGA Compliance Advisor
Ombudsman. Boards for the respective World Bank Group institutions also required
regular updates about high profile joint projects (box 4.2).

     Box 4.2. Long-Standing Commitment to the Bujagali Project Overcame Intense Opposition
     Bujagali Electricity Limited: Without the World Bank Group’s unwavering support and
     intense involvement in this project, it would have been difficult to get this hydropower
     project contributing to stabilize power supply and increase electricity access rates in
     Uganda. The intense coordination within the World Bank Group—from the project team to
     Management of the World Bank Group institutions as well as board members—was
     unprecedented. A multitude of problems and the intense scrutiny by the affected
     population, local and foreign nongovernmental organizations, the government of Uganda,
     and other IFIs added enormous pressure on the World Bank Group partners to collaborate
     closely, communicate, and exchange information on a regular basis.
     At the staff level, teams from IDA, IFC, and MIGA conducted joint appraisal missions,
     prepared a joint project appraisal document, and undertook joint supervision missions on a
     regular basis, especially IDA and IFC, with MIGA participating during the early stage of
     construction. Senior management and board members of these institutions coordinated
     closely, including joint supervision missions during the construction phase, to ensure
     problems were resolved and stakeholder concerns were addressed without additional
     adverse reputational risk to the World Bank Group. While the World Bank Group’s role in
     the project remains controversial, the electricity supplied by the hydropower plant had
     temporarily eased an electricity shortage in Uganda and allowed Umeme Limited (the
     electricity distributor) to accelerate connections and ensure reliable electricity flow.
     Source: Project documents.

In other joint investment projects, the intensity of interactions required reflected
exogenous factors including natural disasters. The intense interactions between the IDA

                                                                                    CHAPTER 4
                                             WORLD BANK GROUP JOINTNESS AND PROJECT OUTCOMES
and MIGA team leaders in the Umeme Limited project came as a consequence of a
prolonged drought occurring a year after the IDA and MIGA guarantees became
effective (box 4.3). In the Pamir Private Power project, IDA and IFC teams worked
jointly “under extreme conditions (including 18-hour trips on bad roads, 16-hour
workdays, subfreezing temperatures at 10,000 feet altitude and no space heating, one
meal a day, and other privations) in March 2007.”2 They brought much of Pamir’s
capacity back on line following a catastrophic accident caused by severe floods.

At the other end of the continuum, low-intensity interactions seem the norm among
many joint investment-type projects. In these cases, one of the World Bank Group
institutions enters the transaction late in the internal approval process. Typically, some
coordination, communication between teams, or document sharing occurs during
appraisal. But the interaction stops there, not continuing once the respective Board of
Directors approves the project. In some cases, IEG found no mention or
acknowledgment about a partner institution in project documentation, either in
appraisal, supervision, or completion and self-evaluation documents.


 Box 4.3. Close Intra-World Bank Group Interaction Can Overcome Crisis Events
 Umeme Limited: When sector conditions drastically changed due to a prolonged drought a
 year after the effectiveness of the IDA and MIGA guarantees, joint efforts by IDA and MIGA
 teams helped the investors and the government renegotiate new concession terms, ensuring a
 more equitable distribution of risks. The IDA and MIGA team leaders also helped develop an
 emergency plan that would ensure continued electricity supply to Umeme to prevent outages
 and start fixing Uganda’s electricity distribution system. IFC investment came three years
 later when the company needed financing to accelerate the electricity connections and
 prepare for its initial public offering through cross-listing in the Kampala and Nairobi Stock
 Exchanges. Additional IFC investment came in 2013 and in 2014 to finance the capital cost of
 lowering electricity losses. Today, Umeme Limited continues to be one of the few financially
 viable power distribution company in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Sometimes the low-intensity of interactions seems appropriate—as in lowered
transaction costs, for example. But detached mutual engagement has had negative
consequences. Low-intensity intra-World Bank Group engagement occurred in a project
financing and providing guarantee coverage for a PPP toll road project. For this project,
IFC and MIGA staff conducted parallel due diligence and appraisals. They prepared
separate board documents but arranged for a joint meeting of their respective boards to
win approval and concurrence. Thereafter, coordination effectively ceased following
board approval. No coordination occurred despite a whistleblower’s notice of violation
of World Bank Group policy on Involuntary Settlement. Two separate appraisals failed
to trigger the Involuntary Resettlement safeguard policy, both relying on sponsor


                                                                                              37
CHAPTER 4
WORLD BANK GROUP JOINTNESS AND PROJECT OUTCOMES
representation. IFC eventually provided a supplemental loan to rectify resettlement
shortcomings but some negative effects remained. A portion of involuntarily resettled
families remained negatively affected at the time of IEG’s evaluation. In other projects,
however, low-intensity intra-World Bank Group interaction (regarding client value-
added or achieving greater project effectiveness) made no apparent difference at all.

Among the three World Bank Group institutions, MIGA’s small size and business
model limit its capacity for greater engagement after board approval. While modest
post-board approval involvement is mostly adequate, several instances reveal how an
active tracking of project issues could have been helpful both to the client and to
compliance with environmental and social requirements. In an agribusiness project
supported by IFC and MIGA, project effectiveness could have risen if MIGA had held
its guarantee holder (that is, the same IFC client) to similar contractual obligations
pertaining to environmental and resettlement requirements. A lesson from an
evaluation of the cross-border gas pipeline project urged MIGA to take a more
proactive approach to portfolio management of large, complex projects, especially in
key countries. The point is, earlier detection of project implementation problems.

Overall, a more proactive role by MIGA in World Bank Group joint projects will
generate benefits, both in client value-added and even in future business development.
MIGA has shown it can contribute to project supervision under certain situations. In the
West African Gas Pipeline joint project with IDA, for example, MIGA mobilized
funding to help support the implementation of a comprehensive Management Action
Plan. This came in response to an Inspection Panel’s recommendations. Clarity over
MIGA’s monitoring and supervision role is also needed in joint projects where the
World Bank or IFC support has closed or been completed while MIGA’s guarantee
coverage remains active.

The lack of intra-World Bank Group interaction shows most obviously in the evaluation
phase. The One World Bank Group perspective is absent, even among projects having
joint project appraisal documents presented to the board and/or joint board meetings.
Among 35 evaluated joint projects, only the Pamir Private Power Project’s World Bank
and IFC teams produced a joint ICR. However, IEG validated the IDA support only
because the IFC investment was still active, which also highlights IEG’s treatment of
joint projects. Of the 35 evaluated joint projects reviewed by IEG, only the Chad-
Cameroon Oil Pipeline operation had a comprehensive and combined review of the
World Bank Group-wide involvement. For all other (that is, 34) cofinanced joint World
Bank Group projects, single World Bank Group entity project teams conducted their
own evaluations. At present, no other holistic, integrated or harmonized One World
Bank Group evaluation framework/methodology exists to weigh a joint project ’s

effectiveness, efficiency, outcomes, and value-addition to public and private sector
clients.

Development Results of World Bank Group Joint Projects
No observed pattern of association exists between (i) the intensity of interaction in joint
World Bank Group projects, and (ii) their development outcomes. Even allowing (i) for
the 35 sample of evaluated cofinanced joint projects, and (ii) for the complexity of
determining a causal relationship between any given factor and development outcomes,
IEG’s tracking is inconclusive. Contradictory examples abound (see figure 4.1). There
are:

      High-intensity intra-World Bank Group engagement and satisfactory and better
       development outcomes;
      High-intensity intra-World Bank Group engagement but less satisfactory
       development outcomes;
      Low-intensity intra-World Bank Group engagement but satisfactory and better
       development outcomes; and,
      Low-intensity intra-World Bank Group engagement and less satisfactory
       development outcomes.

All factors influencing success or otherwise in projects supported by only one World
Bank Group institution appear in joint projects. If two or more institutions work
together, this may enhance development effectiveness. Or it may not. The higher
cofinancing joint project risk profile can just as easily introduce an additional layer of
complexity; which greater interinstitutional engagement can ameliorate—or not.

Successful development outcomes in all World Bank Group projects reflect a range of
factors, which include pervasive exogenous factors (for example, the regional and
global economic environment) and external factors like natural disasters or political
upheaval. There are also work quality factors over which the World Bank Group has
direct control, such as prior analytical work, partnerships with committed and capable
stakeholders, project design, ambitious objectives, inadequate resources for supervision,
and frequent changes in project team leaders.3 All affect joint project outcomes.

So-called jointness cannot substitute for solid work quality, a committed sponsor,
sufficient resources, or a myriad of other factors enabling positive development
outcomes. Nor is jointness an end in itself. The nature and intensity of joint
relationships differ from one joint project to another. In some instances, the project
requires a high degree of joint engagement. The following, ultimately successful
projects, provide useful examples:



                                                                                             39
CHAPTER 4
WORLD BANK GROUP JOINTNESS AND PROJECT OUTCOMES
        In the IFC-MIGA engagement in support of a complex manufacturing project,
         the institutions worked closely with a private sector client. This managed
         reputational risk by carrying out an intensive, joint due diligence in
         environmental and social risk, and also, by engaging in deep consultation with
         stakeholders, and promoting information and communications campaigns.
        In the IFC-World Bank support experience with Pamir Private Power, the
         institutions adopted a broadly holistic approach. This involved, among other
         things, several joint preparatory reviews and studies and cooperative work on
         due diligence matters, including extensive local consultations. Both mounted
         joint supervision missions. World Bank and IFC teams worked tirelessly to keep
         the power plant operating after heavy damage inflicted by flooding and then to
         restructure the project in the face of financial losses.

In other instances, for example, strong IFC Advisory Services-World Bank collaborative
support for Bangladesh Private Sector Development, or for Cambodia Trade
Facilitation, robust interinstitutional interaction failed to compensate for other negative
factors. IEG found similar challenges, even in projects where IFC Advisory Services
received funding from the World Bank to implement a component of a specific
investment loan or a DPL, and had joint scoping and supervision missions. Specific
examples are the IDA grant and IFC advisory work to improve South Sudan’s
investment climate and another IDA grant and IFC advisory combined support to
strengthen Afghanistan’s financial sector. To complete the picture, some joint projects
proved successful despite low-intensity levels of intra-World Bank Group coordination
(figure 4.1). For example, World Bank and MIGA supported Bolivia-Brazil Trans Gas
Pipeline, a complex project with many partners and tight schedules. MIGA insurance
enabled an added layer of risk mitigation, a significant project contribution, but this
required very little intra-World Bank Group interaction.

    Note: Joint projects in the high development outcome quadrants were rated as moderately satisfactory to highly satisfactory
    for World Bank projects; moderately successful to highly successful for IFC investment projects; and satisfactory to excellent
    for MIGA. The figure excludes one evaluated project that was rated “no opinion possible” for development outcome .

The variable success of joint World Bank Group projects, regardless of the intensity of
interaction, suggests that jointness per se does not act as a dominant driver of successful
outcomes. This is not to suggest that jointness is unimportant. Further analysis must
occur using more and other types of joint projects. Still, in this exploration of cofinanced
(Type 1) joint projects, IEG identified good collaborative practices—regardless of being
unable to determine links between intensity of World Bank Group interaction and
successful project outcomes. Reviewing such practices led IEG to conclude the benefit
from World Bank Group joint projects ultimately rests on the value-added provided to
clients rather than in any inherently beneficial nature of joint projects, per se.

5. What Lessons for Future Joint Projects?
This chapter summarizes IEG’s learning from this stocktaking of intra-World Bank
Group engagement in World Bank Group joint projects. This chapter organizes some
interim lessons according to the analytical framework adopted for this learning note
(presented in appendix B)—namely, context and enabling environment, purpose,
process and structure, resources, and team dynamics. These lessons came from the desk
review of the 35 evaluated projects and from IEG’s engagement with World Bank
Group staff who have worked on joint projects. The final section below describes some
implications for the “One World Bank Group” aspiration.

Lessons Related to Context and Enabling Environment
Joint projects have strong utility in specific contexts with high relevance. Cofinanced
joint projects facilitated investments or initiatives in high-risk countries. They have
helped establish pioneering projects, and supported complex transnational investments.
They have enhanced Category A projects in infrastructure and extractive industries,
and have supported first-time foreign direct investors. In the financial sector
specifically, Type 1 joint projects funded risk sharing and on-lending facilities, while
targeting micro, small, and medium enterprises and financing of affordable housing for
low-income households. Joint projects also helped improve the business climate in
several FCS countries.

Staff’s previous experience and track record in joint projects have motivated
replication. In general, collaboration has led to more collaboration. Previous experience
in joint projects has provided two advantages: (i) the ability to navigate internal World
Bank Group processes and external coordination requirements, and (ii) skills and
confidence to be involved in other World Bank Group joint projects. The learning
dividend from repeat experience partly explains the preponderance of World Bank
Group joint projects in the power sector and support for repeat clients. Successful
investments in the power sector had solid demonstration effects generating repeat
transactions. Likewise, joint projects involving investment climate, institutional reforms
or strengthening built on earlier bodies of work. IEG also observed that among the
different team leaders of the 112 World Bank Group joint projects, more than 30 had
been involved in joint projects more than once. IEG noted that several joint project team
leaders have also worked in another World Bank Group institution. Staff cross-over
from one World Bank Group institution to another may have encouraged collaborative
work because of familiarity with colleagues, products, and processes of other World
Bank Group institutions.

                                                    WHAT LESSONS FOR FUTURE JOINT PROJECTS?

Joint projects need support both from external stakeholders and from the internal
World Bank Group entities. Although client commitment is essential, strong signals
and support from World Bank Group senior management act as a positive motivator for
joint projects. Strong support by Management of the World Bank Group institutions
buttressed jointness in the Bujagali Electricity Limited endeavor, in the controversial
Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline, and in the Orion-Botnia, and the West African Gas
Pipeline projects. Strong internal support for joint projects also withstood intense
external opposition from some civil society organizations, as in the case of Bujagali
Electricity Limited, as well as criticism from other governments, as in the pulp mill joint
project. However, support for jointness by Management of the World Bank Group
institutions can wane over time—as in the Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline Project.


Lesson Related to Purpose

A clear business case as rationale for jointness plus a shared vision of objectives and
final outcomes are essential to sustaining jointness. The clearer the reasons for
jointness, especially the business case, to the project team and clients, the higher the
likely intensity of interaction. Having a shared vision of the business rationale and
intended project results (beyond the pro forma project results framework and project-
level indicators) helped joint project teams solve problems and overcome challenges,
especially in complex joint projects. In projects with a high intensity of joint team
interaction, team members more readily grasped the business rationale for cofinancing
with another World Bank Group institution, the contribution from each World Bank
Group institution, and for what ultimate purpose. IEG also noted how joint teams
having high-intensity interaction developed clearer ideas about the joint project’s end-
goals—and the World Bank Group’s contribution in achieving them.

Good understanding by the joint project team members of each World Bank Group
institutions’ mandates, products, strengths, and limitations eased more and better
collaboration. World Bank Group staff wishing to become involved in joint World Bank
Group projects need this deep institutional knowledge. Comprehending the World
Bank Group’s different institutional mandates, their products, their strengths and their
constraints, forms the indispensable foundation for understanding the World Bank
Group’s complementarity and comparative advantage.


Lessons Related to Resources

Joint projects required sufficient budgets for the additional administrative,
preparation and (especially) the implementation, supervision, coordination costs of
having more “jointness.” Regardless of the extent of World Bank Group intervention,


                                                                                        43
CHAPTER 5
WHAT LESSONS FOR FUTURE JOINT PROJECTS?
joint projects required adequate, assured financial resources. Without these, appraising,
implementing, and supervising or monitoring these projects become a daunting task—
not to mention allocating funds for the intensive documentation of project experience,
including client feedback and beneficiary impact assessment at evaluation. World Bank
Group cofinanced joint projects have a higher risk profile, needing more internal
coordination; accordingly, the resource needs tend to be higher than in single World
Bank Group institution projects.

Joint projects required sufficient time to achieve project objectives, build trust, and
World Bank Group team synergy. Developing trust takes time. In turn, sufficient time
implies the need for repeated interactions that build knowledge, commitment, and
personal relations necessary for the joint teams to be responsive and effective.

Having the right combination of staff skills enabled the solving of multilayered joint
project risks. Lacking the right skill mix for joint projects have had detrimental
consequences that ultimately affected project beneficiaries.


Lessons Related to Process and Structure
Clear roles, division of labor, and responsibilities throughout project life enabled
teams to accomplish tasks, reduce transaction costs, and increase effectiveness. Joint
project teams with higher intensity interactions understood their own and their World
Bank Group partners’ competencies, responsibilities, and roles in the joint project.
Clearly defined roles in particular, and a clear division of labor, helped maximize
development benefits, reduce transaction cost, and enhance the World Bank Group’s
contribution.

Ownership of both process and outcomes of the joint project by the respective
project teams and the respective Management of the World Bank Group institutions
helped maximize value-added and effectiveness. Members of the respective World
Bank Group institutions have a stake and stood accountable for decisions and
outcomes. In joint projects with high-intensity interactions, a strong team commitment
emerged, subordinating parochial institutional considerations.

Adaptability and flexibility during implementation figured as key factors in joint
projects, especially those sited in conflict-affected countries or places with low
institutional and human capacity. In an IFC Advisory Services and World Bank ASA
joint project in South Sudan, the project team showed adaptability and flexibility by
shifting resources from activities with less local ownership or readiness, to activities
showing more success. In other joint projects where IFC advisory implemented a World

                                                     WHAT LESSONS FOR FUTURE JOINT PROJECTS?
Bank project component, the rigidity of World Bank procurement rules often attracted
criticism as a principal factor leading to less successful project outcomes.

Continuity of task team leaders is vital. This built trust, strong personal links and
commitment to joint project success. Although frequent staff rotation has advantages,
avoidable changes in joint project leadership affected both cohesion and responsiveness
among the team members, especially as each World Bank Group institution has its own
team within a joint project. Lack of continuity also weakened relationships with
stakeholders and reduced knowledge exchange. Frequent changes in team leaders also
affected project effectiveness.


Lessons Related to Leadership, Joint Team Formation, and Dynamics
Skilled leadership plus the “right” personality mattered a lot in joint projects. While
top-down policies had a major role in facilitating joint projects, an inclusive, open-
minded personality1 and leadership skills also became critical factors. Team leaders
having solid knowledge of subject areas, as well as of process and collaborative skills,
showed themselves better equipped to handle the additional coordination needed in
joint projects. While these traits are not unique to joint projects, a collaborative
personality have engendered joint team harmony, enabled a united World Bank Group
stance in often demanding project environments, and avoided confusing clients.

And while subject area knowledge remained indispensable, personality had a
dimension of its own for joint team formation, interactions, and effectiveness.
Personality traits—such as keeping an open mind, keeping other members informed, or
being adaptive and flexible—formed key attributes enabling joint World Bank Group
teams to stay focused on the project (and not on personality conflicts). There are also
natural collaborators and the internal entrepreneurs (also known as intrapreneurs),2
who tend to push the envelope within existing parameters. World Bank Group staff
who worked on joint projects, especially those who worked on joint projects before the
current improved enabling environment, may share some of these entrepreneurial
traits.


Implications for Management of the World Bank Group Institutions
ON EXPECTATIONS ABOUT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF WORLD BANK GROUP JOINT PROJECTS
Despite Management’s continuing efforts to stimulate World Bank Group joint projects,
joint projects still represented a very small share of the World Bank Group project
portfolio. IEG’s review of World Bank Group cofinanced projects shows strong joint
project relevance to high risk and specific contexts but also find that joint projects add


                                                                                         45
CHAPTER 5
WHAT LESSONS FOR FUTURE JOINT PROJECTS?
cost and risk, including reputational risk. Moreover, cofinanced joint projects must have
clients willing to procure these blended World Bank Group products and services.
Given these needs and limitations, Type 1 joint projects will continue to occupy a niche
segment within the World Bank Group’s array of products and services, albeit an
important one on occasion. Knowing and understanding the “sweet spot” for joint
projects require realism about expectations and opportunities for increasing the
number of World Bank Group joint projects in the future.

ON DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS OF JOINT PROJECTS
As explained in the previous chapter, in and of itself jointness could not ensure
successful project outcomes. But joint projects on occasion became powerful tools,
effective when conditions require a creative integration or blending of World Bank
Group institutional approach. World Bank Group joint support offers no substitute for
solid work quality or sufficient resources; having a committed sponsor also matters to
joint success and positive development outcomes.

ON ENSURING SUFFICIENT RESOURCES
Joint projects require additional resources and time regardless of World Bank Group
commitment amounts because of the intense coordination required internally and with
external stakeholders. This implies:

        greater realism from Management of the World Bank Group institutions
         regarding time, ensuring stability and adequacy of financial and staff resources
         required in joint projects, regardless of the amount of World Bank Group
         commitment;
        ex-ante discussion among the participating World Bank Group institutions
         regarding the expected intensity of collaboration;
        for IFC and MIGA, realistic assessment of its cost recovery considering the
         additional appraisal cost and extra monitoring, especially of complicated or
         controversial projects;
        revisiting project supervision budget formulas and upfront client processing cost
         and fees, and exploring internal cost-sharing and cost recovery methods to cope
         with additional tasks;
        allocating funding for the intensive documentation of project experience,
         including getting client feedback and beneficiary assessment; and
        ensuring that joint projects team leaders have both the hard and soft skills to
         manage the additional coordination role required.

                                                    WHAT LESSONS FOR FUTURE JOINT PROJECTS?
ON PROCESS AND STRUCTURES
Joint projects require clear and sensible systems for managing, facilitating decision-
making, and operationalizing joint projects. Weak processes and structures affected
project success, increased transaction costs, and hindered World Bank Group
effectiveness in joint projects. It helps to have:

      Clarity. Whether formal or via other agreements, clarity about respective roles
       and responsibilities as well as expected intensity of collaboration, for each World
       Bank Group institution in joint projects must abide during the entire project
       cycle.
      Management guidance. Needed for resolving information exchange and
       knowledge-sharing issues within the same joint project team;
      Flexibility. Needed for procurement, disbursements, and for allocating resources
       mid-stream. Rigid rules prevent creative solutions and outcome achievement.
      Alignment of supporting structures. Needed for minimizing transaction and
       coordination costs, and increasing World Bank Group competitiveness. Separate
       budgets, procurement, and IT systems stymie efficiency and effectiveness.

ON STAFF INCENTIVES
Recognition, promotion, and other tangible staff incentives can go a long way in
sending the right signal to World Bank Group staff. Current staff incentives, including
promotions, hardly recognize and reward World Bank Group staff for working
collaboratively on joint projects. As indicated in the previous chapters, cofinanced
projects are innovative but risky and resource-intensive. Different human resources
systems, especially the IFC and the World Bank, also create disincentives for working
on joint projects. Within the World Bank, applying its standard project performance and
portfolio tracking metrics to joint projects (especially blended finance with PBGs) send
contrasting and discouraging signal to staff who want to work on such projects.

More important, the meaning of “joint projects” has not been well defined and has
been interpreted differently by staff. Sometimes staff sought a kind of verbal jointness
without any substantive and real collaboration. Greater clarity is needed about what is
meant by World Bank Group jointness and expectations for World Bank Group joint
projects or programs need clarification. A common, shared understanding of what
jointness means can help inform expectations and staff incentives for substantive
collaborative work. As mentioned in chapter 1, identifying joint projects from existing
IFC and World Bank project portfolio databases was challenging because of the
different interpretation of what are truly joint projects.

CHAPTER 5
WHAT LESSONS FOR FUTURE JOINT PROJECTS?

On Evaluating and Generating Knowledge about Joint World Bank Group Projects

Generating knowledge about joint World Bank Group projects begins with the
systematic and consistent tagging and tracking of joint projects in the three World
Bank Group institutions’ systems.

Harmonizing and testing of a single evaluation framework or methodology for
World Bank Group joint projects would enable deeper understanding of their
effectiveness and outcomes. Evaluative evidence, and lessons about how to work as a
“One World Bank Group,” remain scarce. Due to different business models, project
timelines, and evaluation/sampling methodologies, evaluation remains focused on
each World Bank Group institution. Knowledge about the effectiveness, efficiency,
relevance, outcomes and results of Type 1 joint projects, especially as seen from a One
World Bank Group perspective, needs dissemination and prioritization. Inventive
approaches, mechanisms, and methodologies to effect this reorientation need to be
devised, explored, and tested: It’s the best way to jumpstart World Bank Group
awareness of, and effectiveness as, a “Solutions World Bank Group.”

Value-proposition to clients of World Bank Group joint projects is not fully known.
Information relating to clients’ motivation for seeking World Bank Group joint support
could not be confirmed. Project documents usually highlight each World Bank Group
institution’s contribution to the project and occasionally as One World Bank Group,
albeit from the perspective of World Bank Group staff. Documenting client ex ante and
ex post feedback on the value-added of (including reasons for seeking) World Bank
Group joint support in projects would go a long way in understanding the true market
test and value of World Bank Group jointness.
