1. Introduction


In many developing countries, a significant barrier to economic growth is an unreliable
supply of electricity. Electricity shortages in South Asia are especially widespread, with
the average firm experiencing nearly an outage per day, lasting roughly 5.3 hours each.
Within South Asia, Pakistan has the most severe power shortages where firms report 2.5
outages each day with an average duration of 13.2 hours. More than 75 percent of
firms in Pakistan identifying lack of reliable electricity as a major constraint to their
operation and growth (Figure 1).

Absent a reliable supply of electricity, manufacturing firms must substitute away from
energy-intensive capital or divert investments toward diesel generators, and credit
constraints and market imperfections can compound these inefficiencies. In the absence
of alternative sources of electricity, particularly for unanticipated outages, firms must
send workers home, which decreases the productivity of labor.

Several recent studies quantify the impacts of electricity shortages on various firm- and
household-level outcomes. Allcott, Collard-Wexler, and O’Connell (2016) estimate the
productivity impacts of large manufacturing firms in India. Grainger and Zhang (2017)
follow a similar identification strategy but focus on micro-, small, and medium Indian
enterprises, and they find much larger impacts on unit costs. Fisher-Vanden, Mansur,
and Wang (2015) examine the productivity and environmental effects of electricity
shortages in China. Foster and Steinbuks (2009), Alby, Dethier, Straub, et al. (2011) and
Andersen and Dalgaard (2013) examine the impact of outages on firm size and
technological adoption. Samad and Zhang (2016, 2017) analyze the effects of power
outages on household welfare in India and Bangladesh. Chakravorty, Pelli and Marchand
(2014) examine the effects of power supply reliability on the benefits of electrification.

Despite the wide recognition that electricity shortages result in substantial losses for the
economy in Pakistan, empirical study that quantifies the impact is still lacking. In this
paper, we study the impact of power shortages on manufacturing firms in Pakistan. We
match firm-level data from the Census of Manufacturing Industry conducted by the
Pakistan Bureau of Statistics with district-level power shortage data reported by
distribution utilities. Using a sample of 4,500 manufacturing firms for 2011, we estimate
the impact of electricity shortages on firm-level value-added and total product value
while controlling for each firm’s sector, labor costs, the costs of raw materials, the value
of fixed capital assets, and the value of energy inputs. Our estimates suggest that a 10
percent increase in the total hours of outages on average leads to a 0.14 percent

                                             2
decrease in a firm’s total value of output and a 0.36 percent decrease in the value
added. There is also heterogeneity in the impact of outages on productivity across
sectors: the most energy-intensive, technical manufacturers are impacted the most
severely by shortages.

In what follows, we provide an institutional and economic background on Pakistan,
focusing on electricity shortages and their causes. We then describe the firm-level data
and power shortage data in Section 3, describe the empirical model in Section 4, and
provide cross-sectional estimates in Section 5. Section 6 offers a discussion and
concluding thoughts.

2. Background

Pakistan faces massive electricity shortages. Since 2006, nation-wide power shortages,
the difference between projected demand and actual supply, have been steadily
increasing each year and have risen to 26 percent of total demand, or 29 TWh in 2013
(Figure 2). To address supply shortfalls, utilities implement systematic rolling blackouts
that can last 6 to 14 hours each day. In some areas of Pakistan summertime load
shedding of 8 to 10 hours per day is typical, and in some areas up to 18 to 20 hours of
load shedding happens on a regular basis.

Multiple price and institutional distortions have contributed to the current power crisis
in Pakistan. On the pricing side, historically, electricity price has been set much lower
the cost of supply. The gap is financed by direct budget support and cross-subsidization
across consumer groups. Recent electricity tariff reforms have substantially lowered
subsidy spending from more than 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) per year in
the past decade to 0.8 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2014. However, the weighted
average end-user tariff is still only about 50 percent of the average supply cost in fiscal
year 2014. Underpricing of electricity undermines the incentives of power utilities to
provide high-quality services, creating a so-called "subsidy trap" (McRae 2014).

When distributors were not fully paid through the combination of tariffs and subsidies,
they in turn could not pay the generators. In Pakistan, accumulated arrears of
distribution companies to suppliers, commonly known as circular debt, reached 280
billion rupees, or 1 percent of GDP, on March 31, 2015. Circular debt has caused up to 5
gigawatts (GW) to lie idle, accounting for almost 22 percent of the total installed
capacity in Pakistan (World Bank, 2015). Furthermore, when capacity is used, it is
substantially inefficient. For example, the average efficiency of gas power plants in

                                             3
Pakistan is 30 percent as compared to the average efficiency of 43 percent for gas
power plants in the United States.2 Aging infrastructure and overloaded transmission
and distribution systems also contributed to high losses in the network. In fiscal year
2014, average transmission and distribution losses reached about 21 percent of all the
electricity generated.

Another cause for Pakistan’s power shortages is upstream gas shortfalls. Gas plays an
important role in power generation in Pakistan, constituting 25 percent of total
electricity produced in 2014. Despite having large gas reserves, the low price of
domestic gas has made gas supply increasingly fall short of demand in recent years.
Specifically, natural gas was priced on average at 5 per million British Thermal Units
(MMBTU) during 2009 and 2015 in Pakistan. In contrast, the price of liquefied natural
gas was between USD 10 and 15 per MMBTU during the same period in the Asian
market. Gas underpricing not only results in wasteful consumption, but also reduces
investors’ interest in upstream exploration and production. Meanwhile, there are huge
losses in gas transmission and distribution. The amount of unaccounted-for-gas, the
difference between gas available for sale and gas actually sold, has reached 12 percent
of total supply in 2016.

Facing supply shortfalls, domestic gas is being allocated to different sectors based on
administrative orders. Although the economic benefit of using gas in power generation
is expected to be among the highest in all sectors in Pakistan (USAID 2011), gas is
diverted from power to other sectors such as fertilizer and transport. With gas
resources waning, Pakistan has to increasingly rely on expensive imported fuel oil for
power generation. Imported fuel oil is used for close to 40 percent of overall power
generation in 2014, but the cost of this generation accounts for about 70 percent of the
total energy cost. Reliance on oil-based power generation has resulted in higher cost of
electricity and further worsened the circular debt issue.

Finally, although Pakistan has huge untapped hydropower and substantial wind and
solar potential, development in renewable energy has been almost stagnant over the
past decade.

3. Data

Data for this study come from two sources. The first is the 2010-11 Census of
Manufacturing Industries conducted by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. The second data
source is the distribution company performance evaluation report by National Electric
Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). We describe these in turn.

3.1 Firm Data

The Census of Manufacturing Industries provides a thorough annual overview of firm-
level activities, including detailed information on a variety of input costs, including labor,
capital and electricity, as well as revenue data. The 2010-2011 census mainly covers
firms in Punjab province.3 Punjab in Pakistan has the largest economy of all provinces
and the majority of the manufacturing activity is concentrated in this area.

The census covers 4,499 firms in 23 sectors at the 2-digit level of Pakistan Standard
Industrial Classification (PSIC). 4 The distribution of firms by the 2-digit classification are
shown in Table 1. Of the 23 divisions, number 13 (Manufacturing of Textiles) covers
roughly 28 percent of our sample, division 10 (Manufacturing of Food Products)
accounts for 15 percent, and division 32 (Other Manufacturing) is the third-largest with
11 percent of the sample. The 23 sectors can be further broken down into 236
subcategories at the 5-digit level of PSIC.

Firm-level characteristics are described in Table 2. The mean total product value at the
firm level is about 523,000 rupees5, whereas the mean value-added is 114,000 rupees.
Average total employment costs are just over 17,000 rupees, whereas the average cost
of raw materials is over 300,000 rupees. Firms have an average value of fixed assets of
150,000 rupees, which is notably half the value of the raw material costs for the average
firm and less than a third of the value of the product output. The median number of
employees at a firm in the census is 22 people, with an average of 103 and a standard
deviation of 569.

  There are four firms in the data set located outside Punjab province, including one in Karachi and three
in Islamabad. Excluding these firms from the sample does not change the estimation results.

3.2 Shortage Data

Power shortage data are reported annually by distribution companies (DISCO) to NEPRA
and are published in the DISCO Performance Evaluation Report. The latest evaluation
report includes shortage data at the DISCO level from year 2010-2011 to year 2014-2015.
There are 11 distribution companies in Pakistan, among which 6 provide service in Punjab
province. We identify service areas by district for each DISCO and match firm-level data
with shortage data based on district-level identifiers in the census data for year 2010-
2011. The providers (and corresponding number of firms) in our data are IESCO (120),
GEPCO (1,517), FESCO (1,281), LESCO (1,159), and MEPCO (372).

Although power shortages are nationwide and systematic, there is large variation in
shortages at the DISCO level, which is partially linked to differences in supply and
demand for electricity and partially linked to differences in operating performance of
DISCOs. In fiscal year 2014, for example, average transmission and distribution losses
ranges from 9.4 percent to 38.2 percent, while collection rate ranges from 33 percent to
over 100 percent across the 11 distribution companies.

Shortages are characterized by two reliability indices in the data: one represents the
frequency of shortages, and the second represents the duration of shortages. The
System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) is the average number of
interruptions that a customer experiences in a year. Specifically, SPAIFI is calculated as
the total annual number of consumer supply interruptions divided by the total number
of consumers that the distribution company serves in any a given year. The second
measure, the System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), captures the outage
duration (in minutes) that an average customer experiences in a year. Both SAIFI and
SAIDI do not encompass outages caused by load shedding. However, there is still large
variation in the value of SAIFI and SAIDI across regions. Among the distribution
companies in our data, the SAIFI measure ranges from 0.41 (IESCO) to 185.5 (MEPCO)
(Figure 3), while the SAIDI measure ranges from a minimum value of 22.6 minutes for
IESCO to a maximum of 15,896 minutes (roughly 11 days) for PESCO (Figure 4). In our
econometric analysis, we exploit regional variation in the reliability of power supply
measured by SAIDI and SAIFI to identify the relationship between shortages and firm
productivity.

For year 2010-11, these two measures of shortages have a correlation coefficient of -
0.13 across the 11 distribution companies covered in the NEPRA report, but for the six
distribution companies in Punjab Province, the correlation coefficient for the SAIDI and

                                             6
SAIFI is about 0.54. We incorporate both measures of outages because they may have
different impacts on manufacturing firms. The frequency of disruptions may have a
smaller impact if load-shedding is anticipated, but we expect that longer durations will
have a measurable impact regardless of regularity.

4. Empirical Approach

Given the data described above, we are interested in the impact of electricity shortages
on firm-level value-added and revenues, holding constant costs of inputs and firm-
specific characteristics. A regression of the following form is estimated as the baseline
specification:

                        =   +    ∗ ln ℎ            + ∗      +      +

where Yi is the outcome of interest (i.e. either the natural log of revenues or value-
added) for firm i, shortagei is the shortage index experienced by firm i, Xi are input costs
and other firm-level characteristics, including firms’ labor costs, raw material costs, fixed
assets and total electricity costs. Si is sector fixed effects, capturing shocks that are
common to all firms in a sector. , , ,	and are parameters to be estimated. is the
error term. Because the frequency and duration of shortages could have differential
effects on firm productivity, we estimate alternative specifications to allow for
alternative measures of the severity of shortages as described in the data section.

There could also be heterogeneous effects of shortages at the sector level. For example,
energy-intensive sectors may be more vulnerable to power supply disruptions. In
addition, sectors such as textile industry that are often equipped with gas-based captive
power generators are likely to be less affected by power shortages. To test this
hypothesis, we allow for heterogeneous impacts by two-digit PSIC groups. We note that
there are tradeoffs in exactly how we implement this test. We could estimate the
regression separately for each two-digit sector, but given the small data set, this will
likely lead to few significant coefficients. Alternatively, we can include interaction terms
for the PSIC dummy variable and shortages, assuming that the impacts for the other
variables (labor costs, raw material costs, values of fixed assets, and energy costs) are
the same across sectors as before. In next section, we report both results which are
qualitatively similar in terms of coefficient magnitudes, but in the latter case we are able
to get more precise estimates of the impact of outages.




                                             7
Because we rely on cross-sectional data for the estimation, there are challenges to
causal identification of the impact of shortages on firm-level revenues or value-added.
First, there is likely unobserved firm-level heterogeneity, which can affect both firm
performance and shortages experienced by the firm. For example, more productive
firms may be attracted to less shortage-prone districts. More productive firms are also
more likely to acquire self-generators. Second, shortage is likely to be endogenous to
growth and business climate at the district level. For example, areas that provide more
friendly business environment and experienced faster economic growth can have higher
demand for electricity. This will in turn result in worse power shortages (Allcott, Collard-
Wexler, and O’Connell 2016; Grainger and Zhang, 2017). Finally, there is likely
measurement error in our measurement of shortages, because we only capture district-
level average outages, but not actual outage experienced by each firm. In the following,
we present our estimation results while recognizing the above caveats of the
identification strategy.

5. Empirical Results

Following the approach outlined in Section 4, we first estimate the impact of electricity
shortages on firm-level product revenues, and then we assess the impact of shortages
on firm-level value-added.

5.1 Product Revenues

Table 3 presents the results of our product revenue regressions in which the dependent
variable is the natural log of product revenues at the firm level. There are 3,105
observations in the data with observations for all of the variables included in the
regressions. Columns (1) and (2) include the duration index (SAIDI) as the shortage
variable, while (3) and (4) include the frequency measure (SAIFI). The fifth column
includes both.

The control variables for firms’ labor costs, raw material costs, fixed assets and total
electricity costs all have positive, significant impacts on product revenues, as expected.
Furthermore, the regressions explain a significant amount of variation in product
revenues with Adjusted R-squared values around 0.96 across specifications.

In the first two columns, we find that a 10 percent increase in the average total duration
of outages decreases firm-level revenues by between 0.14 and 0.28 percent. Since



                                             8
column (2) includes two-digit PSIC fixed effects, this is our preferred specification, with
an elasticity estimate of -0.014.

In columns (3) and (4), the estimates indicate that a 10 percent increase in the
frequency of outages is associated with a decrease in revenues of between 0.1 percent
and 0.2 percent, though the effect is insignificant when including PSIC sector fixed
effects. Finally, in the fifth column we include both the duration and frequency indices.
The duration index is significant, with an elasticity of -0.02, whereas the frequency index
is insignificant and positive. It shows that when controlling for frequency of power
shortages, a 10 percent increase in the duration of outages is on average associated
with a 0.2 percent reduction in firm revenue.

5.2 Value-Added

In Table 4 we show estimates analogous to those for the product revenue regressions in
Table 3, but with the dependent variable being the natural log of value-added. Overall
the regressions explain less of the variation than in the product revenue regressions, but
the adjusted R-squared values are still high at around 0.70. There are 3,274 observations
in each regression.

In the first two columns, we see that the duration of outages has a negative, significant
impact on a firm’s value-added. In our preferred specification, which includes two-digit
PSIC indicators, the elasticity is -0.036. This means that a 10 percent increase in the
average total duration of outages leads to a 0.36 percent decrease in a firm’s value-
added. The effect of outages on value added is more than twice as large as that on
revenue. This result suggests that even though firms can rely on self-generators to
reduce the impact of shortages on output loss, the impact of shortages on value-added
is more difficult to be mitigated because self-generators are in general less efficient and
much more expensive than grid electricity.

As with the product revenue regressions, the frequency index leads to smaller and less
significant coefficients, suggesting that the duration is potentially more important than
the frequency of outages. In the fifth column, we see that a 10 percent increase in the
duration of shortages leads to a 0.7 percent decrease in value-added, all else being
equal. The coefficient associated with the frequency of outages is positive, suggesting
that holding constant the total duration of outages in a year, more frequent shortages
have an offsetting effect on revenue decrease due to power shortages. When the total
duration of outages is holding constant in a year, more frequent outages means shorter

                                             9
duration of outages each time. This result suggests that firms on average would prefer
shorter, more frequent shortages than fewer, long-lasting outages.

5.3 Heterogeneity by Sector

Figures 5 and 6 show the impacts of the duration of outages on firm’s total output value
and value-added by sector, respectively. Figures 7 and 8 show impact of the frequency
of outages on firm’s output value and value-added, respectively. All results are based on
sector-by-sector regressions.

The results indicate significant heterogeneity in impacts by sector. In the duration
regressions, sector 16 (i.e. the manufacture of wood and products of wood and cork,
except furniture) has the largest effect in absolute value, with an elasticity of roughly -
0.24 in Figure 5, but it is imprecisely estimated, due to a small sample of observations. In
the frequency regressions, sector 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) has
the largest effect, with an elasticity of -0.4, again imprecisely estimated.

Of the significant impacts we estimate, sector 15 (manufacture of leather and related
products) has an elasticity of roughly -0.15, and sector 17 (manufacture of paper and
paper products) has a precisely estimated effect close to the overall average, with an
elasticity of -0.06. Sectors 24 and 25, both of which deal with the manufacturing of
metal products, have larger than average elasticities in the range of -0.15 to -0.20.

6. Discussion

Pakistan faces severe power shortages, but the question remains as to what impact
shortages have on the national economy. Using a survey of 4,500 manufacturing firms in
Punjab for 2011, we provide new empirical evidence on the impact power shortages
have on firm productivity in Pakistan. Though the data in this study are limited to a
cross-section, results in the paper suggest that there is indeed a strong negative
correlation between electricity shortages and manufacturing revenues and value-added
in Pakistan.

We use two measures of the reliability of power supply: the duration and frequency of
power outages. Our baseline estimates suggest that the elasticity of the value of output
to total duration of outages is roughly -0.014. That is, a 10 percent increase in the
duration of outages on average leads to a 0.14 percent decrease in a firm’s total value of
output. On the value-added side, the elasticity is more than twice as large; a 10 percent

                                            10
increase in the total duration of outages on average leads to a 0.36 percent decrease in
a firm’s value added.

There is also heterogeneity in the impact of outages on productivity across sectors; the
most energy-intensive, technical manufacturers are impacted the most severely by
shortages. The corresponding elasticities for manufacturers of various metal products
are closer to -0.2, indicating that shortages can have a serious deleterious impact on
firm productivity for energy-intensive manufacturing firms.

In the absence of outages, firms would likely behave very differently, including
producing at different times during the day, employing different mixes of capital and
labor, and even engaging in different activities altogether. Therefore, we believe our
estimates to be conservative and underestimates of the actual losses due to the
frequent outages experienced by firms in Pakistan.

On the other hand, the impact of frequency of outages has a small negative impact on
firm output value or value-added, but the effects are not statistically significant. When
holding constant total hours of outages in a year, more frequent shortages even have an
offsetting effect on revenue decrease due to power shortages, suggesting that firms on
average would prefer shorter, more frequent shortages than fewer, long-lasting
outages.

There are a few caveats worth discussing. First, as discussed earlier, there are likely
unobserved firm characteristics that affect our results through omitted variables bias,
perhaps due to the locational decisions of the more- and less-productive firms. Second,
we are unable to account for self-generation in the data. Though we have information
on other fuel use, the effects (which are not shown) are virtually the same for firms that
report purchasing other fuels, but this measure is imperfect. Third, outages are likely to
be endogenous to economic growth at the district level. Endogeneity of shortages at the
firm and district levels could both lead to an underestimation of the impact of power
shortages on firm productivity. Therefore, our estimated impact of power shortages is
likely to be a lower bound of the true effect. Future work will incorporate panel data as
well as more precise measures of outages at the firm location, which will help us come
closer to a true causal effect.

Notes: SAIFI is the average number of interruptions that a customer experiences in a year.
Specifically, SPAIFI is calculated as the total annual number of consumer supply
interruptions divided by the total number of consumers that the distribution company
serves in any a given year. For the purposes of illustration, the index has been
transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine.
