    INTRODUCTION:
    BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
    Africa is urbanizing late but fast. This brings many
    benefits but, as this report shows:
     	Thus far, urbanization in Africa,
      unique in a number of respects,
      is having deleterious and largely
      unchecked impacts on the natural                   URBANIZATION,
      environment;                                     THE ENVIRONMENT
     	The degradation of natural assets                AND GREEN URBAN
      and ecosystems within African                     DEVELOPMENT IN
      cities carries tangible economic,                     AFRICA
      fiscal and social costs;
     	There are important opportunities
      to change the current
      environmental trajectory of African
      cities so that they move towards
      a more harmonious relationship
      between their natural and built
      environments. For this to happen,
      focused action is necessary.

             Greening Africa’s Cities:
             Enhancing the relationship between urbanization, environmental assets and ecosystem services
             Introduction: Background and Objectives




In this context, the lack of an adequate understanding of the
natural environment and the extent of urban environmental
degradation in Africa, its economic and human costs,
and the complex interplay between urban development,
natural asset decline, and the value of ecosystem services
provision is becoming increasingly problematic. National
and city governments are unable to make well-informed,
cost-effective urban planning, land-use, budgetary and
investment decisions regarding the development of urban
areas, and lack the tools to mitigate negative environmental
externalities. Moreover, there is a significant risk that African
cities may become locked into a “grow dirty now, clean
up later” development path which is potentially costly,
inefficient and welfare-reducing (World Bank 2012). Thus far,
with one or two exceptions (de Wit et al., 2011) very little
systematic analytic work has been done on these issues in
Africa and little attention has been paid to the development
of instruments, strategies and approaches which can improve
cities’ capacities to improve their decision-making capabilities
and enable them to respond effectively to the erosion of the
value of their environmental assets.
This report, and the suite of eight research studies which
underlie it (see Preface), is directed at addressing part
of this knowledge deficit. An improved understanding
of urbanization’s impacts on the environment, and the
proper valuation of the costs and benefits associated
with interventions that alter the natural capital base and
ecosystem services provision, can allow public agencies
to make more cost-effective and responsible urban
development decisions, balance the trade-offs between
natural capital conservation and other land-uses, and inform
approaches to developing urban land and the nature of
the associated investments (TEEB 2010). It is particularly
important that knowledge and technical capacity gaps in this
area are addressed sooner rather than later: once ecosystems
are severely degraded or destroyed it becomes very difficult,
or impossible, to restore them and the value of the services
they provide may be irreversibly lost.
                                                                        There is a significant risk
                                                                         that African cities may

    THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
    CITY GROWTH AND THE
    NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
    How urban activities affect the environment
    Urbanization entails the growth and spatial concentration
    of population, economic production, and consumption.
    This involves three types of activity which affect the
    natural environment:
     	The expanded use and
      consumption of natural resources;
     	The transformation of the
      natural environment into the
      built environment as residences,
      economic enterprises, and
      infrastructure are established;
     	The generation of waste
      including atmospheric emissions,
      wastewater and solid waste.

In any urban space, these activities exist in complex                 are also beneficial. Natural resource consumption, for

     Africa is urbanizing at relatively low levels of industrialization      than other regions (Figure 5). This is aggravated by low
     (Lall et al., 2017), motorization and technology. For example,          proportions of overall capital investment (infrastructure,
     at levels of 42, 25 and 39 per 1,000 population, respectively,          housing and office building) which remains at around 20% of
     motorization levels in Nairobi, Dar es Salaam and Dakar are             GDP. In contrast, capital investment in China rose from 35%
     low by international standards (Behrens et al, 2016; CETUD,             to 48% of GDP at the time that its urbanization level rose
     2015). This has varying effects on the urban environment.               from 18% to 52% of the population (1978-2012), and capital

In the context of rapid urbanization, and in combination                       is characterized by poor levels of infrastructure and service
with other factors (such as weak planning and institutional                    delivery. Third, in the context of social and political pressures
capacity), this has had three important and interrelated                       which tend to emphasize the delivery of services focused
impacts. First, relative to city size, fiscal resources are                    on access and immediate human consumption (water, roads
extremely limited. This is reflected in exceedingly low public                 and so on), infrastructure and services which deal with waste
expenditures on urban infrastructure which (outside of                         are deprioritized and receive little of the scarce resources
South Africa) are normally in a range of less than US$1 per                    that are available. Thus, the urban population without access
capita per year to around US$15 per capita per year.2 Second,                  to improved sanitation has grown steadily over the past 2-3
household resources for investment in housing and payment                      decades from 89 million in 1990 to 189 million in 2010 (Figure
of service charges are also very limited, one reason for the                   6; AMCOW 2012). For the entire region the proportion of
very high proportion (at 70% by far the highest in the world)                  urban residents with access to sanitation was estimated to be
of the urban population living in informal settlement, which                   only 37% in 2010.3

     Solid waste coverage also remains very limited with                     poorly capacitated. Most metropoles traverse numerous
     collection rates for many African cities at below 50% (Table            jurisdictions, managed by different elected bodies, local
     1). The upshot is that African cities appear to be doing less           government structures and agencies, many of which have
     to manage the waste that their urban populations and                    fragmented and/or overlapping planning and regulatory

     ENVIRONMENTAL TRENDS
     IN AFRICAN CITIES
     Although urban areas cover a relatively small proportion of the Earth’s
     surface, their expansion drives global environmental change (Seto
     et al., 2012). Rapid urbanization, coupled with low levels of wealth
     and technology and weak institutions, have had a combined effect
     on the environment that has been particularly severe in Africa. Poor
     and ineffective planning has led to the transformation of valuable
     ecosystems and other open space areas in and around cities, while a
     growing backlog in infrastructure investment and service delivery has
     led to major problems of pollution, flooding and overconsumption
     of resources. All of these problems, along with a lack of protection
     from invasive alien species, have had major impacts on ecosystems
     and biodiversity. These problems, discussed in more detail below,
     will be exacerbated by the effects of global climate change while also
     contributing to the problem.

     COSTS AND CONSEQUENCES
     Economic consequences
     Untangling the economic costs of environmental degradation in urban
     areas is complex, as they usually go hand in hand with poorly-maintained
     buildings and infrastructure, poorly-organized street-trading and transport
     activities and high levels of crime. Neglect of city environments also
     means that they lack the enhancements one sees in developed cities, such
     as roadside verges, trees and gardens. While the environmental quality
     of cities may be treated as a low priority by financially-strapped local
     governments, it has an important bearing on urban, and hence national,
     economies. Greener and cleaner cities are likely to have healthier and more
     productive citizens, as well as being more attractive to property developers
     and buyers, international business and tourism.

The city of Durban is a leading tourism destination in South Africa. The year-
round warm weather conditions encourage leisure tourists to enjoy the
many outdoor tourist attractions, but the beach and marine environment
is known to be the core leisure tourism experience on offer.

as on estuaries and wetlands and in the 27 nature

whole city are rare. However, the recent emergence
of various social media tools, specifically involving
uploading of geotagged photographs, provides
an opportunity to assess the spatial behavior of

Panoramio.com, which hosts outdoor images of
landscapes, natural features and architecture,
Turpie et al. (2017a) mapped the value of leisure
tourism in Durban. The spatial patterns and photo
content analysis suggests that open space areas
within the municipal area account for almost half
of the tourism attractions in Durban, with coastal
attractions, nature areas, parks and rural farmland
accounting for 20%, 17%, 7% and 4% of leisure
tourism value, respectively.
The tourism value associated with the coast is
very high, with the most popular coastal areas
contributing up to US$5.1 million per kilometer to
GDP. Man-made open space such as parks and golf
courses contribute US$18,000 per hectare. The
combined tourism value of natural and man-made
open space is approximately US$180 million.

     Property taxes form a substantial proportion of city income in

     In Durban, which still maintains substantial areas of green

     to natural and semi-natural open space areas that are in a

     CHANGING THE TRAJECTORY:
     GREEN URBAN DEVELOPMENT
     IN AFRICA
     Crystallizing the challenge
     The research presented above indicates that most African
     cities are on a trajectory of environmental degradation that
     has become self-reinforcing though negative feedbacks. This is
     the path C1 described earlier in Figure 2. This situation is not
     sustainable: cities urgently need to change their trajectory by
     slowing and ultimately reversing environmental decline.
     An investment in environmental assets and quality would yield
     positive economic, social and fiscal returns and rejuvenated
     cities would be able to make a positive and vitally-needed
     contribution to national development.

     What cities should not do

     Research undertaken for this report indicates that there are important things that cities
     should avoid doing if they are to attempt a shift to a positive environmental trajectory.
     These essentially fall into three broad areas – waste and stormwater, city structure
     and the use of natural resources – and are also strongly linked to service delivery.

     Strengthen institutions to manage green urban development
     Cities need to strengthen the institutions on which effective green urban
     planning and management rest by addressing structural limitations,
     accountability and capacity constraints. This includes finding better
     ways to integrate the protection and management of natural assets that
     pertain to a range of city and/or government departments.
