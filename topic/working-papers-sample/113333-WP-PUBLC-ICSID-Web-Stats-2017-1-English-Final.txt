THE ICSID CASELOAD –
     STATISTICS
    (ISSUE 2017-1)
            The ICSID Caseload – Statistics
                                                (Issue 2017-1)



This issue of the ICSID Caseload – Statistics updates the profile of the ICSID caseload, historically
and for the calendar year 2016. It is based on cases registered or administered by ICSID as of
December 31, 2016.

As in the previous issues, this document illustrates: the number of cases registered under the
ICSID Convention and Additional Facility Rules; the number of other cases administered by the
ICSID Secretariat; the basis of consent to ICSID jurisdiction invoked in registered arbitration and
conciliation cases; the geographic distribution of ICSID cases by the State party to the dispute,
and the economic sectors involved in ICSID disputes. It also contains data on outcomes in ICSID
arbitration and conciliation proceedings, including further information on disputes decided by
arbitral tribunals, data on discontinued ICSID arbitration proceedings, and outcomes to date in
annulment proceedings under the ICSID Convention. The nationalities and geographic origins of
arbitrators, conciliators and ad hoc committee members appointed in ICSID cases are also
featured.

The Secretariat will continue to publish the ICSID Caseload – Statistics on a bi-annual basis, and
welcomes any comments or suggestions by email at ICSIDsecretariat@worldbank.org.

      The ICSID Secretariat offers various levels of administrative and organizational support for non-ICSID dispute
      settlement in State-State or investor-State proceedings. Among the State-State cases administered in the
      past decade are the Southern Bluefin Tuna case (Australia and New Zealand v. Japan), an expert
      determination proceeding under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, and an arbitration under the Softwood
      Lumber Agreement of 2006 (United States v. Canada).

      The Centre also frequently provides administrative assistance to investor-State arbitrations under the
      UNCITRAL Rules or other ad hoc dispute settlement provisions. The Centre’s services in these proceedings
      range from support with the organization of hearings to administrative services comparable to those
      provided in ICSID cases. The Secretariat also acts as appointing authority, and decides proposals for
      disqualification of arbitrators, upon request. In addition to administering UNCITRAL arbitrations, ICSID has
      also assisted with the organization of hearings in arbitration proceedings conducted under the auspices of
      the ICC, LCIA, PCA, and other institutions.
