Designing Sustainable Sites
           As we expand our work with the world’s least developed countries and those facing
           situations of fragility, conflict, and violence, ensuring the safety of our staff working in
           the field and the efficient use of resources in our buildings is paramount.
           Operating buildings sustainably. Guidelines for sustainable management of our offices
           shape the procurement for, and management of, global World Bank structures. Vendor
           solicitation documents specify criteria to encourage firms that support sustainable
           facility maintenance to apply. Simultaneously, tender documentation states that the use
           of sustainable materials and practices during construction and refurbishment is required.
           Laos and New Delhi join the ranks. In fiscal year 2017, a new World Bank building in the
           Lao People’s Democratic Republic received Green Mark Platinum status for its sustainable
           features, such as solar energy use, rainwater harvesting, artificial light sensors, sewage
           treatment, and managed garbage disposal. At the New Delhi Lodi Estate office, building
           upgrades and the purchase of green energy certificates through the Indian Energy
           Exchange enabled us to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
           Gold Commercial Interiors status. By applying sustainable building standards, not only
           do we minimize the environmental footprint of our offices, we also contribute to the
           country’s green growth agenda.
           Efficiencies in data centers. As more operations move to the Cloud, the need for onsite
           capacity shrinks. In fiscal year 2017, the Bank Group reduced its real estate footprint by
           consolidating five data centers into two, leading to $2.4 million in annual savings and
           less space, power, and cooling capacity. In addition, a state-of-the-art infrastructure
           platform, VBlock, was deployed to reduce electricity use significantly by converging 19
           systems of servers, storage, and networking into two.

         staff in Washington, DC, use alternative means of commuting, including biking, walking,
         public transportation, and carpooling. Demand for onsite car parking decreased by 2
         percent in fiscal year 2017.

Waste Not
          A combination of source reduction, reuse, and recycling efforts aims to reduce the                                Sorting made simple.

          Reduce. Minimizing the amount of material brought into Bank facilities is the first way
          we mitigate the amount of waste created. We accomplish this by avoiding unnecessary
          packaging for purchased items, including encouraging minimum purchase thresholds for
          office supplies. Another method is mandating that large purchases, such as our latest                                          PAPER ONLY = GREEN BIN

          of introducing source-separated recycling. The standard, piloted in one World Bank building in
          October 2016, resulted in an increased landfill diversion rate, from 59 percent to 77 percent,
          by the end of fiscal year 2017. The waste diverted compostable materials to an appropriate
          food compost facility. Lessons learned from the pilot led to program launch in an additional
          building in April 2017 and a plan for headquarters-wide implementation by fall 2017.

Engaging Our Host Communities
          We take seriously our responsibility as a neighbor in our host communities. The World
          Bank Group Community Connections Program supports staff efforts to give back to our
          communities.
          Giving time. Staff volunteer in their communities with their colleagues, their families, and
          their friends. To support employees in these efforts, the Bank gives staff a paid day to
          volunteer and, in fiscal year 2017, hosted Volunteer Awareness Week to help them connect
          with volunteering opportunities. The program included an expo with dozens of nonprofits,
          a blood drive, trainings on how to be a nonprofit board member, and presentations on
          volunteering to prevent food waste.
          Investing in our host communities. In fiscal year 2017, the Bank Group and staff
          donated over $7 million. Specifically, in our annual Community Connections Campaign,
          staff pledged a record $3.2 million, and the Bank Group matched these gifts, putting
          $6.4 million into the Washington, DC, region and the world through this program alone.
          Campaigns in 25 country offices set records as well, raising $211,000, including the
          corporate match, for local NGOs. Staff worldwide also responded to the hurricane in
          Haiti, with donations totaling $25,000 including Bank Group matching.

Giving more. Staff reach beyond contributing monetarily to volunteer
time and knowledge. Measure4Change began its fifth year of providing
grants, technical assistance, knowledge briefs, and a community of
practice for nonprofit performance measurement professionals in the
Washington, DC, region. In addition, we have launched a pilot series of
briefs with the World Bank Education Global Practice and the Rotary
Club of Capitol Hill on innovations in education in the region. Most
of the projects included in the briefs were supported by Community
Connections funding.

Using Creativity in Operations
EXPRESSING DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES
The World Bank uses art as a way of raising awareness of local and global development
issues. The goal of the World Bank Art Program is to provide a platform for the artists,
mostly from developing countries, to convey the hopes and struggles of people in their
countries to an international audience. Art can capture moments to provide victims and
their loved ones a means of healing through creative expression. In fiscal years 2016 and
2017, the program highlighted gender-based violence, albinism, and the Syrian refugee crisis
through exhibitions, art installations, and lectures.
"1 in 3: What Does It Take for You to Be Outraged?" is an international traveling exhibition
that employs art as a tool to fight gender-based violence by encouraging people to
acknowledge the violent acts that are occurring within their society. "Neda Wants to Die"
and "Wounded to Death" are two theatrical events tied to the “1 in 3” exhibition.
"A Long Road: The Struggle for Social Inclusion of People with Albinism in Africa" is a
photography exhibition dedicated to raising awareness of the issue in several countries.
"Syrian Crisis—The Art of Resilience" is an exhibition of 35 paintings, created mostly              Hitman Gurung Save Yourself First acrylic on      Hitman Gurung Save Life Together acrylic on
by Syrian refugees, that focuses on the conflict and displacement resulting from the                canvas, Nepal – 2012                              canvas, Nepal – 2012

The program also manages a collection of over 6,000 works of art in the Bank’s global offices.

  Strengthening support for staff in Fragile, Conflict, and Violence (FCV) situations. As the World Bank expands
  efforts in countries facing situations of fragility, conflict, and violence, we are committed to ensuring appropriate
  staffing levels, as well as strengthening the Employment Value Proposition for staff in those locations. We are
  investing in their learning and career development and ensuring that we are adequately compensating and
  rewarding all staff working on and in fragile, conflict, and violence situations.
  Advancing diversity and inclusion. As a development organization, we can be successful only if we reflect and
  understand our clients, and if we bring different experiences, viewpoints, and ways of approaching issues to the
  table. In fiscal year 2017, the World Bank reached its target for representation of Sub-Saharan African/Caribbean
  professional staff for the first time since 1998, and redoubled efforts to reach gender parity. The Bank Group
  became the first international financial institution to join the UN Women HeForShe campaign, and committed
  to achieving additional gender equality targets. These include gender balance among senior management (vice
  presidents and above) by 2020, second-level certification of Economic Dividends for Gender Equality (EDGE) by
  2020, and a 50-50 gender balance in technical positions by 2022. EDGE is the leading global standard for gender
  equality in the workplace. In the latest Staff Engagement Survey, staff validated that our institution’s efforts are

Ensuring Staff Voice
           The World Bank promotes a positive and respectful workplace. Staff have numerous
           venues to raise concerns or address workplace conflicts.
GRI        Staff Engagement Survey. The annual Engagement Survey provides an opportunity
406        for staff to share their views on the workplace and to provide feedback to management
           on areas to strengthen our Employee Value Proposition and make the Bank a more
           effective institution for client countries. In fiscal year 2017, 80 percent of Bank staff
           participated in the Engagement Survey. Results showed that we have a strongly engaged
           workforce, with 92 percent of staff expressing their pride in working for the Bank, 74
           percent indicating that they would recommend it to friends as a great place to work,
           and 76 percent agreeing that the Bank is the best place to work in development. There
           was improvement in staff responses to questions such as (1) clear understanding of the
           direction in which our senior management is leading the institution; (2) strengthening
           collaboration of staff across different Bank Group units; and (3) being inspired by the
           institution to do their best work.
           Staff services. Workplace conflict is addressed through the Internal Justice Services
           (IJS), a group of informal and formal services: Respectful Workplace Advisors Program
           (RWA), Ombuds Services (OMB), Mediation Services (MEF), and Peer Review Services
           (PRS). Related services include the World Bank Administrative Tribunal (WBAT), Ethics
           and Business Conduct Vice Presidency (EBC), and Integrity Vice Presidency (INT).
           Together these entities help create a positive and respectful work environment.
           In fiscal year 2017, a two-tier process was created to address performance evaluations,
           performance ratings, and decisions to place staff on “Opportunity to Improve”
           performance plans. If a staff member is dissatisfied with the outcome of the first tier
           review—carried out by the World Bank Human Resources Department, he or she may
           request a Performance Management Review be carried out by the Peer Review Services.

In March 2016, the Bank launched the first bonds that link returns to an equity index of companies that support the
Sustainable Development Goals in their operations.
The World Bank has been a leader in developing the Green Bond market. World Bank Green Bonds are the first
type of World Bank sustainable development bonds to be earmarked for a specific purpose: to mitigate the effects
of climate change and help countries adapt to its impacts. The World Bank started issuing Green Bonds in 2008
in response to investor requests that came when the Bank was seeking to support innovation in climate finance.
Like all World Bank bonds, these are high-quality, liquid assets offered in different maturities and currencies and
with specific terms and coupons to fit investor needs. Projects eligible for green bond support include wind power,
solar power, technologies to reduce GHG emissions, waste management, transport efficiency, energy efficiency,
reforestation, and sustainable forest management. Since 2008, the World Bank has issued over USD 10 billion                                                      Wind Park near Kavarna, Bulgaria

          meet every three years to replenish IDA’s funds and review its policies. The most recent
          replenishment, IDA18, was approved in March 2017 and resulted in a record replenishment
          size of $75 billion to finance projects over the three-year period from July 1, 2017, to June
          30, 2020. Additional financing comes from transfers from IBRD’s net income, grants from
          the International Finance Corporation, and borrowers’ repayments of earlier IDA credits.
