      Box 1.1.   What Is Political Economy?


      Political economy is concerned with the interaction of political and economic processes in a society: the
      distribution of power and wealth between different groups and individuals, and the processes that create,
      sustain, and transform these relationships over time.

                                                                          — OECD Development Assistance Committee


      Political economy is the study of both politics and economics, and specifically the interactions between
      them. It focuses on power and resources, how they are distributed and contested in different country and
      sector contexts, and the resulting implications for development outcomes. Political economy analysis
      involves more than a review of institutional and governance arrangements: it also considers the underlying
      interests, incentives, rent/rent distributions, historical legacies, prior experiences with reforms, social
      trends, and how all these factors effect or impede change.

                                                                                                              — World Bank

      Box 2.1.   Technical Knowledge Is a Critical Element of Political Economy Analysis


      An emphasis on politics does not diminish the importance of technical knowledge. As reflected in the figure
      below, political economy analysis compliments technical and economic analysis. While political economy
      assessments provide insights into the nontechnical drivers of decision making, they rely on a sound
      understanding of the technical bottlenecks that need to be resolved, as well as the economic and social
      costs and benefits of a given intervention. With regard to project design, finding the sweet spot between
      what is technically desirable and politically feasible requires specialized knowledge of the technical,
      economic, and political-institutional issues at play.

       Box 2.2. Countries Perceive Risks When Negotiating or Implementing a Transboundary Waters
       Agreement


       Capacity and Knowledge: Confidence in ability to negotiate a fair deal; having adequate and correct
       information and knowledge to negotiate a deal.

       In experiencing the capacity and knowledge risk, countries can fear that they would be at a disadvantage.
       This risk is manifested in two major ways: (a) countries perceived they had less negotiating capacity than
       their co-riparians and (b) countries perceived they did not have adequate or accurate information about
       the basin.

       Accountability and Voice: Deliverability of benefits by the regional entity and co-riparians, often related to
       trust; having a say in decision making in the governing structures of the regional entity.

       Decision makers generally experienced the accountability and voice risk in regard to fear that co-riparians,
       third parties, or the regional institution may not deliver benefits; concern that his/her country’s interests
       would not be adequately considered in joint decision-making processes; and/or perception of a high
       probability that the regional institutional arrangement would not result in the optimal flow of benefits.

       Sovereignty and Autonomy: Ability to act in the best interest of the country without constraints; making
       decisions independently.

       To a greater or lesser extent, all of the cases reflected the significant risk of sovereignty and autonomy.
       At its core, this risk is about a decision maker sensing the danger of intrusion into the country’s authority to
       make sovereign decisions. It refers to both of the following: (a) the desire to have control over national
       development goals and related development of resources and infrastructure and (b) the right to make
       decisions independently.

       Equity and Access: Fairness of (relative) benefits to a country, including timing of benefits and costs and
       obtaining/retaining fair access to the river.

       Countries were acutely concerned with the risk of equity and access. Namely, (a) fairness in any deal,
       regarding specified quantity (or quality) of water, benefit flows, or project costs and (b) entitlement to use
       the river. Some countries viewed entitlement as the right to continuing with historic uses; others as gaining
       access to a river running through (or originating in) its territory; and yet others as attaining benefits in
       proportion to a country’s relative size in (or percent contribution to) the basin.

       Stability and Support: Potential longevity of the agreement; in-country support of the agreement,
       including likelihood of ratification.

       The risk of stability and support had direct national and personal implications. It was an important
       consideration for all countries, but particularly so for countries with diversified and powerful stakeholders.
       It applied to all the following: (a) the implementability of an agreement, (b) the presence or absence of key
       stakeholder support, and (c) a decision maker’s positive or negative public image.

        Box 3.1.   Linking Structural Issues to Decision Making in the Okavango


        In the Okavango Basin, the socioeconomic dependencies on the river and the delta for each country
        and nationally important productive sectors that may affect the river shape decision making. In brief,
        all three riparians retrieve the majority of their economic flows from mined and oil reserves outside of
        the basin. Botswana has an important secondary foreign exchange revenue from tourism, particularly in
        the fragile Okavango Delta. Hence, an analyst could use these first layers of socioeconomic data to dig
        deeper on drivers that Angola and Namibia may have for developing or cooperating with Botswana on
        conservation measures.

       Box 3.2.   The Historical Legacy of Political and Economic Cooperation in West Africa


      In West Africa, historical factors play an important role in the way transboundary water cooperation is
      manifested. Many West African countries share the legacy of French colonization and inherited governance,
      legal and institutional systems, as well as language and global alliances; these parallels have been useful to
      overcome initial barriers to cooperation. Likewise, West African states not colonized by the French have
      inherited different institutional structure and languages, which have posed a barrier to cooperation with
      former French colonies. On the other hand, it has increased the drive for countries like Nigeria, Ghana, or
      Sierra Leone to cooperate to avoid isolation. Other historical legacies, such as the strong political leadership
      of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), move countries toward regional integration,
      including credible peacekeeping efforts and regional efforts. For example, cross-border movement of
      peoples plays an important role in regional solidarity in West Africa. Finally, the strong history of economic
      cooperation, including economic and monetary integration, led by ECOWAS and West African Economic and
      Monetary Union (UEOMA), are important historical and structural factors to include in a political economy
      analysis focused on West Africa.

       Box 3.3. De Jure Mandate and De Facto Implementation for Data and Information Sharing—
       The Niger Basin Observatory


       The Niger Basin Authority (NBA) has a broad mandate to manage and develop resources in the Niger Basin.
       It depends on member state contributions and goodwill to carry out its core functions. When the interests
       of member states are not well aligned with the NBA carrying out its mandate, the institution must balance
       its mission and core functions with the interests of the member states. For example, the Niger Basin
       Observatory, an organ of the NBA, is mandated to monitor the basin and produce regular information on
       the development of the basin. To fulfill this task, the observatory has monitoring stations throughout the
       basin and relies on member states to share flow and abstraction data to characterize the basin and the
       development of its resources. Yet, accurate monitoring of flows may challenge member states interests.
       This creates an inherent tension for the NBA which fully relies on member states contributions to carry out
       its core monitoring functions. This tension also arises with regard to recruitment and human resource
       management. There is the perception that the NBA must maintain member-state goodwill. Consequently,
       staff positions are often appointed with an eye toward representation of all nine countries in the basin;
       few are competitively selected. This results in more limited de facto implementation of the NBA’s
       functions, particularly on controversial matters.

       Box A.1.   “Strategic” vs. “Project-Specific” Assessments


       Strategic assessments:

       •	 Purpose: This type of analysis is used to inform strategic planning about where to engage, as well as the
          design of regional engagement strategies. With regard to timing, these are usefully conducted before
          taking decisions about whether to engage in a specific basin or country.

       •	 Focus: The focus is on “big picture” basin dynamics and the overall trajectory of the region. Analysis is
          comparative rather than deep. It might explore the capacities and systems that have produced successful
          reforms in the past. It will also highlight any critical junctures that represent the opening or closing of a
          window of opportunity for reform. Though it may already make some initial contributions to discussions
          about which types of interventions or approaches may gain traction, it will not provide sufficient depth to
          inform the design of a specific engagement.

       •	 Scope: The analysis is more likely to cover all countries in the basin, looking at dynamics that are influ-
          ential across water-related sectors. The assessment will touch on how political and economic power is
          organized in each country, explore the salience of water in each country’s political-economic system, and
          discuss the implications for unlocking sustainable and inclusive growth, climate resilience, and poverty
          reduction through the development of international waters. The analysis might explore the de jure and
          de facto functioning of national and regional institutions which are responsible for water resources man-
          agement, as well as which of the “risks of cooperation” set out in Box 2.2 are at play in the region.

       Analysis focused on a single engagement or project:

       •	 Purpose: This type of analysis is to inform decision making about the design and implementation of specific
          engagements or operations. With regard to timing, these are usefully conducted before the project concept
          note stage when there is still flexibility with regard to design. These assessments are most valuable when ini-
          tiated by and in close collaboration with operational teams and may benefit from periodic updating over time.

       •	 Focus: This type of assessment provides depth rather than breadth—but connects the dots between
          issue-specific dynamics and big-picture national and regional drivers. It addresses the questions “what
          should we do” and “how should we do it?” It has a medium-term outlook which unpacks dynamics likely
          to shape engagements over 2–3 years.

       •	 Scope: This type of assessment is focused on the specific water resources management sectors encompassed
          by the proposed project—for example, groundwater, data and information sharing, investment in a specific
          infrastructure project, addressing an identified institutional gap. Further, the analysis may not touch on every
          riparian with the same level of depth; a discussion of which countries to cover in more detail will be critical.

      Management


      The following sample TOR should be adapted as much as possible to fit the development challenge for
      which a solution is being sought, as well as the purpose and desired outputs.

      A.	Background

      [Add name of the unit, project or team] is aiming to improve the effectiveness of its operational
      engagements; risk identification and mitigation strategies; and its responsiveness to country demand for
      context-specific and context-sensitive approaches. To this end, [name unit, project, or team] is undertaking
      applied political economy work early in program design and implementation.

      B.	Objective of the assignment

      The objective of this assignment is to provide the task team with a deep understanding of the political-
      institutional context in [region or countries or organization] to ensure that the purposes of the proposed
      [strategy or operation] are aligned with a prudent assessment of the political, economic, and institutional
