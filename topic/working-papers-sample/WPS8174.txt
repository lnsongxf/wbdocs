I. INTRODUCTION


Rail transport generally has the advantage for large-volume long-haul freight operations.
Because of the large amount of fixed costs required for rail infrastructure development, rail
operations exhibit significant economies of scale. A practical norm is that 1 million net tons a
year would be needed to justify economic viability of railways (World Bank 2010). By
distance, railways can achieve good financial performance with an average haulage of more
than 500-600 km (e.g., World Bank 2013; Llano et al. 2017). From the environmental point
of view, railways also have an important advantage to foster sustainable transportation. In
theory, railways are more than 50 percent greener than road transportation (Kopp et al.,
2013). According to the global statistics, the rail sector accounts for only 3.6 percent of total
transport emissions, while it contributes to over 8 percent of the total movements of
passengers and goods over the world (IEA and UIC, 2015).


Railway carries 6.3 percent of the global passenger transport demand and 9 percent of the
total freight demand (Table 1). For passenger movements, road transport is a dominant mode
in many countries, except for some countries, such as China, India, Japan and the Russian
Federation, where railway accounts for about 15-30 percent of the total passenger transport
(Figure 1). In Africa, railway passenger transport is minimal.


On the other hand, railway has a more vital role to play in freight transportation. With
navigation excluded, rail carries the same amount of freight as road does. In non-OECD
countries, the demand for rail freight transport has been increasing in recent years, while
developed countries have been experiencing more stable rail freight activities (Figure 2). The
rail dependency varies across countries: While rail freight accounts for more than 30 percent
in India and the United States, the modal share of rail freight in Japan is less than 1 percent.
In the Russian Federation, the share exceeds 85 percent.

Historically, Africa possesses important rail assets, however, intermodal competition has
been becoming increasingly intense in recent years. At the end of 2008, there were 52
railways operating in 33 countries in Africa. The total rail network size is about 70,000 km,
out of which some 55,000 km are currently operational, mainly transporting mining and
agricultural products. Africa’s rail freight tariffs, which range from US$0.03 to US$0.06 per
ton-km, are competitive against truck transportation (Table 2). However, the quality of rail
services continues deteriorating, mainly because of lack of infrastructure maintenance. Many
rail lines in Africa are more than 100 years old and lack resources for rehabilitation, falling
into a vicious circle (e.g., Gwilliam, 2011).

In the literature, transport mode choice has long been discussed not only from the transport
planning point of view, but also from the trade and industrial development perspectives.
There are a number of discrete choice models investigating people’s or firms’ modal choice
decisions. For instance, Brooks et al. (2012) use a stated preference experiment to examine
Australian shippers’ preferences among truck, rail and coastal shipping. It is shown that
freight rates are important but transit time is also critical. Especially, rail transit time has a
significant negative impact on shippers’ choice. In the revealed preference literature, it is
shown that multinational firms are particularly sensitive to transport reliability and prefer air
or maritime shipping to truck transportation in Southeast Asia (Hayakawa et al. 2013).


On the passenger side, McFadden (1974a and 1974b), Hensher (1986), and Hensher and
Greene (2002) are among the most important studies on urban transport choice. The demand
for public transportation, including bus and train, is often examined in relation to individual
car use. A recent study shows that for long distance trips in Spain, transport costs are an
important determinant of people’s modal choice. The rail cost elasticity is estimated at -0.442
in the multinomial logit setting (Gonzalez and Suarez, 2016). Agarwal and Koo (2016) show
that the implementation of congestion toll rate adjustment, which is among the most
innovative road pricing systems, increased public bus ridership by 12 to 20 percent in
Singapore, though relying on a different estimation approach, i.e., difference-in-differences.


From the trade facilitation point of view, the gravity model is frequently used. For instance,
Llano et al. (2017) estimate a gravity equation to examine the effect of intermodal
competition on the freight flows on the road network across provinces in Spain. It is shown
that road and railway can coexist and be positively associated for the segment of distance
between 600 and 1,200 km, supporting the currently observed modal mix in Spain. The firm
location literature also provides relevant insight on firms’ modal preferences. Firms are often
found to be located along major highways (e.g., Holl, 2004; Chandra and Thompson, 2000).
This is because reliable transport infrastructure is critical to improve firm productivity. For
example, firm inventory is reduced with proximity to interstate highways in the United States
                                               -5-




(Shirley and Winston, 2004). Access to good port facilities is also essential for firms
(Belderbos and Carree, 2002; Deichmann et al., 2005). There are only a few studies showing
the impact of rail proximity. Banerjee et al. (2012) show the positive effect of rail
infrastructure on local economies in China.


The current paper analyzes the modal choice made by firms in Tanzania. As discussed above,
Africa has important rail infrastructure, of which the quality has been deteriorating in many
countries. More and more shippers prefer using truck transportation, as the road network is
improved in the region. However, certain companies are still taking advantage of rail
transport. In the literature, there is little evidence on freight modal choice in Africa. This
paper aims at casting light on the demand for rail freight in the region. With firm-level data
collected from about 500 firms in Tanzania, the traditional discrete choice models are
estimated.


The remaining sections are organized as follows: Section II provides an overview of recent
developments in transport infrastructure in Tanzania. Section III develops our empirical
models and describes data. Section IV presents main estimation results and discusses policy
implications. Then Section V concludes.




II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE


Tanzania is a large country with a land area of 885,800 km2, where more than 55 million
people live. Intercity connectivity is critical for the economy. While Dar es Salaam is the
primary city, with an estimated population of 5.4 million, other secondary cities are also
growing, such as Mwanza, Arusha, Dodoma, Morogoro and Mbeya. Each city is estimated to
have a population close to 500,000. A number of firms are located in secondary cities and
other small towns. According to the Central Register of Establishments, about 45,000
enterprises were formally registered by 2010 (Figure 3).
                                                   -6-




The firm concentration in Dar es Salaam seems to be accelerating. About 2,300 firms were
newly created or formally registered in the three districts in Dar es Salaam in 2010 alone. Dar
es Salaam accounts for about 25 percent of the total firms registered (Figure 4). Long distance
transportation is of particular importance for firms located in inland areas to connect Dar es
Salaam. Port access is also critical for many businesses that engage in international trading.
Tanzania traditionally exports mining and agricultural products. The country also imports a
lot of goods and equipment from abroad. The Port of Dar es Salaam is one of the largest hub
ports in the region, which handled about 10.4 million tons in 2011, 13.1 million tons in 2013
and 15 million tons in 2015.

Tanzania has a relatively well developed road network composed of over 86,000 km of
roads. The government spends approximately US$310 million for road development and
maintenance every year. Regional and trunk roads managed by a national road agency,
                                                   -7-




Tanzania National Roads Agency (TANROADS), are generally well-maintained. About
12,000 km of roads are paved, of which half or 55 percent are maintained in good or fair
condition. On the other hand, most rural roads remain unpaved, and nearly 90 percent are in
poor or very poor condition.


Rail transport has the general advantage of long-haul freight transport. Tanzania has about
3,557 km of rail lines, which are operated by two rail companies: Tanzania Railways Limited
(TRL) and Tanzania Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA). The TRL lines were
constructed during the colonial era in the early 20th century. The construction of the Central
Railway was started in 1905, to Kigoma, a port town situated on Lake Tanganyika, which
was reached in 1914 (e.g., Amin, Willetts and Matheson, 1986). The current TRL was
established as a parastatal company jointly owned by Reli Assets Holding Company
(RAHCO) on behalf of the Government of Tanzania (49 percent) and an Indian private
operator RITES (51 percent) in 2007. However, the anticipated increase in performance
under RITES management did not materialize.1 Since the completion of negotiations in 2011,
the company has fully been owned by the government.


The TRL network is based on a 1,000 mm narrow-gauge standard and extends more than
2,500 km, connecting Dar es Salaam and large inland cities, such as Mwanza, Kigoma and
Arusha. These inland areas are more than 1,000 km away from the coast. Historically, rail
transport has been playing an important role to provide affordable access to the global market
to Tanzania, which is a large country with a land area of about 900,000 km2.


TAZARA is another major rail line connecting Dar es Salaam to Mbeya and New Mposhi in
Zambia. Unlike the TRL, which is primarily a national network with the ends of lines located
at Dar es Salaam and Tanga on the Indican Ocean, Mwanza on Lake Victoria and Kigoma on
Lake Tanganyika, TAZARA is a binational rail network, extending 1,860 km, with 975 km
in Tanzania and 885 km in Zambia (Table 3). TAZARA is a statutory body established under

TAZARA Act No.4 of 1995 (Repealed Act No.23 of 1975) and jointly owned by the two
governments, Tanzania and Zambia, on 50:50 basis. Other neighboring countries, such as
Malawi and Southern Democratic Republic of Congo, which are practically landlocked in the
region, are also benefiting from the TAZARA lines. The network is based on the Cape Gauge
with a width of 1,067 mm, a different standard from TRL. It is relatively new compared to
the TRL lines. TAZARA was constructed in the 1970s. However, the rail infrastructure has
already been in poor condition because of lack of proper maintenance. Recently, the two
governments have agreed to take up responsibility of funding infrastructure maintenance,
locomotives and wagons.2

Given the deterioration of the service quality as well as the improvement of road
infrastructure along the regional corridors, the current freight volume hauled by the TRL
represents only 13 percent of the peak demand in the early 2000s (Figure 5). Similarly, the
traffic on TAZARA is only about 15 percent of its peak demand during the early 1990s
(Figure 6). Despite the deteriorated service quality, some businesses and shippers are still
using rail transport, mainly because of low relative costs compared with road transport. Rail
tariffs have increased in U.S. dollar terms in recent years but are still lower than truck road
user costs in Tanzania, which are US$0.05 to US$0.12 per ton-km, depending on road
surface and condition (Figure 7).

Although truck transportation accounts for the vast majority of freight shipment, some firms
and shippers are still using railways, perhaps depending on location. Particularly, firms
located in inland areas of central and western Tanzania may have an incentive to rely on rail
transportation because it is cheap despite distance. Based on the network analysis in which
unit road user costs and average rail tariffs are assumed, transport costs of moving one ton of
goods to Dar es Salaam are estimated at about US$91 per ton from Mwanza and US$95 per
ton from Kigoma, respectively (Figure 8). Rail transport presumably has the advantage to
connect those areas from the cost perspective.


The advantage of rail freight is considered to be attributed fundamentally to the fact that unit
rail tariffs are often set lower when the shipping distance is longer. For instance, the TRL
                                                        - 10 -




tariff for general goods is TSh1.5 million per large wagon for the first 100 km, which
translates into about 61 U.S. cents per ton-km (Figure 9).3 But when the shipping distance is
greater than 500 km, the tariff is TSh2.6 million per wagon, which is equivalent to about 11
U.S. cents per ton-km. The unit rate is even lower when the distance exceeds 1,000 km, i.e.,
TSh3.9 million per wagon or 8 U.S. cents per ton-km.


Such a pricing strategy is rational because loading and unloading goods from rail wagons
incur significant fixed costs, especially when transported goods are uncontainerized bulk
cargo. Waiting times that are required for each train to have sufficient wagons to carry may
also add additional economic costs to shippers. Because of these fixed costs, short-haul rail
shipping tends to be relatively expensive, and long-haul bulk shippers are more induced to
use rail transportation. Although no detailed data are available, most rail cargo are large
volumes, such as minerals, cement, agricultural products and fertilizer.4 According to the port
statistics, at the Port of Dar es Salaam, wheat accounted for about 40 percent of total imports,
followed by fertilizer, cement and rice (Figure 10). Similarly, wheat and fertilizer are among
major commodities exported through the Port of Dar es Salaam.




3
    Average loaded weight per wagon is assumed to be 36.5 tons.

    This is consistent with our survey data. See the following sections.

III. EMPIRICAL MODEL AND DATA


To examine how firms choose transport modes, the traditional discrete choice model is
considered: Firm i chooses mode m to carry out transaction j if its indirect utility of this
modal choice is greater than the utility of any other transportation mode:


   (m)
U ij    U ij
            (t )
                   for t  m                                  (1)


In our analysis, there are only two modes: m  rail , road . There are four types of
transactions: j  export,import, domestic sales, domestic input . Each firm can use different
transport modes, depending on type of transaction. For instance, firms can use truck transport
to purchase some inputs for production, while relying on rail transport for exporting
products. It may depend on where their trading partners exist and what level of transport
service is required. Note that a firm engages in at least one type of transaction but may not
carry out all transactions.
                                                - 13 -




As usual (e.g., McFadden 1974b), the utility is assumed to comprise a deterministic term, V,
                         (m)
and a random error ε: U ij    Vij( m )   ij
                                             (m)
                                                 . When the error term is distributed according to the

type I extreme value distribution, the probability that a firm chooses mode m is given by:



Pr(Yij  m) 
                                 
                           exp Vij( m )                          (2)
                                        
                      1  t exp Vij( t )


The following linear specification is assumed for the deterministic part:


Vij( m )   0( m )  X ij '  ( m )                              (3)


where Xij contains firm- and transaction-specific characteristics.


Our data were collected by carrying out an enterprise survey in February to May 2016. The
survey aimed at about 500 firms focused on light manufacturers and agribusinesses in major
urban areas of 18 regions.5 Based on the customer databases of the two rail companies as
well as with freight forwarders and clearing agents, firms were randomly selected in each
major urban area. The subsample size was determined in proportion to the size of each city.
In the survey, each firm was asked about not only its basic characteristics, such as year of
establishment and ownership, but also its chosen transport mode and transport spending for
each type of transaction.


As discussed above, only a small number of firms are currently directly using railway
services for shipping their freights, because of the diminished rail operations and the poor
quality of the services. In the current analysis, both direct and indirect rail users are
considered as beneficiaries. Some are directly using rail services, and others have

transactions with freight forwarders and clearing agents that are using rail transportation. In
our data, only 3 percent of firms are road users (Table 4). Relatively speaking, firms are more
likely to use rail transportation for exporting and importing purposes.

In the data, there are 165 pairs of firm location and their trading partners (Table 5). This is
based on the firm location by region. Technically, however, there is a more granular variation
because firm locations are geo-referenced and can be different within the same region. It is
clear that Dar es Salaam is the center of all business relationships in Tanzania. No matter
where firms are located, they tend to have some transactions with other companies in Dar es
Salaam. The table also suggests that geographic proximity matters to businesses. Beside
within city transactions, there are a certain amount of freight movements between two close
locations, such as Mwanza and Kagera, and Arusha and Moshi/Kilimanjaro. From the global
point of view, there are international trade flows from almost all regions. This must generate
the demand for long-haul freight transportation.


Notably, these international shipments may not necessarily be handled at the Port of Dar es
Salaam. There are several important regional border points, such as Rusumo, a border town
between Rwanda and Tanzania, and Tunduma, a border point between Tanzania and Zambia.
A border point can serve not only a direct neighbor but also other countries. For instance,
Rusumo is presumably passed when firms export something to or import from Rwanda,
Uganda and the Democratic Republic Congo (DRC).

Summary statistics of our covariates are shown in Table 6. Transport prices paid by firms
(denoted by PRICE) could be defined in terms of firms’ transport spending per ton-km.
Unfortunately, the quantity or volume of freight transported is not available in our data.
Instead, our transport price variable is defined by the amount of transport spending divided
by the value of shipment and distance from the origin or to the destination. While knowing
the value of shipment may not matter to transport costs, this is the only available proxy.
Firms spent on average TSh174 million or about US$80,000 to ship to transport inputs or
outputs, of which the average value (VALU) is TSh5.4 billion or US$2.4 million.


The distance between the surveyed firms and their business partners is on average 425 km
but has a wide variation from several kilometers to over 2,300 km (denoted by DIST). Note
that this is only measured within Tanzania, up to the Port of Dar es Salaam or other border
points.6 Maritime travel distance and road distance in other countries are ignored because the
paper aims at focusing the firms’ choice between rail and road transport within Tanzania.




6
    Three border points are taken into account: Rusumo, Kasumulu and Tunduma.
                                                        - 17 -




Average speed is defined by the distance divided by the number of days required for that
shipment (SPEED). It is further divided by 24 hours.7


In our sample data, firms are highly heterogeneous.8 Firms vary considerably in terms of age,
market orientation and ownership structure. Surveyed firms were established on average 14
years ago (AGE). The survey also asked firms’ targeted markets: Global, national or local.
The last two market orientations are represented by two dummy variables: NATN and LOCL,
while the global orientation is used as a baseline. The average share of foreign ownership is
12 percent (FORN): Some firms are domestic, and others are fully owned by foreign
investors (i.e., the share is 100 percent). More formally, rail users tend to be more foreign
owned: Based on the firm-level data, the average foreign share is 20.2 percent among rail
users (c.f., 6.1 percent among road users) (Table 7). This is consistent with the fact that rail
users are more focused on the global market: The share of firms responding that their main
markets are local (within their localities) is 85 percent among road users, while 32 percent of
the rail users indicated their local orientation. Rail users are more focused on global and/or
national markets.9 In our sample, rail users are also found relatively larger and more
transport-intensive, meaning the share of transport spending in the total operating cost is
high.




7
  The speed variable defined in this way is obviously underestimated because the normal operating time of rail
or truck transportation is less than 24 hours per day.
8
  From an empirical point of view, the current sample frame may not be ideal because it is significantly
unbalanced. It is not easy to identify clear rail transport users. Still, there is economic potential to (re)develop
rail transportation in large countries, such as Tanzania. Thus, the current study was designed as a potential
baseline for further surveys. As the government is investing in rail (and lake) transport infrastructure, the
follow-up surveys are expected to show more visible impacts of improved rail transport.
9
 While local market orientation is referred to mean that firms’ main product lines are targeted at their local
areas, national market orientation indicates that firms are active in several locations in the country. Global
market oriented firms involve significant amounts of international transactions.

IV. ESTIMATION RESULTS


Multinomial logit regression is performed: The results are shown in Table 8. Road
transportation is used as a baseline. It is found that prices have a negative impact on rail use.
The impact is statistically significant: When rail prices are higher, firms are less likely to
                                               - 19 -




choose rail transportation, holding everything else constant. As expected, rail transport seems
to have the advantage for long-haul shipments. The coefficient of DIST is positive and
significant. It is consistent with the fact that unit rail tariffs are often set lower when the
shipping distance is longer, as described above. Thus, firms are more likely to use rail
transport, as shipping distance becomes longer.


The results also indicate that the choice of transport modes depends on business purposes. By
type of transaction, firms are most likely to use rail transport when they import something
from abroad. The coefficient of IMPT is significantly positive. This is plausible because the
Port of Dar es Salaam is connected to TRL. On the other hand, EXPT also has a positive but
insignificant coefficient. These positive coefficients imply that other domestic shipments
(which are used as a baseline) are more likely to be carried by truck transportation. This is
also consistent with the current alignment of transport infrastructure. Railways primarily
connect the western and eastern parts of the country. However, domestic business
transactions can take place in all directions. Therefore, road transportation has advantage in
this regard.


The negative coefficient of LOCL is also consistent with this view: Firms focused on local
markets do not use rail transportation. But when firms target the national market, they are
more likely to take advantage of freight rail services. The coefficient of NATN is found to be
consistently positive. This is considered to have primarily captured the effect of rail use for
firms in non-primary cities to do business with firms based in Dar es Salaam.

There are two unexpected results in Table 8. First, the speed variable has a statistically
insignificant coefficient. Although our speed variable may have a measurement flaw as
discussed above, it is expected that the better quality of rail services (i.e., faster operating
speed) would increase the probability of firms choosing rail transportation. To examine
sensitivity to functional forms, the quadratic form is assumed: The result is found to be
unchanged (Table 9). Thus, the impact of operating speed of rail transport is inconclusive.
Firms may or may not be motivated to use railways if their operating speed is increased. This
does not mean that efficient rail operations would not be important. Given the current
situation that many firms shifted from rail to road transportation in recent years, it should be
interpreted to mean that our data do not support firms’ particular preferences to shipment
speed when they use rail transport.


Second, the shipment value variable is not significant in Table 8. Our expectation was that
firms would use rail transport for large-volume shipments. Again, our variable is not ideal to
measure this effect, because the value of shipment may not necessarily be the same as the
tonnage of cargo. However, there must be a broad correlation between them. When the
                                                      - 21 -




quadratic form is assumed for VALU, it is found that the probability of using rail transport
increases with the value of shipment in a concave fashion. Under this specification, it is
suggested that large-volume shippers may prefer to use rail transportation. The other results
remain unchanged. Price matters. In addition, traditional firms seem to have a tendency to
ship goods by rail. The coefficient of AGE is positive and significant. New firms prefer to
avoid rail transportation.

To check robustness of the main results above, the alternative-specific conditional logit
(McFadden’s choice) model is also performed. While all firm-specific characteristics are
used as case-specific variables, two alternative-specific variables are created by using
network analysis (as shown in Figure 8). Given the road network condition data as well as
average road user costs and rail tariffs, transport costs (TC) and travel times (HR) are
estimated by minimizing the total transport costs from a firm to the shipping destination.

These engineering estimates can be different between the following two scenarios: (i) only
road transport is assumed, and (ii) both rail and road can be used. The second scenario is
referred to as the modal choice of rail transportation. Technically, even if rail is selected,
road transportation is also generally needed, for instance, to bring products to a close rail
station. TC and HR include all rail and road segments along the optimal route. Not
surprisingly, as shown at the bottom of Table 6, rail transport tends to have lower transport
costs and greater travel times than road transportation.


The results turned out to be broadly unchanged. Transport costs have a negative effect on
shippers’ mode choice: The coefficient of TC is negative and statistically significant (Table
10). Traditional firms are more likely to use rail services, holding everything else constant.

Firms aimed at local markets do not use rail transportation, because their transport demand
may be focused on short haul shipping. Rather, rail transport is more often used for
international trading purposes. Both EXPT and IMPT have significantly positive coefficients.

V. CONCLUSION


Rail transport generally has the advantage for large-volume long-haul freight operations. It
can be a cheaper and greener option than truck transportation. There are a number of studies
analyzing people’s modal choice among road, rail, air and coastal shipping transport,
particularly in the developed country context. It is often found that shipping distance, costs
and reliability are among the most important determinants.


In the literature, however, there is little evidence investigating the modal preferences in
Africa. The region possesses significant rail assets. However, many rail lines are currently
not operational, falling into a vicious circle: Less and less shippers are using rail transport
because the service reliability is low. Available resources for maintenance and investment are
limited since the number of rail users is declining. Because of limited resources, the service
quality continues deteriorating.


This paper examines the shippers’ modal choice in Tanzania with new firm-level data
collected. The traditional multinomial logit and McFadden’s choice models were estimated.
It is shown that rail prices and shipping distance are important determinants of firms’
transport mode choice. With higher rail prices, firms are less likely to choose rail
transportation. In addition, firms are more likely to use rail transport, as shipping distance
and volume become greater. This is consistent with a view that rail transport has the
advantage for long-haul bulk shipments. Which transport mode is used depends on type of
transport demand. Rail transport is often used for international trading purposes. Firms aimed
at local markets may not need rail transportation. Operating speed does not seem to have an
unambiguous effect influencing firms’ modal choice.


The policy implications are straightforward: In order to restore the demand for rail freight, it
is crucial to maintain price competitiveness of rail services against truck transportation.
Firms’ rail use is sensitive to prices. This is consistent with our companion paper (Iimi et al.
2017). Operational efficiency and reliability are of course important from a practical view.

But this may be able to be subordinated. Key customers that rail operators should particularly
focus on include exporters and importers that engage in international trade. Rail
transportation is especially preferred by these companies. It is important to meet the freight
demand for their operations.
