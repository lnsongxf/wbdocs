                   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This volume analyses the importance of State Enterprises and Parastatals (SEPs) in the economy,
with a special focus on fiscal risks from SEPs' operations. The volume explores how the activities
of SEPs such as the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) and Grain Marketing Board (GMB)
contribute to poverty reduction. The volume also reviews corporate governance issues facing SEPs.



KEY CHALLENGES
          Fiscal Issues

          Though more information on the fiscal role of SEPs is now available, there is no clear control
          mechanism for monitoring or controlling explicit budget guarantees to SEPs.

          The overall balance of SEPs within the general government budget is difficult to establish.
          Though the central government is in arrears on payments for a number of services delivered,
          transfers to SEPs have increased and SEP tax liabilities have grown.

          Regulation of tariffs, including political direction of some decisions, has not allowed SEPs to
          cover long-run marginal costs. The subsidies provided through sub-economic tariffs are not
          effectively targeted to reduce poverty.

          The absence of effective oversight has allowed SEPs to build up extensive financial linkages â
          including complex mutual indebtedness â which contribute to systemic risk.

          The employment costs of SEPs, especially of key management, constitute a large share of SEP
          expenditures, and rose from 2011 to 2014.

          Governance Issues

          Governance and oversight of SEPs are shared among a plethora of institutions, without a clear
          demarcation of roles.

          Some SEPs have both operational and regulatory functions, presenting conflicts of interest
          and undermining incentives for performance.

          Corporate governance of SEPs is patchy, with no obvious mechanism for ensuring compliance
          with the existing high-quality National Code for Corporate Governance.



POLICY OPTIONS
          The GoZ could clarify the financial interrelationships between the central government
          budget and SEPs. Annual reports of SEPs should report on payments arrears, outstanding tax
          liabilities, and budget transfers received from the central government. The central governmentâs
          budget should summarize this information, and shed light on transfers between SEPs, and the
          size of quasi-fiscal operations undertaken by them.

          The GoZ might realign employment costs, especially of key management and boards,
          to ensure results-based performance. To complement this, the GoZ could support a clear
          remuneration policy for all SEPs, which gives key benchmarks on remuneration based on the
          financial status of SEPs.

                                                               State Enterprises and Parastatals


Authorities could consolidate and clarify the oversight function of SEPs among relevant
institutions, and clarify the roles of certain SEPs. Authorities might restructure the
institutional framework for SEPs, as the numerous institutions now involved in administering
SEPs risk derailing needed reforms due to overlapping instructions. Authorities might better
separate the regulatory and commercial activities in SEPs to help reduce duplication of duties,
and improve accountability for performance.

The Government could designate an entity â an existing ministry, Agency, or unit, or a
newly created body â to coordinate the reform agenda. The Government could also explore
options for exercising its ownership function. For example, the GoZ might pilot among a sample
of significant commercial SEPs a more centralized ownership approach, which would follow
an increasing trend in other countries.

The GoZ could implement the provisions of the Public Enterprises Corporate Government
Bill (PECG), which might help reduce the financial losses of SEPs. Implementing such
provisions might require additional resources â both in senior decision-making time and
operational staff. Piloting the full implementation of provisions swiftly in a couple of SEPs would
allow the GoZ to assess support needed for scale-up, and potential challenges.

The GoZ could take steps to improve transparency and accountability. For example,
authorities could insist that, as required by the PECG Bill, SEPs begin immediately publishing
annual reports, strategic plans, and progress reports.

The GoZ could improve management of its portfolio of SEPs by establishing a central
database that systematically consolidates performance information on SEPs. Such a database
would allow easier identification of problems, and quicker action on corrective measures.

State Enterprises and Parastatals




     1               INTRODUCTION
State Enterprises and Parastatals play important roles in Zimbabweâs economy. SEPs are active
in major infrastructure areas: energy, transport, communications, and agriculture. In 1980, Zimbabwe
inherited 20 public enterprises thinly spread across sectors, though SEPs have since increased. Despite
efforts since 1990 to privatize SEPs, Zimbabwe today has 107 SEPsÂ¹ and this PER focuses on 38
commercial SEPs that provide public services on a cost recovery or for-profit basis. The non-commercial
are mostly regulators, research boards, and tertiary education institutions Public expenditure on
SEPs funds wage bills, capital investment, and direct subsidies. SEPs operate in a policy environment
with many institutional actors. The State Enterprises Restructuring Agency (SERA), the Office of the
President and Cabinet (OPC), the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED), and line
ministries are directly involved in monitoring SEPs. Line ministries govern most SEPs, as such ministries
administer the Acts establishing these institutions. The OPC has a coordinating role in government
policy and leads on the Corporate Governance Framework. The Ministry of Finance through the
Public Finance Management Act is responsible for assessing the performance of these institutions.
SERA was established in 2004 to replace the Privatization Agency of Zimbabwe. SERAâs functions were
expanded to include not just privatizing and restructuring SEPs, but also assisting in coordinating the
SEPs reform programme.Â²

Though SEPs play a significant role in Zimbabweâs economy, their contribution to GDP has declined.
The contribution of all SEPs to GDP fell to 13.4 percent of GDP in 2014 from 16.8 percent in 2009 (ZIMSTAT,
2016). The contribution of commercial SEPs dropped to 7.7 percent of GDP in 2014 from 9.4 percent in
2012 (World Bank, staff calculation).Â³ In parallel, tax and dividend payments from SEPs declined over
the years.

The GoZ has announced measures to improve SEPs' performance in several national budget
statements. In the 2011 Budget Statement, the GoZ launched the first phase of a reform programme,
targeting ten major enterprises, including the Agricultural Bank of Zimbabwe (AGRIBANK), Air Zimbabwe,
GMB, Cold Storage Commission (CSC), Net-One, Tel-One, Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (ZISCO)
and National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ). In addition, the Minister of Finance announced that the
GoZ is finalising the Corporate Governance Manual for public enterprises. In the 2012 Budget, the GoZ
announced measures to limit ministriesâ use of SEP services without payment, which aimed to contain
SEPsâ risk exposure to government. In the 2013 Budget, the GoZ noted the need to continue restructuring
public enterprises â including 18 public enterprises identified by Cabinet, such as Allied Timbers, Air
Zimbabwe, Agribank and ZESA â through commercialisation, privatisation and other strategies. The GoZ
required all SEPs to comply with provisions of the âCorporate Governance Framework for State Enterprises
and Parastatalsâ. Authorities also announced cascading of Zimbabweâs results based management system
to all SEPs, in line with developments in central government.

In recent years, the GoZ continued to call for better SEP performance. In the 2014 Budget, the
GoZ emphasized the extent to which employment costs crowd out the core business of most public
enterprises. In the 2015 Budget, the GOZ provided resources to conduct audits for SEPs and launched
forensic audits of some SEPs. Further, the GoZ committed to developing turn-around strategies for
the ten priority enterprises to be restructured. In the 2016 Budget, the GoZ highlighted the need to


Â¹ This does not include minority shareholding in some companies or subsidiaries of SEPs. SEPs operate in various market
structures: natural monopolies (such as National Railways of Zimbabwe, NRZ, or the oil pipeline to Beira, NOIC), legal monopoly
(such as the Rural Electrification Agency, or the postal service ZIMPOST), oligopolies (Netone in telecommunications) while the
majority, albeit smaller SEPs, engage in monopolistic competition.

Â³ The data for all SEPs contribution was provided by ZIMSTAT, while data for commercial SEPs was calculated by World Bank
staff from various audited financial statements. The two figures calculated on a slightly different basis, so the contribtion of
non-commercial SEPs cannot be calculated by subtraction.

Enterprises Corporate Governance Bill which, when enacted into law, will establish corporate governance
and performance principles for SEPs, and include a requirement to remit 50 percent of after-tax profits
to the Treasury. The GoZ will carry out performance audits to expedite the reform process. The auditing
exercise is being led by the Office of Auditor General, with financial support from the GoZ.

Data on SEPs is fragmented and often incomplete, but this study is the first of its kind using
various data sources covering multiple years. Until recently, the financial information of SEPs was
only in annual reports, as no central database existed for SEP data. However, SERA was able, with World
Bank support, to collect and establish a baseline database of key financial and performance indicators
of SEPs. For the first time in years, this study uses data from multiple sources, including a newly created
baseline database collected from audited financial statements, fiscal data from the Ministry of Finance,
views and data collected from questionnaires, case studies, and reports of the Auditor General. The study
focuses on only the 38 commercial SEPs in Zimbabwe. The analysis covers from 2011 to 2014, which is
the last year for which audited financial information for most companies was obtainable. Figure 1 and
Annex 1 list the companies and sectors targeted in this analysis.

This volume aims to analyse the importance of Zimbabweâs SEPs in the economy, especially
the fiscal risks from SEPs' operations, and the impacts that SEPs such as ZESA and GMB can have on
poverty reduction.â´ In addition, the volume reviews corporate governance issues for SEPs and offers
policy options.

The volume is organised as follows. Section 2 explores the roles of SEPs. Section 3 examines the
revenue and expenditure trends of SEPs. Section 4 analyses fiscal risks associated with SEPs. Corporate
governance is explored in Section 5, while Section 6 focuses on service delivery and poverty alleviation,
illuminated through case studies of ZESA and GMB.

        2                  IN THE ECONOMY
Some enterprises, especially in energy sector, have captured almost 100 percent market share.
Some SEPs have both commercial and regulatory functions, sometimes resulting in conflicts of interest
and weak accountability. The GoZ embarked on privatisation, commercialization and restructuring of
SEPs to improve performance. In early 2000s, the GoZ intensified its privatization agenda. About 13
SEPs were privatized from 1980 to 2002, and privatization was thinly spread over other years. Most
privatised enterprises were loss making, and they came from several sectors, including agriculture (Cotton
Company of Zimbabwe, Dairy Marketing Board Zimbabwe); financial services (ZIMRE, Commercial Bank
of Zimbabwe); and mining (Munyati mining).




â´ This volume focus only on commercial State enterprises. State Enterprises are entities incorporated under the Companies
Act where the Government holds 100 percent or fewer shares, while a parastatal is a body established by a special Act of
Parliament to carry out a particular undertaking for the benefit of the public.

The average contribution of SEPs to GDP from 2011 to 2014 was 15.3 percent. The contribution
of all SEPs to GDP fell from 17 percent in 2012 to 13.4 percent in 2014.âµ For commercial SEPs, the
contribution fell from 9.4 percent in 2012 to 7.7 percent in 2014 (see Table 1).

Among sectors, energy contributed the most to GDP from 2012 to 2014 (see Figure 2). The energy
sector contributed between 3 and 3.5 percent of GDP during this period, followed by financial services,
which contributed slightly above 1 percent each year.




âµ The data for all SEPsâ value added is from ZIMSTAT. For Commercial SEPs, data was calculated by World Bank Staff.
â¶ Since figures for all SEPs are calculated on a different basis from those for commercial SEPs, the contribution of non-commercial
SEPs cannot be calculated by subtraction. Figures for all SEPs use total stocks, rather than the changes in stocks, in estimating
Value Added.

The contribution of SEPs to employment has declined since 2011. The number of people that SEPs
employed fell by about seven percent from about 44,000 in 2011 to 41,000 in 2014 (See Figure 3).
The downward trend was driven by a difficult economic environment, leading some SEPs to retrench.
From 2011 to 2014, SEPs accounted for about five percent of total formal employment in Zimbabwe,
and about 18 percent of public sector employment.

Transport provided the most employment among sectors, though the number of transport
employees has declined since 2011. The decline in the number of employees in transport is partly
due to poor performance, especially in road passenger and rail transportation. The energy sector
had the second highest number of employees, and employment in energy gradually increased from
2011 to 2014. Only energy and mining showed persistent annual increases in employees since 2011.

Very few SEPs pay dividends to the Government. Paid dividends increased between 2012 and
2013, before declining heavily in 2014 (see Figure 4). The mining sector contributed the most dividend
payments. Of the 38 commercial SEPs, only two enterprises declared dividends in 2014.

Transfers from the state are higher than dividends declared by companies. For example, the
Government in 2013 received only about US$44 million in paid dividends, but the state transferred
US$156 million to SEPs. In 2014, transfers were markedly lower than previous years, with the bulk of
the transfers directed to two enterprises satisfying a public service obligation: the Zimbabwe National
Water Authority (ZINWA), and the GMB, the latter arguably for the public policy goal of sustaining a
Strategic Grain Reserve.â·

The contribution of commercial SEPs to tax revenues declined over the full period (see Figure 5).
In nominal terms, taxes from SEPs as a percent of total government revenue and GDP have trended
downward, reflecting a declining contribution of SEPs to the fiscus. SEPs paid taxes of more than US$20
million in the first three years, but only US$15.6 million in 2014. The SEPs contributing the most taxes
were in energy, dominated by taxes from petrol companies.

Accumulated tax liabilities of SEPs exceeded their paid taxes. SEPsâ tax compliance is low, with
accumulated tax liabilities in 2014 of US$42.1 million, against paid taxes of only US$15.6 million (see
Figure 5). As percent of GDP, paid taxes were below 20 percent of GDP, while tax liabilities were over
25 percent except in 2012.

       3               REVENUE &
                       EXPENDITURE TRENDS
The net income of commercial SEPs, after interest and depreciation but before paying taxes,
has been negative since 2012 (see Figure 7). Losses, in aggregate, were close to 10 percent of
turnover in 2014 â against close to zero in 2011. Of the 38 commercial SEPs, 24 reported losses in
2014, compared with 26 in 2011, when the portfolio as a whole broke even. 14 SEPs ran losses each
year from 2011 to 2014.

In aggregate, SEPs are accumulating losses and losing equity value, thereby posing fiscal and
macroeconomic risks. The profit of SEPs before other comprehensive income has been negative
across the years (see Figure 8). Losses increased from US$20 million in 2011 to US$285 million in
2014. As a percent of GDP, losses increased from 0.2 percent in 2011 to 2 percent in 2014. A sector
breakdown shows that financial services has operated at a profit since 2011, mainly driven by NASA.
The mining sector recorded a surplus in 2011 and 2012, but thereafter operated at a loss.

The losses of commercial SEPs are caused by many factors, including poor corporate management,
the Governmentâs failure to pay for services rendered, and sub-optimal prices. The Government
owes money to most SEPs for utility bills and other costs, especially in energy, which undermines the
viability of these SEPs. The continued existence of SEPs has relied on inefficient and unwise strategies,
including growing arrears to private sector operators, and the Governmentâs issuance of T-Bills.

Revenue Trends
Gross income (total revenue) increased from 2011 to 2013, but declined in 2014. This followed a
decline in revenues in the energy sector, the largest revenue contributor. Revenue in the energy sector
increased from US$1.2 billion in 2011 to US$1.8 billion in 2013, before dropping slightly to US$1.6

billion in 2014. Gross revenue was above 20 percent of GDP across the years, but has declined since
2012 (see Figure 9).

Revenue grew in financial services and postal and telecommunication from 2011 to 2014. In
contrast, sectors such as mining saw revenue increase in 2011 and 2012, but fall in 2013 and 2014 (see
Figure 9). The decline in mining revenue was driven by significant reduction in diamond production
and sales.

Though SEPs have accumulated tax arrears, the Government continues to pay transfers to them.
The easy access of SEPs to transfers limits their incentives to maintain tight budgets and prudent
controls. The Government paid and maintained an upward trend on capital transfers (see Figure 10).
These transfers contributed to the fiscal deficits experienced over the period.

Expenditure Trends
Total expenditure has trended upward, even in 2014 when total revenue declined. Total
expenditure and employment costs rose from 2011 to 2014. Employment costs as percent of total
expenditure increased from 19.7 percent in 2012 to 21.1 percent in 2014 (see Figure 11).

Board costs and remuneration to key management staff have trended upward since 2011.
Recurrent expenditure thus makes up a large share of the total expenditure of SEPs. The increase in
Board costs is partly driven by CEOs and Boards, which in many cases set their own remuneration,
while ignoring legal provisions on maximum remuneration. Such practices testify to Zimbabweâs weak
oversight structure, and imbalances in accountability and reporting. Though the Auditor General has
noted the high salaries of some CEOs, the GoZ has not acted promptly to fix this problem permanently.

The energy, agriculture, and financial services sectors trended upward in Board costs,
notwithstanding these sectorsâ poor performance and sometimes failure to provide key services. The
sharp decline in Board costs in mining is because certain SEPs, for example ZMDC, operated without
a Board in the first quarter of 2014 (see Figure 12).

An analysis of the relation between remuneration and revenue performance in sectors from
2011 to 2014 reveals varying performance, and a risk that staff in underperforming sectors
may be excessively rewarded (see Figure 13). For example, remuneration in energy and agriculture
were in a similar range, but annual revenues in energy of more than US$1 billion were more than
double those in agriculture. In addition, profits in agriculture were negative during this period. Such
factors suggest that personnel in agriculture may be overly remunerated compared with their peers
in other sectors. Linkages between revenue and Board costs were less clear: in energy from 2013
revenue declined as Board costs increased, while in the financial sector from 2013 revenue increased
as Board costs declined.

        4               FISCAL RISKS FROM
                        S TA T E E N T E R P R I S E S
The SEPs are major sources of fiscal risks, and consistently threaten Zimbabweâs public finances.
Fiscal risks stem from the costs of sub-economic tariffs, subsidies, debts, state guarantees, and unpaid
taxes. Such costs burden the government budget (see Annex 2 for a further explanation), and result
in unsustainable debt levels â both for legacy and new debt.

Though SEPsâ total assets are greater than total liabilities, their current assets are less than
current liabilities. This current ratio, less than one, signifies an inability of companies to meet short-
term financial obligations from current assets (see Figure 14).

                       Source: Audited Financial Statement: Data compiled by World Bank Staff


Many SEPs are illiquid (25 of 38 in 2014), and a few are insolvent and illiquid (7 in 2014). Overall,
the portfolioâs current net asset (working capital) position is precarious, raising questions about the
financial status and sustainability of several SEPs, and their ability to be going concerns in the medium
term. (see Table 2). Though total net assets are positive, part of the increase in assets comes from
non-operational activities, such as revaluation of existing assets (e.g., dams), making it difficult to
validate the true value of assets.

State guarantees are a major source of fiscal risks for the GoZ. Contingent liabilities for SEPs are
both explicit and implicit. Explicit refers to debt guaranteed by the GoZ, while implicit refers to the
expectation that the GoZ may bail out distressed SEPs. The main source of explicit contingent liabilities
are external creditors. The largest creditors of the external debt of SEPs are the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), Kreditanstalt Fur Wiederaufbau (KFW)â¸and China Exim
Bank. Currently, state guarantees are managed by the Debt Management Office in the MoFED. The
Debt Management Office operates within the framework set out by the Public Debt Management Act.
The Act states that the Office should assess the risks in issuing state guarantees, and monitor and
report on any implicit and explicit public sector contingent liabilities. The Public Debt Management Act
states the conditions under which state guarantees are to be issued and procedures for repayment.â¹

Explicit contingent liabilities have trended upward since 2011. These are liabilities explicitly
guaranteed by the Government. Generally explicit contingent liabilities range from 11 percent to 13
percent of GDP (see Figure 15). These guarantees are a source of fiscal risks, as most SEPs do not have
capacity to pay back debt as they operate perennially at a loss. In practice, guarantees are seemingly
granted on an ad hoc basis, without clear ceilings, thresholds, and objective criteria. Moreover, some
SEPs offer assets as security for new loans, thus further undermining their balance sheets, and adding
to fiscal risks.

The energy sector had the highest explicit contingent liabilities, which nearly doubled from
2011 to 2014. The other two sectors with high contingent liabilities are transport and postal and
telecommunication (see Figure 16). The expansion of these contingent liabilities are a result of increased
investment in infrastructure in these sectors funded by external loan financing, guaranteed by the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. The energy sector also maintained a lead in implicit
liabilities, which ranged from US$178 million in 2011 to US$191 million in 2014, followed by the industry
and commerce sector, which was below US$ 65 million for the whole period.

Less easily quantified explicit contingent liabilities include demand guarantees offered in Joint
ventures. Where a contract or Joint Venture agreement is supported by undertakings on demand
levels (e.g. for power or road usage), Government may face an unpredictable obligation to make up
any shortfall in revenue.

The inter-linkages among SEPs through inter-SEP debts amplify fiscal risks and hinder economic
adjustment. From 2011 to 2014, related party loans payable were higher than related party loans
receivable.Â¹â° Figure 17 suggests poor payment discipline between SEPs on receivables and payables.
Fiscal risks are higher as companies always borrow more than they pay out, and, in aggregate,
commercial SEPs are in perennial deficit. There is no legislation guiding the loans between the SOEs,
and much of the linkage is due to debts on services rendered. There are also some SOEs which hold
shares in other SOEs.

Disaggregating by sector, the energy sector dominates in related party loans payable and party
loans receivable. Mining and postal and telecommunication also have high shares of both. From 2012,
agriculture had more loans payable than loans receivable. The environment, health and financial
services sectors had loans receivable, but almost zero on loans payable.




Â¹â° Related party loans payable are loans that SEPs need to pay to other SEPs, while related party receivables are loans that SEPs
expect to receive from other SEPs.

Many SEPs engage in quasi-fiscal activities, which creates substantial fiscal risks and undermines
fiscal consolidation. Quasi-fiscal activities are activities outside normal budget operations. For
example, in energy ZESA may charge below market prices and even below long-run marginal costs.
In some cases, SEPs are forced to engage in politically-induced donations. Quasi-fiscal activities are
not included in the budget, which therefore understates the true impacts of government policy on
the economy.

                        AUTHORITY AND GRAIN MARKETING BOARD


To reduce poverty, the GoZ plays a key role in providing electricity and marketing grain. The
Government implements some policies to improve social welfare through SEPs. For example, the GoZ
facilitates access to and use of affordable electricity through the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority
(ZESA), and maintains a strategic grain reserve while stabilising grain prices for farmers through the
GMB. This section reviews the contributions of these two SEPs to poverty reduction.

Electricity: ZESA
ZESA has the largest market share for electricity in Zimbabwe. Until recently, the State has
enjoyed a monopoly over electricity generation and transmission through ZESA, whose subsidiaries â
the Zimbabwe Electricity and Transmission Company (ZETDC) and Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC)
â are responsible for power transmission and generation, respectively. Despite recent private sector
participation in the sector, particularly in energy generation, ZESA still commands a lionâs share of the
energy market, and still monopolizes transmission and distribution.

ZESA has been operating at a loss since 2012, and its poor performance is partly due to corporate
governance challenges, which also affect its subsidiaries (see Figure 18). ZETDC operated without
a Board of Directors since June 2015.With regards to ZPC, the CEOâs tenure of office is indefinite, and
the performance agreement with the Government is still in draft form. The absence of a performance
agreement tying remuneration to performance does not create demand for improved performance
by the senior management. These governance challenges are not peculiar to the electricity sector but
are common to the whole SEP portfolio in Zimbabwe.

Zimbabweâs electricity tariffs are below ZESAâs long-run marginal cost (LRMC) levels and the
regional average, which contributes slightly, if inefficiently, to poverty reduction.Â¹Â¹ Tariffs are
pegged at US9,86c per KWh â compared to a regional average of US14c per KWh.

Suboptimal tariffs resulted in losses for ZESA, which affect service delivery. ZESA incurred
losses of US$517 million between 2009 and 2016, despite the GoZâs allocating to it SDRs withdrawn
from the IMF in 2010. In September 2013, the GoZ wrote off customer debts to ZESA of over US$80
million. This resulted in further deterioration of collection rates. As of September 2016, debts stood at
US$987 million, part of which had been accumulated since 2013. ZESA is owed significant money by its
customers: mining companies owe US$52 million, manufacturing US$210 million, and other commercial
consumers US$436 million. Domestic consumers owe US$294 million and farmers US$84 million.

Despite the suboptimal tariffs, only 31 percent of the two bottom quintiles of Zimbabweâs
population has access to the electricity (see Table 4). Most poor people are still off the grid, while
about 82 percent of the richest quintile have access to electricity. Access to electricity is an important
determinant to health outcomes, and associated with improved educational outcomes.Â¹Â² In addition,
electricity contributes to improved productivity of individuals and firms, leading to economic growth.
Access to and use of electricity is important for poverty reduction, particularly for rural populations,
which in most cases expand opportunities for income generation.

The poor spend more on electricity than the rich. Table 5 shows that the bottom forty percent
dedicate slightly more of their total consumption expenditures to electricity than everyone else. Though
slight, this imbalance does not contribute to poverty reduction.

Â¹Â¹ In 1991, the Ministry of Finance agreed with the World Bank on a phased programme of electricity tariff adjustments with the
objective of attaining long-run marginal cost (LRMC) levels by 1995/96. The target was later moved to 2000, after several revisions
and updates to the System Development Plans. However, successive Ministers of Energy have until today not implemented
the LRMC tariff programme.
Â¹Â² Electricity is strongly associated with improvements in adult literacy and primary school completion rates, because it enables
reading and studying in the evening and early morning hours (Barnes 1988; Brodman 1982; Foley 1990; Venkataraman 1990).

The GoZ has provided subsidies to ZESA to increase the poorâs access to electricity. Poor
households spend less in absolute terms compared with the rich (see Table 6). To achieve its objective
of universal access to electricity, the GoZ has spent tax revenue and SDRs on loans and capital,
respectively, for ZESA.Â¹Â³ These subsidies ensure that ZESA continues to provide comparatively cheap
electricity, in effect augmenting the purchasing power of citizens. There is, however, no targeting,
and the subsidy is applied to everyone regardless of income, so richer households capture more of
the subsidy than poorer households. Subsidies can also lead to inefficiencies in using resources that
hobble efforts to expand and improve service delivery.Â¹â´ Total grants and loans to ZESA between 2011
and 2015 amounted to US$59.8 million, made up of domestic lending of US$46.8 million between
2011 and 2012, and an allocation of SDRs in 2010 amounting to US$13 million.

Grain Marketing Board (GMB)
The GMB has a large share of the grain market, and commercial and non-commercial mandates.
Established in 1931, the GMB is governed by the GMB Act, which is outdated and does not capture all
of the GMBâs current mandates. The GMBâs non-commercial mandate is to maintain a Strategic Grain
Reserve. Its commercial mandate encompasses packaging (the Silo brand) and producing stock feeds
(the Country Feed brand). The Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-Economic Transformation
(ZimAsset) notes that âin order to stimulate agricultural productivity and safeguard food security, Government
will recapitalize and capacitate the Grain Marketing Board (GMB)â. In addition, ZimAsset notes that food
relief for vulnerable social groups will be taken from stocks in GMB depots. As such, the Government
is selling maize to vulnerable social groups at a subsidized price of 65 percent of the market price.
Such subsidies compounded by poor corporate governance have made GMB a perennial loss-maker
(see Figure 19).

Poor corporate governance detracts from the GMBâs performance. Poor corporate governance is
epitomized by a Board Chairman who is appointed by the line ministry, while board members are not
required to sign confidentiality undertakings or performance agreements. Other weaknesses include
no clear indication of key performance indicators monitored by the line ministry, and failure to meet
the statutory deadline for financial reporting The GMB has significant accounts owed to and from other
SEPs and the central government, and there is no compliance with the PFM Act and Audit Office Act.Â¹âµ




Â¹Â³ Special Drawing Rights (SDR) is an international reserve asset, created by the IMF to supplement its member countries' official
reserves. SDRs have been lent to SEPs by the Government.

Zimbabwe is consistently food insecure, though the Government understands that food security
is important to the health and productivity of the poorest citizens. Zimbabweâs 2014/15 agricultural
season registered a 51 percent decline in maize production compared with the 2013/14 season, in
the wake of El Nino-induced drought. According to the July 2015 report of the Zimbabwe Vulnerability
Assessment Committee (ZimVAC), the drought resulted in 1.5 million people â 16 percent of the rural
populationÂ¹â¶ â having insufficient means to meet their minimum food needs during the 2015/16 season.
This number represented a 164 percent increase in people facing food insecurity from 2013/14, but
was only a little above the five-year average for Zimbabwe. Consistent food insecurity has resulted in
high chronic under-nutrition, despite some recent improvements.Â¹â·

The Government has subsidized GMB in its bid to ensure food security. The Government seeks
to improve price and income stability for producers, guarantee disposal of surplus production, and
maintain a strategic grain reserve.Â¹â¸ Achieving these goals comes at large cost to the Government,
which continuously subsidizes the losses of GMB. In line with ZimAsset, the Government provided

The GMB consistently buys maize at above market prices, and sometimes sells maize below
its purchase price, thereby contributing to poverty reduction. For example, the GMB in 2016 has
offered to buy domestic white corn at a much better price (US$390 per tonne) than the private sector
(US$220 â US$308 per tonne). After buying maize at US$390 per tonne, the GMB was instructed by
the Government to sell maize from May 2016 at US$300 per tonne, which was down from the market
price of US$460 per tonne. This approach responded to a 70-80 percent increase in maize prices on
the market.

These sub-optimal prices contribute to the GMBâs poor performance, which affects food
security. The GMB delayed payments to farmers for maize from the 2014/15 crop, thereby eroding
farmersâ power to purchase inputs for the 2015/16 season, and their capacity to produce more in
the coming season.

                             GOVERNANCE OF SEPs
The relative failure of SEPs partly stems from weak corporate governance of SEPs. This section
presents the main findings of a corporate governance assessment of 38 SEPs from a sample of 40
selected by the GoZ. The section is based on a distributed questionnaire that followed OECD Guidelines
on corporate governance of SEPs, and local corporate governance requirements.Â¹â¹ Data collection
work was done with World Bank support under the ZIMREF Trust Fund.

The questionnaires assessed the following corporate governance practices among commercial SEPs:

A. Corporate governance requirements: legal framework, regulatory and international good practice
requirements
B. Capacity: quality of the board and management, and the entityâs environment
C. Compliance: audit, regulation, monitoring, disclosure, and enforcement of requirements

Line ministries continue to play a major role in SEP management. Findings from the questionnaires
show that the Boards of all commercial SEPs were appointed by line ministries. Yet the current
appointment process does not adhere to basic corporate governance requirements on Board
composition. This process has resulted in relatively weak Boards, leading to insufficient oversight.
Though improving, the transparency and financial reporting of SEPs remain problematic. Weak Boards
and inadequate transparency have eroded performance, and led to a âsoft budget constraintâÂ²â°, which
encourages managerial interference by ministries. In addition, managers from SEPs lack information
on good practices and how to implement principles of good corporate governance.Â²Â¹ These factors,
coupled with resistance from key staff to implement reforms, has contributed to corporate governance
failures in some SEPs. Poor performance seems to be the result of frequent political interventions; poor
oversight; and weak Boards and corporate governance, which has led to a vicious circle (see Figure 20).

Zimbabwe currently has no overarching legislation governing the corporate governance of SEPs.
A Bill on corporate governance for public entities may be adopted relatively soon. Once approved,
the Public Enterprises Corporate Governance Bill will provide such legislation. This Bill accounts for
most international good practices, and is largely based on the high-quality National Code of Corporate
Governance. This Code was and remains an initiative providing corporate governance standards for
the public and private sectors, but is voluntary, and has not been used or adopted by SEPs. This Bill
is necessary to translate the content of the Code into law and make it mandatory for SEPs. If enacted
and complied with effectively, this Bill should enhance accountability and transparency in the public
enterprises sector. In parallel, authorities will need to strengthen institutions that enforce relevant
practices. International best practices point to clear mandates between oversight institutions of SEPs




Â²â° This concept was developed by Kornai to describe state-owned enterprises in socialist countries, and their tendency to be
recapitalized and increasingly subsidized/financed by the state. See Kornai, JÃ¡nos (1986), âThe Soft Budget Constraintâ, Kyklos,

The SEP oversight environment lacks clarity among its multiple actors: line ministries,
SERA, the OPC, and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. The roles of each
of these institutions need to be clarified and communicated to those exercising these functions.
It is important to ensure there are no oversight gaps or duplicated responsibilities. Additionally,
some institutions, like OPC and SERA, need assistance to build their capacity in key operational
areas (particularly IT) to improve their effectiveness.

Most ownership entities do not receive sufficient relevant information on SEPs' operations
on a timely and regular basis. Many of the other SEPs fail to meet reporting deadlines, and
otherwise suffer from poor transparency and insufficient disclosure by management. Ownership
entities may unduly interfere in SEPs' operations, or be too passive in exercising oversight, which
may contribute to poor performance.

Zimbabweâs SEPs have loopholes undermining the operations of boards of directors. Thirty
percent of assessed SEPs either had no Board charter or no code of ethics. SEPs suffer from other
problems related to Boards: entities operating for extended periods without full Boards; Board
memberships shifting with changes in line ministers; Boards having inappropriate balances of skills;
inadequate Board training; and inadequately managed conflicts of interest. A study by Wushe,
Shenje and Dingiswayo (2015) found such results and others.Â²Â³ The authors showed that some
members sit on too many Boards (up to seven among sampled companies), and do not have the
required professional expertise. International best practices suggest professionalising Boards,
along with supporting effective policies for appointing Board members, formal evaluations of
members, and in many cases the independence of Board members. The effectiveness of a Board
relies on its structure and composition, which are not always optimized. Many Boards are not
effective because members are appointed without considering their independence or the balance
of skills and experiences, without professional criteria for selecting and removing Board members,
and without mechanisms for replacing Board members in a timely fashion.

A common weakness of SEP management is that CEOs feel more accountable to line ministries
than to Boards. This tendency was observed in all assessed SEPs. To ensure good SEP governance,
the CEO must be accountable to their Board, insulated from political interferences, and required
to implement a strategic plan that makes clear CEO and Board objectives.

Performance contracts are not well defined in SEPs. Performance contracts exist (see Figure 21),
but are based on inadequate data and reporting, and usually do not include quantitative indicators,
which makes it difficult to measure or dispute expected outcomes. Moreover, some contracts lack
clarity not only on financial and non-financial indicators, but also the entity in charge of monitoring.
The frequency of monitoring is not always clear. In contrast, international good practice suggests
signing and implementing performance contracts between ownership institutions and Boards, to
include indicators and targets making clear the success (or failure) of CEOs and Boards.

Most SEPs lack fiscal and financial discipline. Of the 38 assessed SEPs, 17 continue to rely on direct
and indirect state support through subsidies, recapitalizations, or guarantees. The separation between
SEPsâ commercial and non-commercial objectives is not always clear. Overall, SEPs have not achieved
financial discipline, and represent an increasing drain on the fiscus. International best practice suggests
improving SEPsâ financial discipline by reducing direct and indirect support; separating commercial and
non-commercial objectives; and providing SEP management flexibility in various areas (e.g. human
resource management).

Many SEPs still need to improve transparency and disclosure. Nearly all assessed SEPs did not
meet financial reporting statutory deadlines, and their financial reports or annual reports were not
posted on public websites. Some SEPs selectively applied the law. For example, some State Enterprises
incorporated as companies are supposed to comply with the Companies Act and the PFM Act. However,
some entities did not comply with the PFM Act, and wrongly argued that this Act does not apply to
them. Others claimed ignorance of the Actâs existence. A large number of the SEPs do not hold Annual
General Meetings.
