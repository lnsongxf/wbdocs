Strengthening Urban Resilience in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area




Foreword


        Ghana is making important strides toward fostering resilient cities that ensure the safety of citizens
        and create thriving and vibrant communities. It is estimated that 65 percent of the Ghanaian
        population will live in urban areas by 2030. Cities are places where people, assets, economic activities
        and connections to other countries and cities come together. The process of urbanization in Ghana
        has contributed to economic growth and human prosperity, and remains an opportunity to create
        cities that may lift many people out of poverty and establish Ghana as the gateway to West Africa.
        At the same time, however, Ghana’s rapid urbanization and the creation of new urban settlements
        also pose unique challenges in relation to planning, service provision and management, and hence
        requires sustained policy effort and attention. If not attended, the development gains associated with
        urbanization can be gradually reversed.

        The Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), along with Kumasi, continues to be a dominant urban
        center. GAMA has a population of 4.6 million people (more than 16 percent of Ghana’s population),
        and is also acknowledged as one of the fastest-growing city regions in West Africa, with a large
        concentration of people, investments and economic activities. Nonetheless, GAMA is exposed to
        recurrent shocks and stresses on top of numerous developmental challenges and climate change
        issues that threaten development gains. The deadly floods of June 2015 are a reminder that creating a
        resilient and inclusive city must be a priority at all government levels.

        As a first step, the Government of Ghana approached the World Bank in 2015 to undertake the
        CityStrength Diagnostic. The objective of the CityStrength Diagnostic was to engage a wide range of




x
stakeholders across Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) in GAMA and other
government agencies to jointly identify the root causes of the many shocks and stresses confronting
the GAMA region and identify priority actions and investment to address them.

This report summarizes the outcomes of the process and outlines the recommendations that
were identified jointly by national and local stakeholders in Ghana and World Bank specialists.
Furthermore, the report provides evidence that can be leveraged by the Government to request
further support from the World Bank and other development partners to implement follow-up
actions.

The overarching message of this report is that actions are needed now to better manage and
mitigate the risks and exposure of Accra to climate change and the associated shocks and stresses,
gravely affecting the economy, key sectors, and the lives of households and families. Without any
action, Accra remains exposed to significant and recurrent hazards, with a risk of diminishing the
development gains made over the last decades. Therefore, as Government moves forward to take
action on this challenge, this report provides a concrete and detailed forward-looking strategy
that may guide and inform policy and budget decisions, and thus eventually leading to a thriving,
inclusive and more resilient Greater Accra Metropolitan Area.

                                   	 Investing in Urban Resilience
                                   The Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA) is one of the
                                   fastest-growing city regions in West Africa. The metro
                                   area is home to 4.6 million people; more than 16 percent
                                   of Ghana’s 2016 total population. The regional economy
                                   accounts for about 25 percent of the national Gross
                                   Domestic Product (GDP), dominates formal and informal
                                   urban employment (32 and 28 percent, respectively), 1 and
                                   is the least poor region in the country, with the incidence
                                   of poverty (5.6 percent) lower than the national average
                                   (24 percent). 2

                                   However, the unprecedented population growth and
                                   unplanned spatial expansion have exceeded the capacity
                                   of the city to keep up. GAMA faces housing shortages,
                                   urban sprawl, and informal settlements unconnected to
                                   essential city services and infrastructure; traffic congestion
                                   can slow the city to a halt. These challenges make the city
                                   susceptible to natural and man-made disasters including
                                   floods, sea-level rise, fire, disease outbreaks, and building
                                   collapse. The effects of climate change will exacerbate
                                   these vulnerabilities, increasing the frequency and intensity
                                   of floods and driving rural-urban migration because of
                                   drought in the northern parts of the country.

                                   The June 2015 floods demonstrated the urgent need for
                                   urban resilience in the Accra region. Continuous rainfall
                                   led to a devasting flood, also reported as among the
                                   ten deadliest disasters worldwide in 2015.3 The floods
                                   affected 52,622 people and also caused leakage at a
                                   filling station, resulting in an explosion that left 150
                                   casualties.4 Beyond the toll on human life, damages to
                                   housing, transport, water and sanitation totaled US$55
                                   million, while the rebuilding costs were estimated at

    The Government formed a steering committee of agencies in the GAMA region to guide the exercise according
    to nine priority sectors. These include: Urban Development, Land Management and Housing; Disaster Risk
    Management; Urban Finance; Transport and Roads; Water Supply and Sanitation; Solid Waste Management;
    Drainage and Coastal Zone Management; Community Development and Social Protection; and Food Security
    and Agriculture. Urban Development and Housing; Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change; Social and
    Community Development; Solid Waste and Basic Sanitation; Transport; Water and Sewerage; Urban/Municipal

    workshops with representatives from key Ministries, the 16 MMDAs, and development partners; and field visits and
    hazard mapping. Facilitated by a team from theWorld Bank, city stakeholders identified the key shocks and stresses
    that most affect GAMA as well as key actions to address them.

I. THE CASE FOR INVESTING IN
   URBAN RESILIENCE IN GHANA
    Ghana has been undergoing a significant structural transformation over the past
    nearly 30 years. From 1984 to 2013, Ghana’s national population more than doubled,
    while its urban population more than tripled, from under 4 million to nearly 14
    million people.12 Urbanization has yielded many positive outcomes associated
    with increased productivity and economies of scale, helping to create jobs, increase
    human capital, decrease poverty, and expand opportunities, in the process improving
    living conditions for millions of Ghanaians. However, Ghana now faces key challenges
    to ensure that urbanization continues to complement growth by strengthening
    resilience, rather than loosing development gains to natural and man-made disasters.
    Many emerging problems are related to urbanization, natural and man-made
    disasters, and climate change, especially in the context of urban areas. In this context,
    Ghana finds itself in need to enhance its urban resilience.


    1. What is Urban Resilience?

    Resilience 13 is the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and
    systems to survive, adapt, and grow regardless of the changes and challenges they
    experience. A resilient city is capable of adapting to a variety of chronic stresses and
    acute shocks while still providing essential services to its residents, especially the poor
    and vulnerable. Resilience works toward long-term sustainability objectives—meeting
    the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
    their own needs.14 Resilience is also about learning to live within the spectrum of risks
    that exist at the interface between people, the economy, and the environment. Where
    sustainability aims to put the world back into balance, resilience looks for ways to
    manage in an imbalanced world. 15

    Thriving cities can drive national economic growth and innovation and act as cultural
    and creative centers. However, urbanization, especially when rapid and unplanned, also
    brings challenges. The concentration of people, assets, and infrastructure in urban areas
    means that an increasingly complex range of shocks and stresses can jeopardize the
    well-being of large numbers of people and hard-won development gains. In addition to

3.	 Consultation workshops—May 2016:
    A two-day workshop was organized
    in May 2016 in Accra to further assess
    resilience in each of the 16 MMDAs and in
    each of the sectors. The objectives of the
    workshops were to engage with a wide
    range of stakeholders (government officials,
    academic institutions, Non-Governmental
    Organizations (NGOs), and development
    partners) to: (i) identify, map and further
    explore the shocks and stresses in GAMA; (ii)
    present the findings of the pre-diagnostic
    phase and obtain validation from local
    stakeholders; (iii) fill in information gaps; and
    (iv) prioritize the challenges in sectors and
    MMDAs and brainstorm about the required
    actions to address them.

	   Due to the large number of MMDAs
    participating in the exercise, the discussions,
    facilitated by World Bank specialists, were
    grouped in four clusters of MMDAs based
    on locational proximity, spatial-economic
    characteristics, historical and administrative
    relationships, and common watershed
    areas. Concrete outputs from the workshop
    included: (i) hot spot maps developed by
    the MMDAs with guidance from World Bank
    staff; and (ii) presentations from each of
    the sectors and clusters of MMDAs with
    the identified shocks and stresses, current
    level of resilience, and priority actions
    and potential implementing bodies. The
    assessment of resilience was done against
    the five characteristics of resilience in the
    methodology: coordination, inclusiveness,
    reflectiveness, redundancy, and robustness.

II. RESILIENCE CHALLENGES
    IN GAMA
 The Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA) has long been a dominant urban center
 due to its concentration of assets, economic activities, and government. GAMA is also
 a destination for rural migration linked to economic opportunities and a better quality
 of life. In recent decades, GAMA has become one of the fastest-growing metropolitan
 areas in West Africa. Urbanization has far outpaced planning and available services
 and infrastructure, with implications for the inclusion and living conditions of the
 residents. Low-income communities, in particular, find themselves living in informal and
 overcrowded housing with limited or no access to urban services. This haphazard urban
 development represents a challenge for the city. Furthermore, GAMA faces a number of
 shocks and stresses that impact the city due to its lack of capacity to withstand them.
 Flooding events, fire outbreaks and diseases continue to bring GAMA to an economic
 and social halt. These issues are predicted to exacerbate as a result of the effects of
 climate change.

                               Although flooding events and their impacts are not systematically documented by the
                               MMDAs, it is estimated that flooding occurs during all rainy seasons, from March to June
      Flooding
                               or July. The most recent flooding event on June 3rd, 2015 was the deadliest, leaving 150
                               casualties and affecting 52,000 people.
                               Cholera outbreaks were reported by many MMDAs as happening every year. Between June
                               2014 and February 2015, 20,500 cholera cases were recorded in the Greater Accra region with
      Cholera
                               121 fatalities. Open defecation, lack of access to adequate sanitation solutions, and limited
                               drainage network have contributed to cholera outbreaks.
                               All MMDAs noted rising exposure to fire. On average, three big fires are reported in a year.
      Fire                     Major causes are electrical and gas faults, illegal connections and/or unsafe cooking

  	 Although recently banned, the construction sector relied heavily on the use of coastal sand and pebbles from the coastal areas of GAMA when
    constructing buildings, houses, bridges and roads. Despite the ban, this practice continues as a form of sand theft, directly causing erosion.

  	 Representatives of TMA and KKDA at the pre-diagnostic workshop also indicated they believed the construction of sea-defense walls in nearby
    coastal communities has transferred the tidal pressure of the sea to their coastlines, resulting in the increasing rate of coastal erosion being
    recorded within their jurisdictions.

III. ASSESSMENT OF RESILIENCE
OF URBAN SYSTEMS
  Introduction and Overview

  In this chapter, the findings of the sectoral assessments of resilience are presented.
  The sectoral specialists and local stakeholders conducted the assessments jointly,
  based on information collected as part of the pre-diagnostic phase and discussed
  collectively during the consultation workshops. The performance of each sector was
  measured against the five characteristics of resilience included below. The process at
  the sectoral level was intended to provide participants with a better understanding
  of strengths and weaknesses in each of the sectors and their linkages with other
  systems. These insights served as input into the overall prioritization process. There
  was an analysis of the Food Security and Agriculture sector but the results are not
  included since they do not reveal sufficient new information.

  The following sectors, organized under three categories, were part of the exercise:

  1. Urban Development, Housing and Disaster Risk Management
  	   1.1. Urban Development, Land Management and Housing
  	   1.2. Disaster Risk Management
  	   1.3. Urban Finance

  2. Urban Services and Infrastructure
  	   2.1. Transport and Roads
  	   2.2. Water Supply and Sanitation
  	   2.3. Solid Waste Management
  	   2.4. Drainage and Coastal Zone Management

  3. Community Development and Social Protection

                                    Qualities of Urban Resilience

         Quality                                                Description

         Robust         Robust systems include well-conceived, constructed and managed physical assets, so
                        that they can withstand the impacts of shocks without significant damage or loss of
                        function. Robust design anticipates potential failures in systems, making provision to
                        ensure failure is predictable, safe, and not disproportionate to the cause. Overreliance
                        on a single asset, cascading failure and design thresholds that might lead to catastrophic
                        collapse if exceeded are actively avoided. An important aspect of robustness is proper
                        operations and maintenance to ensure that systems are functioning properly. (e.g., A
                        building is designed to accommodate a seismic event without collapse or excessive
                        damage.)

       Redundant        A redundant network or system has a belt and braces approach which includes spare
                        capacity or back-up to accommodate disruption, extreme pressures or surges in demand.
                        Providing diverse ways of achieving a given need or fulfilling a particular function is a
                        means to achieving a redundant system. If one service channel gets disrupted, another
                        can be used. (e.g., A power distribution network is able to rebalance to respond to a surge
                        in demand in a particular area).

        Reflective      Resilient urban systems examine, learn, and evolve based on their past experiences and
                        new information, modifying standards or norms based on emerging evidence rather than
                        seeking permanent solutions based on the status quo. As a result, people and institutions
                        examine and systematically learn from their past experiences, and leverage this learning
                        to inform future decision-making (e.g., A financial management system might make use of
                        information on past shocks and stresses to improve budget reserving policies).

      Coordinated       Coordination between city systems and agencies means that knowledge is shared,
                        planning is collaborative and strategic, and decision-making is based on investments that
                        are mutually supportive towards a common outcome. Exchange of information between
                        systems enables them to function collectively and respond rapidly through feedback
                        loops occurring throughout the city (e.g., A coordinated transport systems is not only
                        aligned with urban growth dynamics and land use but also has open communication with
                        other agencies so that it can divert user traffic to different modes of transport based on
                        changing conditions).

        Inclusive       Being inclusive recognizes that risk is perceived differently by different stakeholders and
                        that shocks and stresses affect the most vulnerable the most. An inclusive approach
                        contributes to a sense of shared ownership or joint vision to build a resilient city. This can
                        be achieved through consultation and engagement with a wide range of stakeholders,
                        including the most vulnerable groups, to ensure that systems are more resilient by
                        considering a wider range of vulnerabilities, risk management capacities, and localized
                        information. Equity in access to infrastructure and services underpins social cohesion and
                        opportunity (e.g., An inclusive budgeting process could help ensure that the allocation of
                        city resources reflects community priorities).

           Box 2: Goals of National Land Policy

           The goals of the National Land Policy are to: (i) harmonize statutory laws and customary practices to
           facilitate equitable access to land and enhance security of tenure through registering systematically
           all interests in land; (ii) minimize and eliminate, where possible, the sources of protracted land
           boundary disputes and litigation in order to bring their associated economic costs and socio-political
           upheavals under control; (iii) ensure payment within a reasonable timeframe of fair compensation
           for land acquired by the state from customary or private landowners; (iv) instill order and discipline
           in the land market to curb the incidence of land encroachment, unapproved development schemes,
           multiple or illegal land sales, land speculation and other forms of land racketeering; (v) create and
           maintain effective institutional capacity and capability at the national, regional, district, and where
           appropriate, community levels for land services delivery; (vi) promote community and participatory
           land management and land use planning within a decentralized planning system; and (vii) formalize
           land markets where appropriate to promote business-like and professional property management
           principles with the aim of maximizing economic, financial and social returns while working towards a
           self-financed land administration system.

      Box 4: Negative Impacts of GAMA Waste Management

      Most Dump sites in the GAMA are sources of considerable environmental impact. The Abloraadjei
      dump site is one example, in particular. Wastes are burned on site, causing local air quality impacts,
      and with no engineered lining at the site, it is possible that leachate is polluting the Ga East
      groundwater, though no studies have assessed this issue. The site is also likely generating methane
      gas, a potential asphyxiation/explosion risk for nearby residents and also a powerful greenhouse gas.
      Any impacts of the site will become more acute as housing is built increasingly close to the dump
      site’s boundaries.

      Approximately 100 wastepickers scour the dump site daily, collecting recyclable materials. The
      conditions for these activities are dangerous, with wastepickers exposed to pathogens from
      decomposing organic and medical wastes, hazardous substances in the waste, dangerous fumes
      from burning materials, and potential waste slides due to the steep piles of waste.




                                                                                                                 67

       Strengthening urban resilience in a transforming metropolitan economy and society
       needs to adopt a multi- sectoral and multi-disciplinary approach in planning and
       implementation. In the GAMA region, because of the many local entities involved, the
       process must also be inter-jurisdictional. This chapter presents priority actions and
       investments that highlight GAMA’s most pressing needs and recommended actions
       and investments to enhance resilience across the region’s scale and sectors. These
       recommendations are based on the detailed sectoral and MMDA level priorities identified
       during different CityStrength diagnostics workshops. Recommendations were first made
       by the sectors and clusters of MMDAs, and then validated during various CityStrength
       Diagnostic workshops.


       1.	 Key Shifts in Planning and Response

       The lack of institutional coordination around urban resilience has hindered concerted
       efforts to address the range of shocks and stresses confronting GAMA. Moreover, in the
       absence of agreed proactive measures, emergency management has largely focused
       on response rather than reduction of underlying risks. If risk mitigation measures are
       not addressed urgently, trends suggests that the GAMA will see increasing shocks and
       stresses – more so, under the expected impacts of climate change – with potentially
       debilitating effects on the vibrancy of the region.

       In recent years, there has been a high-level commitment from the Government of Ghana
       to shift the national agenda for disaster management from response to prevention and
       risk Reduction. The development of the Ghana Plan of Action on Disaster Risk Reduction
       by NADMO, with technical and financial assistance from UNDP and the World Bank,
       respectively, constitutes a milestone in this process. Similarly, the Community Resilience
       through Early Warning (CREW) project 85 aims to build capacities within the country to
       reduce disaster risk by putting in place an integrated early warning system that is both
       scientific and people-centered. However, planning efforts have been largely centralized
       and not effectively integrated with the local governmental planning processes and
       management efforts. While there is a national disaster management plan, GAMA MMDAs
       do not have disaster management plans of their own and there are no special funds for

Box 5: Example of a Potential Intervention on Greater
Accra Resilient and Integrated Development
Proposed Objective: Improve flood management capacity in Greater Accra and strengthen
resilience and living conditions in the most vulnerable communities.

Expected Results: Improved drainage and flood management in MMDAs, with a focus on most
vulnerable communities. This will boost new investment in the area and improve quality of life
with potentially transformative impacts within one basin and beyond; Increased government
capacity at all levels to monitor and manage inland and coastal flooding risks; Reduced
vulnerability of people and households, infrastructure, and public assets in risk-prone areas;
reduced income loss (livelihood, property and business) from flooding.

Potential Areas of Interventions

I. Integrated Urban Flood Risk Management
  1a: Drainage and flood management improvements: In the short term, this will include
  urgent actions to prepare for recurrent floods, such as dredging, de-silting, waste collection
  improvements and rehabilitation of damaged drains. In the medium-to-long term, it will
  support drainage improvements and rehabilitation within the critical basin, along with
  the development of green spaces (parks and flood retention areas) and other associated
  improvements such as waste management, and water quality improvement. It will also include
  comprehensive planning, monitoring, coordination, operations and maintenance system for
  core infrastructure.

  1b: Support to most vulnerable communities: This will include upgrading basic Infrastructure
  and services prioritized by most vulnerable communities: developing and retrofitting drains,
  pavements, schools, health centers, and potential support to lower-cost housing options. The
  work will be targeted within the critical basin and in sync with integrated drainage and flood
  management improvement investments under 1a and the GAMA project.

II. Strengthening Capacity for Disaster Preparedness and Response in Greater Accra
Metropolitan Area

   2a: Flood Early Warning & Response System Improvement in GAMA: This will include improving
   hydromet (hydrological and meteorological) services at the national level (GMET, HSD, WRC),
   and coordination, warning and response systems at GAMA and MMDA levels. It will also include
   preparation of Disaster Risk Information System, disaster risk management, and emergency
   preparedness plans (response, recovery and reconstruction).

   2b. Support for Metropolitan Planning, and Coordination for MMDAs in GAMA: This will include
   support for creation of Joint Development Planning Areas (JDPA) with particular emphasis on
   flood risk management, and close coordination across sectors. It will also include support for
   risk assessment, integrated and risk-sensitive land use planning, infrastructure and services
   master planning; building regulations, zoning, operation and maintenance finance and
   technical review at GAMA and MMDA levels. It will also provide incentives and grants to MMDAs
   in GAMA to support metropolitan coordination, and local Disaster Risk Management and
   Emergency Preparedness Plan priorities, including but not limited to advocacy and training
   on early warning and response, simulation exercises, data sharing and planning, building
   retrofitting, emergency coordination center and equipment, and recovery and response
   support.
