Key Characteristics of Aggregation Case Study
                         Mercado Regional del Atlántico, Colombia
Context                  •	 Upper-middle-income country

                         •	 Aggregation covering urban and rural areas

                         •	 Low level of water supply and sanitation (WSS) performance
Purpose                  Performance, professionalization, economic efficiency
Scope                    WSS functions and services
Scale                    •	 Administrative boundaries

                         •	 Localities covered: 15 for water and 8 for wastewater

                         •	 Population covered: 2,173,616 inhabitants for water and 1,945,277 for wastewater

                         •	 Coverage: 99% for water and 88.6% for wastewater

                         •	 Connections: 475,349 for water and 393,090 for wastewater
Process                  Voluntary and incentivized
Governance               •	 Delegated

                         •	 Public-private partnership (PPP)

                         •	 Decision making: according to the PPP contract provision

                         •	 Asset transfer: assets remain the property of municipalities and are transferred to the operator for the
                          duration of the delegation contract

                         •	 Liability: liabilities and debts from previous operators are not taken over by the private operator

                         •	 Staff transfer: none

                         •	 Clear entry and exit rules as stipulated in the PPP contract
Outcome                  Positive, inclding lower marginal costs
Findings                 Strong cooperation between municipalities and operator made easier by clear aggregation institutional
                         arrangement (ownership, duties); good reputation and achievements of operator that contributed to
                         acceptance from population, with new municipalities joining; accountability efforts (awareness campaigns,
                         meetings w/social leaders, creation of social control committees); utility champion and governance leader
