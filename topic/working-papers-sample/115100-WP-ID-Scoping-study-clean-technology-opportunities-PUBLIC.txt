Scoping Study on Clean Technology Opportunities and Barriers in Indonesian Palm Oil Mill and Rice Mill Industries                         i
                                                                        A.           Introduction

1. Background
Indonesia has been enjoying high and increasing economic growth since it started to recover from the financial crisis of
the late 1990s. At the same time, however, Indonesia has become the world’s third largest emitter of carbon (after the USA
and China). Moreover, the strong economic recovery has not solved the persistent poverty. In fact, unemployment rate
has risen to double digits—from 6.1% in 2000 to 10.3% in 2006—and poverty incidence continues to increase—from
16.0% in 2005 to 17.8% in 2006. Over 70 million Indonesians (about one-third of the country’s total population)
live without access to electricity. The overarching goal, therefore, of the Indonesian government should be to continue
to attain high economic growth while reducing poverty and mitigating its impacts on the environment.

No doubt, the industry and power sectors, among other sectors, have contributed to this positive economic performance.
The manufacturing and construction industries alone combined to contribute 34% of GDP in 2005. The power
sector, along with the entire energy sector, of course fuels the growth of the Indonesian economy. These two sectors,
however, are also contributing to the rapidly increasing carbon emissions and environmental pollution (waste, water,
and air)—clearly a negative side effect of growth and industrialization. The industrial sector relies on fossil fuels and,
along with the household sector, dominate final energy consumption. The power sector, on the other hand, continues
its dependence on coal to increase capacity and satisfy rapidly expanding electricity demand. Already, coal accounts for
close to 70% of Indonesia’s power generation mix. Yet it should be possible to ensure the two sectors’ contributions to
the growing Indonesian economy through the use of proven clean and sustainable energy technologies.

To be sure, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) has taken steps to arrest these growing environmental impacts. For
example, the Presidential Regulation on National Energy Policy in 2006 aims to increase the share of geothermal and
other renewables to 5% by 2025 and reduce energy intensity by 1% per year. Though maybe modest compared to
national potentials, it cannot be denied that this is still a step in the right direction. However, while already modest, the
attainment of these goals is hampered by technical, financial, and institutional barriers.



2. Objectives
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) intends to take a closer look at the barriers and opportunities for
sustainable energy finance and clean technology applications in Indonesian industry and energy sectors. It has, therefore,
commissioned a study that finally aims:
        To understand, both quantitatively and qualitatively, financing barriers that impede the development of
    1.	 	
        sustainable energy in Indonesia; and
        To have a basis for making concrete decisions regarding the type of sustainable energy-related advisory work,
    2.	 	
        as well as investment interventions, which IFC may undertake in Indonesia and maximize opportunities for
        replicability and substantially improve the access to finance.

IFC has instituted sustainable energy finance programs in Russia, China, the Philippines, and other countries, and now
plans to do the same in Indonesia.

Specifically, the study will:
   1.	 Assess attitudes of manufacturing companies that wish to improve their environmental and economic
        performance and identify barriers to their doing so;




                        Scoping Study on Clean Technology Opportunities and Barriers in Indonesian Palm Oil Mill and Rice Mill Industries   1
    2.	 Identify and assess the capabilities of consulting companies or individual consultants that wish to deliver
        Sustainable Energy and Cleaner Production (SE/CP) services to companies;
        Assess government policies and regulations aimed at increasing awareness and promoting sustainable energy and
    3.	 	
        cleaner production or which act as barriers to investment;
        Identify international companies that wish to market and supply SE/CP equipment and technologies to
    4.	 	
        Indonesia;
        Identify international buyers (importers) requiring energy efficiency or environmental compliance from
    5.	 	
        Indonesian suppliers (exporters);
        Identify important technical, commercial, financing, institutional, and other hurdles and constraints to the
    6.	 	
        implementation of SE/CP projects;
        Identify key players in the promotion of Distributed Generation in Indonesia, in relation to both project
    7.	 	
        development (developers, technical consultants, contractors, technology providers, equipment manufacturers)
        and financing (banks, parastatal institutions, etc.).

The study will be undertaken in two phases. The present scoping study represents Phase 1 of the study. It covers two
important industries in Indonesia, which have been prioritized in consultation and agreement with IFC after evaluation
of additional data and information provided by the World Bank and IFC. Phase 1 study focused on two specific areas:
the barriers to adoption of technologies by selected companies and the range of modern technologies available in
each sector. Phase 2 will expand the coverage of the study to additional key Indonesian industries, including possibly
the power sector, focusing on distributed generation options. The final scope and sectoral coverage of Phase 2 will be
discussed and agreed upon with IFC after the completion of Phase 1 study.

Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies will investigate barriers and opportunities to sustainable energy investments in the
prioritized sectors. For the manufacturing industries, the study on sustainable energy investments is oriented towards
cleaner production and clean technologies, which refer to business activities and technology applications that have the
common characteristic of providing environmental (mainly through energy efficiency improvements) as well as financial
(cost savings) benefits. The scoping study is focused on private sector-led sustainable energy investment opportunities
and in promoting market-led outcomes.



3. Scope
The following six criteria were used in selecting the priority industries for Phase 1:
   •	 1.	Contribution to export value added
   •	 2.	Contribution to sectoral gross value added
   •	 3.	Number of firms
   •	 4.	Potential for clean technology
   •	 5.	Data availability
   •	 6.	Potential for getting loans from IFC for the adoption of clean technologies

The first three criteria were based on a study made by the World Bank office in Indonesia comparing the macroeconomic
performance and contributions and energy intensities of Indonesian industries, with particular emphasis on the food
and beverage sectors. The fourth criterion was based on prior expert knowledge of candidate industries. The fifth
and sixth criteria were based on a quick pre-assessment of the candidate industries and initial discussion with key
stakeholders.

After careful discussions with IFC, it was agreed that Phase 1 of the Scoping Study focus on the palm oil mill and rice
mill sectors.




2         Scoping Study on Clean Technology Opportunities and Barriers in Indonesian Palm Oil Mill and Rice Mill Industries
The palm oil mill sector easily satisfied all these criteria. The rice mill sector was not a strong candidate in terms of the
first two criteria but came out very strongly in terms of the last four criteria.

The potential for the adoption of clean technologies focused on these two industrial processess. However, it was
necessary to go back upstream and further downstream, that is, study the production of the basic agricultural crops
processed by these industries—oil palm and rice paddy (rough rice)—as well as sale and export of the final products of
the industries—crude palm oil and milled rice—to gain better understanding of the target industries.



4. Methodology
The study was conducted primarily through interviews with key stakeholders in Indonesia’s energy and environment
sectors, including policy makers and NGOs, and the target indusries, including key players and industry associations.
The interviews were conducted during the two technical missions in which the offices in Jakarta of the identified
stakeholders and plants or factories of the selected players in the palm oil and rice mill sectors were visited.

Structured questionnaires were sent to selected palm oil and rice mills, including those visited, prior to the interviews.
Unfortunately only two questionnaires were returned for the palm oil mill sector and one incomplete questionnaire
for the rice mill sector. However, the interviews confirmed the responses to the questionnaire. Both the information
collected in the questionnaire and during the interviews served as basis for preparing case studies on appropriate clean
technologies for the two industries.

It was also necessary to supplement the interviews with secondary research, including review of related literature and
gathering of published secondary data. In fact, the financial and policy aspects of the study relied to a large extent on
secondary information rather than the few interviews that could be made given the time and resources available for the
study.1 However, these secondary sources were close to primary sources as they were authored by direct stakeholders
in the target sectors, as against secondary sources authored by observers or researchers. The resource and technology
opportunities in the palm oil and rice mill sectors have been also explored in the literature through similar investigations



1	   For instance, the sections on barries on clearn energy relied heavily on two recent studies commissioned by USAID—one including Indonesia as one of the six target Asian countries
     and the other focused on Indonesia alone.

in the sector, including in Indonesia and other countries, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, which are important
players in the international market for crude palm oil and rice. The interviews and plant site visits confirmed the
technological opportunites, as well as reveal or confirm policy and financial barriers. The resource and technology
opportunities (and barriers for that matter) made several references to the experience of the consultants in the same
sectors in Thailand and Malaysia.

The study culminated in a Dissemination Workshop on 14 April 2009, organized by the IFC. The additional knowledge
shared and recommendations made during the workshop have been incorporated in this final report.

1. Palm oil mill industry and clean technology

1.a Industry background and market opportunities
Since 2006, Indonesia has overtaken Malaysia as the largest producer of palm oil in the world. That year Indonesia
produced 16.050 million tons of crude palm oil (CPO), slightly higher than Malaysia’s 15.881 million tons (Figure
1). In fact, Indonesia’s CPO production has been growing much faster than Malaysia’s. Between 1995 and 2006,
Indonesia’s CPO production was growing at 12.3% per year compared to Malaysia’s 6.7%. Younger plantations and
continuing land conversion to oil palm plantations have boosted Indonesian palm oil production and driven the
country to this current status. The combined palm oil production of Indonesia and Malaysia accounts for 86% of world
palm oil output.

As of 2004, some 320 palm oil mills (POMs) with a total processing capacity of 13,520 tons of fresh fruit bunches
(FFB) per hour had been operating in Indonesia (Table 2). In 2005, there were more than 340 POMs processing 13.8
million tons of CPO.2 Most POMs are located in North Sumatra and Riau, and a significant number are also located

in South Sumatra, Aceh, Jambi, and in East and South Kalimantan. The typical capacities of POMs in Indonesia are
30, 45, 60, and 90 tons per hour (tph) of FFB per palm oil mill.

Indonesia exports between 73%and 78% of its palm oil production as crude or processed palm oil3 and generates
export revenues in excess of US$ 1 billion annually.4 The major destinations for Indonesia CPO exports are India (48%
of crude palm oil exports in 2007), the Netherlands (10%), Malaysia (5%), Germany (5%), and China (4%). On the
other hand, the major destinations for processed palm oil exports are China (21% of processed palm oil exports in
2007), Pakistan (9%), India (8%), Bangladesh (7%), and Netherlands (5%).

For the long term, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is predicting that global
production of palm oil will increase by 60% from 33.3 million tons in 2005 to around 54.2 million tons in 2030, or by
about 2% per year. Indonesia is expected to remain as the top producer because of abundant supply of suitable land for
oil palm and relatively cheap labor. Total CPO demand projections indicate that Indonesia’s oil palm plantation base
may continue to increase and reach around 15 million hectares by 2020.5


1.b Palm oil mill clean technology opportunities
Cleaner production measures in palm oil mills (POMs) maybe grouped into three categories:6
       (A)	 Good housekeeping
       (B)	 In-house re-use or recycling
       (C)	 Equipment or process modification including energy efficiency improvements and energy conservation

The specific measures, including clean technologies, under each category are enumerated below:

Box 1: Clean technology options in Palm Oil Mills


      (A)	 Good housekeeping
           1.	 Process fresh fruit bunch within 24 hours after harvesting to avoid excessive production of free
               fatty acids by the natural enzymes present in the fruit.
           2.	 Collect wastewater from loading ramp in order to recover oil and prevent oil contamination of
               land and surface water.
           3.	 Apply good practice in solid waste handling such as solid waste separation and application of
               certain fractions as soil cover material or reuse/ recycling in the palm oil plantation area as soon as
               possible to reduce dust and bad smell in the mill area.
           4.	 Separate fresh fruit bunch into 2 categories: ripe and unripe fruit to control optimal conditions for
               sterilization, since time for sterilization of ripe fruit is shorter than for unripe fruit.
           5.	 Apply good maintenance practice.
           6.	 Improve combustion control: Control excess air/ fuel ratio at 0.4 in burner to reduce energy (fuel)
               consumption. Maintain 9-12% oxygen in flue gas outlet

      (B)	 On-site reuse/ recycling
           1.	 Reuse fiber and shell as fuel in boiler.
           2.	 Recycle sludge from vibrating screen to digestion tank.
           3.	 Recycle sterilized condensate to screw press and vibrating screen to reduce hot water use and to
               improve the recovery of oil from wastewater.
           4.	 Recycle hot water from vacuum tank for cleaning decanter and separator.
           5.	 Recycle steam condensate (temp. 100oC) from kernel drying tank for reuse as boiler feed water to
               reduce water use and energy for heating water.
           6.	 Recovery of biogas from palm oil mill effluent (POME) for generating steam and /or electricity
               and hot water, or for use as substitute for diesel as transport fuel.
           7.	 Recycle wastewater after anaerobic treatment for irrigation in oil palm plantation area.
           8.	 Recycle sludge from wastewater treatment plant for soil conditioning and fertilizing.
           9.	 Mix effluent from biogas plant with shredded empty fruit branches (EFBs) and recycle as
               fertilizer.
           10.	Recycle EFBs as solid fuel or compost fertilizer.
           11.	Mix shredded EFBs with POME to produce biogas or compost fertilizer.
           12.	Mix EFBs with shell and fiber and re-use as fuel in boiler.
           13.	Recovery of ash from boiler and mix with wastewater for use as fertilizer.

      (C)	 Process modification
           1.	 Employ an automatic autoclave for optimal sterilization conditions.
           2.	 Collect remaining unripe palm fruit to re-sterilize manually in order to reduce oil loss.
           3.	 Install 2nd bunch stripper to enhance fruit separation from bunch stalk to reduce oil loss from
               EFB.
           4.	 Install buffer tank to separate the sludge from the crude oil before flow to the settling tank to
               enhance oil separation, and remove sand from sludge.

Beyond on-site reuse and recycling, POM residues can be re-used and recycled in an “industrial ecology” approach. In
simplest terms, this approach would give market or commercial value to the POM residues that can be used or processed
by other firms besides the POMs. For example, in Indonesia, the fibers and shells can be collected, briquetted, and sold
to independent power producers (IPPs, Green IPPs) or nearby industries for use as fuel in generating electricity. The
EFBs can be dried and shredded or chipped and sold for making furniture cushion. The palm oil mill could rely solely
on the biogas generated from POME for its electricity requirements.

Palm oil mills are processing palm oil from fresh fruit bunches harvested from oil palm trees by first cutting the frond
below the fresh fruit bunch and then cutting loose the fruit bunch. Approximately 20% of the weight of the FFBs going
into the palm oil mill comes out as palm oil. The remaining 80% is biomass residue: ~20% empty fruit bunches; ~22%
fiber; ~7.5% shells; decanter cake ~2%. The remaining biomass residues go out with the wastewater at ~0.45 m3/ton
of FFB (depending on the water management, boiler water treatment among others).

Residues from palm oil processing could be used to produce a lot of energy. The energy content of the different residues
is listed in Table 2.

The figures above are from a Thai palm oil mill before they optimized the energy supply and consumption.

Naturally some of the biomass residues are used as fuel for processing of the palm oil. But even though the energy
conversion efficiencies are kept extremely low it is still not possible to use all of the residues.

At full capacity, a 60-ton FFB/hour mill will generate around 27 – 30 m3/hr of wastewater (POME). Chemical oxygen
demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) will depend on the efficiency of the decanters at the mill, with
the more efficient decanters yielding higher oil output and less polluted wastewater. The COD value can vary between
40,000 mg/L and 60,000 mg/L. Depending on the biogas technology, it is possible to convert from 65 to 90% of the
COD to biogas. Standard figure is 65%, but when using hydrolysis and two-stage biogas plants, full scale experiments
have shown COD reductions above 90%.

A 60-ton FFB/hour mill with a COD value of 40,000 mg/L will generate methane (CH4) at 200 m3/hr from a 325
m3/hr biogas plant (biogas has a methane content of around 65%). The methane produced (200 m3/hr) corresponds
to approximately 200 liters of diesel oil/hr.

The methane could be used in a gas engine for electricity generation and can produce around 800 kW of electricity.
An additional 800 kW of thermal energy is available for hot water used in oil clarification, threshing and pressing. The
biogas (with H2S removed) could be injected into the air intake of existing diesel engines (dual fuel operation) and
substitute a substantial amount of diesel oil used for electricity generation. During operation of the boiler, surplus gas
could be used in the boiler to supply steam for electricity and processing of the palm oil.

Cleaned and compressed methane could be used to substitute diesel oil for trucks either by modifying the cylinder head
of the diesel engine and turning the diesel engines into gas engines, or by injecting the methane into the air manifold
of the diesel engine (dual fuel principle). It is recommended that a lubrication oil supplier be consulted to ensure that
the right engine oil for the gas engines or dual fuel engines is used.

A simplified mass and energy balance with specific focus on the biogas utilization options seen from an energy point
of view is presented in Figure 1.

From the Danish experience it is seen that the biogas plant converts dry matter to biogas, increases the expensive
ammonium and nitrogen in the effluent, maintains phosphorus and slightly reduces the potassium (Table 4). It is
believed that the potassium is settled in the biogas plant. The Total Solids (TS) in POME is expected to be around 3%,
thus the fertilizer figures might be slightly less than seen in the table above.

It is recommended to have the POME analyzed before utilization to determine its proper dosing.

Table 5 shows the fertilizer content of POME after biogas treatment.

Some projects in Malaysia applying for CDM involve producing compost fertilizer by soaking shredded or chipped
EFBs in POME. Some mills are soaking EFBs in POME and then spreading the soaked EFBs evenly in the plantations.
This brings the fertilizer and trace elements back into the plantation, helps keep the soil moist during the dry season,
and adds fiber where aerobic micro-organisms can grow and help to keep the soil healthy. But if overdone, there is a
risk that the soil environment becomes anaerobic causing choking of the palm trees.

Treating POME in a biogas plant before using as fertilizer will produce about 3.3 m3 of CH4 (equivalent to ~3.3 liters
of diesel oil) from each ton of FFB processed.

The feasibility of a biogas production plant and a gas engine generator system for substitution of diesel generated
electricity is very high. With a diesel price of 0.57 USD/liter the FIRR on the project will be slightly above 50%. In
other words the biogas plant and the gas engine investments would, after covering the operation service and maintenance
costs generate a surplus big enough to pay the investment back in 2 years.

If the gas is converted to vehicle fuel the same feasibility or slightly lower feasibility can be expected. The value of the
biogas for this example is the same as for the example with substitution of diesel generated electricity. The investment
costs for conversion of biogas to vehicle fuel and conversion of diesel trucks to gas is expected to be higher.

None of the feasibility calculation includes the value of CER’s from a CDM project. It is believed that it is easier to have
a CDM project approved with the conversion of the biogas to vehicle fuel.

be around 65 %. If a debt equity ratio of 70/30 is used, the IRR on the equity would be around 220 %. (Better than
most other infrastructure projects.)

LHV means Lower Heating Value and tells about the energy converted during combustion, with the water vapor
generated by the combustion, and the water vapor in the combustion air, still being vapor.

HHV means higher heating value, where the vapor from the combustion and the combustion air has been condensed.
HHV is thus LHV + energy for evaporation of the amount of water vapor found in the flue gas.

The LHV can be calculated from the moisture content according to the formulas below:

LHVfiber [kJ/kg] 	 = 18631 [kJ/kg] – 211.3 [kJ/kg] * moisture [%]

LHVshells [kJ/kg] 	= 19385 [kJ/kg] – 218.9 [kJ/kg] * moisture [%]

LHVEFB [kJ/kg] 	= 16957 [kJ/kg] – 194.6 [kJ/kg] * moisture [%]

EFBs are often considered as the “black sheep” in the Palm Oil Industry. Many mills incinerate EFBs because it will
generate clinker ash and cause fouling problems if burnt in the boiler. Combustion of biomass with high potassium
content at high temperature results in the formation of clinker ash, and sticky fly ash when it is burnt at high temperature.
The deformation temperature for EFB ash is actually as high as1,080°C. (Gulf ).

Around 20% of the FFB input comes out as EFBs; if the EFBs are sun-dried to a moisture content of around 20%, the
LHV would be ~13,000 kJ/kg (3.6 kWh/kg). Each ton of FFB would generate 200 kg of EFB fuel equivalent to ~ 726
kWh. The thermal energy needed for processing is 0.4 ton steam/ton of FFB or ~350 kWh/ton of FFB (A low pressure
steam boiler with a total efficiency of 50% could generate all the steam needed for processing using the sun dried EFBs
as fuel). Biogas from the POME could be used to produce all the electricity needed for processing.




14          Scoping Study on Clean Technology Opportunities and Barriers in Indonesian Palm Oil Mill and Rice Mill Industries
With a setup where the electricity for processing comes from biogas and the thermal energy is covered by EFBs, there
would be ~220 kg fiber/ton of FFB and ~70 kg of shells/ton of FFB. A total of ~1 MWh of good quality surplus fuel
per ton of FFB is available.

A 60-ton FFB/hr mill with an annual FFB input of 300,000 tons would thus have a fuel surplus of 300,000 MWh,
which could generate 100,000 MWh of electricity in a high pressure (70 bar) power plant with condensing steam
turbine (fuel for a 15 MW power plant).

A simplified mass and energy balance with specific focus on the utilization of excess biomass, after the energy demand
for processing has been covered by biogas generated electricity and EFB generated steam, is shown below. The scenario
has been chosen from an optimized energy point of view. Biogas and fertilizer considerations would be the same as in
the biogas scenario described earlier.

The feasibility for the biogas part will be the same as in the previous scenario.

No significant savings would be expected by installing a new EFB-fueled boiler for steam generation. A CDM project
is possible if the EFBs were previously not utilized or dumped in an open landfill. Income from sale of CERs would be
realized by turning a new EFB-fueled steam boiler into a CDM project. Using a CER generation of 0.92 CER/ton of
EFB and a CER price of 10 USD/CER, the project would generate a FIRR of 8%, if the sales price of the CERs was
15 USD/CER the FIRR would be 22%.

2. Rice mill industry and clean technology

2.a Industry background and market opportunities
Indonesia is one of the world’s leading rice producers with paddy production in 2007 of more than 57 million tons,
which was about 9% of the world total. According to official statistics, paddy rice production was expected to reach
close to 60 million tons in 2008. The provinces in the major island of Java, particularly West Java, Central Java, and
East Java, accounted for 54% of paddy production in 2008. It was followed by Sumatra (23%) and Sulawesi (11%).

Indonesia has also exhibited one of the highest growths in paddy rice production at 3.43% per year from 1961-2007,
as against the world average of 2.43%. This can be attributed to a large and growing area dedicated to rice production
and at the same time increasing yield in tons per hectare. Except as against China and India, Indonesia has the largest
paddy rice area in Asia; which has grown from under seven million hectares in 1961 to more than 12 million hectares
in 2007. It could expand further and become even larger than the combined paddy rice areas of South America and
Africa. The expansion in paddy rice area has been accompanied by an even higher growth in rice yield that is in fact even
higher than world and Asia’s average. From below world and Asia’s average in 1961, Indonesia’s rice yield has grown to
4.69 tons per hectare compared to the world average of 4.15 tons per hectare and Asia’s average of 4.21 tons per hectare.
Indonesia’s rice yield has been higher than those of Thailand and Vietnam, the top two rice exporting countries. Both
trends—growth in paddy rice area and rice yield—are expected to continue in the future.

20   Scoping Study on Clean Technology Opportunities and Barriers in Indonesian Palm Oil Mill and Rice Mill Industries
The rice export market has been dominated by Thailand and Vietnam, particularly since the late 1980s, when the two
countries have been cornering more than half of the export market. Thailand’s rice exports, however, has been slowing
down, and its share has been eaten by other rice exporters.

Only less than 5% of paddy rice produced worldwide is exported as milled rice. However, this share has grown from
less than 3% in the last two decades and is expected to grow further, as growth in exports continue to exceed that of
production.

Indonesia is actually one of the largest rice importers because of huge domestic demand. However, with rice production
growing and almost equalling that of Thailand and Vietnam combined, larger area being dedicated to rice than most
exporting countries, and rice yield increasing and higher than world and regional averages, Indonesia could very well
enjoy huge rice surplus and thus enter the growing export market. Price is also another incentive. Although the short-
term shows a decreasing trend, rice export price is expected to increase in the long-term.


2.b Rice mill clean technology opportunities
After threshing and drying, milling is a crucial post-harvest activity in the production of rice. The basic objective of rice
milling is to remove the least amount of husks/hulls and bran layers, and produce an edible, white rice kernel that is
sufficiently milled and free of impurities.

For rice milling, the main environmental issues are as follows:
   •	 Water used for soaking the paddy, especially for parboiled rice production, if not properly treated could result
        in water pollution and odor nuisance to local community
   •	 Effluent produced during cleaning of equipment may cause water pollution through insufficient treatment of
        effluent
   •	 Air pollution both on site and in the surrounding locality may result from release of dust to the atmosphere
        from handling or processing of the paddy or its by-products (in fact, this is a major environmental concern for
        rice mills)
   •	 High internal and external noise levels that may generate health hazard to employees and nuisance to the local
        community
   •	 Disposal of solid wastes, particularly unused rice husk and bran, as well as other wastes generated from the
        cleaning process
   •	 Raw materials and by-products may be subject to pest infestation and contamination (Birds contaminated with
        avian flu can leave their droppings in the rice mill)




                              Scoping Study on Clean Technology Opportunities and Barriers in Indonesian Palm Oil Mill and Rice Mill Industries   21
     •	 Pollution risks to water and soil from spillage and leakage of fuels that maybe stored on site
     •	 High risks of fire

To address and mitigate the above-mentioned environmental concerns, the following cleaner production measures are
particularly relevant for rice mills:
    •	 Good and adequately maintained drainage to facilitate run-off and minimize the likelihood of flooding
    •	 Regular inspection of bulk storage tanks to minimize the risk of surface water pollution
    •	 Installation of interceptor traps for solids, oil and fuel to reduce the control release of contaminated water via
       the surface drains
    •	 Separation of milling areas from all other areas of operation
    •	 Water proofing of mill floor and all other floors
    •	 Walls are designed to prevent accumulation of dust and entry of rodents, birds, or pests
    •	 Adequate ventilation to prevent dust pollution and reduce heat
    •	 Prevention of build up of dusts on machinery and ledges, and in the building
    •	 Design of chimney and vents of sufficient height and appropriate technology to avoid causing local nuisance of
       dust and smoke emissions
    •	 Measures to control noise levels at the site boundary
    •	 For parboiling mills, locating the steam-generating units away from storage and immediate work areas
    •	 Locating the soaking tanks close to the drying area
    •	 Locating the steaming tanks close to the soaking tanks and using non-corrosive metal
    •	 Insulating the steam conduit pipes and making sure they are free from leaks
    •	 Treatment of effluents and wastewater
    •	 Re-use of rice husk as fuel for paddy drying, steam generator, or gasifier
    •	 Sale of rice husk or high crystalline silica produced from controlled burning of rice husk
    •	 Use of more efficient variable-speed drive motors for controlling combustion of rice husk


2.c Rice mill residue usage options
Around 20% of the paddy is husk; rice husk in turn contains 16 to 22% ash, and 90-96% of the ash is composed of
silica (silicon dioxide, SiO2). Rice husk has traditionally been used as an ingredient in ruminant and poultry feeds
worldwide. In the modern rice milling industry today, rice husk is commonly used as fuel source for grain drying and
parboiling. The husk is burned in a simple steam boiler where the steam is then used for drying of paddy, or the hot flue
gas from combustion of rice husk is used to heat up air used for paddy drying. The energy content, in terms of Lower
Heating Value (LHV), of rice husk is around 14,204 kJ/kg which is equal to 3.95 kWh/kg. The moisture content is
normally <10%.

Most of the rice milled in Indonesia today is milled at small rice mills scattered all over the country for the country’s
own consumption. The husk is sometimes used as food for chickens together with broken rice. Sometimes the husk is
collected and burned, with the ash used for cleaning utensils. Broken rice is used for animal fodder.

Incomplete combustion of rice husk generates ash with very high carbon content. This can be briquetted and used as
fuel for cooking in biomass stoves.

Rice that is to be sold for export or to be sold under specific brand names must meet certain criteria for moisture,
protein content, variety of rice, amount of broken rice and other requirements. This kind of rice is produced on large
rice mills. Large rice mills try to keep the mill in operation as many hours as possible during the year, even during the
rainy season. Rice delivered during the rainy season must be dried according to the quality criteria. Large rice mills use
the rice husk as fuel for paddy drying. The rice husk is burned in a furnace and the hot flue gas is used to heat up the
air used for paddy drying.

Ash from these paddy drying furnaces should be analyzed for carbon and silica content. If the carbon content is high,
the ash could be converted into charcoal briquettes used as fuel for cooking.

Rice husk as biomass fuel
Rice husk is the only rice mill residue that is considered relevant when it comes to renewable energy. It is estimated that
175 MWe could be generated from rice husk, which is equivalent to 15% of the total electricity that could be generated
from biomass wastes in Indonesia. As can be expected, the bulk of this capacity would come from Java. Significant
additional capacities could come from Sumatra, Sulawesi, and Kalimantan.

Box 2: Rice husk in Thailand	

        In Thailand, the husk is commonly used as fuel for power generation and as fuel in cement kilns. When
        used in cement kilns the crystalline silica helps to improve the quality of the cement.

        One of the biggest alcohol producers in Southeast Asia, Thai Alcohol is using rice husk and biogas as fuel
        for processing of the alcohol. The plant is not connected to the public grid. In 2005, the plant was paying
        USD50 per ton of rice husk.

        On the central plain of Thailand, North and North-East of Bangkok, a number of rice husk-fired power
        plants have emerged during the last 10 years. Due to the energy policy and electricity payment schemes,
        most of the plants are just below 10 MW. Most of the power plants are equipped with a bagging unit for
        bagging and exporting white ash; this business generates almost as much money as the electricity sale.

        These power plants use 40 bar water tube steam boilers and 8-10 MW steam turbines with possibility to
        extract steam for paddy drying. The electrical efficiency (fuel to electricity) is around 18%.

Silica from rice husk
A by-product from rice mills where the rice husk is used as fuel for drying is the ash. This ash contains a high degree of
silica which has many different uses and can be sold to increase the income in the local community.

There is a growing demand for fine amorphous silica7 in the production of special cement and concrete mixes; high
performance concrete; and high strength, low permeability concrete for use in bridges, marine environments, nuclear
power plants, etc. This market is currently filled by silica fumes or micro-silica imported from Norway, China and
Burma. Due to limited supply of silica fumes in India and the high demand, the price of silica fume has risen to as
much as USD500 per ton in India.


Rice husk as building materials
Low carbon, white husk ash suitable for use in manufacturing building materials, more particularly refractory building
materials, are prepared by first removing volatile constituents by heating the husks to a relatively low temperature below
the ignition point of the husks. Rice husks are usually used but wheat, oats or barley husks can also be used. Fixed



7	   Rice husk is burned in controlled temperatures below 700°C. The ash generated is amorphous in nature. The transformation of this amorphous state to crystalline state takes place
     when the ash is exposed to high temperatures above 850°C.

carbon is then oxidized in the presence of a reagent by heating the husks to a second temperature above the separation
temperature but below the crystallization temperature of the SiO2 in the husks. This is followed by heat treatment at a
third temperature above the crystallization temperature of the SiO2 to produce a uniform SiO2 crystal structure.


Rice husk briquettes
Rice husk is a rather bulky material, but also a good fuel with a Lower Heating Value of almost 4 kWh/kg. Storage and
handling could be made easier if the rice husk is briquetted. Briquetted rice husk could be used to substitute kerosene
for cooking. The price of kerosene in Indonesia is around Rp2,500 per liter (USD0.23 /liter). Assuming a LHV of
kerosene of around 8 kWh/liter, the price of briquetted rice husk should be around Rp1,250 per 8 kWh (Rp625 /kg)
or USD0.06 /kg to compete with kerosene.

3. Policy and Institutions
The development and utilization or application of clean technologies in Indonesia has been driven by environment and
energy policy frameworks.

3.a Cleaner Production
The industrial sector has been responsible for a “significant percentage” of all environmental damage and pollution
in Indonesia. Like most countries, the policy frameworks in Indonesia to address these environmental problems have
shifted from the end-of-pipe approach and strong government intervention to cleaner production and market-based
actions.The first measures by the government of Indonesia to address pollution problems in the 1980s were through
the introduction of regulations and control. While this command and control approach had been successful in raising
awareness on environmental management issues, it resulted in a perception that environmental management meant
high costs for both capital investments and operations & maintenance (cost centre). Hence, these mandatory measures
did not succeed particularly well in responding to the environmental problems.

For this reason, in the mid 1990s, the Ministry of Environment (KLH) started to apply mixed policies and instruments
which integrate between the mandatory approach, partnerships and voluntary programs, and market-based &
economic instruments. In particular in 1995, the Government of Indonesia announced a National Commitment on the
Implementation of Cleaner Production. “This stated that the Government of Indonesia is committed to implementing
Cleaner Production as the most effective means of protecting our environment and promoting sustainable development
in Indonesia.”8 The positive response to this paradigm shift came towards the end of 1990s when several industries
became aware of the savings that could be achieved through cleaner production measures, both in terms of reduced
waste management costs and in terms of decreased need for raw materials and other inputs.

The Indonesia Cleaner Production Center defines Cleaner Production (CP) as “the continuous application of an
integrated preventive environmental strategy applied to processes, products, and services to increase eco-efficiency and
reduce the risks for human and the environment.”

Cleaner Production has been a conceptual bridge connecting industrialization and sustainability.9 Cleaner production
has allowed industrial production to find a place in the vision of sustainability “by recasting negative images of polluting
industrial processes into positive images of technologies that are materials-conserving, energy-efficient, non-polluting
and low-waste, and that produce ecologically friendly products which are responsibly managed throughout their
lifecycle.”10

One concrete output of the national Cleaner Production policy was the establishment of Indonesia Cleaner Production
Center (ICPC) in 2003, under the auspices of the Ministry of Environment. Both ICPC and the Ministry of
Environment have been involved in the promotion of and capacity building for Cleaner Production.

The Indonesia Cleaner Production Center (ICPC) will include such services as:
   •	 Collect information concerning CP (policies, implementation, progress status, industries that have already
       applied CP measures etc.) so that it functions as an information center for domestic consumers as well as for
       foreign investors in order to further the transfer of clean technology.
   •	 Become the axis between industries interested in applying CP measures and stakeholders for CP analysis in
       order to decrease the dependency on foreign experts.
   •	 Act as a forum for stakeholders to exchange information and policies

      •	 Promote the application of CP throughout all industrial sectors and thus, through the use of the forum, facilitate
         the dialog between the different interested parties ( government, industry, academics, NGOs etc.);
      •	 Provide incentives for industries to apply CP concept and establish benchmarking
      •	 Propose pilot projects11
      •	 Catalyse institutional growth

The Ministry of Environment itself has directly conducted CP-related activities, including:
   •	 Promotion of CP through the conduction of seminar and the production of training material, brochures and
      a website.
   •	 Advise on the application of CP measures for the textile, leather, palm oil, electroplating, rubber, tapioka, sugar
      industries and the development of hotel and urban communities.
   •	 Compose technical guideline for the implementation of Chemical Management and Good Housekeeping
   •	 Establishing a pilot project implementing CP in the textile industry, palm oil and small environmental
      industries.
   •	 Consulting and technological guidance for more than 500 industries, such as: automobile, agricultural,
      electroplating, textile, sugar industries.
   •	 Practise of CP, Good-Housekeeping, Chemical Management and Life Cycle Analysis
   •	 Participation in international forums, e.g. UNEP High Level Seminar for CP; Pollution Prevention Roundtable,
      USA; Asia Pacific Roundtable for CP (APRCP); Asia Productivity Organization (APO), Eco-Industrial Estate
      Asia (EIEAsia), etc.

Other ministries and line agencies have been involved in CP. These include Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of
Tourism, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Trade and Industry, and of course the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources.

The current basis for government intervention in clean and environment technology is Act 23/1997 by which “government
shall develop and implement type of instruments (preemptive, preventive, and proactive) to enhance environment
management in Indonesia.” The Ministry of Environment (MOE) is naturally the main agency spearheading this
government mandate.

MOE implements the following incentive schemes to encourage industries to adopt “cleaner”12 technologies:
  •	 Soft Loan Programs
  •	 Import Duty Exemption Program
  •	 Debt-for-Nature Swap
  •	 GEF (multilateral fund)
  •	 ODS Phase-out Trust Fund
  •	 Subsidy/grant for composting program
  •	 Special Allocated Fund for Environmental Management by Local Government


The Environmental Soft Loan Program (ESL)
The Environmental Soft Loan (ESL) Programme may be called as the “flagship program” of the Ministry of Environment
in supporting investments in clean and environment technologies. It was in fact an offshoot of the Cleaner Production
policy.




11	   The palm oil industry was among the priority industries targeted for implementing cleaner production. In fact, a pilot study had been conducted for the industry. In this pilot project,
      liquid and solid wastes from two palm oil mills were recycled to produce organic fertilizer.
12	   The Ministry of Environment prefers to use “cleaner” over “clean” technologies.

The ESL Programme includes four credit schemes supporting environmental investments:
   •	 Pollution Abatement Equipment (PAE) supported by JBIC
   •	 Industrial Efficiency and Pollution Control (IEPC1) by KfW
   •	 Industrial Efficiency and Pollution Control Phase 2 (IEPC2) by KfW
   •	 Debt for Nature Swap (DNS)

The JBIC-PAE started in 1992 with an offer from the government of Japan of a soft loan to assist industries primarily
in managing their pollution loads (through end-of-pipe technologies). Following the success of the PAE loan scheme,
a similar lending program was provided in 1997 by a grant amounting to IDR53 billion from the government of
Germany through its financial aid agency, KfW. The Industrial Efficiency and Pollution Control (IEPC) soft loan
program “promotes and speeds up the process of changing environmental management processes towards the principles
of pollution prevention particularly in SMEs.”13 Both original PAE and IEPC funds have been fully exhausted but
the programs continue to use the repayments as revolving fund. During this period, there was also a shift in the
technologies supported by these schemes, from end-of-pipe to cleaner production. Clean technologies accounted for
89% of investment under JBIC-PAE and 86% under KfW-IEPC1. In 2005, the government of Indonesia received a
EUR9 million grant from KfW to start the Phase 2 of IEPC.

The Debt-for-Nature Swap scheme provides financial assistance particularly to micro and small enterprises that have
marginal or outreach financial access to banks in order to invest in environmentally friendly technologies.

The ESL Programme does not target particular industries but each scheme targets specific types of enterprises in terms
of scale, as shown below. The various schemes can also finance any of the following investments:
    •	 Pollution prevention equipment, including:
             o	 Cleaner production equipment, energy efficiency and changing technology
             o	 Non-ozone depleting substances (ODS) equipment
    •	 Recycling industries, referring to all equipment to save natural resources and reduce wastes
    •	 End of Pipe technologies, including:
             o	 Wastewater treatment plants
             o	 Air pollution control equipment
             o	 Solid waste treatment plants
    •	 Environment analysis equipment, including
             o	 Emission analysis equipment for auto repairs
             o	 Laboratory equipment
    •	 Raw and additive materials or substitution of bleaching agent
    •	 Environmental certification (e.g. ISO14000 series)
    •	 Consulting services


The Program for Pollution Control, Evaluation, and Rating (PROPER)
Indonesia is a pioneer country in applying information disclosure14 for the environmental management of industries.
The Program for Pollution Control, Evaluation, and Rating, better known as PROPER, is based on public disclosure
of facilities’ environmental performance and is “the first major public disclosure program in the developing world.”15
The program was launched in June 1995 and targeted major industrial water polluters. The program controled, assessed
and classified or graded the pollution levels of industrial factories or plants using a five-color scale. “Black” plants were
the ones without efforts for pollution control, which therefore cause serious damage to the environment. “Red” was
for enterprises that implement some pollution control activities but did not achieve the standards and had insufficient

reporting. The enterprises meeting the national standards and had reasonably frequent reporting would be ranked
“Blue”. “Green” was intended for the “proactive” companies and was awarded if pollution was significantly below legally
required standards and the firm conducted good equipment maintenance, reporting, and environmental work. “Gold”
or “Yellow” would reward firms that meet international standards of environmental excellence, which in addition to
the Green requirements implied the use of clean production technology, waste minimization, and pollution prevention
activities.

PROPER was stopped by the financial crisis in 1998 but is now being revived and on a larger scale than before. One
study finds that “there was indeed a strong, positive response to the scheme, in particular among firms with poor
environmental compliance records; these firms cut their emissions intensity by approximately a third. The response was
immediate, and firms pursued further reductions in the following months.”16

3.b Clean Energy
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) issued the “Green Energy Policy” in December 2003 to
encourage the development and utilization of renewable energy and to improve efficiency of energy utilization This
policy provides the reference for renewable energy development and energy conservation in Indonesia.

Under the Green Energy Policy, renewable energy in Indonesia has been classified into three types: (i) already developed
commercially (biomass, geothermal, and hydro energy); (ii) already developed but still limited in use (solar, wind); and
(iii) still at the research stage (ocean energy). The Green Energy Policy defines action steps consisting of formulation
of more specific policies and programs, including policies for: (i) investment and funding; (ii) incentives; (iii) energy
pricing; (iv) human resources; (v) information dissemination; (vi) standardization and certification; (vii) research and
development; and (viii) institutional development.

                                    Scoping Study on Clean Technology Opportunities and Barriers in Indonesian Palm Oil Mill and Rice Mill Industries   31
Following the Green Energy Policy, the Blueprint on Energy was published by MEMR and set forth roadmaps for
energy development (solar, geothermal, and nuclear) and a number of programs such as phasing out subsidies in the
energy sector, introduction of new incentives, and introduction of a carbon tax. It has become the basis for several laws
enacted for the energy sector, including the National Energy Policy Law of 2006.

The President issued Presidential Regulation (Perpres) No. 5/2006 on National Energy Policy (Kebijakan Energi
Nasional or KEN) to set national targets for the optimal energy mix in 2025, i.e.: (i) less than 20 percent from oil; (ii)
more than 30 percent from gas; (iii) more than 33 percent from coal; (iv) more than 5 percent from biofuels; (v) more
than 5 percent from geothermal; (vi) more than 5 percent from other renewable sources, especially biomass, micro-
hydro, solar and wind; and (vii) more than 2 percent from liquefied coal. In addition, a national target was established
to reduce energy elasticity to less than 1.



4. Finance

4.a Local commercial banks
The local financial sector in Indonesia comprises basically of banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). Banks
dominate the local financial landscape as they account for about 80% of the assets of the financial system.

Local commercial banks, both private and state-owned, have been cooperating with the Government of Indonesia
through the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Finance in implementing a number of economic incentives
or instruments, particularly environmental credit schemes, since beginning of 1990s. One of the economic measures
implemented since 1992 is a programme of revolving environmental soft loans. The programme, is a joint effort
between the government of Indonesia Bank Indonesia (the Central Bank) and channeling banks. This programme so
called JBIC PAE started with the offer of a soft loan from the government of Japan to assist industries primarily in
managing their pollution loads (end-of-pipe). Following the success of the JBIC-PAE loan scheme, the government
of Germany provided a grant to the government of Indonesia through KfW for the first Industrial Efficiency and
Pollution Control soft loan programme (IEPC1-KfW). This financial cooperation programme promotes and speeds up
the process of changing environmental management processes towards principles of pollution prevention particularly
in SMEs. In year 2005 the government of Indonesia received a soft loan from the government of Germany to continue
this approach under IEPC-KfW phase 2. The above soft loan schemes still continue to run although the original donor
funds for PAE and IEPC1 have already been fully exhausted. The funds that are now being managed by the banks are
those revolving through repayments.

“Banks gradually started to see that environmental investments can be interesting and financially rewarding.”17 Cleaner
production equipment accounted for 89% of investments under PAE-JBIC and 86% under IEPC1-KfW. This shows
that cleaner production equipment has become an interesting object for financing by banks and for companies to get
funding for.


4.b Non-bank financial institutions
NBFIs remain a small part of the local financial system but they can be a good source of financing for SMEs. A recent
World Bank study explores the potential of NBFIs.18

“A well-developed NBFI system can play a major role in achieving Indonesia’s development goals and can enhance
the stability of the country’s financial system. NBFIs have the potential to unlock long-term domestic resources for
investment in sectors critical to growth, such as infrastructure, and increase access to low-cost financial services.”19

“By providing additional and alternative financial services, NBFIs improve general system-wide access to finance.
They also help to facilitate longer-term investments and financing, which is often a challenge in the early stages of
bank-oriented financial sector development. The growth of contractual/collective savings institutions such as insurance
companies, pension funds, and mutual funds widens the range of products available for people and companies with

resources to invest. These institutions also provide competition for bank deposits, thereby mobilizing long-term funds
necessary for the development of equity and corporate debt markets, municipal bond markets, infrastructure finance,
mortgage bond markets, leasing, factoring and venture capital.

Collective savings institutions also allow for better risk management, while helping to reduce the potential for systemic
risk through the aggregation of resources, allocation of risk to those more willing to bear it, and application of portfolio
management techniques that spread risk across diversified parts of the financial system.”20

The same study points out: “Indonesia needs strong NBFIs for at least three reasons: (i) they can play a critical role
in mobilizing and allocating domestic resources for financing development – an urgent priority; (ii) they can reduce
the vulnerability of the financial sector to future shocks; and (iii) they can help meet other articulated Government
objectives.”21

NBFIs may be compared to a “spare tires”22 that is a must especially if you’re in for a long trip. Indonesia must still
travel long to economic prosperity and thus needs those spare tires. “It urgently needs to develop (NBFIs) if it is to
reduce the vulnerability of its still bank-dominated financial system to future shocks, which will almost inevitably
occur. It needs NBFIs and capital markets that can pick up the slack and act as shock absorbers – strong institutional
investors such as pension funds and insurance firms; well developed capital markets – both equity and fixed income;
and well-functioning other NBFIs such as leasing and venture capital firms that can support a variety of industries.”23

“NBFIs broadly provide a set of products that can be used by the society to manage individual and corporate risks
better.”24


4.c Banking policy
The Central Bank of Indonesia (BI) and the Ministry of Environment have signed an MOU envisaged to improve the
banking role in protecting the environment. In fact, the BI has been encouraging the banking sector to be concerned with
environmental issues in their financing activities through regulations. Among other regulations, these environmental
regulations for the banking sector include:
    •	 Bank Indonesia regulation no. 21/9/UKU/1989 dated 25 March 1989 on “Investment Credit and Equity
        Participation”;
    •	 Banking Law or Act no. 23 of 1999, amended through Act. No. 3 of 2004;
    •	 Bank Indonesia’s latest regulation PBI no. 7/2/PBI/2005 dated 20 January 2005, on the “Assessment of Quality
        of Productive Assets Owned by Commercial Banks” (recorded in the State Gazette no. 12 of 2005), with its
        implementing regulation Bank Indonesia Circular no. 7/3/DPNP dated 31 January 2005. It stipulates that
        productive-asset assessment by a bank to its client should refer to and comply with the Ministry of Environment’s
        guideline. It also implies that banks need to adjust their methodologies concerning the collectibility or quality
        of their credit provision by adding covenants on environmental considerations geared towards assessing the
        business sustainability of the debtors.
    •	 National ordinance relating to these legal bases are Law no. 23 of 1997 and the Government Regulation no. 27
        of 1997 on the Environmental Impact Analysis (AMDAL).

4.d CDM and the carbon market
Growing concerns of climate change was remarkably highlighted through the adoption of the United Framework on
Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) in the Earth Summit 1992, Rio de Janeiro, and discussion on climate change
issues have undergone important milestones ever since. Under a major milestone - the Kyoto Protocol of the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 1997 - developed countries listed in Annex B
(hereinafter called the “Annex B countries”), have committed to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with an
aim to stabilize the concentration of GHG in the atmosphere to a level that does not cause harm to the living beings.

CDM is one of the flexibility mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol, designed to facilitate Annex B countries to fulfill their
commitments for reducing GHG emissions, and at the same time to assist non Annex-B countries, which are mostly
developing countries, in achieving sustainable development. It is a means for developed countries (Annex B countries)
to achieve part of their target under the Kyoto Protocol by purchasing Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) from
GHG reduction projects in developing countries. CDM is the only flexibility mechanism that involves developing
countries. Under the Kyoto Protocol, developing countries have no obligation to constrain their GHG emissions, but
may, on a voluntary basis, contribute to global emission reductions by hosting CDM projects.

The clean development mechanism (CDM) is a means for developed countries to achieve part of their GHG (green
house gas) emission reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol by purchasing Certified Emission Reductions (CERs)
from GHG reduction projects in developing countries. A prerequisite for a CDM project is that it must contribute to
sustainable development in the host country. The most direct way to achieve this other objective of CDM is by offering
or serving as additional sources of technology and finance for clean technology projects.

CDM is a project-based mechanism where the emission reductions are generated through specific projects and it is
intended to promote the investment in projects in developing countries. A prerequisite for a CDM project is that it
must contribute to sustainable development in the host country. CDM projects must be validated, the projects must
be registered, their emissions reductions generated must be verified, and then the verified emission reductions must
be certified. Only the certified emission reductions can be used by Annex B countries to comply with their emission
reduction commitments.

The CDM project cycle consists of several steps as follows:

Step 1: Project Development by the Project Proponent: In the beginning, the project proponent (PP) identifies the
project idea and conducts an initial evaluation of the eligibility and feasibility of developing the project. This evaluation
will involve development of a Project Design Document (PDD) consisting of description of the baseline, baseline and
project emission calculations, emission reduction calculations, and monitoring and verification protocol. The PDD
is a formal requirement of the CDM Executive Board (CDM EB) and the format is also given by the CDM EB. The
determination of baseline is developed based on the approved baseline methodology by the CDM EB. In the absence
of an approved methodology, the PP may propose a new baseline methodology for evaluation and consideration by the
CDM EB.

Step 2: Validation and Registration: PP seeks validation by a Designated Operation Entity (DOE) –an entity accredited
by CDM EB to conduct CDM project validation. Validated projects will be then registered under CDM project
registry.

Step 3: Project Monitoring: The emission performance of the project is monitored throughout the crediting lifetime
of the project using the monitoring methodology and monitoring plan (Monitoring and verification protocol, MVP)
described in the project PDD. This is conducted on the basis of data collected on emission reductions, environmental
and social impacts, and other operational information. MVP reports are submitted to DOE for verification as a basis
for the issuance of CER.

Step 4: Verification, Certification and Issuance: Once the emission reductions verified by DOE, the emission reductions
can be certified and the CER is issued to appropriate parties.

A variety of projects are eligible under the CDM. The following list classifies the eligible CDM projects according to
sectors and technologies, as well as specific activities:25
    •	 Renewable energy technologies;
    •	 Energy efficiency improvements (supply side and/or demand side);
    •	 Fuel switching;
    •	 Combined heat and power;
    •	 Capture and destruction of methane emissions (e.g. from landfill sites, oil, gas and coal mining);
    •	 Emissions reduction from industrial processes;
    •	 Capture and destruction of GHGs other than methane (i.e. N2O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6);
    •	 Emission reductions in the transport sector;
    •	 Emission reductions in the agricultural sector;
    •	 Afforestation and reforestation (also called sink projects);
    •	 Modernisation of existing industrial units/equipment using less GHG-intensive practices/technologies
        (retrofitting);
    •	 Expansion of existing plants using less GHG intensive practices/technologies (Brownfield projects);
    •	 New construction using less GHG intensive practices/technologies (Greenfield projects).

CDM projects are also categorized as large-scale and small-scale. Small-scale projects are: (1) renewable energy projects
with a maximum output capacity equivalent to up to 15 MW; (2) energy efficiency improvement project activities
which reduce energy consumption, on the supply and/or demand side, by up to the equivalent of 60 GWh per year;
or (3) other project activities that both reduce anthropogenic emissions by sources and directly emit less than 60
kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent annually.

As of 1 March 2009, some 1,423 CDM projects had been registered at the CDM Executive Board. To this date, a
total of 261,756,264 tCO2eq have been issued. But the expected annual average CERs from these registered projects
amount to 264,170,818 tCO2eq. 23 projects have been registered from Indonesia, and 195,490 tCO2eq have been
issued as CERs. But the expected average annual CERs from the 23 projects are 3,256,883.

The table below lists the 22 registered CDM projects on which some information could be gathered. As shown, the
projects are almost equally divided between small- and large-scale CDM projects. Most are renewable energy projects
using biomass or biogas. Some of these renewable energy projects and others are recycling and utilizing wastes, thus
avoiding or recovering methane, which is a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.26

Although the additional revenue from the sale of CERs under the CDM can increase the financial feasibility of projects
there are transaction costs that place small-scale projects at a disadvantage. Transaction costs in Indonesia are estimated
to be between USD 50,000 up to USD 300,000 depending on the complexity of the project (such as the selection
of the baseline methodology and additionality compliance) and the availability of local expertise to help develop the
project. The challenge for small scale renewable energy projects in pursuing CDM revenue lies in the capability of the
project owner to pay the transaction costs in advance and the capacity of the project to produce sufficient revenues from
CDM to justify the transaction costs.27

The clean development mechanism (CDM) has promoted further cleaner production applications in the POMs because
the carbon revenue serves as an economic incentive and offer additional income to offset additional costs necessary to
implement clean technology applications.

Based on the observation of 32 POM-related projects in the Indonesian CDM pipeline as of October 23, 2008,28
seven clean technology applications in the palm oil mill industry have the potential to earn certified emission reduction
(CER) revenues:
        1.	 Bio-diesel fuel production from palm oil waste
        2.	 Biomass power plant from palm oil waste
        3.	 Biomass cogeneration
        4.	 Methane recovery from wastewater treatment
        5.	 Composting from solid and wastewater treatment
        6.	 Biogas extraction for heat generation
        7.	 Biogas extraction from POME treatment plan for bio-hydrogen production

A 2005/2006 technical assistance project by the ADB estimated the potential for GHG emissions reductions in
Indonesian palm oil mills at 6.5 million tons of CO2eq per year of which 3.3 million tons is from POME methane
sequestration. At the CER price of USD7 per tCO2, the “potential CER revenues from the sustained implementation
of the waste to energy projects in the POM are estimated at 45 million USD/yr.”29

On the other hand, the utilization of rice husk as renewable energy to generate heat and/or electricity has the potential
to be proposed as a CDM project, especially if:
    •	 The fuel which would have been used to generate heat/and/or electricity in the area is diesel or coal, which have
       high carbon content/unit energy
    •	 In case of electricity generation, the size of the power generation for rice husk-fired power plant is equal to or
       more than 5 MW. Less than 5 MW may not be suitable to be proposed as CDM project due to lower CER
       potential and may not bring valuable return from the CDM transaction costs incurred (cost for development
       of PDD, validation, registration, and verification). A 5 MW rice-husk power generation may generate CER
       of 28,000 tonnes of CO2e/year, assuming that the baseline of the project activity is diesel power generation
       with the efficiency (power output to energy input) of 30%, and CO2 emission factor of 74100 kg/TJ.30
       Theoretically on ideal basis, based on data on paddy production in the year 2008 which is given in Chapter 1,
       and the rice husk LHV of 14,204 kJ/kg, the estimated potential of CER which would be generated by rice
       husks as renewable energy in Indonesia is about 12 million tonnes.



5. Environmental and social benefits
Renewable energy technologies and options, like those mentioned earlier, contribute to reducing environmental
emissions at the global and national level as well as air pollution in cities and rural areas. In addition, renewable energy
sources and their attendant technologies have other important and proven benefits:31

      •	   Reduction of foreign exchange burden because of less reliance on energy imports;
      •	   Reduction of human-induced climate impacts caused by the use of fossil fuels;
      •	   Reduction of negative health impacts and physical damage from airborne emissions;
      •	   Increase in access to modern energy services for large parts of unserved rural population in the developing
           world, as renewable energy technologies are the most cost-effective and competitive supply options for many
           remote areas;
      •	   Increase in local economic development by creating employment, introducing new capital and innovation,
           developing new sources of revenue for households and local communities;
      •	   Reduction in the depletion rate of natural resources and help in revitalizing local economies in agriculture and
           forestry because of improved technologies for using biomass resources;
      •	   Creation of highly qualified employment in small and medium-sized enterprises by stimulating the development
           of new products and services that cater to rural energy needs; and
      •	   Creation of the potential for decentralized use, technological innovation, and opportunities for wider
           participation of people in decision-making about energy options.

The specific benefits depend on the type of technology options and the conditions or circumstances within which the
renewable energy potential is being harnessed. The renewable energy technology options discussed for the palm oil mills
would have the following environmental, social and economic benefits:
   •	 Methane emissions reductions from POME and aerobic digestion of EFBs from capturing methane and using
       it as biogas or as compost fertlizer
   •	 CO2 emissions reductions from replacement of diesel oil in the vehicles, biomass residues in the boiler, and
       fossil fuels in power plants by biogas from POME, or blend of POME and EFBs
   •	 CO2 emissions reductions from replacement of fossil-based electricity from the grid by electricity generated
       from power plants fueled by biomass residues of the POMs
   •	 Reduction in particulate emissions from uncontrolled gathering or accumulation of fibers and shells by
       transporting them for use as feedstock to biomass power plants
   •	 Reduction in other air pollutants from uncontrolled gathering or accumulation of excess EFBs and other solid
       wastes32
   •	 Increased productivity of plantations through better use of fertilizer value of POM “wastes” and residues, e.g.
       mixing of biogas effluent and EFBs, production of compost from EFBs, collection of ash from boilers and
       mixing them with waste water (or biogas effluent)
   •	 Cost savings from replacing even a small part of procured and expensive commercial fertilizers
   •	 Electrification of nearby communities from excess renewable electricity generated by POMs
   •	 Electricity supply made available to rural enterprises
   •	 Employment and livelihood opportunities arising from construction activities, operation of biomass-fired
       power plants, collection and transport of biomass residues from POMs, and growth and proliferation of rural
       enterprises as a result of available energy supply
   •	 Other social benefits of available electricity supply and ensuing increased penetration of energy in rural areas
       where POMs operate are shown below in terms of their direct and indirect contribution to the achievements
       of the MDG:

Similarly, the renewable energy technology options described earlier, particularly using rice husk residues as fuel, have
the following environmental and socio-economic benefits:
    •	 Reduction in particulate and possibly other air pollutant emissions and avoidance of methane emissions from
        exposed, dumped, or unused rice husk
    •	 Reduction in CO2 and air pollutant emission by substituting fossil fuels directly with rice husk or briquetted as
        biomass for producing steam or electricity


32	   In the same way that air pollutants are actually emitted at open dumpsites.

     •	 Reduction in CO2 and air pollutant emissions by substituting “dirtier” wood fuels with charcoal briquettes
        derived from rice husk ash as cooking fuel
     •	 Additional revenue from selling rice husk ash for use in cement kilns or as high crystalline silica for use in the
        steel and cement industries
     •	 Rural electrification benefits of producing electricity from rice husk-fired gasifiers or high-pressure steam
        generators

44         Scoping Study on Clean Technology Opportunities and Barriers in Indonesian Palm Oil Mill and Rice Mill Industries
                                                                                        C. The                           Barriers

The Scoping Study identified renewable energy options for both the palm oil mill and rice mill sectors as solutions or
opportunities for addressing both the industries’ waste management problem (cleaner production) and need for efficent
and environment-friendly energy supply (clean energy).

Regardless of context, renewable energy development and use face common barriers that are generally classified into
financial and economical, technical and marketing, legal and institutional, political and social, and awareness and
information.33 The specific barriers under each of these major categories of barriers are shown below. The table also
shows the generally applicable and workable measures to overcome those barriers.

Many of these barriers could be found in the Indonesian renewable energy market. The Scoping Study finds some
barriers more important and more relevant to the target industries.

1. Industry and technology
Both the few interviews with the palm oil and rice mills and the two returned palm oil mill questionnaires indicate
that a key technological barrier is the lack of knowledge on appropriate technological opportunities and their financial,
economic, and environmental impacts or benefits. This situation has led to expectations of low financial returns on
technology investments and perceptions of high technology and financial risks. The industry respondents also believe
that the Indonesian government has no clear policy on both cleaner production and renewable energy and offer low
prices for recovered energy. The result is low investment on clean technologies.

To be sure, the palm oil industry in Indonesia is practicing many of the clean technology measures enumerated earlier,
including:

     •	 Good housekeeping
          1.	 Process fresh fruit bunch within 24 hour after harvesting to avoid excessive production of free fatty acids
              by the natural enzymes present in the fruit
          2.	 Apply good practice in solid waste handling such as solid waste separation and application of certain
              fractions as soil cover material or reuse/ recycling in the palm oil plantation area as soon as possible to
              reduce dust and bad smell in the mill area
          3.	 Apply preventive and good maintenance practices
          4.	 Improve combustion control

     •	 On-site reuse/ recycling
          1.	 Reuse fiber and shell as fuel in boiler.
          2.	 Recycle sludge from vibrating screen to digestion tank.
          3.	 Recycle sterilized condensate to screw press and vibrating screen to reduce hot water use and to improve
               the recovery of oil from wastewater.
          4.	 Recycle hot water from vacuum tank for cleaning decanter and separator.
          5.	 Recycle steam condensate (temp 100 oC) from kernel drying tank for reuse as boiler feed water to reduce
               water use and energy for heating water.
          6.	 Recycle wastewater after anaerobic treatment for irrigation in oil palm plantation area
          7.	 Recycle sludge from wastewater treatment plant for soil conditioning and fertilizing

      •	 Process modification
            1.	 Employ an automatic autoclave for optimal sterilization conditions.
            2.	 Collect remaining unripe palm fruit to re-sterilize manually in order to reduce oil loss.
            3.	 Install 2nd bunch stripper to enhance fruit separation from bunch stalk to reduce oil loss from EFB.
            4.	 Install buffer tank to separate the sludge from the crude oil before flow to the settling tank to enhance
                oil separation, and remove sand from sludge.

Moreover, as also shown earlier, a number of industry players are exploring CDM opportunities.

Notwithstanding, the maximum potential of biomass and biogas resources generated by the industry, both as waste
management solution and clean energy option is not being exploited.



2. Policy and institutional
The Scoping Study also finds barriers in Cleaner Production and Clean Energy policies.

For one, the implementation process of Cleaner Production has experienced many delays because of the following
obstacles:34
   •	 a public policy concerning the implementation of CP has not been completed;
   •	 retrieval of technological information concerning CP ( best practice and best available technology) is still
       difficult;
   •	 capacity building and CP experience in the industrial sector, associations, governmental apparatus, consultancy
       is limited;
   •	 CP suitable for the manufacturing sector has not yet been developed;
   •	 A funding mechanism to facilitate the adoption of CP principles is still lacking;
   •	 lack of incentive to motivate and possibly subsidize activities of companies that have already applied CP.

As regards clean energy, the following barriers stand out:
    •	 Weak implementation of renewable energy policy, or policy does not provide adequate incentive.
       Ministerial Decree No. 1122/K/30/MEM on Small-Scale Power Purchase Agreement (PSK), issued in 2002, requires
       PLN to purchase electricity generated from renewable energy sources by cooperatives, private enterprises, and
       government companies or non-PLN producers for projects up to 1 MW capacity. This program known as PSK
       Tersebar has set the purchase tariffs at 80% for connection at medium voltage and 60% for connection at low
       voltage of PLN’s announced “Electricity Base Price’ (Harga Pokok Penjualan - HPP), which is supposed to be
       its marginal production cost at the location where the plant is to be built. Despite the clear potential of this
       standard offer approach and its good intentions to produce renewable energy at lower cost than the grid, “only
       a handful of mostly very small (10-100 kW) hydro facilities have been constructed.”35 This is because PLN
       has refused to commit to a long-term price based on forecast marginal production cost, a requirement for the
       long-term financing necessary for renewable power assets. Moreover, the rate at which the purchase prices have
       been set are contrary to the common and proven approach to place a premium on and guarantee a market for
       renewable energy electricity.36 The government subsidies on fossil fuels also makes the calculated marginal
       production costs of PLN questionable. Ministerial Regulation No. 2 on Medium Scale Power Generation from
       Renewable Energy Sources (PSM), issued in 2006, extends the same price guidelines as PSK for projects from 1
       MW to 10 MW but sets a minimum contract period of ten years.

36	   This is the so-called feed-in tariff, which is thought as responsible responsible for the renewable energy growth that has taken place in Germany, Denmark, and Spain.

      •	 PLN’s monopsonistic position and perceived inefficiency discourages sellers (or at least does not provide
         incentive to potential sellers). PLN remains the sole buyer of distributed electricity. This position, coupled
         with weak regulation on the utility, gives PLN great market power. In fact, PLN is viewed as the stumbling
         block to the development of renewable energy in the country.
      •	 Uneconomical nation-wide electricity tariff. The Government’s political decision to hold electricity tariffs
         constant since July 2003 and to apply a nation-wide uniform electricity tariff (TDL) continue to hide the true
         cost of supplying electricity to consumers. This of course leads to inefficiency in the use of energy and over
         consumption. The current electricity pricing policy is also not good for ensuring adequate electricity supply, as
         current prices do not give the right signal to investors.

In addition, a recent USAID-commissioned study also identified other key barriers in the energy sector that can
hamper the utilization of clean technologies in industries:37
   •	 Lack of fiscal incentives for clean and renewable energy technology. Despite an explicit policy to increase the
       share of renewable energy and accommodate connection of renewable energy technology to the grid, no fiscal
       incentives are provided for the utilization of renewable energy technology in Indonesia. The customs duties of
       about 10 percent, VAT of about 10 percent, and import income tax of 2.5 percent of the import value are also all
       applicable to clean and renewable energy technology. In 2006, the MOF issued a regulation exempting import
       duty on capital goods purchased by IPPs entering into PPA contracts with PLN. However, the promulgation of
       a new Customs and Excise Law later in the same year has effectively nullified this tax exempt regulation.
   •	 Lack of policy and regulatory coordination on rural electrification. A World Bank study38 has reported
       that there are many players in the country working on various rural electrifications programs with competing
       government departments, varying procedures, and diverse financing sources. Unfortunately, there is no
       effective coordination among the different players. There is also legal and regulatory ambiguity surrounding the
       responsibility for rural electrification. It is unclear whether the responsibility for rural electrification is given to
       the MEMR Social Electrification Unit or to the PLN. In fact, as a result PLN disbanded its Rural Electrification
       Unit.
   •	 PPA pricing. Pricing of electricity for purchase by PLN from private producers has been one of the most
       significant barriers to renewable energy IPP. PLN was required to purchase electricity-based on a tariff formula
       that used the nationwide uniform tariff (TDL) as a reference. This regulation has made small and renewable
       PPA non-bankable, as the price did not truly reflect the cost of supply. New reference prices based on local cost
       of supply were introduced in 2008 to overcome this problem. Its implementation by PLN regional units is yet
       to be confirmed.
   •	 Lack of institutional capacity. Both central government and sub-national governments lack the capacity to
       formulate and effectively implement policies and regulations. Weak political commitment and lack of budget
       support have diminished the capacity of government institutions and staff to execute policy and enforce
       regulations. Training need analyses are rarely conducted and no rigorous training plan was available. Effective
       training programs depend on collaborations with donor institutions, which program for no longer than a
       two-year period. Lack of consistency in staff selection and career advancement, together with the bureaucratic
       communication process, weaken institutional memory and eventually hinder a sustainable implementation of
       government policies

There seems to be barriers as well in terms of industrial policy. The interviewed stakeholders in the rice mill sector have
commonly pointed out the absence of government support on the sector, including paddy (or rough rice) production
and post-harvest processing (which includes rice milling).

3. Finance
Access to finance remains a key barrier to SMEs. “Although in the aggregate SME lending is growing rapidly (from
a small base), the vast majority of SMEs in Indonesia continue to face constraints in access to credit. Bank lending is
heavily collateral based – and with weak land titling and collateral documentation, especially for land, many SMEs find
the banking sector hard to access.”39

It is not without reason why banks would not finance SMEs?40 In terms of administrative lending requirements, SMEs
“often povide insufficient or unfeasible collateral and have inadequate financial reports and/or business licenses.” Banks
continue to perceive SMEs businesses as high risk because of the following:
     •	 SMEs products are regarded as innovative product,
     •	 SMEs need seed capital to develop new products
     •	 SMEs are in developing stage
     •	 SMEs need extensive funding but haven’t entered their mature period
     •	 SMEs businesses are seasonal, such as plantation and fisheries.

The banks themselves faced constraints when it comes to sustainable energy or environment finance despite the exposure
offered by the enviromental finance program of the Ministry of Environment. These constraints include:
    •	 “limited knowledge in waste management and clean development infrastructures;
    •	 lack of uniformity in implementation by banks;
    •	 rigid conditionalities by foreign partners; and
    •	 sustainable banking is still a new concept in Indonesia.”41

                                             D. Recommendations


1. Industry and technology
The palm oil and rice mill industries in Indonesia can benefit from awareness raising and capacity building particularly
on renewable energy and CDM, including latest developments in these two closely inter-related markets.

The recommended capacity building activities should be extended to local service and equipment providers and this
should be coupled with a registration scheme to upgrade the quality of local support industries.

During the dissemination workshop for the scoping study held on 14 April 2009 in Jakarta, it was also recommended to
include as participants to the proposed capacity building activities plantation cooperatives and other interest groups.

All these recommended capacity building efforts would increase the level of confidence of the target or priority sectors
and their stakeholders on renewable energy technologies. In turn, it will increase the level of confidence of the financial
sector in the two industries and in lending for clean technologies.



2. Policy
The mission statement proposed by ICPC could very well be the general framework for implementing the national
policy on cleaner production:
    •	 Create climate and condition in society condusive to the successful implementation of CP, so that further
        environmental pollution is halted and production and consumer habits change;
    •	 Develop a national draft framework to adopt CP strategy and change production and consumption patterns;
    •	 Integrate and synchronize the innovational principle of CP in rural, local and national rules and regulations;
    •	 Promote CP as priority strategy in the development program and development policy, thus aiming to alter social
        attitudes and views toward the environment.
    •	 Promote the obedience of CP measures as an effective instrument to increase competitiveness on the international
        market through eco-labelling, ISO 14000 etc.

On the other hand, the following selected policy recommendations are made for Indonesia’s energy sector:

Revive the planned electricity sector restructuring and rationalize electricity tariffs. A key recommendation for
Indonesia’s energy sector is an up-to-date review and eventual enactment of the long-delayed electricity law that would
institutionalize a multi-buyer (distribution companies or utilities, direct customers), multi-seller (distributed generators)
sector structure. This proposed restructuring of Indonesia’s electricity sector should provide more opportunities for the
spread of distributed or decentralized renewable energy systems. Coupled with increasing concern for the environment,
the restructured market will also call for internalizing environmental costs, thus making renewable energy technologies
more competitive and giving them higher market value than fossil-based technologies.

The rationalization of electricity tariffs, from wholesale to retails levels, is sine qua non to the establishment of a
competitive electricity market and its sustainability. This should start with the gradual removal of price subsidies,
while maintaining lifeline rates for the poor. It is not necessary to jump to retail electricity market model where every
customer can choose its electricity supplier, but it is necessary to allow competition in electricity generation.




50        Scoping Study on Clean Technology Opportunities and Barriers in Indonesian Palm Oil Mill and Rice Mill Industries
Put in place incentives for Green IPPs. The availability of large energy resources from biomass residues in palm oil
and rice mills is not enough to set the stage for Green IPPs, or IPPs investing in renewable energy technologies. Fiscal,
market, and other incentives are necessary to encourage entry into this industry, especially to overcome perceptions of
high technical and financial risks on renewable energy technologies. To overcome perceptions of high financial risks,
the following incentives have been proven effective in other countries:
    •	 Capital subsidies or grants
    •	 Feed-in tariffs (which is a form of price subsidy but should be technology specific)
    •	 Tax and duties exemptions and discounts
    •	 Relaxed lending policies (low interest rates, longer repayment terms, loan guarantees)

Similarly, to overcome perceptions of high technical risks, the following incentives are also used in other countries:
   •	 Priority grid connection
   •	 Net metering
   •	 Research, development and demonstration (RD&D)

In addition, the setting of national renewable portfolio standard and renewable energy targets can overcome perceived
market and policy risks.

As PLN would be the major buyer of the electricity produced by Green IPPs and considering its important stake in the
sector, it should be involved in stimulating as well as governing the market for Green IPPs.

MEMR to coordinate the policy on rural electrification, while PLN remains as one of its implementing actors.
It is appropriate that policy on national rural electrification should proceed from the MEMR, being in principle
the central energy planning and policy-making agency of the Indonesian government. MEMR should set the policy
directions and targets for increasing electricity access and work with different national and international actors (national
and international NGOs, donor organizations, etc.) to achieve these targets. In fact, PLN as a national utility should
be one of these actors and has a social responsibility to pursue rural electrificaton, particularly through its IPP program
and/or an entity within its organization that takes on this responsibility.42 World Bank, for example, proposes as one
solution for increasing electricity access in Indonesia the establishment of an independent PLN subsidiary that “would
be allowed to focus on the needs of the local area, while maintaining the decision-making autonomy necessary to
quickly address localized concerns.”43

Assist and improve image of PLN and increase its role in renewable energy development. PLN has negative image
among many sectors in Indonesia, including potential renewable energy project developers. But as a large buyer of
renewable electricity and operator of electricity supply network in the restructured electricity market, PLN has an
important role in the development of renewable energy market. For one, PLN can identify and prepare renewable
energy projects for potential private sector investments. PLN should develop standard contracts and procurement
process for small power producers, most of them would be investing in renewable energy technologies.

      separate group within its organization that aims to provide electrification in remote and small islands. Both Philippines and Indonnesia are archipelagic countries.

3. Finance
There is no doubt that banks and the financial sector are needed to achieve economic growth and sustain it. It seems
that two urgent actions at the sectoral level are needed in Indonesia’s financial sector so that it can fulfill this role:
    •	 Banks that currently dominate Indonesia’s financial landscape must be restructured or prepared to finance long-
       term assets. Right now they’re not poised to do that.
    •	 The potential of NBFIs as a source of deep and diversified long-term finance must be tapped.

On the other hand, at the level of the financial institutions, the future role of Indonesia’s financial sector as a source of
sustainable finance requires two fundamental actions at the level of the firm:
    •	 Integrate environmental/Cleaner Production criteria into investment appraisal, credit rating and loan application
       process
    •	 Develop new financial products linked to environmental performance

There are fundamental reasons why Indonesia’s banks “should undertake and stick to environmentally friendly credit
policies:
    •	 the right and responsibility of each individual towards environment protection;
    •	 the need for banks to protect themselves in their various forms of financing; and
    •	 bank management can be legally implicated for failures in complying with environment-related policies.”44

Thus, in order to protect and improve credit quality, it has been suggested that banks should include environment-
related covenants in credit agreements, such as conditions precedent, representation and warranties, affirmative
covenants, negative covenants, and events of default.”45

To be sure, the environmental soft loan program of the Ministry of Environment has improved the understanding and
awareness of Indonesia’s banks on environmental issues or environmental risks of providing funds to any enterprise (see
for example the case of Bank Negara Indonesia in Box 3). Therefore, the environmental soft loan programme is not
only a sustainable funding scheme, but also consitutes a source of learning and increased awareness and knowledge to
build the bank’s capacity in this field. Relevant bank staff will continue receiving training in environmental awareness
and tools through the capacity building activities included in the programme.

Notwithstanding, the capacity building program should be extended to the entire financial sector. The program should
revolve around renewable energy, climate change and CDM, and sustainable development.

        Case Study in Sustainable or Environment-friendly Banking: BNI
            •	 Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI), a commercial bank with a public company status, is the first
                financial institution in Indonesia to sign up to the UNEP Finance Initiative.\1
            •	 BNI’s environment risk management system includes an assessment of the environmental awareness
                of the customer, which affects the setting of interest rates.
            •	 Eco-friendly policies in BNI include training on environment awareness to loan officers, inclusion
                of environmental factors to the Industry Risk Rating, requirement of debtor’s commitment in
                environmental management, and inclusion of the factors as part of the early warning system.
            •	 BNI has participated in environment credit financing through commercial lending and soft loans
                lending provisions. To date the bank has worked with KfW in industrial efficiency and pollution
                control and with JBIC in pollution abatement equipment program.

           	 The UNEP Fnance Initiative (UNEP FI) is a partnership between UNEP and the financial sector worldwide.


Another recommendation that came out during the Dissemination Workshop in April 2009 is to replicate in Indonesia
the experiences of IFC with the Bank of Philippine Islands (BPI) in the Philippines and the Industrial Bank in Chna.
BPI partnered with IFC in establishing a Sustainable Energy Finance program that provides loans in the areas of energy
efficiency in buildings and manufacturing and renewable energy. IFC provided advisory services on strategic planning,
market analysis and development, and engineering reviews; assisted BPI in deal origination and evaluation, and pipeline
development; conducted capacity building for BPI team; and provided financial product support. On the other hand,
the Industrial Bank teamed up with IFC to launch the first energy efficinecy financing project in China. On top of
providing advsory services similar to those in the Philippines, IFC established with Industrial Bank an equally- shared
risk facility to overcome perceived market risks in energy efficiency and emisison reduction projects.

In any case, it has been recommended that Indonesian banks start a sustainable energy finance loan program with palm
oil and rice mills currently in their portfolio, as partnership has already been established with these clients and whose
creditworthiness has been established.
