          Thermal Efficiency             56% (Approximately-Combined Cycle)
          Ramp Rate                      18 MW/Min

    The mission was informed that the discussion with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)
    of the power plant is ongoing to ensure the plant to operate in FGMO. The power plant
    management has sent a request to the OEM for a technical and financial proposal in this regard.

2. Ashuganj Power Station Company Ltd. (APSCL) Power Plants: Details of all the plants of
   Ashuganj are given below. However, APSCL management has considered two new power plants
   (Ashuganj North and Ashuganj South) to participate in FGMO. These new units are ready for
   FGMO. However, the calibration and tuning of the control equipment could be necessary. The
   issue of operating in FGMO has been raised with the respective EPCs/OEMs but no reply is
   received so far.

3. BPDB Sylhet Power Plant (GT 150 MW): The ST is not yet commissioned. The manufacturer of
   the GT is Ansaldo Energia and the EPC Contractor is Shanghai Electric Company (SEC). The ramp
   rate for each unit is 11MW/min for normal loading and 30MW/min for fast loading. The unit has
   the speed/load/temp control modes. The Plant engineer couldn’t confirm its readiness for
   operating in FGMO. They wrote to Ansaldo and SEC but no reply was received. The Plant
   engineers also mentioned that the ST of this plant will be installed and process of contract award
   was going on. The FGMO commissioning could be done during that time.

4. BPDB Fenchuganj Combined Cycle Power Plant:
   - Unit-1 (2 x GT 30 MW and ST 30 MW). Made by Hitachi, Japan. Ramp Rate – 5 MW/ Min,
      Droop setting - ±4%. The power plant was built in 1994 and the capacity of the plant to
      operate in FGMO should be further assessed.
   - Unit-2 (2 x GT 30 MW and ST 30 MW). Manf. of GT – General Electric, ST – Nanjing, China.
      Ramp Rate – 5 MW/ Min, Droop setting - ±4%. The capacity of the plant to operate in FGMO
      should be further assessed.

5. BPDB Shajibazar 330 MW Power Plant:

    The plant is comprised of 2 Gas Turbines each 110 MW and one ST with 11O MW. The plant is
    new and has FGMO capabilities. The warranty period is not yet over and this is the time that
    FGMO mode can be made functional by the Contractor. BPDB is to take necessary steps in this
    regard.
