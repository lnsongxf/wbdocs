This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

      signed by a manager or/and authorized representative who is not an
      attorney, a notary public, or a chartered accountant, his/her signature
      and powers to execute such act will be certified by a notary public. The
      cost of this certification cannot be determined precisely, as each notary
      public has his/her own fees, though it should not exceed AR$ 350.

      construction work. After that, the administrative authority has 60
      working days to verify the affidavit’s accuracy and truthfulness.
      According to the Building Code, this action releases contractors
      involved in the construction from liability, leaving the owner as
      the sole liable party. Even so, neither the final approval nor the
      affidavit nor the final construction plans are required for
      municipal approval of the warehouse.

        After the customer receives the cost estimate and the details of the

        EDESUR approves the connection works carried out by the customer’s
        electrical contractor, obtains the relevant approvals from the municipality
        to do the excavation works in public spaces and finalizes the connection
        works. The installation of the meter happens on the same day that the
        connection works are carried out and the electricity starts flowing right
        away.

        The signed supply contract is a prerequisite for EDESUR to start its part
        of the connection works. By means of the supply contract the client
        commits to paying the electricity that will be consumed and to not lower
        the initial load estimate on which the connection works are based. At this
        moment, the client also has to present the electrical plans approved by
        the relevant Municipality ("Habilitacion Municipal del plano
   6    electromecánico and del plano de la instalación eléctrica"). After the     21 calendar days    ARS 2,705.45
        supply contract has been signed, EDESUR inspects the part of the
        connection works that was carried out by the customer’s electrical
        contractor, and finalizes the connection works.

        Since August 2012, according to the Resolución ENRE 0215/2012, the
        EDESUR charges a contribución especial reembolsable (CER) for new
        connections. The CER is reimbursed to the client through electricity bills.
        The reimbursement happens in a maximum of 48 equal payments
        reimbursed with interests.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      Obtain a Real Estate Reference Value (Valor Inmobiliario de
      Referencia)

      Property transfers in the City of Buenos Aires and some parts of the
      Province of Buenos Aires require a “Valor Inmobiliario de Referencia
      (VIR)” (Real Estate Reference Value”). The VIR was introduced by
      Resolutión Nº 67-AGIP-10 of February 10, 2010 and later amended by       Less than a day
      Resolutión Nº 435-AGIP-11 of August 3, 2011. A VIR is assigned to every (online procedure
      property by the revenue agency and it sets a minimum base to calculate and simultaneous               no cost

      the stamp tax. The VIR aims to prevent the undervaluation of properties
                                                                               with procedures
      done to pay less stamp duty on property transfers.
                                                                                     1, 2 and 3)
      The notary has the responsibility to check the VIR, since the stamp duty
      will be calculated on the greater value between VIR, the fiscal valuation
      ('valuación fiscal') and the sale price agreed by parties. The procedure is
      free and it can be obtained online by the notary through the revenue
      agency website www.agip.gob.ar. However, not all the properties in the
      City of Buenos Aires have been assigned a VIR yet. In these cases the

    In June 2015, TaxpayerCo. makes a large capital
     purchase: one additional machine for
     manufacturing pots.
    The value of the machine is 65 times income per
     capita of the economy.
    Sales are equally spread per month (that is,
     1,050 times income per capita divided by 12).
    Cost of goods sold are equally expensed per
     month (that is, 875 times income per capita
     divided by 12).
    The seller of the machinery is registered for VAT
     or general sales tax (GST).
    Excess input VAT incurred in June will be fully
     recovered after four consecutive months if the
     VAT or GST rate is the same for inputs, sales and
     the machine and the tax reporting period is
     every month.

for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                 After Mirage's default, it is very likely that BizBank would enforce its security

                                Based on the assumptions of the case at stake, it is likely that BizBank will
                               require the sale of the property used as collateral in satisfaction of secured
Outcome       piecemeal sale       loan. Mirage consequently will enforce the collateral through formal
                             foreclosure. At this point, the hotel would cease operating and all its assets will
                                                             be sold piecemeal.

                                 The foreclosure procedure in Buenos Aires will take approximately 2.75 years
                                 from the moment of Mirage’s default until the debt is repaid to the secured

                                    The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 14.5% of
                                    the value of the debtor's estate. The cost breakdown is the following: Court

on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

very high relative to the average), an increase has a

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
