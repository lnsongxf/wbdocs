I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better understanding
of how stakeholders in Tajikistan perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    ▪ General Issues Facing Tajikistan
    ▪ Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    ▪ World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    ▪ The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    ▪ Working with the World Bank Group
    ▪ The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Tajikistan
    ▪ Communication and Information Sharing
    ▪ Background Information


II. Methodology
From January to February 2017, 534 stakeholders of the WBG in Tajikistan were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a Country Opinion
Survey. Participants were drawn from the office of the President/Prime Minister, office of a
Minister, office of a Parliamentarian, employees of ministries/ministerial departments/
implementation agencies, Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of
WBG projects or consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs, local
government office or staff, bilateral/multilateral agencies, private sector organizations, the
financial sector/private banks, civil society organizations, the media, independent government
institutions, academia/research institutes/think tanks, and the judiciary branch.

A total of 362 stakeholders participated in the survey (68% response rate). Respondents either
received the questionnaire via courier and returned it accordingly, received an invitation via
email and completed the questionnaire online, or completed the questionnaire with a
representative from the fielding agency.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the WBG’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions
are identified throughout the survey report.

The results of this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY ‘14 (response rate was 57%, N = 272). The data were weighted to reach similar
stakeholder compositions across the two survey years, allowing for more statistically reliable
comparisons. Note, there were insufficient numbers of respondents from the office of the
President/Prime Minister in FY ’14 to be included in these analyses. Also, stakeholders who
identified themselves as “Other” in the stakeholder category options were not included in these
comparisons. As a result, mean ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of
respondents in both years are slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY
‘14 COS report and the non-weighted data presented in this report. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (see page 73).

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
     ▪   Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey indicated significantly
         higher levels of familiarity with the WBG compared to respondents from the FY ‘14
         Country Survey (weighted mean in FY ‘17 = 6.6; weighted mean in FY ‘14 = 5.3)1.
     ▪   Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG gave significantly higher
         ratings of familiarity with the WBG (mean rating = 7.6) than respondents who do not
         collaborate with the WBG (mean rating = 5.3).
     ▪   Impact of Familiarity: Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the WBG were strongly,
         significantly correlated with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in
         Tajikistan, and moderately, significantly, correlated with the extent to which the WBG’s
         work helps to achieve development results and the extent to which the WBG plays a
         relevant role in development in Tajikistan.

   ▪   Stakeholders: Respondents from local government and PMUs/Consultants on WBG-
       supported projects had the highest mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the
       twenty-six COS indicator questions whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral

      supported projects, and independent government institutions had the highest levels of
      agreement that “Overall the World Bank Group currently plays a relevant role in
      development in Tajikistan” whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies and
      the media had significantly lower mean ratings. Respondents from local government,
      PMUs/Consultants on WBG-supported projects, and independent government institutions
      had the highest levels of agreement that “The WBG’s work is aligned with what I
      consider the development priorities for Tajikistan” whereas respondents from the office
      of the President/Prime Minister, bilateral/multilateral agencies, and the media had
      significantly lower mean ratings. Responses for individual questions by stakeholder
      groups can be found in Appendix B (see page 52).

Overall Perceptions
   ▪   Stakeholders: There were significant differences between stakeholder groups in their levels
       of agreement across all of these aspects of how the WBG operates. For the most part,
       respondents from PMUs/Consultants on WBG-supported projects tended to have the
       highest levels of agreement whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies tended
       to have significantly lower levels of agreement (refer to Appendix B, page 52, for a

    projects tended to give the highest ratings whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral

Appendix E: Responses to Select Questions by Year16
Comparing responses across Country Surveys reflect changes in attitudes over time, but also changes in respondent
samples and changes to the survey instrument itself. To reduce the influence of the latter factor, only those
questions with similar response scales/options were analyzed. To reduce the influence of the former, the samples
from both FY14 and FY17 were weighted to have equivalent stakeholder groups.

development in Tajikistan or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following

A local independent firm has been hired to oversee the logistics of this survey. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid.

Finally, the survey relates to the World Bank Group’s work. The World Bank Group consists of IBRD, IDA, IFC,
MIGA, and ICSID. When responding to the survey, please consider the area of the World Bank Group with which
you are most familiar.
