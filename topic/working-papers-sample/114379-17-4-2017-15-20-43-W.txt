     Help the water sector “get its house in order”

     •	 Support and fund improvements in governance, regulation, and sector capacity.
     •	 Set higher expectations for improved technical and financial efficiency, including capital efficiency.
     •	 Establish incentive frameworks to encourage management actions better aligned with meeting the SDGs.
     Set in motion a culture and cycle of improved sector performance

     •	 Promote a culture of efficiency by making service providers accountable for results.
     •	 Instigate a virtuous cycle of sector performance to attract commercial finance.
     Allocate sufficient and well-targeted resources to the water sector

     •	 Explicitly target public funds to investments that yield the highest return.
     •	 Where possible, leverage public and concessional funds to crowd in commercial finance.
     Support the transition to commercial finance

     •	 Consider domestic commercial finance before borrowing in foreign exchange.
     •	 Support the development of domestic capital markets and encourage domestic investors to consider water
        sector investment, potentially through supportive regulation.

     Start now

     •	 Take an incremental approach that aims to increase commercial finance by 10–20 percent and build on that.
     •	 Examine how other countries have used financial enhancements to ease the transition.
