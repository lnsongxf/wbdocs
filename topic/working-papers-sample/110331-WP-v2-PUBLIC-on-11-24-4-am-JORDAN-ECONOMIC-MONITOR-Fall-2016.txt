fell by 3.8 percent 8M-2016 yoy; with domestic
exports to Iraq down 40.6 percent. While continued
low oil prices compared to 8M-2015 help reduce
Jordan’s import bill, pressure on the current account
stems in part from a reduction in remittances (-4.0
percent 9M-2016 yoy). Such pressures have led to
a widening of the current account to 12.7 percent
of GDP (H1-2016) and have affected Jordan’s gross
international reserves which decreased by 11.1
percent to US$12.6 billion (7.9 months of imports)
by end-September 2016 compared to end-2015.

vi.      The outlook is subject to downside risks.
Compared to the region, Jordan’s growth forecast
of 2.3 percent for 2016 is in line with the average
growth rate for the Middle East and North Africa.
However, higher frequency of security incidents are
materializing around Jordan and could further depress
consumer and investor confidence. Containing the
fiscal deficit and implementing the new IMF program
will be challenging as some adjustment measures
could be considered socially sensitive. In parallel,
the implementation of planned reforms to improve
the functioning of the labor market, improve the
investment climate and unlock access to finance
which are vital to stimulate economic activity, and
improve welfare. Finally, Jordan’s external position
would face further pressures if expected grants and
concessional financing do not materialize and grants
are not sustained and increased.

 Policy makers often refer to the potential output gap as a proxy of the economy’s performance or lack thereof.
 The potential output gap depicts how far off the economy is from the output it would have generated had it operated
 with its maximum capacity (i.e. fully employed factors of production).
 There are several techniques referred to in the literature for estimating potential output gap. Two estimation
 techniques with variations are employed in the following for a holistic and robust approach. The Hodrick-Prescott
 (HP) filter, a de-trending statistical method, is employed using three standard smoothing parameters (1600, 1000,
 500). The output gap for Jordan is estimated on annual data over the sample period 1975-2018 as well as on quarterly
 data over the sample period Q1-1992 – Q4-2016. Data post Q2-2016 is obtained from World Bank staff projections.
 Annual output gap is also estimated using a Production Function model (as of 1990), which is a structural method
 incorporating economic theory that relates output to total factor productivity and production inputs.
 The economy has been operating below its potential since 2013 when the output gap turned negative for the
 first time since 2005. Results show that the economy was suffering from a negative and widening output gap from
 the mid-1990s until mid-2000s. In 2005, the economy embarked on a period of high growth during which it operated
 above potential recording a positive output gap until 2009 when it reached +5.27 percent (on average across the four
 estimation techniques employed) of potential output (Figure 5). Since then, the output gap has been narrowing and
 even became negative in 2013. The annual output gap estimates for 2013 have an average of -0.03 percent across
 the four different methods, after being +0.65 percent in 2012. The annual output gap further widened to reach an
 average of -1.05 percent of potential output in 2015 and is forecasted to continue deteriorating to reach -1.74 percent
 in 2016.
 The numerous estimation methods employed yield similar trajectories for the potential output gap, particularly
 when applied with quarterly data. The magnitudes of the quarterly output gap estimates from the different HP filters*
 are very close (Figure 6). This diversity in the use of estimation techniques provides a wide scope for robustness
 and cross-checking that further validates the estimation process. The output gap estimates from the HP filter with
 the three different smoothing parameters are negative in all quarters of 2013. This is in line with the annual data. In
 the first quarter of 2016, output gap reached an average of -0.58 percent of potential output, which was the lowest
 recorded since Q4-2012. Although still negative, the output gap showed a modest pickup in Q2-2016 to reach -0.38
 percent of potential output. The gap is expected to turn positive by the third quarter of 2016 to reach +0.13 percent
 of potential output.
 Despite the uncertainty in estimating a country’s output gap, the various estimates unanimously show that
 the Jordanian economy is operating below its potential. This result is in line with other indicators that reflect idle
 capacity such as high unemployment rates, persistent deflation, among others.

                            Box 3. A Closer Scrutiny on Job Creation in Jordan between 2007 and 2014.


 Unemployment rates remain elevated despite positive growth in Jordan. While real GDP grew by 29.2 percent
 between 2007 and 2014, unemployment only dropped slightly from 13.1 percent in 2007 to 11.9 percent in 2014
 (Figure 12). This is in line with Jordan’s low aggregate employment-growth elasticity, previously estimated at 0.53
 between 2000 and 2009.* Even though the number of unemployed Jordanians dropped from 8,008 in 2007 to 5,511
 in 2014, it was offset by a larger drop in the Jordanian labor force. In fact, there were 61,043 economically active
 Jordanians in 2007 compared to 46,348 in 2014. The contraction in the Jordanian labor force is one explanation for
 the persistently high unemployment rates.

 While the Jordanian economy has been registering positive growth rates, this growth has not been inclusive
 in terms of job creation across sectors. Total jobs created dropped by 29 percent between 2007 and 2014 (-4.3
 percent average annual growth rate) (Figure 13). In absolute terms, there were 70,356 net jobs created in 2007 versus
 49,935 net jobs created in 2014. Out of the total jobs lost between 2007 and 2014, 16.1, 21.1 and 30.1 percent
 corresponded to sectors covering education; real estate, renting and business activities; and private households with
 employed persons, respectively. On the other hand, mining and quarrying and hotels and restaurants contributed
 positively to total job creation during the period of 2007-2014.

 A closer scrutiny of the data shows that job creation was worse in the private sector than in the public sector.
 Job creation in the private sector shrank at an average annual growth rate of -4.54 percent between 2007 and 2014
 compared to -0.37 percent in the public sector. In fact, out of the total jobs lost between 2007 and 2014, 75.8 percent
 stemmed from the private sector.

 Job creation for Jordanians was slower than that for non-Jordanian workers in the Kingdom especially for
 those with a bachelor’s degree and above. Out of the 20,421 jobs lost between 2007 and 2014, 66.1 percent
 were occupied by Jordanians versus 33.9 percent by non-Jordanians. Moreover, out of the Jordanians who lost their
 jobs, 37.8 percent had bachelor degrees and above and 25.4 percent had secondary level education. However, job
 prospects improved for Jordanians with basic education only. This depicts shifts in the labor market dynamics in
 Jordan. Moreover, data is not that stark with non-Jordanians as all education categories suffer from job losses almost
 proportionally between 2007 and 2014. More noticeably, 15.1 percent of the non-Jordanians who lost their job had
 elementary level education and 13.1 percent had secondary level education. However, only 2.8 percent of bachelor
 holders lost their jobs among the non-Jordanians.

certain line items above others. In terms of budget
execution, every month the Education Directorates
submit their payment requests, which are compiled

Finance. Every year, certain line items run out

the recent experience with devising a 3-year plan

stakeholders in Jordan seem well poised for similar
planning for lagging regions in the country.

the reaction to the shock” (Bleaney, 1996, p. 465)
by restoring macroeconomic stability, thus reducing
uncertainty which correlates negatively with the
level of productivity and investment (Fischer, 1993).
Such policies include fiscal consolidation, inflation
and exchange rate stability, among other things.

68.      In addition to the above local factors,
external conditions can have a major influence on
a domestic economy following the recent events.
Collier and Hoeffler (2004) argued that external aid
has a considerable effect in boosting growth following
post-instability situations. While the international
community has been helping Jordan withstand the
large influx of Syrian refugees since 2011, much
effort is still needed. Another global link that might
positively impact the pace of economic recovery is
trade openness, particularly through higher exports.
As argued by Elbadawi and Soto (2013) trade affects
growth by increasing productivity, expanding
markets and spreading technological innovation,
among other things. In that spirit, the recent relaxed
rules of origin deal signed with the EU is likely to
increase exports and consequently speed-up the
pace of economic recovery.

69.      Lastly, Jordan can benefit from its highly
educated population to recover. As suggested by
Gennaioli et al. (2013), entrepreneurship is a main
channel through which education boosts economic
activity. In particular, highly skilled entrepreneurs
tend to be innovative economic agents who are likely
to find new ways of overcoming problems, hence
boosting productivity, creating jobs and consequently
helping the overall economy. Moreover, higher
levels of education allow individuals to cope more
efficiently with sudden changes in the economic
environment. In the context of Jordan, the primary
school enrollment, a widely used proxy for human
capital, stood at 88.7 percent in 2012. This suggests,
that if utilized efficiently, Jordanians are able to find
new and productive ways to boost the economy.
However, a weak business environment is preventing
skilled labor from fully realizing its potential. As        22 Jordan’s ranking in the World Bank Group’s Doing Business
