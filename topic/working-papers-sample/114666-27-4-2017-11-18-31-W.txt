Abstract


T
          he current state of knowledge on climate change and water points to predominantly negative effects on the
          economy and society. This paper reviews the literature on these effects by geographical region and notes
          the differences as well as the uncertainties.

An important feature of the projections is the fact that the climate effects will occur on top of a water scarcity sit-
uation that currently prevails in many parts of the world. The impact of climate change on scarcity is generally
small compared to the impact of the socioeconomic factors. Adopting steps to increase the efficiency of water use
could make a big contribution to addressing water problems, including those caused by climate change.

In-depth estimates of damages from climate change related to water have been made to 2060 and, less accurately,
to 2100. The 2060 estimates indicate that the negative impacts from changes in water supply or changes in water-­
related extreme events and marine flows could amount to about 1.5 percent of GDP in 2060 in the absence of
mitigation or adaptation. This average figure, however, may be an underestimate for a number of reasons.
­
Estimates to 2100 of potential damages in economic terms are even more uncertain, but there are strong reasons
to believe they will be greater as a percentage of GDP—perhaps around 10 percent globally, and possibly even
higher.

Adaptation can make a major contribution to reducing damages from climate change in all mitigation scenarios,
and more so when mitigation is absent or limited. Adaptation will require both private and public actions.
Adaptation measures need further analysis to include more of the softer options (such as those involving the use
of ecosystems) and to incorporate steps to increase efficiency in the use of scarce water, as well as other resources.

In terms of next steps, work is needed on how future economic growth could be affected by the effects of climate
change on water and on water-related extreme events. In addition, a better understanding of how increases in the
efficiency of water use could affect the water-energy-economic nexus in the context of climate change is needed.
Finally, a better estimate of the likely reduction of damages from adaptation is needed, based on a detailed
bottom-up assessment rather than a top-down one.

       Box 1.   Modelling the Economic Impacts of Climate Change


       Estimates of the economic costs of climate change are generally conducted using Integrated Assessment
       Models (IAMs) with long-term perspectives, to the end of this century and beyond.a Most of these studies
       have a stylized, aggregated representation of the economy focusing on projections of climate change
       impacts over time. They often include highly aggregated integrated structures, in which climate change
       impacts in different sectors are aggregated and used to re-evaluate welfare in the presence of climate
       change. An IAM projection is presented in detail in the section on the Uncertainty of Cost Projections.

       A smaller strand of literature uses computable general equilibrium (CGE) models to examine the economic
       implications of climate change impacts in specific sectors, often using a comparative static approach.b
       Because CGE models have a more disaggregated structure, they need more information to determine
       annual equilibria, and to run them forward, linking annual changes for more than 40 to 50 years, becomes
       very difficult. On the other hand, they can track the impacts of climate in a more detailed way than IAMs,
       which rely on reduced form functions linking impacts to temperature. Recent work at the Organisation
       for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2015a) has attempted to address these issues by
       combining a CGE model to investigate the economic impacts of climate change to 2060 with an IAM model
       (AD-RICE) to look at impacts beyond that. Because their results are similar to a number of other models for
       the two periods, it is instructive to discuss them in some detail.

       The OECD CGE model (ENV-Linkages) contains 35 economic sectors and 25 regions. It models trade flows
       as well as capital accumulation using capital vintages, in which technological advances trickle down only
       slowly over time to affect existing capital stocks. The model estimates the impacts of changes in different
