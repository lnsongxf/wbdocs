1.	Introduction	
	
	
What	determines	entry	and	successful	participation	in	export	markets?		What	role	does	
the	 real	 exchange	 rate	 play	 in	 that	 process,	 and	 what	 other	 factors	 are	 at	 play?	 As	 the	
productivity	 and	 growth	 gains	 from	 integration	 into	 the	 global	 marketplace	 are	 better	
understood,	policy	makers	across	the	world	seek	to	understand	what	drives	firms’	entry	
into	 export	 markets,	 and	 their	 subsequent	 success	 in	 them.	 This	 paper	 addresses	 the	
above	question	in	the	context	of	Polish	manufacturing	firms.		
	
Poland	has	often	been	cited	as	an	example	of	a	successful	transition	from	middle	to	high	
income.	 That	 transition	 happened	 on	 the	 back	 of	 a	 productive	 transformation	 led	 by	
private	sector	firms.		Over	the	last	fifteen	years,	firms	in	Poland	have	become	increasingly	
internationalized.	New	firms	have	entered	export	markets,	and	firms	already	exporting	
have	increased	the	intensity	of	their	exposure	to	foreign	markets	(Albinowski	et	al.	2015).	
The	decrease	in	trade	costs	that	resulted	from	the	association	with	the	EU,	and	the	formal	
accession	 to	 the	 market	 were	 important	 drivers	 of	 this	 process,	 coupled	 with	 the	
increasingly	 important	 fragmentation	 of	 the	 production	 process	 across	 borders	 –	 the	
emergence	 of	 international	 production	 networks.	 From	 a	 firm‐level	 perspective,	 what	
were	the	underlying	factors	that	facilitated	this	internationalization?	Why	did	some	firms	
thrive	and	grow	while	others	struggle	to	compete?	
	
The	paper	focuses	on	real	exchange	rate	and	non‐real	exchange	rate	related	determinants	
of	 export	 performance,1	 such	 as	 sunk	 costs,	 location	 and	 sectoral	 spillovers,	 financial	
constraints,	and	productivity.	This	paper	contributes	to	the	literature	by	analyzing	the	
export	performance	of	Polish	firms	during	a	crucial	period	of	productive	transformation	
associated	 with	 the	 enlargement	 of	 the	 European	 Union.	 The	 Polish	 case	 is	 useful	 to	
understand	 other	 transition	 processes	 that	 firms	 in	 Central	 and	 Eastern	 Europe	 and	
beyond	face	when	operating	in	a	context	of	substantial	pro‐market	reforms	and	increased	
market	 access.	 The	 analysis	 integrates	 the	 major	 determinants	 considered	 in	 the	
literature,	and	explores	two	different	but	complementary	sources	of	data.	First,	a	panel	
survey	of	Polish	firms	for	the	period	2005‐2013	that	contains	detailed	information	on	
firms’	characteristics	and	their	export	performance.	Second,	an	exporter‐level	customs	
data	set	for	the	same	period	of	analysis.		Customs	data	provide	detailed	information	on

 The real exchange rate has been often identified as a key determinant of export performance in Poland and
elsewhere. For example, in 2009 the exchange rate of PLN against the EUR depreciated over a 6 month period
by 40% that is believed to help Poland maintain its competitiveness and dampen the effect of the financial crisis,
see e.g. Toroj (2012).

products	exported	and	their	destination	and	allow	a	more	accurate	analysis	of	the	impact	
of	destination‐specific	exchange	rate	movements	and	their	volatility.		
	
Along	the	lines	of	Melitz	(2003)	and	the	related	strand	of	literature,	we	show	that	firm‐
level	 productivity	 is	 important	 for	 export	 participation.	 Polish	 exporters	 are	 also,	 on	
average	larger,	and	more	likely	to	be	foreign	owned	than	other	firms.	Our	results	show	
that	 firms	 face	 high	 sunk	 costs	 for	 entering	 the	 export	market,	 which	 make	 firms	 that	
exported	in	the	previous	year	50	percent	more	likely	to	export	also	in	the	following	year.	
The	 returns	 of	 having	 paid	 these	 sunk	 costs,	 however,	 depreciate	 rapidly	 over	 time	
meaning	that	firms	rapidly	lose	the	benefits	of	the	initial	investments	if	they	exit	export	
markets.	We	identify	strong	positive	local	spillovers	indicating	that	proximity	between	
exporters	 in	 the	 same	 sector	 reduces	 entry	 costs.	 Similar	 to	 recent	 findings	 in	 the	
literature	(Amiti	et	al.,	2014;	Ahmed	et	al.,	2015),	we	find	that	impact	of	real	exchange	
rate	 fluctuations	 on	 firms’	 export	 performance	 is	 highly	 dependent	 on	 the	 degree	 of	
integration	in	regional	or	global	value	chains.	The	effect	of	real	exchange	rate	movements	
on	export	decisions	is,	therefore,	heterogeneous	across	and	within	sectors,	and	affects	the	
most	firms	with	low	shares	of	imported	intermediate	goods.	In	particular,	firms	in	the	
motor	vehicles	sector	are	more	likely	to	be	relatively	hedged	against	an	appreciation	of	
the	 Polish	 Zloty,	 as	 they	 show	 the	 highest	 intensity	 of	 imported	 intermediates.	 The	
opposite	 is	 expected	 for	 firms	 in	 the	 furniture,	 wood,	 printing	 and	 media,	 other	 non‐
metallic	mineral	or	food	and	beverages	sectors	that	rely	mostly	on	domestic	inputs.	The	
findings	 are	 complemented	 using	 customs‐level	 data	 that	 allow	 us	 to	 determine	 the	
relevant	source	of	exchange	rate	variability.	The	additional	findings	confirm	the	negative	
impact	of	exchange	rate	appreciation	and	volatility	on	export	performance	for	small	and	
medium	size	firms.	Finally,	results	confirm	that	also	liquidity	plays	a	role	in	facilitating	
entry	in	the	export	market.	When	focusing	on	export	intensity	rather	than	entry,	the	most	
relevant	determinant	of	export	intensity	is	productivity	growth,	although	the	impact	is	
economically	small.	Real	exchange	rate	movements,	instead,	have	no	significant	impact	
on	export	volumes,	but	its	volatility	does	negatively	affect	performance	when	examined	
with	detailed	export‐transaction	data.		
	
The	remainder	of	this	paper	is	structured	as	follows.	Section	2	discusses	the	literature	on	
determinants	of	export	participation	and	intensity.	Section	3	presents	the	methodology,	
and	section	4	describes	the	data.	Section	5	discusses	the	results	on	the	drivers	of	export	
entry,	and	section	6	discusses	the	results	on	export	intensity.	Section	7	concludes.

2.	Literature	Review	
The	determinants	of	export	participation	and	export	intensity	have	been	largely	studied	
in	the	empirical	literature.	A	survey	of	the	literature	can	help	understand	some	of	the	
drivers	 of	 export	 dynamics,	 although	 most	 papers	 tend	 to	 focus	 on	 only	 one	 of	 the	
several	aspects	influencing	export	decisions.	In	this	paper,	we	aim	at	testing	the	five	
major	 channels	 identified	 in	 the	 literature	 with	 Polish	 data:	 real	 exchange	 rate	
fluctuations,	sunk	costs,	geographical	and	sectoral	spillovers,	financial	conditions,	and	
productivity.		
	
First,	we	look	at	the	role	of	real	exchange	rate	changes.	Large	real	exchange	changes	may	
have	long‐lasting,	firm‐level	composition	effects	if	they	irreversibly	impact	on	entry	and	
exit	into	and	from	export	markets	(Baldwin	and	Krugman,	1989).	Such	an	impact	depends	
on	 the	 characteristics	 of	 the	 economy	 at	 large,	 on	 the	 characteristics	 of	 the	 individual	
firms	populating	it	and	on	the	nature	of	the	interactions	between	firms.			
	
However,	in	the	world	of	global	value	chains,	effective	changes	in	the	RER	(as	perceived	
by	firms)	may	depend	on	the	degree	of	involvement	in	both	imports	and	exports,	and	
these	relationships	are	not‐trivial,	as	shown	by	e.g.:	Bems	and	Johnson	(2012)	and	Patel	
et	 al.	 (2014).	 	 Ahmed	 et	 al.	 (2015)	 show	 that	 in	 firms	 integrated	 in	 international	
production	networks,	the	import‐content	of	products	will	be	larger,	while	the	effect	of	the	
real	exchange	rate	on	exports	acts	through	the	effect	on	the	domestic	value	added.	In	fact	
this	 literature	 identifies	 a	 decline	 in	 the	 export	 responsiveness	 to	 real	 exchange	 rate	
changes	 as	 international	 production	 networks	 became	 more	 prominent.2	 Most	
interestingly,	 this	 empirical	 result	 seems	 to	 be	 capturing	 a	 change	 in	 firms’	 trading	
patterns,	rather	than	just	an	increase	in	their	import‐content	shares.	With	international	
production	networks,	most	trade	happens	among	firms	(‘business‐to‐business’)	rather	
than	from	firm	to	consumer,	or	final	demand.	With	complex	production	processes,	costs	
of	switching	suppliers	are	likely	to	make	purchase	decisions	more	inelastic	to	prices,	at	
least	 within	 a	 relatively	 small	 range.	 This	 may	 also	 affect	 the	 export	 response	 to	 real	
exchange	rate	changes.	Those	effects	may	be	even	more	straightforward	in	Poland,	given	
that	most	of	its	imports	and	exports	is	with	the	rest	of	the	EU	and	is	denominated	in	euro	
(EUR),	Polish	zloty	(PLN)	or	to	a	smaller	extent	in	USD,	which	makes	it	highly	probable	
that	a	firm’s	imports	and	exports	may	be	denominated	in	the	same	currency.	3	
	
Second,	 we	 consider	 the	 role	 of	 sunk	 costs	 in	 preventing	 participation	 in	 the	 export	
market	(Dixit,	1989;	Baldwin	and	Krugman,	1989).	In	particular,	following	Bernard	and	
Jensen	 (2004),	 we	 test	 for	 the	 presence	 of	 entry	 costs	 by	 looking	 at	 the	 effects	 of	

2	In	line	with	this	argument,	Amiti	et	al.	(2014),	for	example	developed	a	theoretical	framework	with	

variable	markups	and	imported	inputs	predicting	that	firms	with	high	import	shares	and	high	market	
shares	will	have	low	exchange	rate	pass	through.	Their	prediction	was	empirically	confirmed	using	
Belgian	data.

exporting	yesterday	on	exporting	today.	The	high	fixed	costs	associated	with	exporting	
are	important	barriers,	in	particular	for	small	and	medium	enterprises	to	participate	in	
the	global	marketplace.		
	
Third,	activities	of	neighboring	firms	may	affect	a	firm’s	entry	costs	into	export	markets	
due	to	spillover	effects.	For	example,	a	cluster	of	firms	in	a	given	location	may	increase	
the	 supply	 of	 necessary	 skills	 for	 a	 particular	 activity,	 improve	 infrastructure	 or	
increase	the	stock	of	information	about	foreign	markets	that	may	be	available	to	other	
firms.	On	the	other	hand,	a	high	concentration	of	firms	in	a	specific	location	may	push	
input	 prices	 upwards	 through	 increased	 demand,	 which	 may	 affect	 other	 firms	
negatively.		For	these	reasons	the	sign	of	the	effect	is	a	priori	ambiguous	and	warrants	
an	 empirical	 investigation.	 For	 example,	 Koening	 et	 al.	 (2010)	 examine	 local	 export	
spillovers	in	France,	on	the	decision	to	start	exporting,	and	on	the	export	intensity.	They	
find	evidence	of	positive	spillovers	on	the	former,	but	not	on	the	latter,	suggesting	that	
spillovers	act	through	fixed	rather	than	variable	costs.	They	also	find	spillovers	to	be	
stronger	 when	 specific:	 by	 product	 and	 destination,	 and	 not	 significant	 when	
considered	on	all	products,	all	destinations.	They	also	find	that	they	decay	spatially	–	
they	decline	with	distance.	Bernard	and	Jensen	(2004),	instead,	find	no	role	for	export	
spillovers	on	the	export	decision	of	manufacturing	firms	in	the	United	States.	Closer	to	
home,	Cieslik	and	Hagemejer	(2010),	who	study	export	spillovers	in	Poland,	find	that	
the	probability	of	exporting	by	domestic	firms	is	positively	related	to	the	geographic	
concentration	of	export	activities	by	multinationals.	
	
Fourth,	 we	 explore	 whether	 a	 firm’s	 financial	 conditions	 affect	 the	 decision	 to	 enter	
export	markets.	A	priori,	given	the	high	fixed	costs	associated	with	exporting,	and	the	
fact	that	production	takes	time	and	there	is	a	lag	between	the	moment	in	which	inputs	
are	 purchased	 and	 the	 moment	 in	 which	 revenues	 are	 cashed,	 exporting	 firms	 have	
particularly	high	financial	needs	(see	Greenaway	et	al.,	2007).	
	
Finally,	 productivity,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 has	 been	 identified	 as	 one	 of	 the	 most	
important	 factors	 underlying	 the	 fuzzy	 concept	 of	 “competitiveness”	 (e.g.:	 Krugman,	
1994;	 Porter,	 2011).4	 Firms’	 productivity	 levels,	 being	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 the	 income	
convergence	 process	 of	 a	 country,	 interact	 in	 complex	 ways	 with	 their	 degree	 of	
internationalization,	 including	 foreign	 ownership,	 and	 participation	 in	 export	 and	
import	 markets.	 More	 productive	 firms	 are	 better	 positioned	 to	 face	 the	 highly	
demanding	international	markets,	and	in	turn	they	become	more	productive	by	facing	
increased	competition	and	by	learning	from	sophisticated	competitors	and	clients.	On	
the	theoretical	front,	self‐selection	of	most	productive	firms	into	export	markets	has	
been	elaborated	by	Melitz	(2003)	and	several	subsequent	papers.	
	



4	Krugman	(1994)	argues	that	“competitiveness”	would	turn	out	to	be	a	funny	way	of	saying	productivity.

Evidence	 on	 drivers	 of	 the	 intensive	 margin	 –	 the	 determinants	 of	 export	 intensity,	 is	
scarcer.	Campa	(2004)	a,	for	example,	has	found	that	exchange	rate	changes,	as	well	as	
some	 firm‐level	 characteristics,	 can	 impact	 on	 both	 the	 decision	 to	 export	 and	 export	
intensity.	Héricourt	and	Poncet	(2015)	demonstrate	that	real	exchange	rate	volatility	is	
an	important	factor	that	influences	both	extensive	and	intensive	margins	of	exports.	Real	
exchange	 rate	 appreciations	 make	 the	 foreign	 export	 price	 of	 goods	 and	 services	
produced	 by	 domestic	 firms	 more	 expensive,	 but	 also	 make	 the	 inputs	 they	 import	
cheaper.		As	argued	above,	Koening	(2010)	finds	no	evidence	of	spillovers	on	the	intensity	
of	exporting.		

3.	Methodology	
In	 this	 section,	 we	 present	 the	 methodology	 adopted	 to	 estimate	 the	 determinants	 of	
export	participation	(extensive	margin)	and	export	size	(intensive	margin).	


         Export	participation	

We	 test	 several	 hypotheses	 about	 the	 factors	 that	 increase	 the	 propensity	 of	 firms	
entering	export	markets	(the	extensive	margin).	Starting	with	the	characteristics	of	the	
firm	 itself,	 we	 explore	 whether	 size,	 ownership	 structure,	 productivity	 and	 R&D	
expenditure	and	sunk	costs	are	important	for	export	decisions.	Next,	we	consider	four	
main	 factors	 that	 might	 matter	 for	 entry	 into	 foreign	 markets:	 sunk	 costs,	 spillovers,	
financial	conditions	and	real	exchange	rate	changes.		
Following	Bernard	and	Jensen	(2004)	we	estimate	the	following	reduced	form	model:	
	
                                	                    	     	 ,																																																							(1)	
	
where	      	 is	 a	 dummy	 indicating	 whether	 firm	 i	 in	 sector	 s	 exported	 in	 year	 t.	 	
represents	firm	level	 characteristics	while	 	are	sector‐level	variables.	The	variables	
that	are	meant	to	capture	the	four	major	determinants	and	are	defined	below.	
	
We	 test	 the	 role	 of	 sunk	 costs	 in	 preventing	 participation	 in	 the	 export	 market	 by	
looking	at	the	effects	of	exporting	in	period	t‐1	on	exporting	in	period	t	as	in	Bernard	
and	 Jensen	(2004).	 We	 explore	 the	 role	 of	 location	 and	 sectorial	 spillovers	 on	 firms’	
export	decisions	by	looking	at	the	effects	of	activities	of	other	firms	in	the	same	sector	
or	region.	We	then	include	a	set	of	financial	indicators	to	capture	the	financial	status	of	
a	firm.	Finally,	we	look	at	the	role	of	real	exchange	changes	by	constructing	sector‐level	
exchange	rates,	which	takes	account	of	the	destination	composition	of	each	sector,	and	
estimate	the	participation	response	to	positive	RER	changes	(i.e.:	depreciations	of	the	
domestic	 currency).	 Following	 Greenaway	 et	 al.	 (2010)	 we	 account	 for	 different	
exposure	to	changes	in	the	price	of	imported‐inputs	at	the	firm	level	by	considering	the	
ratio	between	imported	and	total	intermediates	used.

To	 gain	 a	 deeper	 understanding	 of	 the	 impact	 of	 exchange	 rate	 movements	 on	 export	
performance	along	the	extensive	margin,	we	complement	the	results	using	a	customs‐
level	data	set	on	export	transactions.	Although	this	data	set	offers	little	information	on	
firm	 characteristics,	 it	 provides	 very	 detailed	 information	 on	 destinations	 reached	 by	
firms.	In	the	model	below	we	analyze	the	determinants	of	firm	entry	in	a	new	market.	Our	
dependent	variable	is	binary	and,	following	Héricourt	and	Poncet	(2015),	takes	value	1	
when	a	firm	starts	exporting	to	country	j	at	time	t	but	did	not	at	time	t‐1.5	The	estimating	
equation	is	the	following:	
	
                                                	                        ,																																								(2)	
	
The	vector	 	includes	a	set	of	control	variables	at	destination	level	such	as	GDP	and	the	
real	effective	exchange	rates	to	account	for	destination’s	market	size	and	relative	prices.	
Moreover,	to	control	for	country	j’s	demand	for	goods,	we	include	total	imports	of	country	
j.	We	also	include	firm‐destination	fixed	effects,	 ,	and	time	dummies,	 .	The	variable	
      	captures	bilateral	exchange	rate	effects.	We	also	explore	the	impact	of	RER	volatility	
computed	as	the	standard	deviation	of	monthly	log	differences	in	the	nominal	exchange	
rate	(NER).	 	 The	 switch	 from	 real	 to	 nominal	 when	 looking	 at	 exchange	rate	 volatility	
effects	is	driven	by	availability	of	monthly	data	only	for	nominal	exchange	rates	for	the	
set	 of	 destinations	 considered	 in	 this	 analysis.	 Given	 that	 prices	 are	 relatively	 stickier	
than	nominal	exchange	rates,	it	is	reasonable	to	expect	that	most	of	the	variation	of	RER	
volatility	is	actually	driven	by	NER	volatility.	
	
Both	models	are	estimated	using	a	linear	probability	framework	(i.e.	the	error	term,	 ,	
is	 assumed	 to	 be	 normally	 distributed)	 that	 allows	 us	 to	 control	 for	 time‐invariant	
unobserved	heterogeneity	by	including	firm	fixed	effects,	 .	Despite	the	binary	nature	of	
the	dependent	variable,	a	linear	probability	model	is	preferred	because	the	inclusion	of	
firm	fixed	effects	does	not	bias	the	estimates	(Angrist,	2001).	Linear	probability	models	
provide	 good	 estimates	 of	 the	 partial	 effects	 for	 average	 values	 of	 the	 explanatory	
variables	 and	 the	 coefficients	 allow	 for	 a	 straightforward	 interpretation	 of	 the	 effects	
(Wooldridge,	 2002).	 We	also	include	time	dummies,	 ,	to	 control	for	common	 shocks	
such	as	changes	in	the	business	cycle,	trade	liberalization	across	all	industries	and	overall	
changes	 in	 demand	 that	 affect	 all	 firms.	 All	 regressors	 are	 logged.	 Because	 one	 of	 our	
variables	 of	 interest	 is	 the	 lagged	 dependent	 variable,	 we	 also	 implement	 the	 system	
GMM	 estimator	 (Blundell‐Bond,	 1998)	 that	 deals	 with	 endogeneity	 concerns	 by	
instrumenting	 with	 lagged	 first‐differences	 of	 the	 explanatory	 variables.	 	 We	 report	
robust	standard	errors	clustered	at	the	firm	level	to	deal	with	general	heteroskedasticity	
and	serial	correlation.

  We slightly depart from Hericourt and Poncet (2015) inasmuch we consider entry after one year or more of
non-exporting, while they consider entry if the product has not been exported before during the sample period.

         Export	intensity	
	
In	this	section,	we	provide	an	empirical	framework	to	estimate	the	relationship	between	
export	 intensity	 and	 firm	 and	 sector	 level	 characteristics.	 While	 the	 previous	 section	
focused	on	the	main	factors	affecting	the	extensive	margin	of	exports,	this	section	focuses	
on	 their	 importance	 through	 exports	 adjustments	 conditional	 on	 market	 participation	
(the	intensive	margin	of	exports).	The	estimable	equation	is	as	follows:	
	
                                         	                     	      	 ,																																					(3)	
	
where	         	is	the	log	value	of	exports	of	firm	i	in	sector	s	in	year	t.		 	are	firm	level	
characteristics	while	 	are	sector‐level	variables.	Because	the	export	intensity	is	only	
available	for	firms	that	have	chosen	to	export,	a	potential	problem	of	selection	bias	arises.	
Therefore,	 we	 implement	 a	 two‐stage	 approach	 where	 firms	 first	 choose	 whether	 to	
export	 or	 not	 (selection	 equation),	 and	 second	 decide	 how	 much	 to	 export	 (export	
intensity	 equation).	 Following	 Wooldridge	 (1995),	 we	 first	 estimate	 the	 selection	
equation	below	for	each	t	using	a	probit	model:	
			
                         	                                	      	 ,										for	each	t																		(4)	
	
The	equation	is	similar	to	the	one	estimated	in	the	previous	section	where	past	export	
status	 is	 considered	 as	 predictor	 for	 whether	 a	 firm	 is	 currently	 exporting.	 For	 each	
equation,	we	compute	the	inverse	Mills	ratio	(          .	In	the	second	stage,	we	estimate	the	
following	export	intensity	equation	conditional	on	selection:	
                                                                                                                     	
                                	                	                  	 	 	 ,																														(5)	
	
where	 we	 include	 the	 Mills	 ratios	 and	 their	 interactions	 with	 time	 dummies.	 This	
equation	 is	 estimated	 using	 correlated	 Chamberlain’s	 random	 effects	 estimator	 (CRE)	
that	controls	for	time	averages	of	all	time‐varying	firm	variables	in	equation	to	capture	
unobserved	firm	effects.	We	report	robust	standard	errors	clustered	at	the	firm	level	to	
deal	with	heteroscedasticity	and	serial	correlation.			
	
We	also	analyze	determinants	of	export	intensity	using	customs	export	transactions	data.	
The	baseline	specification	is	analogous	to	equation	(2),	with	the	dependent	variable	being	
the	log	of	exports	of	a	firm	i	to	a	country	j:	
	
                                               	                         ,																																								(6)	

4.	Data	and	Summary	Statistics	
We	 rely	 on	 two	 sources	 of	 data:	 a	 firm‐level	 panel	 survey,	 and	 a	 customs‐level	 export	
transactions	data	set.	The	first	data	set	is	the	F01	database	of	Polish	firms	for	the	period

2005‐2013	 with	 10	 or	 more	 employees	 provided	 by	 the	 Central	 Statistical	 Office	 of	
Poland	 to	 the	 National	 Bank	 of	 Poland.	 We	 consider	 only	 firms	 in	 the	 manufacturing	
sector	given	the	lack	of	disaggregated	trade	data	for	the	service	sector.	Moreover,	this	
allows	 us	 to	 benchmark	 our	 results	 with	 the	 findings	 of	 the	 academic	 literature	 that	
focuses	 on	 manufacturing	 firms.	 The	 sample	 comprises	 about	 21,000	 manufacturing	
firms.	The	data	have	an	unbalanced	structure,	with	an	average	of	about	5	observations	
per	firm.	Table	1	reports	the	number	of	firms	by	number	of	years.

Figure	1	shows	the	share	and	the	total	number	of	exporters	by	year	as	well	as	the	fraction	
of	 exporters	 that	 stopped	 exporting	 and	 the	 share	 of	 non‐exporters	 that	 started	
exporting.	The	peak	in	the	number	of	exporters	observed	in	2009	is	mainly	due	to	a	rise	
in	entrants,	while	the	increasing	trends	in	exporters	observed	since	2011	is	due	to	both	
an	increase	in	entrants	and	a	decrease	in	exiters.	The	share	of	exiters	has	been	stable	over	
time,	averaging	around	11%	of	exporters,	and	only	since	2010	has	it	started	to	decrease.

Firms	that	export	are	larger	than	non‐exporters,	they	are	more	productive	and	pay	higher

Results	 confirm	 what	 we	 typically	 find	 in	 the	 literature	 (see	 for	 example	 Bernard	 and	
Jensen,	2004	and	Greenaway	and	Kneller,	2004).	Furthermore,	foreign	owned	firms	are	
more	likely	to	export,	26%	of	exporters	are	foreign	owned	against	5%	of	non‐exporters.		
Considering	 total	 factor	 productivity	 (TFP),	 exporters	 are	 12%	 more	 productive	 than	
non‐exporters.	The	ratios	for	exporters/non‐exporters	on	employees,	wages	and	TFP	are	
roughly	in	line	with	what	is	found	in	the	literature	for	other	European	economies	(Figure

We	 construct	 three	 different	 measures	 of	 geographic	 and	 sectoral	 spillovers	 following	
Bernard	and	Jensen	(2004).		Region‐specific	spillovers	are	captured	by	export	activity	in	
the	region	but	outside	the	three‐digit	(NACE	Rev2)	sector.	Sector‐specific	spillovers	refer	
to	activities	in	the	same	sector	but	outside	the	region	where	the	firm	is	located.	Finally,	
local	spillovers	are	captured	by	export	activity	in	the	same	sector	and	region	as	the	firm.	
Spillovers	are	computed	both	in	terms	of	number	of	exporters	and	value	of	exports.	Table

To	analyze	the	role	of	real	exchange	rate	fluctuations	on	the	probability	of	exporting	we	
construct	sector	level	(3	digit	NACE	rev2)	real	effective	exchange	rates	(REER).	Following	
Bernard	 and	 Jensen	 (2004)	 we	 construct	 export‐weighted	 averages	 of	 real	 exchange	
rates,	where	weights	are	average	export	shares	of	the	partner	country	during	the	entire	
period.	Data	on	nominal	exchange	rates	and	national	deflators	were	taken	from	the	World	
Bank’s	World	Development	Indicators	(WDI).	Data	on	bilateral	trade	were	obtained	from	
UN	 Comtrade.	 To	 assess	 the	 potential	 offsetting	 effect	 of	 imported	 intermediates	 we	
follow	Greenaway	et	al.		(2006)	and	construct	the	ratio	of	imported	intermediate	to	total	
intermediates	(IIIR).	Figure	3	reports	average	IIIR	by	sector	while	the	evolution	of	the	
REER	 over	 time	 by	 sector	 is	 reported	 in	 the	 Appendix.	 The	 largest	 fluctuations	 in	 the	
REER	 are	 observed	 in	 the	 chemicals,	 coke	 and	 refined	 petroleum	 products,	 fabricated	
metals,	other	transport	and	tobacco	sectors.

Firms	in	the	motor	vehicles,	computer,	electronic	and	optical	sector	tend	to	rely	more	on	
imported	 intermediates.	 About	 28	 percent	 of	 intermediate	 costs	 in	 the	 motor	 vehicles	
sector	are	due	to	imports	of	materials.	The	lowest	share	is	found	in	food	and	beverages.

Considering	 the	 financial	 factors	 variables	 (Table	 5),	 liquidity	 is	 defined	 as	 the	 firm's	
current	assets	net	of	current	liabilities	over	total	assets.	Leverage	is	defined	as	the	firm's	
ratio	of	short‐term	debt	to	current	assets.	6	Current	assets	are	those	reasonably	expected	
to	 be	 converted	 into	 cash	 within	 one	 year	 (cash,	 accounts	 receivable,	 inventories,	
marketable	securities,	etc.).	The	higher	its	liquidity	ratio	and	the	lower	its	leverage	ratio,	
the	better	the	firm's	financial	health.	The	table	shows	that	exporters	are	characterized	by	
a	 higher	 liquidity	 ratio	 (0.18	 on	 average)	 than	 non‐exporters	(0.15	on	 average),	 while	
non‐exporters	 display	 a	 higher	 average	 leverage	 ratio	 (1.41	 on	 average)	 compared	 to	
exporters	 (0.89	 on	 average).	 The	 difference	 is	 persistent	 over	 time.	 This	 descriptive	
evidence	suggests	a	link	between	firms'	financial	health	and	export	status.

Access	 to	 finance	 has	 been	 identified	 as	 a	 constraint	 for	 innovation	 (among	 various	
sectors),	 and	 for	 business	 operations	 (for	 services).	 Banks	 do	 not	 finance	 projects	 on	
which	they	do	not	have	priors	of	returns.	Even	successful	firms	may	struggle	to	obtain	
bank	financing	for	innovative	projects	due	to	information	asymmetries	between	lenders	
and	 creditors.	 Field	 level	 interviews	 revealed	 that	 banks	 tend	 to	 be	 willing	 to	 fund	
activities	 with	 a	 well‐established	 track	 record	 of	 success,	 but	 are	 reluctant	 to	 finance	
innovations.	 An	 entrepreneur	 operating	 in	 the	 motor	 vehicle	 sector,	 in	 particular,	
indicated	that	banks	had	not	perceived	that	developing	hybrid	technologies	was	going	to

Figure	4	provides	a	comparison	of	firms’	ability	to	access	financing	in	Poland	and	other	
countries.	Polish	firms	tend	to	finance	70	percent	of	their	investments	with	own	funds.	
Although	this	should	not	necessarily	be	a	source	of	concern,	it	may	be	a	symptom	of	firms	
not	being	able	to	access	external	financing,	and	may	be	restricting	the	type	of	investments	
that	 are	 actually	 conducted.	 This	 ratio	 is	 higher	 than	 observed	 in	 the	 Slovak	 Republic,	
Lithuania,	Estonia,	Slovenia	or	Turkey.	In	addition,	if	we	look	at	one	indicator	of	external	
financing	costs,	such	as	the	collateral	as	a	portion	of	the	debt,	we	observe	that	it	is	also	
high	in	Poland	(130	percent)	when	benchmarked	against	comparators	such	as	the	Slovak	
Republic	(120	percent)	and	Lithuania	(122	percent).	
	
The	 customs‐level	 export	 transaction	 data	 set	 also	 covers	 the	 period	 2005‐2013	 and	
records	 transactions	 for	 more	 than	 40,000	 exporters	 in	 2013	 (about	 32,000	 in	 2005).	
Overall,	the	number	has	increased	by	36	percent	since	2005,	with	smaller	firms	entering	
the	 export	 market.	 Indeed,	 the	 median	 exporter	 size	 has	 declined	 over	 time.	 The	
transport	equipment	and	machinery	sectors	have	led	the	way	in	terms	of	increase	in	the	
number	 of	 exporting	 firms,	 likely	 associated	 with	 a	 process	 of	 integration	 into	
international	production	networks.	The	number	of	exporters	in	the	transport	sector	has	
increased	substantially	by	more	than	100	percent	since	2009.	A	notable	increase	is	also	
observed	in	the	machinery	sector.	The	sector	went	from	about	5,000	exporters	in	2009	
to	more	than	12,000	in	2013	(Figure	5).

 Evidence from the World Bank Enterprise Survey confirms that access to finance is a source of concern in
Poland, with more than 30 percent of firms identifying that as an obstacle or a major obstacle for operations,
higher than in most countries in the region.

5.	Results:	Export	Decision	
	
In	this	section,	we	describe	the	results	of	estimating	equation	(1)	on	firm‐level	data	to	
analyze	the	determinants	of	export	participation	and	the	results	of	estimating	equation	
(2)	on	customs‐transactions	data	to	analyze	determinants	of	entry	in	new	markets.	
	
        Firm‐level	data	

Our	 first	 baseline	 results	 are	 reported	 in	 Table	 6.	 It	 reports	 the	 coefficients	 on	 firm	
characteristics	on	the	probability	of	exporting	from	the	linear	probability	model.		The	first	
column,	reporting	pooled	OLS	estimates,	confirms	our	initial	findings.	Foreign,	larger	and	
more	productive	firms	have	higher	probabilities	of	exporting.	Columns	(2)	–	(5)	report	
results	in	which	firm‐level	fixed	effects	are	added.	Adding	firm‐level	effects	is	useful	to	
control	for	unobserved	firm	characteristics	that	may	be	correlated	with	the	regressors	
and	with	the	 dependent	variable	at	the	same	time,	thus	reducing	the	scope	of	biases	in	

                                                     15
the	estimates.	At	the	same	time,	by	adding	firm	fixed	effects	we	are	less	likely	to	identify	
the	specific	effects	of	firm‐level	characteristics	that	show	little	variation	over	time.		
	
Indeed,	 when	 we	 control	 for	 firm	 fixed‐effects	 much	 of	 the	 effects	 of	 the	 firm‐level	
characteristics	are	swept	away.	Total	factor	productivity	and	real	wages	are	no	longer	
significant	and	the	foreign	effect	is	no	longer	distinguishable	from	the	firm	fixed	effect.	
This	 is	 reasonable	 if	 real	 wages,	 productivity	 and	 foreign	 ownership	 do	 not	 vary	
substantially	over	time	at	the	level	of	the	firm.	An	increase	in	size,	however,	still	shows	a	
moderate	effect	on	the	probability	of	exporting.	A	10%	increase	in	employment	at	the	
firm	level	leads	to	a	0.6	percentage‐point	increase	in	the	probability	of	exporting.

Sunk	costs	are	important	determinants	of	the	decision	to	export.	This	is	evidenced	by	the	
fact	that	having	exported	in	the	previous	period	significantly	affects	the	decision	to	export	
in	the	current	period,	increasing	the	probability	of	exporting	 by	14	percentage	points.	
Nevertheless,	estimates	are	smaller	than	those	found	in	Bernard	and	Jensen	(2004)	for	
the	United	States	and	Greenaway	et	al	(2007)	for	the	United	 Kingdom.	 It	is	 likely	that	
given	the	single	market	conditions	in	the	EU,	and	the	portion	of	exports	that	are	directed	
to	that	market,	the	sunk	costs	associated	with	exporting	are	relatively	lower	than	those	
faced	 by	 US	 firms,	 or	 even	 by	 UK	 firms	 that	 have	 a	 more	 diversified	 market	 scope.		
Moreover,	 we	 do	 not	 find	 any	 positive	 effects	 of	 having	 last	 exported	 two	 years	 ago,	
indicating	that	sunk	costs	rapidly	depreciate	over	time.

  We	find	strongly	significant	positive	local	spillover	effects	(both	when	measuring	them	in	
  terms	of	firms	and	value	exported).	This	might	indicate	that	proximity	between	exporters	
  in	the	same	sector	reduces	entry	costs.	There	are	several	mechanisms	at	work	within	this	
  channel.	First,	it	could	be	that	the	local	presence	of	other	exporters	in	the	same	sector	
  lowers	the	cost	of	production	by	increasing	the	availability	of	specialized	capital	or/and	
  labor	inputs	(Bernard	and	Jensen,	2004).	Second,	the	presence	of	other	exporters	in	the	
  same	sector	is	likely	to	increase	the	stock	of	knowledge	about	exporting	specific	products,	
  and	this	knowledge	may	be	more	readily	available	for	other	firms	to	profit.	Interestingly,	
  firms	 generally	 do	 not	 benefit	 from	 the	 proximity	 to	 other	 exporters	 if	 these	 do	 not	
  operate	in	their	same	sector.8		Moreover,	surprisingly,	we	find	a	negative	coefficient	for	
  the	sector‐specific	spillovers,	when	considering	the	ratio	of	exporting	firms	to	total	firms	
  in	 the	 sector.	 This	 indicates	 that	 the	 presence	 of	 other	 exporters	 in	 the	 same	 sector	
  reduces	the	probability	of	exporting,	likely	due	to	competition	pressures.		
  	
  Results	concerning	financial	factors	and	R&D	expenditure	are	reported	in	Table	9.	We	
  follow	Greenaway	et	al.	(2007)	in	the	choice	of	the	two	measures	of	financial	constraints:	
  liquidity	 and	 leverage.	 These	 measures	 have	 been	 widely	 used	 in	 the	 literature.	 The	
  higher	the	liquidity	ratio	and	the	lower	the	leverage	ratio,	the	better	the	firm	financial	
  health.	 Liquidity	 has	 a	 positive	 and	 strongly	 statistically	 significant	 effect	 on	 export	
  market	participation,	although	its	economic	effect	is	not	large.	Taking	the	results	from	

  8 This,	however,	might	be	driven	by	the	fact	that	because	we	use	a	firm‐level	not	a	plant‐level	data	set,	the	majority	of	

  firms	have	headquarters	in	Warsaw.

                                                             18
column	6	–	with	the	largest	estimated	coefficient,	the	results	suggest	that	if	the	liquidity	
ratio	 increases	 by	 one	 standard	 deviation	 (0.3),	 then	 the	 probability	 of	 exporters	 is	
expected	to	increase	by	slightly	more	than	a	third	of	a	percentage	point	(more	precisely,	
by	0.0036).	On	the	other	hand,	the	coefficient	of	leverage	is	small	and	not	significantly	
different	from	zero.		Firms	in	Poland	are	known	to	face	credit	constraints.	Many	of	them	
are	unable	to	 borrow	(as	argued	 before,	 30	percent	of	 Polish	 firms	in	 the	World	Bank	
Enterprise	Survey	claimed	that	access	to	finance	was	an	obstacle	or	a	major	obstacle).			
	
Liquidity	 matters	 for	 export	 activities.	 This	 is	 confirmed	 also	 in	 our	 findings	 since	
liquidity	is	an	important	factor	to	cover	the	sunk	costs	of	entering	the	export	market.		This	
suggests	that	a	sizable	number	of	firms	that	are	struggling	to	access	external	financing	
and	that	may	have	feasible	export	projects	may	be	excluded	from	export	markets	due	to	
liquidity	constraints.		
	
We	also	find	that	the	export	market	is	not	a	platform	for	Polish	producers	with	high	R&D	
intensity.	R&D	expenditure	does	not	play	a	significant	role	in	affecting	the	probability	of	
exporting.	The	empirical	analysis	reveals	that	producers	with	high	R&D	content	in	their	
cost	 structures	 do	 not	 seem	 to	 be	 predominantly	 exporting,	 in	 addition	 only	 very	 few	
firms	 do	 conduct	 R&D	 in	 the	 sample	 (about	 300	 per	 year).	 This	 is	 to	 some	 extent	
confirmed	 by	 field	 interviews.	 When	 we	 asked	 some	 apparently	 sophisticated	 firms	
whether	they	were	conducting	R&D	investments,	the	managers	generally	mentioned	that	
they	had	“competence	centers”	or	“design	centers”	–	which	were	“one	step	below”	R&D	
centers.	 One	 caveat	 here	 is	 that	 firms	 may	 not	 have	 any	 incentive	 to	 declare	 R&D	
expenditures.	This	is	because	by	declaring	them	they	do	not	receive	incentives	but	their	
operative	costs	may	increase	due	to	more	questionnaires	being	sent	by	statistical	offices.	
The	extent	to	which	this	is	a	significant	cost	that	may	induce	firms	not	to	declare	expenses	
is	unclear.

The	 results	 reported	 in	 Table	 10	 focus	 on	 the	 role	 of	 the	 exchange	 rate	 on	 export	
decisions.	The	real	effective	exchange	rate	(REER)	is	defined	in	terms	of	units	of	foreign	
currency	for	a	unit	of	Polish	zloty.	Therefore,	an	increase	indicates	an	appreciation	of	the	
Polish	zloty.		Results	reported	in	column	1	reveal	no	overall	average	impact	of	exchange	
rate	variations	on	export	decisions.		Real	exchange	rate	depreciations	increase	the	zloty‐
denominated	 revenues	 associated	 with	 export	 flows,	 but	 also	 make	 the	 inputs	 they	
import	more	expensive.

However,	when	we	condition	the	effect	of	the	REER	on	the	ratio	of	imported	intermediate	
inputs	 on	 overall	 input	 costs	 (IIIR)	 (reported	 in	 columns	 2‐4),	 we	 find	 the	 expected	
results.	In	particular,	we	find	evidence	of	a	two‐sided	effect	of	the	real	exchange	rate	on	
firms’	export	decision.	On	one	hand,	a	depreciation	of	the	Polish	zloty	increases	the	zloty‐
denominated	revenues	from	 export	 orders,	thus	encouraging	market	participation.	On	
the	other,	it	increases	the	costs	of	imported	intermediates	as	well	as	the	costs	of	servicing	
debt	denominated	in	foreign	currency.	The	REER	effect	on	export	participation	therefore	
depends	on	the	imported	intermediates	input	ratio	(IIR)	–	the	greater	this	is,	the	lower	
the	overall	effect	of	a	real	depreciation	on	the	probability	of	exporting.	Notice	that	the	
ratio	 of	 imported	 intermediates	 on	 total	 input	 costs	 captures	 the	 broader	 concept	 of	


                                                     20
participation	 in	 international	 production	 networks,	 which	 also	 mediates	 the	 effect	
between	RER	and	exports.		
	
Considering	the	results	reported	in	column	3,	on	average,	firms	that	import	less	than	30	
percent	of	their	inputs	are	more	likely	to	suffer	from	an	appreciation	of	the	zloty,	while	
those	with	imported	inputs	above	that	threshold	are	likely	to	be	relatively	hedged.	This	
latter	group	of	firms	are	more	likely	to	be	found	in	the	motor	vehicles	sector	where	the	
average	 IIIR	 ratio	 is	 close	 to	 the	 threshold	 at	 28%.	 Firms	 most	 likely	 to	 suffer	 from	
appreciations	of	the	zloty	are	found	in	the	furniture,	wood,	printing	and	media,	other	non‐
metallic	minerals,	food	and	beverages	sectors	that	rely	mostly	on	domestic	inputs.

More	 than	 80	 percent	 of	 firms	 can	 be	 considered	 to	 show	 some	 responsiveness	 to	
exchange	rate	changes	as	their	share	of	imports	in	the	total	import	bill	is	relatively	low.	
Figure	6	shows	the	portion	of	firms	that	import	less	than	30	percent	of	their	imports	for

less	than	30	percent	of	their	inputs	as	opposed	to	more	than	95	percent	in	the	food	and

        Export	transaction	data	

In	this	section,	we	employ	customs‐level	export	transaction	data.	The	advantage	of	using	
this	 data	 set	 is	 that	 we	 have	 information	 on	 the	 destination	 of	 a	 firm’s	 exports	 and,	
therefore,	can	determine	the	relevant	source	of	exchange	rate	variability.	Using	firm‐level	
data	we	were	constrained	to	use	sector‐level	measures	of	real	exchange	rate	based	on	
sectorial	 export	 shares	 to	 different	 destinations.	 Table	 11	 reports	 the	 results	 of	
estimating	 the	 equation	 (2)	 when	 the	 dependent	 variable	 is	 the	 decision	 to	 start	
exporting	to	a	destination.	The	first	two	columns	show	that	an	appreciation	of	the	PLN	
has	a	negative	impact	on	the	decision	to	export.

  As small we denote exporters with mean value of exports lower than the 25th percentile of the population.
Analogously, medium-small are located between the 25th percentile and median, medium-large between median
and the 75th percentile, while large exporters are above the 75th percentile.

Finally,	Table	12	considers	the	impact	of	exchange	rate	volatility	on	export	decision.	The

destination	country.	The	last	column	explores	heterogeneous	effects	across	firm	size	and	
shows	that,	again,	small	firms	are	more	negatively	affected	by	exchange	rate	volatility.	
Large	firms	are	also	negatively	affected	but	the	impact	is	notably	smaller	and	very	close	
to	zero.	This	is	likely	associated	with	larger	firms	being	able	to	hedge	both	through	relying	
on	a	larger	share	of	imported	inputs	and	of	credit	in	foreign	currency,	and	through	other	
financial	instruments.					

6.	Results:	Export	Intensity	
	
In	 this	 section,	 we	 present	 the	 findings	 on	 the	 determinants	 of	 export	 intensity	 and	
discuss	the	results	from	firm‐level	data	and	customs–level	data.	
	
          Firm‐level	data	

Once	firms	have	decided	to	enter	export	markets,	what	drives	the	intensity	with	which	
they	participate	in	them?	This	section	focuses	on	factors	affecting	export	intensity	–	the	
intensive	margin	‐	at	the	firm	level.		Conceptually,	factors	that	affect	both	the	fixed	and	
variable	costs	of	exporting	are	likely	to	affect	both	exports	at	the	extensive	and	at	the	
intensive	margin,	while	those	that	predominantly	act	on	one	or	the	other	type	of	costs,	
will	 have	 different	 effects	 on	 the	 extensive	 and	 the	 intensive	 margins.	 In	 this	 way,	
examining	 the	 results	 of	 this	 section	 in	 light	 of	 the	 findings	 of	 the	 previous	 section	 is	
informative	 to	 better	 understand	 the	 channels	 through	 which	 different	 potential	
determinants	affect	export	performance.	
	
The	results	of	estimating	the	export	intensity	equation	(4)	are	reported	in	Table	13.	10		
The	first	column	reports	the	results	of	a	linear	model	with	firm	fixed	effects	while	the	
remaining	columns	deal	with	sample	selection	by	including	the	inverse	Mills	ratios	from	
a	set	of	probit	estimations.		We	find	that	firms	that	have	experienced	an	increase	in	TFP	
are	 more	 likely	 to	 export	 greater	 volumes.	 The	 result	 is	 consistent	 across	 all	
specifications.	 The	 number	 of	 employees	 is	 also	 positively	 correlated	 with	 export	
intensity.	The	overall	impact	of	the	exchange	rate	is	again	insignificant.	In	column	4,	we	
include	 the	 imported	 intermediates	 input	 ratio	 (IIIR)	 and	 its	 interaction	 with	 the	
exchange	rate.	We	find	that	firms	that	increase	their	share	of	imported	intermediates	are	
more	likely	to	experience	an	increase	in	exports.	Appreciations	of	the	exchange	rate	do	
not	 have	 a	 negative	 effect	 on	 export	 intensity	 even	 when	 firms	 import	 zero	 inputs.	

10
  The	 results	 for	 the	 first‐stage	 regression	 of	 export	 participation	 (equation	 3)	 are	 reported	 in	 Table	 A3	 of	 the	
Appendix.

                                                               23
Therefore,	we	do	not	find	evidence	of	a	negative	exchange	rate	effect.	Finally,	we	do	not	
find	any	significant	effect	of	liquidity	and	investment	in	R&D	on	exports	value.

7.	Conclusions	
	
In	this	paper,	we	have	analyzed	the	main	drivers	associated	with	firms’	participation	in	
export	markets	and	with	the	intensity	with	which	they	trade.	In	particular,	we	explored	
the	importance	of	four	main	factors:	the	real	exchange	rate,	sunk	costs,	local	and	sectoral	
spillovers,	and	financial	conditions.		
	
We	found	that	Polish	exporters	are	exceptional	performers,	as	it	is	the	case	elsewhere.	
They	are	on	average	3	times	larger,	12	percent	more	productive	and	are	5	times	more	
likely	 to	 be	 foreign	 owned	 than	 non‐exporters.	 Firms	 face	 high	 fixed	 (sunk)	 costs	 for	
entering	export	markets.	This	makes	firms	that	exported	in	the	previous	year	up	to	50	
percent	more	likely	to	export	also	in	the	following	year	because	they	have	acquired	an	
intangible	asset	associated	with	information	and	know‐how.	This	also	partially	explains	
our	second	finding	that	liquidity	plays	an	important	role	by	facilitating	entry	to	the	export	
market.	 However,	 we	 also	 find	 that	 proximity	 between	 exporters	 in	 the	 same	 sector	
reduces	 such	 entry	 costs.	 This	 is	 likely	 due	 to	 lower	 cost	 of	 production	 given	 by	 an	
increased	availability	of	specialized	capital	or/and	labor	inputs,	or	due	to	the	increased	
availability	of	market	information.		
	
Finally,	we	find	that	real	exchange	rate	movements	affect	firms’	decisions	to	enter	export	
markets.	 But	 the	 effect	 depends	 on	 the	 intensity	 with	 which	 firms	 use	 imported	
intermediates	 and	 participate	 in	 international	 production	 networks.	 In	 particular,	 we	
find	that	80	percent	of	exporters	are	not	fully	‘hedged’	against	exchange	rate	changes.	
Interestingly,	the	effect	of	RER	changes	is	also	conditional	on	firms’	size.	Larger	firms	tend	
to	be	more	immune	to	RER	changes,	likely	related	to	their	ability	to	hedge	against	RER	
shocks	in	multiple	manners.

average	wage	is	computed	as	the	ratio	between	the	firm's	total	wage	bill	and	its	number	
of	employees.	The	lowest	wages	are	found	in	the	Wearing	apparel	sector	(26,000	PLN)	
while	the	highest	are	again	in	the	Coke	and	refined	petroleum	sector	(about	58,000	PLN).	
Foreign	is	a	dummy	equal	to	1	if	a	firm	shows	some	form	of	foreign	ownership,	and	0	
otherwise.	The	largest	share	of	foreign	owned	firms	is	found	in	the	Tobacco	sector	(64%)	
followed	 by	 the	 Motor	 vehicle	 sector	 (44%).	 Regarding	 our	 measure	 of	 productivity,	
which	was	calculated	using	the	Levinsohn	and	Petrin	(2003)	method,	the	Pharmaceutical	
sector	tops	the	list	while	the	Wearing	apparel	sector	shows	the	lowest	level	of	total	factor	
productivity.

            Export	participation	(selection)	estimations	

    The	results	for	the	first‐stage	regression	of	export	participation	(equation	3)	are	reported	
    presented	 in	 table	 A3	 for	 each	 year.	 We	 only	 report	 the	 most	 comprehensive	
    specification.	Consistent	with	the	literature	and	with	our	previous	findings	we	find	that	
    firms	that	export	are	more	likely	to	be	bigger,	more	productive,	and	foreign	owned	(see	
    for	example,	Greenaway	and	Kneller,	2007).	These	variables	are	significantly	correlated	
    with	the	probability	of	entering	the	export	market	in	all	years.	Liquidity	is	also	positively	
    correlated	with	export	participation	in	5	out	of	8	specifications.	Similar	to	our	previous	
    findings,	exchange	rate	fluctuations	do	not	have	an	overall	effect	on	entry	as	the	negative	
    effect	 through	 higher	 export	 prices	 is	 compensated	 by	 a	 positive	 effect	 through	 lower	
    input	 costs.	 The	 interaction	 effect,	 however,	 is	 only	 visible	 in	 one	 specification	 as	 this	
    specification	lacks	the	time	dimension	that	allows	a	better	identification	of	such	effect.		
    Finally,	there	is	also	some	limited	evidence	that	firms	with	higher	R&D	expenditure	are	
    more	likely	to	participate	in	the	export	market.	These	regressions	are	used	to	generate	
    the	inverse	Mills	ratios	for	each	period	that	will	be	included	in	the	estimation	of	the	export	
    intensity	equation	to	control	for	selection	into	the	export	market.

            Qualitative	evidence	

   Qualitative	based	evidence	tends	to	support	our	findings.	Field	interviews	with	selected	
   firms	were	conducted	to	help	in	understanding	two	important	issues,	namely:	(1)	how	
   firms	 react	 to	 exchange	 rate	 shocks	 and	 how	 they	 envision	 the	 possibility	 of	 euro	
   adoption,	(2)	how	the	characteristics	of	the	firm	affect	this	reaction.	The	main	lessons	
   learned	from	the	interviews	are	the	following:		
        Firms	 systematically	 expressed	 views	 that	 their	 business	 was	 not	 on	 exchange	
           rate	 speculation,	 and	 that	 likely,	 euro	 adoption	 will	 be	 a	 positive	 development	
           conditional	 on	 the	 zloty/euro	 parity	 at	 which	 it	 happens	 (most	 mentioned	 4	
           zloty/euro).	 Exporting	 firms’	 reactions	 to	 exchange	 rate	 changes	 are	
           heterogeneous	and	depend	on:	
               o The	 type	 of	 product	 exported.	For	example,	for	firms	from	a	service	sector	
                   with	 highly	 customer‐tailored	 products	 (IT	 systems,	 for	 example),	 re‐
                   orientation	 is	 not	 viable	 option	 and	 thus	 exchange	 rate	 changes	 are	
                   perceived	as	a	noise	that	affects	their	business	decisions.	This	tends	to	be	
                   the	 case	 in	 B2B	 type	 of	 businesses.	 For	 firms	 exporting	 mass	 products	
                   directly	to	the	consumer,	re‐orientation	after	exchange	rate	changes	is	less	
                   costly,	 and	 may	 benefit	 firms’	 margins	 –	 in	 line	 with	 literature	 on	
                   irreversible	investment	and	RER	uncertainty.		
               o The	currency	mismatches	of	firms’	balance	sheets.	Given	that	most	exporting	
                   firms	 have	 a	 large	 portion	 of	 their	 revenues	 coming	 from	 euro	
                   denominated	 exports	 and	 a	 large	 portion	 of	 their	 costs	 (import)	
                   denominated	in	euro	the	effects	of	changes	in	the	price	of	the	zloty/euro	
                   are	mitigated	(in	line	with	the	literature	on	trade	effects	of	exchange	rates	
                   and	global	value	chain	participation).	

   The	 size	 of	 the	 firm,	 and	 in	 particular,	 their	 ability	 to	 hedge	 using	 available	 financial	
   instruments.	Only	large	firms	hedge	(the	rest	use	“natural	hedging”	implying	matching	the	
   currency	in	which	they	source	inputs	with	the	currency	in	which	they	get	revenues).		This	
   is	 despite	 the	 fact	 that,	 according	 to	 anecdotal	 evidence,	 the	 market	 for	 hedging	
   instruments	is	deep.
