"This is not your usual World Bank/UN report. Thorough and
thoughtful analysis provides what initially seems a surprise: a poor,
ethnically marginalized and economically isolated community in Kenya
beneﬁts from the presence of a decades-old large refugee camp in its
midst. The authors are scrupulous; they emphasize the particular
context and avoid generalizing. Still their work puts to the lie a simple
NIMBY view of the world — whether applied to refugees or other
immigrants."
        - Nancy Birdsall, President of the Center for Global Development

"As a former political refugee and one who has visited the Kakuma
Refugee Camp, this report strikes a personal chord clearly vindicating
what so many of us have felt in our struggles to live a digniﬁed life: we

can contribute to development of our host communities."

“This is a fascinating, ﬁne-grained analysis of the impact of refugees in
northwest Kenya. The authors innovatively combine economic and
ethnographic analysis to draw a richly textured, but overall positive
picture of how refugees have improved well-being of their host region.”

      ‘Refugee economies’ is broadly defined as the resource allocation systems relating to a displaced
    population. The concept is intended to be holistic in attempting to look at ways in which refugees’
    economic activities are not simply reducible to livelihoods but are part of a wider system involving
    consumption, production, exchange, and finance (Betts et al. 2014).

      n 1991, some 10,000 Sudanese boys walked into Northern Kenya. Having first
      fled civil war in southern Sudan, undertaking a treacherous journey to Ethiopia,
      war once again forced them to seek refuge elsewhere; they had walked more
than a thousand miles before reaching Kenya, and Kakuma refugee camp would
become their new home. Located in one of Kenya’s most remote areas, Kakuma refu-
gee camp has today become the largest settlement in Turkana County, housing close
to 200,000 refugees, almost 15 percent of the county’s population.
    Known as the cradle of mankind,4 and today home to the Turkana people and
other smaller ethnic groups who live off the land and whose traditional livelihoods
are nomadic pastoralism, Turkana County is sparsely populated. Though its popula-
tion has grown dramatically in the last two decades, increasing from 855,393 people
in 2009 to 1,256,152 in 2015 (Human Rights Watch 2015), for the Turkana people
living in Kakuma, hosting a refugee population larger than their own in a terrain that
is often punishing and a region that is poor, has brought about its share of challenges,
but also opportunities. Although the dawn of man occurred over three million years
ago in the Turkana region,5 it has not exactly remained a beacon of economic growth
or technology development. Turkana County, the largest county in Kenya, is also one
of the country’s most impoverished and marginalized areas, where literacy rates are
among the lowest and poverty rates, at over 90 percent, the highest (Sanghi and
Onder, 2016). It also has a long history of chronic malnutrition and some of the poor-
est health indicators in Kenya (Human Rights Watch 2015). However, the wind of

    In 1992, following talks with the GoK and local leaders and elders of the Turkana
    community, UNHCR formally established a refugee camp in Kakuma in order to
    accommodate people fleeing the conflict in Sudan. Kakuma, meaning the ‘place of the
    giant tortoise’, was a former watering hole and communal meeting ground for the
    Turkana pastoralists during the wet season. The Sudanese ‘lost boys’ were initially
    housed in a temporary camp located closer to the Sudanese border in the town of
    Lokichoggio. Their arrival, combined with a large inflow of Somali refugees into East-

    obliged to reside in a camp with their movement outside the camps being heavily

      According to Human Rights Watch, Kenya hosted 14,400 refugees in 1990, but as a result of the                The refugee presence also increases consumption, self-reported incomes, and

        Second, market imperfections further concentrate refugee-related rents in the
     hands of small interest groups. Overall, encampment creates rents. Thus, insufficient
     competition in markets such as retail, land, housing, and livestock in the vicinity of
     the camp could reallocate some of these rents disproportionately towards those who
     control the businesses (at the expense of the total benefits that could be received by
     the society at large). Indeed, we find that in Turkana, there are signs of such market
     power. For example, another background study for this report (Oka, 2016) suggests
     the presence of a small group of highly influential traders in the Kakuma market, and
     a cartel-like sub-network comprising of these 3-5 traders operating continuously
     within Kakuma between the years 2005 and 2015. Similarly, there are only two bus
                                                                                                                                                      KAKUMA 3
     companies that have operated between Kakuma and Nairobi. Moreover, high trans-
     portation costs also strengthen the concentration of rents by leading to supply bottle-
     necks and reducing the mobility of labor.
        Third, restrictions on refugee employment and mobility change refugees’ incen-
     tives for acquiring skills. The absence of employment prospects diminishes refugees’                                                                               KAKUMA 2
     incentives to develop their skills as manufacturers, traders, and merchants. These
     induced distortions not only deprive the Turkana region of valuable human capital
     (some refugees have more marketable skills than the host population in this remote
     and impoverished part of Kenya), but also generate an unhealthy local dependence
     on the refugee camp (not as a source of growth but of monopoly rents). The local
     population may also suffer from distorted incentives. The extra monopsony power of
     the host region buyers and their consequent improved terms of trade with refugees
                                                                                                                                         KAKUMA 4
     further reduce the locals’ incentive to develop their skills. Hence the barriers to
     integration reduce skill development in the Turkana region as well. As a result, the
     two-way dependence, that is refugees’ dependence on aid and locals’ dependence on
     refugees, becomes a self-enforcing, low level equilibrium. Integration then becomes
     a self-evident win-win.

        This raises the question of who should receive aid: refugees or the host government? One option
     is that once integration takes place, aid that goes to the refugees could be centralized in the hands of                   Major Road                  Kakuma 1

     to receive the same level of transfers, and one where transfers cease to exist after full
     economic integration.
     3. Decampment scenario (DS): What if, starting today, Kakuma refugee camp is shut
     down, and all refugees are suddenly moved to other countries (be it their countries of
     origin or third countries). This is the immediate camp closure scenario.

         The effects of these three scenarios are measured against the encampment base-
     line. In particular, effects are measured by changes in aggregate income, prices, and
     wages in the host community and in the rest of Kenya. Before delving into results,
     what should one intuitively expect, temporally and spatially?
         Temporally, given that refugees constitute approximately one fifth of Turkana’s
     population, we expect that their participation in the work force in all three scenarios
     ought to create major ripple effects (especially in the full integration scenario). These
     effects, though, are most felt in the immediate, short-term. In the long-term, as labor
     becomes mobile and is gradually absorbed by the rest of Kenya, these effects become
     diffused over time.
                                                                                                               3. Ass ssin Imp ct: M thods
         Spatially, we expect the effects to be concentrated in the order of Kakuma, Turka-
     na, and then the rest of Kenya. The effect on the rest of Kenya ought to be marginal at
     best. This is because the entire refugee population of Kakuma constitutes less than                       I. Imp ct m    ns diﬀ r nt thin s to diﬀ r nt p opl

     facing prices which favor their entry into the market, thus transitioning from a state of autarky to    0.0                                                                             0

     Kakuma represents a somewhat unique case since all foreign workers are housed in a compound
     adjacent to the camp, and hence do not directly increase demand for local housing. The presence of
     the camp may still indirectly affect local housing markets to the extent that the camp attracts local
     workers into the housing market in Kakuma Town for which we see some evidence, though it is
     largely anecdotal.

     Further, as a caveat, sorghum has always been a staple food for the Turkana (Lam-

     just have culturally modified ways in which older people eschew cereals so that                    19

                         rents of tension and violence, largely driven by a general meta-narrative of the refu-
                         gee as “violent other”. This is a broader narrative that exists across Turkana County
                         and was observed across the four comparative sites (Figure 10).30 Many informants
                         also reported that the Turkana experience some combination of mistreatment,
                         economic malfeasance, and violence at the hands of refugees when they enter the
                         camp to trade (Figure 11). However, such negative narratives are remarkably unnu-

                         perceptions of refugees compared to those farther away (Figure 12). For example, in
