What are the potential losses in Guatemala?
These charts show the estimated potential future losses to Guatemala that could be caused by earthquakes and
hurricanes that could occur within a given return period. In 1902, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck Guatemala. If this
historical event were to happen in 2015, it would cause losses of US$ 3,200M amounting to 4.6% of GDP.
