  Executive Summary

    London, United Kingdom, 1858.

    Sanitation was considered a private good, and not a concern of the state. The better-off
    installed flush toilets, while the poor relied on basic amenities. When people complained
    about declining living conditions, the politicians didn’t listen. When evidence of the biological
    contamination of local water sources was presented, the politicians tried to undermine it.
    Over time, horse dung on the streets and human waste in cesspits flowed into the capital
    city’s largest river, the source of drinking water, choking it of oxygen. Still, calls for change
    went unanswered until the political elites literally faced a summer stench at their doorsteps,
    and the death toll from cholera reached into the thousands. Only then did they act, making
    major investments in sanitation and water supply infrastructure and institutions. The Great
    Stink was a watershed moment for London.



  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the World Bank’s corporate goals of ending
  extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity call for specific attention to the poor and
  vulnerable. The overarching objective of the SDGs is to end poverty in all its forms, but their
  key difference from the earlier Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is the integration of
  social, economic, and environmental goals (UN 2015). This has significant implications for
  reforms aimed at improving service delivery. With this understanding as its guiding compass,
  the Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Poverty Diagnostic Initiative focuses on what
  it would take to reduce existing inequalities in WASH services worldwide.

  This report, a synthesis of that global initiative, offers new insights on how data can be
  used to inform allocation decisions to reduce inequalities and prioritize investment in
  WASH to boost human capital. It also offers a fresh perspective on service delivery that
  considers how institutional arrangements1 affect the incentives of a range of actors. When
  it comes to improving services, politics matters as much today as it did in the London of
  the mid-19th century.

  Importantly, as will be discussed below, the report does not offer prescriptive global solutions
  for service delivery challenges. Instead, it seeks to encourage a dialogue on ways to think and
  work differently, using a problem-driven approach and engaging with the constraints imposed
  by the broader governance environment.


  The Time for Action Is Now
  The importance of water supply, sanitation, and hygiene obviously transcends time and
  geography—but even where this is explicitly recognized in policy, the needs of hundreds of
  millions of citizens remain unmet.2 In particular, renewed efforts are needed to address those
  populations at greatest risk of death and disease due to inadequate WASH, which threatens
  human capital and economic development.

  The SDGs set ambitious new targets for WASH: universal access to safe and affordable services
  by 2030.3 The SDGs raise the bar by aiming not only to expand access to basic WASH services




Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   xiii
              but also to close gaps in service quality, with an eye toward long-term sustainability. This
              means not only providing water in people’s homes, but also making sure that the water is safe
              to drink and continuously available. It means not just constructing more sanitation facilities,
              but making sure, year after year, that these are used and human waste is properly removed,
              treated, and disposed of—in all neighborhoods, not just the wealthiest. Beyond their intrinsic
              value, improved WASH services will ensure the achievement of other development goals.
              For  instance, SDG 3, focused on overall health, includes targets that explicitly relate to
              improvements in WASH. In their comprehensiveness, the SDGs open the difficult and yet
              unanswered questions of where to start making improvements, how to prioritize action, and
              how to overcome existing bottlenecks.

              Countries that have struggled to reach the MDGs for WASH4 will likely need to improve efficiency
              and invest even more to reach the SDGs. The fourfold increase in investments that is likely
              needed to meet the SDGs is beyond what most governments can afford (Hutton and Varughese
              2016)5. Hence, private capital for infrastructure investment will become increasingly important
              for services, such as urban water supply, where cost-recovery, at least for operations and
              maintenance, is more feasible. And given that resources, whether public or private, will always
              be finite, increasing the efficiency of investments will be as important as how and where
              investments are made. In some cases, achieving greater efficiency will mean confronting
              political obstacles. Often, policy documents say the right things about investing in water supply
              and sanitation to benefit poor and vulnerable populations, but implementation by governments
              and donors does not reflect these commitments.

              Many countries struggle to maintain current infrastructure, let alone respond to growing
              demand. In densely populated areas, economies of scale can be achieved by providing piped
              water rather than leaving individual households to rely on their own sources, such as wells.
              Providing piped water also allows groundwater, a public good, to be better regulated and
              controlled against pollution and overabstraction. Surprisingly, this report reveals that the
              public provision of piped water on household premises is declining as countries struggle to
              keep up with population growth. In Nigeria, it fell from 29 percent in urban areas in 1990 to
              less than 10  percent by 2015. Similarly, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, piped
              connections dropped from 48 percent of the urban population in 1990 to only 17 percent in
              2015. Haiti, Tanzania, and the West Bank and Gaza also suffered a decline in urban areas
              during this period. In the face of service delivery failures, households take matters into their
              own hands, sinking private wells if they can afford to (and thereby straining the local aquifer)
              or buying from unregulated private providers that charge three to four times what public
              providers do.

              In some countries, piped water is hardly any safer than pond water and is a threat to people’s
              health. The SDGs call for safely managed water, which means that improved water is located
              on premises, available when needed, and free of biological and chemical contamination.
              Figure ES.1 presents data on E. coli contamination in four countries—Bangladesh, Ethiopia,
              Tajikistan, and Ecuador.6 Contamination levels vary dramatically not only by country, but also
              by location and household wealth. The figure also reveals a surprising fact about piped water,
              which is theoretically the safest source: in some locations, it is equally or more contaminated
              than nonpiped supply.

              In Bangladesh, 80 percent of piped water is contaminated with E. coli, a level that is just as
              contaminated as surface water. Reasons for this could be inadequate treatment at the source,
              and/or the intermittent water supply, whereby porous networks increase the risk of contaminants
              being drawn in. Giving citizens more information about this problem—making the invisible
              visible—will be critical for improving accountability of service providers. Improving accountability
              involves not only giving citizens information, but also creating space to act on that information
              so that service providers and/or governments have incentives to respond. Thus, it is critical to
              promote household water treatment in areas where the improvement of infrastructure and
              service will take time.

  Problem-Driven Diagnostics to Guide
  the Way Forward
  Built on in-depth country-level analysis, the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative aims to provide
  data-driven recommendations to help policy makers, stakeholders, and donors plan more
  strategically and equitably. The present report synthesizes multisectoral research from 17 low-
  and middle-income countries7 and the West Bank and Gaza, undertaken since 2015. It presents
  new evidence on inequalities in access to WASH services, examines the impact of unequal
  services on the poor, and explores context-specific constraints that go beyond technical issues
  to understand why service delivery continues to be inadequate and inefficient. It highlights
  findings from individual countries, involves substantial reanalysis of existing data sets in new
  and innovative ways, brings new evidence on spatial inequalities at the subnational level, and
  shares insights on SDG parameters that were previously invisible. The work confirms some
  prior findings, even as it challenges water sector practitioners and decision makers to do
  business differently.

  The report is not prescriptive about how governments should spend their resources—such
  decisions are the domain of autonomous states, based on local needs, resources, and conditions.
  Rather, it offers insights on how to better use available information to prioritize and inform
  investment decisions. The report also does not offer prescriptions for addressing identified
  constraints but suggests an approach to finding solutions. One of the key learnings from the
  initiative is that there are no universal off-the-shelf solutions. Not only do politics, institutional
  arrangements, and norms vary across countries, but so do the different services within the
  WASH sector. The characteristics of urban water/sanitation and rural water/sanitation differ
  considerably in terms of their constituencies and the roles of state and private actors, and
  therefore attract varying degrees of political attention, suggesting diverse strategies to improve
  performance.

  To find solutions that will work within a given context, specific service delivery problem(s) may
  be used as the starting point for a diagnostic aimed at identifying binding constraints. The next
  step is to work with local stakeholders to debate and contest issues and solutions that are
  context specific and fit with local politics and the existing policy environment. This can open the

              ambit of reform options that are needed to improve services. (While the desk-based country
              analysis conducted under the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative highlights why such an
              engagement process is required, the process itself is beyond its scope.)

              The lessons from the Initiative point to the need to think and work differently—business as
              usual is not an option. Specifically, three broad shifts in thinking are needed to accelerate
              progress toward the SDGs’ vision for water and sanitation:

                ••   Investments and interventions need to be coordinated across sectors to improve human
                     development outcomes.

                ••   Future investments need to be better targeted and efficiently allocated, given that most
                     countries have limited fiscal space.

                ••   A better understanding of the broader governance context within which WASH services
                     are delivered is needed to reduce gaps between policy and implementation.


              All Hands on Deck: Working Together to Protect the
              Foundations of Development
              Regardless of their income level, all countries included in the WASH Poverty Diagnostic
              Initiative—and indeed most of the countries in the world—face multiple and competing
              challenges and priorities. In poor countries, poverty cuts across multiple dimensions,
              WASH being one of them. In fact, the lack of WASH services typically constitutes one of
              the  deepest and most far-reaching deprivations. With this in mind, this study highlights
              how  improving WASH can help protect the foundations of development by supporting
              nutrition (addressed by SDG 2) and health (addressed by SDG 3), two key pillars of human
              development.

              In several countries studied here, a silent emergency is putting vulnerable sections of the
              population at risk for nutritional deficiency and diarrheal disease. In Guatemala, Niger, the
              Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Yemen, and Bangladesh the rate of stunting8
              among children under 5 is over 40 percent. Stunting is a powerful risk factor associated with
              53 percent of infectious-disease-related deaths in developing countries. The undernutrition
              from which it results can have long-lasting negative effects on children: poor mental development,
              behavioral abnormalities, and a reduced capacity to work, among others. These disadvantages
              are detrimental to human capital and to economic development more generally. A growing
              literature shows how poor WASH contributes to undernutrition by transmitting pathogens and
              infections that inhibit nutritional uptake.

              Directing WASH investment toward public health objectives can help reduce childhood
              diarrheal disease and undernutrition—and, for this, geospatial mapping data are key. Although
              the correlation between monetary poverty and children’s health is clear enough at the
              country level, it does not map directly to poor/non-poor or rural/urban categories. Not all
              children in poor households or in rural areas are undernourished or suffering from diarrheal
              disease, and not all children in relatively wealthy or urban households eat well and are free
              from diarrheal disease. While it is a fact that children living in the five largest slums of
              Bangladesh have the highest rate of stunting in the country (nearly 50 percent), children in
              relatively well-off households are also at risk. Among the better off, those exposed to drinking
              water contaminated with E. coli are at higher risk than those who are not exposed to such
              water. The research conducted under the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative demonstrates
              that WASH investments targeted at areas or groups whose risk of diarrhea and stunting is
              high are likely to accomplish more in improving overall human development outcomes than
              efforts to achieve universal coverage by reducing the WASH gaps between poor and rich,
              rural and urban.


xvi	   Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
  An effort to improve WASH, coordinated with other health interventions, can have effects greater
  than the sum of its parts.  Using a conceptual framework from the United Nations Children’s
  Fund (UNICEF) as a guide, the analysis highlights the need to look across the determinants of
  poor health indicators, such as stunting, to understand the overlapping deprivations of a child.
  UNICEF identifies four determinants of stunting: a lack of (i) food security, (ii) adequate personal
  care and feeding, (iii) a healthy environment (that is, WASH), and (iv) adequate health-care
  services. The Initiative considers whether synergies are generated when more than one of
  these basic human needs are met. As outlined in this report, stunting can be reduced to a
  greater degree when children are given simultaneous access to both adequate WASH and
  specific health services than when they gain access to only WASH or only health services.

  A combination of WASH-related risk factors increases the likelihood of childhood death from
  diarrheal disease.9 The Initiative developed a risk model to assess the co-distribution of risk
  factors for child mortality from diarrheal disease—one of the most important being poor water
  supply and sanitation. Understanding where the risk of diarrheal mortality rates is highest also
  means understanding where children lack access to Vitamin A, are underweight for their age,
  and lack access to oral rehydration therapy (ORT). The combination of these risk factors
  determines a child’s overall risk of dying from diarrheal disease (figure ES. 2).

  WASH investments will have the greatest impact on childhood mortality due to diarrheal disease
  when they target geographic areas where populations have little access to services plus other
  vulnerabilities. One of the main benefits of the risk model that the WASH Poverty Diagnostic
  Initiative developed is its quantification of overall disease risk—and variations in this risk
  across subnational and income-level divisions.

  Map ES.1 highlights the spatial distribution of the exposure index associated with inadequate
  WASH and the susceptibility index of the factors that amplify or weaken the impacts of
  inadequate WASH in Mozambique. A high value of the exposure index (the blue map) implies
  poor WASH, while a high value of the susceptibility index (green map) implies high vulnerability
  (that is, lack of access to Vitamin A and ORT and being underweight). The risk index (red) is a
  combination of the exposure and susceptibility indices and highlights the provinces where

                                     children are most at risk of dying from diarrheal disease. This and other findings reveal that
                                     geographic targeting based simply on poor WASH services (high exposure index) may not be
                                     the most effective in terms of reducing diarrhea.


                                     Investments: More and Better Targeted
                                     Significant disparities in WASH quality are associated with differences in wealth level, location,
                                     and other demographic characteristics. Specifically, the quality of WASH facilities and services
                                     differ between the poor and non-poor, between rural and urban areas, between large cities and
                                     small cities, and across and within geographic regions of the same country. Traditionally
                                     disadvantaged groups—including women, the indigenous, and the disabled—suffer an additional
                                     burden. In some pockets of both rural and urban areas, this burden poses a dire threat to basic
                                     health. The WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative provides decision makers with more precise
                                     information about such inequalities so they can act to better allocate their resources.

                                     Rural areas are particularly lagging: in the countries analyzed, three out of four people who lack
                                     improved sanitation and four out of five people who don’t have improved water live in rural
                                     areas. Of the estimated 2.4 billion people in these 18 economies, 1.5 billion (63 percent) live
                                     in rural areas. The poor are disproportionately affected by this lag: approximately 74 percent
                                     live in rural areas.10 Meanwhile, a lack of attention to sanitation and the management of
                                     human waste is causing problems in both urban and rural areas. Sanitation-related disease is
                                     increasingly a concern in densely populated areas; the urban poor are two to three times less
                                     likely to access any type of improved sanitation than their better-off neighbors.11 To assist
                                     decision makers in achieving the policy objectives of equitable access, the WASH Poverty
                                     Diagnostic Initiative provides new methods to inform resource allocation.

  Map ES.2 shows the overlay of income poverty and improved sanitation and their spatial
  distribution in Nigeria. This reveals that the relationship between poverty levels and access to
  improved sanitation is not straightforward. Around 22 percent of Nigerians are in low-poverty
  areas and have low levels of access to improved sanitation, and around 10 percent of Nigerians
  are in high-poverty areas and have high access to improved sanitation. This type of information
  can help decision makers identify areas where it may be prudent to employ subsidies due to
  low income levels, and provides a guide to better understand why some geographic areas do
  better than others despite a high degree of poverty.

  Discrepancies between policies and budget allocations are compounded by inefficient execution
  and implementation. Policies and voted budgets often look “good” in terms of their commitments
  to extend WASH services to poor and marginalized populations, but the actual resource
  allocation decisions do not reflect the policy commitments. While there are no standard
  objective criteria for judging whether policies are “good” or “bad,” for the purposes of this
  initiative policies are assessed from the perspective of providing affordable, sustainable, and
  equitable services to the poor and marginalized groups.

  For example, the policy in Niger (PROHESA 2016-30) clearly articulates the state’s
  commitment to ensuring equal access to WASH services, and their affordability, and would,
  by this yardstick, be considered “good.” While the rate of access to improved water in
  urban areas stands at 100 percent, in rural parts of the same country only 1 percent of
  people have access to improved sanitation. While those living in cities saw their access to
  improved water increase by 39 percentage points between 1990 and 2015, open defecation
  increased in poor rural areas. These statistics are difficult to ignore given that 75 percent

             of residents live in rural areas, as do 90 percent of the poor, who are largely concentrated
             along the country’s southern border.

             While this report does not prescribe how governments should spend their resources, if
             countries and donors truly aspire to attain the SGDs then they will need to invest more in WASH
             and plan carefully to make more effective use of the resources available to them.


             Mind the Gap: From Policy to Pipes
             The failure to provide adequate WASH services to the poor and other marginalized groups
             results primarily from poor implementation rather than bad policy. For example, in Tanzania the
             water budget quadrupled in the span of just 12 years (2002–14), due in large part to enhanced
             coordination and commitments by donors to achieve the MDG for water. Donor support
             encouraged the country to adopt reforms aimed at devolving resources and authority to local
             governments and encouraging community participation in operations and management—
             widely endorsed measures meant to enhance sustainability and promote equity. However, as
             of 2015, access to basic water services had stagnated at just over 50 percent of the population.
             In addition, 40 percent of all water points12 in rural areas are not functional and an estimated
             25 percent of all water points in the country break down within two years of construction.

             The WASH sector is characterized by persistent failures in providing sustainable services to
             vulnerable populations—even when the funding to do so is available. This tendency is revealed
             again in the case of Tanzania, but its experience is not unique. Similar situations abound in most
             of the World Bank’s client countries. In addition to the resource allocation issues discussed
             previously, the kinds of service delivery challenges described in Tanzania point to the critical
             importance of enhancing the efficiency of resource use. There is a need to look beyond technical
             issues, and even challenge or revisit “best practice” approaches that have been promoted over
             the years. Improving the efficiency of resources will require sector practitioners to look beyond
             infrastructure and services and pay more attention to the institutional arrangements and the
             distribution of power that influences how these institutions perform in practice.

             Looking across a subset of 10 economies studied under the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative,13
             a set of common themes emerge. First, we see that information asymmetries and a lack of
             transparency frequently make it difficult for citizens to know what they can reasonably expect
             and demand from service providers and politicians. Such a lack of information is compounded by
             constraints on the ability of those without significant wealth to effectively voice their concerns.
             As a result, the visibility of outputs tends to drive the priorities of policy implementation. Among
             other things, this creates incentives to construct new infrastructure, rather than invest in the
             operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure or focus on improvements to water quality.

             The fact that water and sanitation services have been only partially decentralized in many of the
             cases also creates challenges for implementation. Several country cases reveal a lack of clarity
             in the allocation of responsibilities and poor coordination across different implementing agencies.
             This results in local governments failing to adequately discharge the responsibilities assigned to
             them. This is frequently the result of a transfer of responsibilities to the local level without a
             commensurate transfer/availability of financial and human resources. The failure to sufficiently
             resource local governments is frequently political—reflecting a reluctance on the part of the
             central government to meaningfully share power, an outcome of intergovernmental interactions
             within what the 2017 World Development Report calls the “policy arena” (World Bank 2017a).
             Thus, in addition to the cross-government coordination discussed above, there are efficiency
             gains that can be had from improving coordination across levels/tiers of government.

             Critically, the identification of common constraints does not justify the application of common
             solutions. A problem-driven approach is necessarily context driven, and—perhaps frustratingly—
             means that would-be reformers cannot begin with a prepackaged toolkit of tried-and-tested



xx	   Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
  reforms. Rather, the proposed approach necessitates beginning with a well-identified service
  delivery problem and identifying the broader governance context within which it manifests.
  Political economy analysis can help to identify the relevant actors whose incentives can
  potentially be shifted to facilitate more efficient and equitable outcomes. Instead of trying to
  rework the whole operating environment, the goal is to navigate it, while being cognizant of
  political and technical constraints.


  Looking Toward the Sustainable
  Development Goals
  The Initiative points to the importance of thinking (and working) differently, not only about
  inequality in WASH services, but also about how investment in WASH can have added impact on
  human development outcomes. It draws from all possible data sources, contributing new ones
  (notably in relation to water quality) to triangulate the analysis and objectively ascertain the
  facts and proposed recommendations. The lessons from this initiative highlight the following:

    ••   If policy objectives are to reduce inequities in human development outcomes with WASH
         investment, then going at it alone and taking a spatially blind approach will not do.
         Coordinated efforts that consider investment in health services and nutrition investment
         are critical. These can also help reinforce cross-sectoral coordination more broadly in
         efforts to reduce undernutrition, stunting, and morbidity and mortality due to diarrheal
         disease.

    ••   To reduce inequalities in WASH services between more and less vulnerable groups,
         resources need to be targeted in a more efficient manner; the Initiative offers a compass
         for achieving those policy objectives.

    ••   To strengthen institutions and improve efficiencies, there is a need to look at the broader
         governance environment to understand binding constraints beyond technical issues
         specific to the WASH sector.

    ••   More money is required, but investing more money in inefficient institutions will not
         always result in better outcomes; improving efficiencies and strengthening institutions is
         paramount.

    ••   Harmonizing and improving data collection efforts at the country level will be critical to
         monitoring the SDG indicators. This means more consistency across national surveys,
         but also better use of administrative data. Making information such as water quality
         available to the public can reduce information asymmetries.

  The lessons from 1850s’ London resonate today: politics matter when developing policies
  and  allocating and spending resources. The tasks that countries and donor institutions
  must consider as they look ahead at the SDGs may be considered herculean. They need not
  be undertaken alone. A key reflection from this initiative is that building cross-sectoral
  collaborations among water, poverty, health, and governance specialists brings a diverse range
  of perspectives and new insights, and opens up the possibility to think and work differently.
  This report hopes to inspire decision makers and practitioners to do just that for goals to be
  more than words, with tangible benefits for the most vulnerable.

Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   xxiii
  Chapter 1
  A New Era of Service
  Delivery: Preparing to Meet the
  Sustainable Development Goals
  In 2013, the World Bank announced two challenging goals for its daily operations, country
  engagement, and analytical work: (i) ending extreme poverty and (ii) boosting shared prosperity.
  While these twin corporate goals are measured in terms of income, the spirit behind them extends
  to the overall well-being of those on the lower end of overall wealth distribution. Many such people
  are poor not only in cash terms, but also in terms of their level of access to basic public services.

  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) formally adopted in 2015 are unambiguous in
  their call for universal access to water and sanitation services. Goal #6, “Ensure access to
  water and sanitation for all,” and Goal #3, “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all
  at all ages,” provide a clear vision for progressively eliminating inequalities in access to basic
  services and reducing poverty.1

  These goals put equity front and center in ways that are both positive and normative. Typically,
  better-off households have better access to basic services such as water supply, sanitation,
  health care, and education. These services allow children in these households to live healthier
  lives and to accumulate more human capital than children from disadvantaged backgrounds, thus
  contributing to future inequities in well-being. A lack of access to good-quality services early in life
  fosters the intergenerational transmission of poverty, otherwise known as the “poverty trap.”2

  In light of the World Bank’s twin goals and the SDGs, the World Bank’s Water Global Practice
  launched the Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Poverty Diagnostic Initiative to
  shine a light on service delivery to the poor and vulnerable. Specifically, the initiative undertook
  research to better understand the impacts of inadequate services and identify the  binding
  constraints to service delivery. This initiative considers the new standards of the SDGs, which
  raise the bar (above that set by the Millennium Development Goals, MDGs) by not just aiming
  for universal access to basic WASH services, but also attempting to close the gaps in service
  quality, with an eye toward long-term sustainability. This means not only providing water in
  people’s homes, but also making sure that the water that flows from the taps is safe to drink
  and continuously accessible and available. It means not just constructing more sanitation
  facilities, but making sure that human waste is properly removed, treated, and disposed of—
  and in all neighborhoods, not just the wealthiest. It means institutions working efficiently and
  effectively to deliver services. The revised standards of the SDGs translate into higher capital
  and operating costs—at least a fourfold increase in capital spending over what was required
  to reach the MDGs for water and sanitation. Yet many countries struggled to meet even those
  relatively modest targets with the resources that were available.

  This raises several questions: What will it take to achieve the SDGs—particularly for those
  countries that failed to meet the MDGs? Do the binding constraints lie in policy or its
  implementation? Even if more resources become available, will these result in the desired
  outcomes? How can WASH investment be better targeted to close service gaps and reduce
  inequities in health outcomes? This report engages with these questions and sheds light on
  emerging answers to them.


Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   1
            The Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)
            Poverty Diagnostic Initiative
            The Initiative was launched in 2015 to better understand trends in access to WASH services,
            the impacts of unequal service provision on the poor, and the reasons why service delivery
            continues to be inadequate and inefficient. Based on its analysis of these factors, the diagnostic
            seeks to provide evidence on the state of WASH inequality around the world, and attempts to
            understand why differences in access rates persist.

            There are no simple answers or one-size-fits-all explanations for these complex problems, let
            alone solutions. Hence, solutions will need to be individually tailored to every context. In
            recognition of this, the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative took a multisectoral and problem-
            driven approach.3 At the Initiative’s core are four questions that guided research and fieldwork
            across 17 countries4 (that range from middle-income to low-income to fragile and conflict
            affected) and the West Bank and Gaza. These questions are as follows:

              1.	 Who and where are the poor and vulnerable populations?

              2.	 What is their level of access to WASH services, and of what quality, relative to the
                  better-off segments of society?

              3.	 What are the links and synergies between WASH and other sectors?

              4.	 What are the binding constraints on improving service delivery, and how can these
                  be addressed?

            Why these four questions? In short, they call for a comprehensive and robust evidence base,
            at the country level, that can be used to guide policy and programs both local and global. The
            robust evidence generated under this initiative and the approaches that it advocates will help
            policy makers, implementing agencies, and donors understand with a new level of precision
            who and where the most vulnerable in society are located and how to best serve them. This, in
            turn, can help them better allocate, prioritize, and coordinate resources to meet their policy
            objectives and improve human development outcomes.

            In so doing, the initiative highlights binding constraints that, to be addressed, require further
            engagement and research. While the Initiative aspired to identify solutions to constraints in
            service delivery, this ultimately was beyond its scope. In general, the initiative found that
            improving the efficiency of public resources at scale requires sector practitioners to look beyond
            infrastructure and services and pay more attention to the institutional arrangements and
            the distributions of power that influence how these institutions perform in practice. Such an
            approach suggests shifting from a focus on “best practices” to a context-specific “best fit” that
            “works with the grain”5 of the prevailing political context. Any reforms implemented using this
            approach are likely to be incremental and feasible. Instead of trying to rework the whole operating
            environment, the goal is to navigate it, while cognizant of political and technical constraints. This
            report advocates this approach because the politics, institutional arrangements, societal norms,
            and even the characteristics of water and sanitation services differ by nation and locale.


            From the Millennium Development Goals
            to the Sustainable Development Goals
            The MDGs distinguished between “improved” and “unimproved” water and sanitation services.
            Today, the SDGs propose a more ambitious vision for service delivery, using new indicators that
            are more refined and stringent. The baseline estimates developed by the Joint Monitoring
            Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation6 provide a stark picture of the challenges


2	   Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
  and opportunities over the next 15 years: 4.5 billion people lack access to safely managed
  sanitation, and 2.1 billion to safely managed water.7 This report focuses on three SDG targets:8

    ••   By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water
         for all.

    ••   By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and
         end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and
         those in vulnerable situations.

    ••   By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing
         release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated
         wastewater, and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.9

  This report provides a picture of the implications of shifting from the MDGs to the SDGs. In
  2016, Hutton and Varughese estimated that $28 billion a year would be needed to provide the
  unserved with just basic services (MDG standards), and estimates run well over a $100 billion
  a year to provide safely managed services (SDG standards) for all. This report acknowledges
  that while more money is required to reach the new targets, it is even more critical that
  effectiveness and efficiency in the allocation and the use of resources be prioritized. Focusing
  on these priorities would improve targeting and reduce the waste of scarce public resources.

  Table 1.1 provides an overview of the ladder-like progression of quality levels for water and
  sanitation services that the JMP will monitor. The top level of quality for water supply and
  sanitation is “safely managed.”

  The United Nations (UN) Member States agreed to raise standards by committing to the SDGs.
  This in itself is an acknowledgement that the previous standards were not sufficient to
  ensure that assets were fully delivering the social or public good benefits intended. For example,
  under the MDGs a household could still be considered to have access to improved drinking
  water even if it took over an hour to obtain, decreasing the volume of water consumed and
  increasing the risk of contamination during transport. Where piped supply is intermittent, the
  risk of water becoming contaminated increases greatly. A toilet with a slab may adequately
  protect users from contact with human feces, but what happens when a latrine or septic tank
  fills up? And what if sewage is left untreated? The SDGs attempt to comprehensively close
  existing gaps in access to basic services, and to ensure that improvements are sustained over
  the long term.

  Whenever standards are raised, some countries will struggle more than others to achieve
  them. This is most definitely the case of the new SDG targets 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, which have
  different implications for different countries. While some countries may need to simply increase
  efficiency by some modest amount, others will face significant challenges and will most likely
  need to take an incremental approach to meeting these targets.

  Figure 1.1 provides a snapshot of how coverage rates will change across 17 of the WASH
  Poverty Diagnostic countries as each of the SDG parameters is applied. Specifically, it compares
  Ethiopia, the 17-country average, and Ecuador.10 While coverage will decline across all countries,
  it will do so to varying degrees. Also, countries that do not collect data on the parameters of
  the new SDG baseline, “safely managed,” will find it particularly difficult to even consider how
  best to address the comprehensive WASH needs of their citizens, or to demonstrate any
  progress they do make toward the 2030 goal of universal access.

  Water quality and the continuity of water supply appear to be key drivers that lower the baselines
  for safely managed water (where data are available). For instance, while Ecuador and Bangladesh
  have achieved their MDGs for water, the new SDG standards have recalibrated their baselines
  down by 22 and 44 percentage points, respectively, largely due to water quality issues.
  Moreover, piped water on household premises was found to be equally or more contaminated

  Congo. On the other hand, accessibility (that is, improved services on premises) will continue
  to pose a challenge for low-income countries such as Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of
  Congo, Tanzania, and Niger, which struggled to meet the MDGs. The SDG indicators push these
  countries’ baselines (which were already low under the MDGs) down by over 44 percentage
  points. This reinforces the importance of taking the ladder approach adopted by the JMP (see
  table 1.1) to help countries track incremental progress toward universal access to safely
  managed drinking water and sanitation. Quality of service is further discussed in chapter 2.


  Country Selection and Methodology
  The 18 economies studied under the Initiative are located in six regions of the world (see
  map 1.1).11 They are not a globally representative sample but do include a mix of low-income,
  fragile, and middle-income economies.

  The WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative systematically developed and applied various methods
  across countries to understand inequalities in service provision, outcomes of such inequities,
  and binding constraints on service delivery. Through desk research, the initiative explored
  existing country literature on health, WASH, and service delivery, and also conducted primary
  data collection and qualitative field work. (For a more detailed description of methods and
  reference to background papers, see appendix A.)


  The Value of the WASH Poverty
  Diagnostic Initiative
  The Initiative examines inequality across four “domains”: poverty, location, social identity, and
  time. It is essential to engage with inequalities across these different domains to better

                                     allocate resources to those in need. Mapping access to WASH across locations and social
                                     groups can provide information on the distribution of well-being, beyond what is provided by
                                     poverty indicators. Also, it should be noted that the correlation between monetary and
                                     nonmonetary (that is, geographical and social) indicators is not perfect because these
                                     indicators capture different concepts and can vary independently of one another.


                                     WASH and Poverty
                                     Understanding the relationship between WASH services and poverty can inform the more
                                     efficient use of resources. This in turn can help service providers reach those in need, reduce
                                     inequalities between population subgroups, and track differences in access. The Initiative is a
                                     first attempt to monitor progress toward the SDGs at a local scale. In addition, the initiative
                                     demonstrates how factors such as WASH indicators and income poverty can be overlaid and
                                     spatially represented. The result is a nuanced picture of the interplay between poverty and
                                     WASH that not only highlights geographic areas of need (that is, where poverty rates are high
                                     and access low) but also potential islands of effectiveness (that is, where access rates are
                                     high despite high income poverty). This is important, as it increases the precision with which
                                     resources can be targeted.


                                     WASH and Child Health
                                     The Initiative represents the most systematic effort to date, using country-level data, to quantify
                                     the relationship between WASH and child health outcomes. These results should inform policy,
                                     investments, and advocacy for cross-sectoral collaboration. The link between inadequate



6	                          Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
  WASH and poor health (such as diarrheal disease) are well established in the literature.
  There is also a growing body of evidence linking poor WASH to undernutrition, as evident, for
  example, in the rates of stunting among children under five. The Initiative takes these findings
  and applies them to specific country contexts, demonstrating where and for which groups the
  burden of disease is greatest due to inadequate WASH.


  WASH Service Delivery
  WASH reform initiatives are typically specific to the sector or a particular service—and
  planners look at rural water or urban sanitation, for instance, in isolation. To better handle
  the gaps between policy and implementation there is a need to engage with the constraints
  imposed by the broader institutional arrangements12 within which WASH services are
  financed, managed, and delivered, and that affect the quality and sustainability of these
  services. This broader perspective opens up the ambit of reform efforts to recognize political
  and other nontechnical factors that impede or enhance service delivery. Doing so requires
  a deeper understanding of cross-cutting public management issues such as planning
  and  budgeting, public investment management, financial management, accounting, fiscal
  reporting, procurement, and intergovernmental systems that impact all services and that
  are in some form or fashion tied to politics. In this vein, the WASH Poverty Diagnostic
  Initiative supports and promotes an emerging approach to improving service delivery that
  entails being problem driven, taking a more adaptive path to finding solutions, and working
  “with the grain” of politics in the local context (see Booth 2011; Kelsall 2011; and Levy
  2014). Even where the characteristics of services such as sanitation are not politically
  salient today, things may change tomorrow. The story of the “Great Stink” in London shows
  that the incentives of politicians can shift drastically in a short time. The examples from the
  case studies presented in this report reflect a problem-driven approach. However, they stop
  short of providing universally valid solutions as, by its very nature, the approach is context
  and country specific.



  Road Map
  The remaining five chapters of this report are organized by common themes that emerged
  across the case studies. Chapter 2 discusses the inequalities in WASH services observed with
  respect to income, location, social category, and time. Chapter 3 looks at how WASH investments
  can best nurture human capital. Here, health outcomes are considered as an additional filter
  in decisions on how and where to prioritize WASH investments. Specifically, the chapter looks at
  the burden of childhood diarrheal disease and undernutrition, and at the interaction
  between WASH and a selection of health services. Chapter 4 discusses the allocation of WASH
  resources, and begins to highlight the disconnect between stated policy objectives and
  implementation. The Initiative does not explore the political economy of how and why certain
  policies are promoted and why allocation decisions often do not reflect the stated policy in a
  country. As highlighted in the 2017 World Development Report (World Bank 2017), this is an
  important question, but was beyond the scope of this initiative. Chapter 5 builds on the previous
  chapters and focuses on the issue of efficiency in resource use. This chapter explores why
  services are failing, and steps outside traditional modes of thinking to look at the broader
  governance context in which services are delivered. The aim is not to develop or hypothesize a
  set of solutions to the challenges identified, but rather to present a different approach to
  service delivery to inform future reform efforts. A brief conclusion, titled “Looking Toward the
  Sustainable Development Goals,” will suggest potential ways for government officials and
  development partners to do business differently to meet the SDG goals.

            Notes
            	 1.	The SDGs, otherwise known as the Global Goals, are a universal call to action to end
                  poverty, to protect the planet, and to ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
                  These 17 goals build on the successes of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), while
                  addressing additional topics such as climate change, economic inequality, innovation,
                  sustainable consumption, peace, and justice, among other priorities. The goals are
                  interconnected—the key to success in one may involve tackling issues more commonly
                  associated with another (United Nations Development Programme, UNDP).

                  institutional complexity and describes the kinds of reform efforts that would be consistent

Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   9
  Chapter 2
  Inequality in Access to Water
  Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene
  There is widespread agreement that the poor are less likely to have and to use critical
  infrastructure, services, and supply chains (hereafter referred to as “access”) than are the non-
  poor. In an ideal world, there would be no correlation between access and measures of poverty.1
  But the ultimate goal—universal access to high-quality services—is unquestionably difficult to
  achieve. Consider a fast-growing city in a developing nation: decision makers often face a
  trade-off between providing more people with some degree of access, and fewer people with
  higher-quality access. They may choose to install centralized public restrooms or public taps in
  a low-income housing development than provide each household with an individual connection.
  And where such services are indeed on household premises, their quality may be subpar. In
  the context of budget constraints, it is clear that there are no easy answers. Different contexts
  require different technical solutions. Where the chlorination of water systems is not feasible,
  for example, other interventions that protect public health, such as household water treatment,
  can be promoted.

  So, who has access to what services, where, and of what quality? This analysis centers on the
  definitions of water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) levels used to track progress toward
  the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which formed the basis for efforts to improve
  WASH access between 1990 and 2015 and remain intrinsic to the new monitoring framework
  of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030, on which data are scarce. This chapter
  builds on the MDG indicators and uses SDG definitions when possible (box 2.1). These WASH
  indicators have the potential to accelerate progress toward the achievement of SDG 1, “End
  Poverty in all its forms everywhere”; and SDG  10, “Reduce inequality within and among
  countries.”

  The evidence presented here shows significant disparities in the quality of drinking water,
  sanitation, and hygiene facilities and services between the poor and non-poor, between
  rural and urban areas, and across and within geographic regions of the same country.
  Traditionally disadvantaged groups—including women, the indigenous, and the disabled—
  suffer an additional burden. The size of this burden increases alongside membership in
  multiple groups; in some pockets of both rural and urban areas, it poses a dire threat to
  basic health.

  This chapter summarizes the inequality patterns revealed across the 18 countries studied by
  the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative, and organizes the discoveries by their correlation with
  several different domains, or “spaces”: poverty, location, social identity, and time. Considering
  the interrelationship of poverty and safely managed WASH, it compares the bottom 40 percent
  (B40) of the wealth distribution with the top 60 percent (T60). It also presents findings for
  populations under the national poverty line as well as those categorized by international
  standards as living in extreme poverty. As for location, the chapter discusses asymmetries
  between people living in rural and urban areas, as well as differences between and within
  (i) cities and (ii) subnational divisions. The chapter then turns to critical disadvantaged social
  groups, with a focus on women, the indigenous, and the disabled. Finally, the chapter considers
  inequality across time by looking at intergenerational disparities.




Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   11
                  Box 2.1: Water and Sanitation Definitions Used throughout this Report

                  The Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene Poverty Diagnostic Initiative uses five key
                  indicators of water quality and access:

                  •	 Improved water sources are those which, by the nature of their construction and
                       when properly used, adequately protect the source from outside contamination,
                       particularly fecal matter. Such sources include piped water to yards or plots,
                       public taps or standpipes, tube wells or boreholes, protected springs, and
                       rainwater.

                  •	 Basic water is improved water that can be collected in no more than 30 minutes,
                       round-trip.

                  •	 Improved water on premises fulfills the same requirements as improved water,
                       but further implies that it is available directly, on household premises.
                  •	 Piped water on premises fulfills the same requirements as improved water on
                       premises, but specifies that water is provided through pipes.

                  •	 A safely managed water service implies that the household’s drinking water
                       source is improved and on premises, and that water is available when needed
                       and is free of fecal and chemical contamination.
                  The following four key indicators are used when referring to sanitation and hygiene:

                  •	 Open defecation is the practice of people defecating outside and not into a
                       designated toilet.

                  •	 An improved sanitation facility is one that hygienically separates users from
                       contact with fecal matter; the facility may be unshared, or shared by two or more
                       households.

                  •	 Improved sanitation implies access to an improved sanitation facility that is not
                       shared with any other household.

                  •	 Sewerage implies that a household is connected to a sewer system.
                  Source: WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative.




             The analysis aims to supports two goals: improving overall access to safely managed WASH,
             and ensuring its equitable allocation. Both are needed for an economy to achieve positive
             socioeconomic outcomes in the critical areas of early childhood development, education,
             health, and information. In this way, the analysis is geared to provide important WASH keys to
             unlock the World Bank’s twin goals—to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity—
             and, simultaneously, speed progress toward SDG targets 6.1 and 6.2 (see chapter 1).

             Acknowledging and understanding the evidence is critical to developing the priorities and
             policies needed to achieve the universal coverage that the SDGs are striving for. This chapter
             contributes critical documentation and quantification of known inequalities using the latest
             data assessed to be of sufficient validity and reliability. The analysis also uncovers several
             important patterns and insights that are less known. For example, in Bangladesh and the
             Democratic Republic of Congo, water quality issues affect both the T60 and B40 populations
             and are pervasive throughout regions and across different types of water technology.



12	   Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
  Poverty Space: A Closer Look
  Analysis across countries suggests that among the studied factors, wealth is the most important
  determinant of WASH status. Some countries have made laudable progress in expanding
  access to improved drinking water and sanitation (see box 2.1 for definitions) among
  B40 households.2 However, the gap between these and T60 households persists. Meanwhile,
  in other countries, B40 households are gaining access in urban but not rural areas. In short,
  the gap in access to improved WASH between the B40 and T60 remains large the world
  over, though access patterns vary widely in and between countries (figure 2.1). On average,
  78  percent of households in the T60 have access to improved water, compared with only
  63 percent of households in the B40; 33 percent of households in the T60 have access to
  piped water on premises, compared with only 17 percent of the B40. Interestingly, the average
  gap between the T60 and B40 does not change when moving from improved water to piped
  water on premises. One might expect it to widen, but in many countries, where the T60 also
  lack access to piped water on premises, the gap decreases.

  Among the study countries, access to sanitation was far lower among the B40 than the
  T60 (figure 2.2). Thirty-seven percent of people in the B40 practice open defecation, compared
  with 17 percent of households in the T60. Meanwhile, the number of people practicing open
  defecation is distributed across these groups. Two in three (64 percent) of people in the
  T60 have access to shared or unshared improved sanitation facilities, compared with close
  to one in three (40 percent) among the B40. Finally, only half of the population in the T60 has
  access to improved sanitation whereas 29 percent of the population in the B40 do. Similar
  to piped water on premises, when higher standards of sanitation are considered (for example,
  shared vs. unshared bathrooms), service coverage drops for both the T60 and B40, and on
  average the gap between them narrows slightly. The B40 continue to be worse off, but the
  gap does not grow.

                                      Access to improved water services is dramatically higher in urban than in rural areas. While
                                      almost all the population living in urban areas has access to improved water services, only
                                      two-thirds of households living in rural areas enjoy such access.3 Countries like Tunisia,
                                      Bangladesh, Panama, and India are close to reaching universal coverage under the MDG
                                      indicators, but emerging evidence on the SDG indicators is cause for concern. Furthermore,
                                      the rural and urban divide remains stark in African countries, where less than half of the rural
                                      population has access to improved water sources. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of
                                      Congo, rural access rates to improved water are 33 percent, on average, compared with
                                      84 percent in urban areas. The urban-rural gap in access to drinking water piped to premises is

  even wider: half of the urban population, but only one-fourth of the rural (figure 2.3). Interestingly,
  gaps between urban and rural areas increase quite substantially when moving to the higher
  standard of improved water on premises, suggesting a decreased time burden for urban
  residents with some form of improved source. However, this gap decreases when moving to
  piped water on premises, which is fairly uncommon in urban areas across South Asia and Sub-
  Saharan Africa.

  Low levels of overall access to sanitation facilities narrow the urban-rural gap. On average, about
  half of the population in the 18 countries covered by the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative
  have access to an unshared, improved facility. Despite the progress made over the past
  25 years—the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation4 estimates
  that improved sanitation access worldwide rose from 54 to 68 percent between 1990 and

                                        2015—most of the 18 countries studied5 did not meet the MDG for sanitation.6 Open defecation
                                        is still overwhelmingly common in some of the countries, for example 71  percent of the
                                        population in Niger, 40 percent in India, and 15 percent in Nigeria. Most but not all occurs in
                                        rural areas: the rural share is estimated to be 90 percent. In terms of access to improved
                                        sanitation, 61 and 45 percent of the urban and rural population, respectively, are covered.

                                        Levels of urban WASH access vary not only by city but within the same urban area; access in
                                        secondary cities remains worrisome and in some poor urban pockets, access rates are lower than
                                        in some rural areas. Looking at four of Indonesia’s largest cities—Jakarta, Medan, Surabaya, and
                                        Makassar—it is clear that the peripheries have both higher levels of poverty and lower levels of
                                        access than the city centers. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, concentrated investments in
                                        Kinshasa’s water supply appear to have consolidated and raised access to improved water to
                                        near-universal levels over the past 15 years (figure 2.5), with the rest of the country lagging.

          Box 2.2: Urban Water and Sanitation in Ethiopia

          In contrast to the experience of rural areas, urban water and sanitation services
          have delivered real benefits—but not equitably or sustainably. With over 10 million
          people gaining access to water from a piped source on premises, significant time
          savings have been realized in urban areas. However, these savings have been
          disproportionally captured by relatively well-off households (that is, those in the top
          60 percent of the wealth distribution), who are nearly four times more likely to have
          access to piped water on premises than poorer households (those in the bottom
          40 percent of the wealth index). The reasons for this inequitable uptake are twofold.
          For about a third of households that are not connected, mainly in smaller towns,
          there is a lack of infrastructure to connect to. For the remainder, mainly in large
          urban centers, the infrastructure exists but households can’t pay or utilities simply
          aren’t making the connection.

  Access to WASH in urban slums poses a major challenge. In Bangladesh, only 13 percent of
  households in the slums of the five largest metropolises have their own sanitation facilities.
  Inadequate WASH in newly urbanized/periurban areas reflect a lack of capacity—at both the
  local and national level—to plan for rapid development and expand service networks as needed.

  Countries also suffer important WASH disparities across provinces: for the first time the Initiative
  systematically exploited data to estimate disparities in access down to the district level.

                                          For  instance, analysis in Nigeria shows with presicion which pockets drop out as higher
                                          standards are applied from easier-to-achieve (for example, improved water) through to higher
                                          (for example, piped on premises) standards. Such findings are observed in maps A to D in
                                          map 2.1,7 as the standards of quality and technology required progressively increase. Overall,
                                          it can be observed that clusters in the northcentral, southwest, and southcentral regions
                                          exhibit the best performance overall. Piped water on premises is scarcely available throughout
                                          the country, short of a few small pockets in the Taraba, Jigawa, and Yobe states.8

                                          seek to address this disparity, by calling for countries to “achieve access to adequate and

  stipulate that coverage rates for poor and vulnerable groups should increase at a faster rate
  than for other unserved populations (WHO/UNICEF 2013).

  The gender of the household head may play a small role in explaining differences in access
  to water and sanitation, but women and girls continue to bear the burden of most household
  water-related tasks. Such tasks are often very time consuming. Where paths to water
  sources are long and through remote areas, this may put women at risk of sexual and other
  physical violence, which is prevalent in fragile countries. For example, in Niger, the average
  route increased between 2006 and 2012, reaching almost an hour round-trip (figure 2.6).
  The average female, whether woman or girl, spends about 36 10-hour working days a year
  collecting water. In rural areas, the time spent fetching water is especially high. Adding a
  30-minute round-trip threshold to the definition of improved access to drinking water (termed
  “basic” in the SDG monitoring framework) drops access rates to improved water in rural
  settings by 9 percentage points. In Panama, the Initiative indicates that girls in the sixth
  grade are 6 to 10 percentage points more likely to have missed at least one day of school
  during the past six months than their male peers. This and related findings indicate that
  learning outcomes appear to be positively correlated with WASH facilities.

  The ethnicity10 of the household head is found to play a role in explaining a household’s access
  to water and sanitation in Nigeria, Panama, Guatemala, and Ecuador. While it is difficult to
  disentangle the causal relationships between lack of access and factors such as income
  poverty, location, and ethnicity, regression analysis shows that—beyond income poverty—
  ethnicity is a determinant in these countries. Acknowledging the vulnerabilities of particular
  social groups is the first step toward addressing them. Similarly, in India, vulnerability is seen
  to differ by caste. A child born into one of the lowest castes is three times more likely to live in
  a household where members defecate in the open than is a child born into the higher castes.
  Even after controlling for location and income, a low caste is still seen to contribute to the
  practice of open defecation.

  Even where households report that their members usually use an improved WASH source,
  certain household members may not be able to access it without assistance. In particular,
  people with disabilities face significant barriers. In Tajikistan, 24 percent of households reported
  having at least one household member with one or more functional disabilities of various levels

             of severity who was unable to access the main drinking water source without assistance. In
             Nigeria, around 67 percent of respondents believe that people with disabilities face challenges
             in accessing and using toilets, and around 51 percent believe that the needs of disabled
             people are not considered during the design of public or private toilets (UNICEF 2017).


             Time Space: The Human Opportunity Index
             Latin America has taken the lead in moving toward providing all children with access to water
             services. Of the countries included in this study, Panama ranks the highest on the Human
             Opportunity Index (HOI; see box 2.3 for details) for improved and basic water. Although all five
             African countries in the study have HOIs below 60, Niger leads the region in improved water
             services: 58 percent are equitably distributed. Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of
             Congo rank at the bottom of the list. All countries face challenges in ensuring equitable (and,
             in many cases, any) access to piped water. Moreover, opportunities to access sanitation
             services rank even lower than access to water services.

             Inequality in access to water services is mostly the result of variations in wealth and location.
             Among the five factors11 considered in our analysis, that a household is part of the B40 and is
             located in a rural area are the strongest predictors12 of a child’s lack of access to water
             services (figure 2.7).




                  Box 2.3: The Human Opportunity Index

                  The Human Opportunity Index (HOI) is the main instrument used by the Water Supply,
                  Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Poverty Diagnostic Initiative to measure inequalities
                  in access to WASH across time. It can be interpreted as a composite of two
                  indicators: (i) the level of coverage of those basic services necessary for human
                  development, such as WASH, among the population of interest; and (ii) the degree
                  to which that level is conditional on circumstances into which children are born (such
                  as gender, income, or household characteristics). Much inequality is an outcome of
                  the chances of birth, and circumstances over which individuals have little or no
                  control, but that often trap them in poverty and reduce access to basic services. The
                  HOI essentially measures how personal circumstances affect a child’s probability of
                  accessing the services that are necessary to thrive and succeed in life. If societies
                  aim for equitable development, they need to ensure that as many children as possible
                  have access to basic opportunities.

                  To measure inequality, the HOI takes the coverage of each basic service, and then
                  discounts that coverage by how unequally the service is distributed among a given
                  population. If two regions within a country have identical rates of access to water,
                  they may still have a different HOI ranks if the residents who lack access share a
                  personal circumstance beyond their control, such as being female, living in a rural
                  area, or living in a household whose head has a primary-school education or less.
                  The HOI runs from zero to 100; thus, a place that has achieved universal coverage
                  of a given service would score 100, while a place with more inequality in coverage
                  would have a lower score.

Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	                                    21
                                       New Insights into the Quality of Services
                                       The previous section quantified several intuitive patterns of WASH access. This section
                                       highlights several unique findings regarding service quality that further elucidate the complexities
                                       and the challenges in the sector.

                                       Although there have been significant increases in access to improved drinking water, most
                                       relate to water outside household premises, missing that critical element of classification under
                                       the SDG “safely managed” indicator. Most people in Nigeria (61 percent) have access to
                                       improved water, but only half of this is on premises. Approximately 14 percent of the population
                                       has access to basic water—that is, within a 30-minute round-trip—and 16 percent has access
                                       to improved water sources farther away. The same pattern is found in the Democratic Republic
                                       of Congo, where 50 percent of the population has access to basic water, but 25 percent of
                                       them must travel more than 30 minutes round-trip to get it. In Ethiopia between 2000 and
                                       2011, the proportion of people able to fetch water within 30 minutes actually fell—from 65 to
                                       56 percent—with the data suggesting that people may being walking farther to substitute
                                       improved water sources for unimproved ones closer to home. While a growing preference for
                                       improved sources would be encouraging, the time involved means that often less water is
                                       collected than adequate to cover basic hygiene needs.

                                       Furthermore, the amount of time needed to access a reliable water source in rural areas varies
                                       greatly. Map 2.2 presents the amount of time needed to complete a round-trip journey to the
                                       closest functioning13 water source from a given location in Nigeria, defined here as the rural
                                       accessibility index (see Andres, Inha, and Getthing 2017). Only 39 percent of the rural

  population lives within a 30-minute round-trip of a functioning water source, and 34 percent of
  the population lives at least two hours away from such a source. Most alarmingly, over 26 million
  Nigerians living in rural areas must travel four or more hours round-trip to access a functioning
  water point.

  While access to improved water at the national level increased in most of the countries analyzed,
  access to piped water on premises declined in one-third of them. In Nigeria, it deteriorated by
  10 percentage points: from 12 percent in 1990 to 2 percent in 2015 (JMP 2015). This is
  mainly due to a steep decline of 29 percentage points within urban areas—from 32 to 3 percent
  during this period—due to rapid urbanization, lack of investment, and institutional constraints
  in the maintenance of services. Moreover, households continually face the risk of bacteriological
  and/or chemical contamination by increasingly relying on unregulated alternative water
  providers or private household solutions, such as manually drilled boreholes, the consequences
  of which are unknown due to limited data which offer limited data on aquifer recharge and
  saline intrusion. Similarly, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, water connections on premises
  have become relatively rare—as evident in a drop from 48 percent of the urban population in
  1990 to only 17 percent in 2015. Urban populations in Haiti, Tanzania, and the West Bank and
  Gaza also suffered a decline in access to piped water on premises.

  Successes in achieving the water MDGs hide some realities on the ground: the E. coli
  contamination at point of use is shockingly common and cuts across differences in location,
  supply technology, and wealth. For instance, though Bangladesh has made significant progress
  in switching to improved water infrastructure,14 much of what is extracted remains contaminated
  with dangerous microbes, heavy metals, or salt. Whilst 97 percent of the population now
  relies on improved water infrastructure. However, half of the water sources (48 percent) are
  contaminated by E. coli and/or arsenic, which would disqualify them from the SDG definition
  of “safely managed” drinking water. Interestingly, problematic water quality seems be an
  issue for the rich and poor alike and is pervasive throughout regions and across different
  types of water technologies. For instance, piped water, often an exclusive asset of rich urban
  populations, seldom has high arsenic or salt content, but available data suggest it can still be
  highly contaminated with fecal bacteria. Piped water offers benefits of convenience and
  centralized regulation and treatment. However, it is a telling statistic that people who use
  piped water on their premises, which is theoretically the best, safest option, face E. coli
  contamination more than 80 percent of the time, a rate not much different than that of water
  drawn from ponds and streams. These levels of contamination in piped water supply are likely
  the result of inadequate treatment at production and/or frequent interruptions in supply
  (distribution networks act as vacuums when not fully pressurized, taking in contamination
  through leaky pipes and joints).

  In the Democratic Republic of Congo, even among households with access to piped water in
  the relatively well-served capital, Kinshasa, more than a third of water samples were
  contaminated. In the city of Kindu, small hamlets in rural Equateur, and a cross-section of rural
  areas in South and North Kivu, E. coli contamination was even higher than Kinshasa. While
  piped water sources tend to perform better, the problem of highly prevalent fecal contamination
  clearly cuts across location and technology. In Ecuador, 33 percent of the water consumed in
  rural areas and 15 percent in urban areas is contaminated with the E. coli bacteria. Alarmingly,
  in Ethiopia, E. coli contamination of both protected and unprotected springs and wells was over
  90 percent. Even where infrastructure costs more, as in the case of piped water systems,
  contamination rates were extremely high (more than 85 and 75 percent, respectively).

  The vast majority of the population in the countries covered by this analysis uses pit latrines;
  because of data constraints the health risk is not yet well understood. Less than 5 percent of
  the population, a figure that has been nearly stagnant in the past 10 years, is connected to a
  sewer system. But even having a sewage connection does not mean that sewage is being
  properly transported and treated at a wastewater plant. A World Bank study (2014) estimates
  that less than 29 percent of all fecal sludge15 is safely managed and treated in some cities.
  Evidence of fecal sludge treatment in rural areas is even scarcer. Under the SDGs, the entire


Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   23
             fecal sludge cycle—through to the neutralization of pathogens—will be monitored; available
             data suggest that the rates that the baseline used to measure progress toward “safely
             managed” sanitation will be set very low.

             An overall absence of good hygiene practices exacerbates the perils of poor water and
             sanitation access. It all adds up to an environment in which harmful pathogens and parasites
             can be pervasive and detrimental to public health. Certain behavioral practices can determine
             the risk of being affected by poor sanitary environments. At homes in Bangladesh, only
             28 percent of the population is observed to have a handwashing station with both water and
             soap, critical to meeting the hygiene component of the SDGs, which is also understood to
             mean that three-quarters of women face critical challenges to menstrual hygiene management.
             Most households with young children do not properly dispose of infant feces. Despite the high
             contamination of water sources, only 10 percent of the population report using an appropriate
             water treatment method.


             New Insights from Spatial Analysis
             As expected, there is a high correlation between access to improved water and improved
             sanitation; however, their relation varies and is difficult to generalize. Map 2.3 and figure 2.8
             show the interaction between improved water and improved sanitation, broken down by
             quintiles and terciles, respectively. Almost a quarter of individuals live in areas with high access
             to both water and sanitation (red). However, 18 percent of citizens live in areas that have high
             access to improved water, but low access to improved sanitation (yellow), and 5 percent live in
             areas with high access to improved sanitation, but low access to improved water (blue).

  Note: This figure, based on data in map 2.3, shows the interaction between improved water and improved sanitation, broken
  down by terciles. For example: “low-low” represents the percentage of the population who are both in the bottom tercile of access
  to improved water and in the bottom tercile of access to improved sanitation.




  In a notable achievement, the data collected for the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative allow
  the identification of disparities in access at the district level. For instance, in Ecuador, the
  poorest parishes in Esmeraldas and Manabí are also the ones with the poorest access to
  water supply. In provinces such as Guayas, the picture is more mixed. Some parishes have
  relatively less poverty but also less access, whereas some poorer parishes have relatively
  more access; the same holds true for sanitation. In Bangladesh, many urban districts lack
  infrastructure. Those in the southeast fare the worst. In the hard-to-reach Chittagong Hill Tracts
  of the southeast, the mountainous and sparsely populated district of Bandarban ranks as the
  country’s least served: only 44 percent of its people have access to an improved drinking water
  source. Geospatial mapping in Tanzania was also able to identify a high concentration of open
  defecation in the northeastern corner of the country, around Arusha and Manyara. This is an
  interesting discovery, as these are not the poorest areas. Understanding the reasons behind
  this finding requires further research.

  Interestingly, in Nigeria, 11 percent of households can be characterized as poor but with
  adequate access to water.16 Conversely, 6 percent of citizens can be characterized as rich, but
  lacking water (map 2.4 and figure 2.9). Most surprising, when considering access to piped
  water on premises, 37 percent of citizens live in areas that are both low in poverty and low in
  access to piped water. Such low-poverty, low-access areas are found in the western regions,
  particularly in the northwest and southwest, and to some extent in the south-central region.
  Similarly, the relationship between poverty levels and access to improved sanitation is not
  straightforward. About 22 percent of Nigerians are in low-poverty areas and have low access to
  improved sanitation, and about 10 percent of Nigerians are in high-poverty areas and have high
  access to improved sanitation.17 This subnational analysis, the first of its kind, provides policy
  and decision makers a tool they can use to visualize differences across locations with a high
  degree of precision.

26	   Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
  A Blind Spot: Facility-Based WASH
  Health-care facilities, schools, and work places desperately need safe WASH services. As part
  of the post-2015 global monitoring agenda, development agencies are expanding WASH
  monitoring beyond the household level and into community facilities where people spend a
  significant amount of time. Overall, data are sparse on WASH coverage beyond households.
  Among primary schools in Bangladesh, only 80 percent have access to improved water
  sources, and only 85 percent have at least one sanitation facility. The average student-to-toilet
  ratio is 100:1, double the national standard. About a third of health-care facilities experience
  routine water shortages, and the convenience of access is poor: only 27 percent of those in
  rural areas and 52 percent in urban areas have piped water on premises. Moreover, many
  health-care facilities also lack handwashing stations with soap and water. Among manufacturing
  enterprises with more than five employees, only 52 percent were found to have access to at
  least one toilet. In Nigeria, around 74 percent of public health centers have access to an
  improved water source, and 61 percent have access to improved sanitation on premises. Only
  31 percent of public health-care facilities have a basic, functioning handwashing station.
  Around 42 percent of health centers have a separate sanitation facility for women and girls,
  and 6 percent have access to facilities for people with limited mobility. Improving the hygienic
  conditions of these health facilities is critical to reduce hospital and clinic infections.


  Improving Data Quality and Collection
  Reliable and consistent population surveys and extensive data on government expenditure and
  service provision are the cornerstones of solid, evidence-based policy making. Across the
  18  economies studied, the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative used all available, reliable
  datasets and collected new data where feasible. Among the datasets used are the Demographic
  Household Survey (DHS), the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), the Living Standards
  Measurement Study (LSMS), national household surveys, data from the International
  Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET), expenditure information
  published by central banks, and other administrative data.

  However, more work needs to be done to ensure that censuses and population surveys are
  conducted regularly, that data are released in a timely manner, and that the data collected are
  of the highest quality. A few observations emerged from the Initiative, specifically from in-
  country research conducted with bureaus of statistics. The first observation is the need to
  harmonize questions across national surveys. This would make it possible to compare data
  across countries and would raise the integrity of any further research. Second, to effectively
  monitor progress, it is important to both retain questions relevant to the MDGs and to add
  questions specific to the SDGs. Bureaus of statistics require support in making the transition
  to the SDGs, and specifically in setting up cost-effective methods of monitoring the quality of
  water supply on a regular basis.18 Third, the use of administrative data such as the data found
  on the International Benchmarking Network (IBNET) can enhance and triangulate data from
  other sources. Also, in some of the countries studied, the quality and availability of data on
  public accounts and national finances could be improved.


  Inequalities in Access to WASH: Final Remarks
  This chapter reviewed inequalities in access to WASH and how they intersect with the spheres
  of poverty, location, social category, and time. Acknowledging and understanding these
  inequalities is critical to developing priorities and policies to achieve the universal coverage
  that the SDGs are striving for. Among other findings, it can be observed that:

    ••   Across countries, wealth is the most important factor in explaining access to WASH services.

    ••   Access to improved water and sanitation services is higher in urban than rural areas.


Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   27
               ••   Countries suffer from regional disparities in access to WASH services.

               ••   Women, ethnic minorities, and religious minorities have disproportionately low access to
                    WASH services.

               ••   Countries face challenges in ensuring equitable WASH services across the life cycle.

               ••   Countries should continue to improve population surveys and the infrastructure for
                    collecting data on, and documenting, service provision.

               ••   Bureaus of statistics will require support from donor agencies to collect reliable and
                    timely data and to combine those data with administrative sources to monitor the SDGs.

             This chapter documented and quantified key inequalities in access to WASH services and
             highlighted several lesser-known patterns and facts that may provide keys to improving access.
             Acknowledging and understanding inequalities is critical to developing the priorities and
             policies needed to achieve the universal coverage called for in the SDGs.


             Notes
             	 1.	 Measures such as the percentage of households below the poverty line or below certain
                   income and consumption thresholds.
             	 2.	The complete description of these findings is presented in Andres, Loughnan, and Li
                   (2017). These categories overlap and are not mutually exclusive.
             	3.	Ibid.
             	 4.	 The JMP , co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children’s
                   Fund (UNICEF), has been monitoring global progress toward the MDGs since 1990 and is
                   responsible for reporting on SDG targets and indicators related to WASH.
             	 5.	 Except for Ecuador, Tajikistan, the West Bank and Gaza, and Tunisia.
             	 6.	 This MDG framework that has been a key part of efforts to build a better world for the past
                   15 years—challenged the global community to reduce by half the proportion of the
                   population without basic drinking water and basic sanitation (JMP 2015).
             	 7.	 Note that spatial aggregation in maps might be misleading, as argued by Gelman and
                   Price (1999). In particular, large rural areas tend to have less access to services, including
                   WASH. Correcting for this by using population density might add another problem, since
                   areas with smaller populations have higher variance.
             	 8.	Another contribution of the WASH Poverty Diagnostics is their overlay of poverty and
                   access maps. This was done in Nigeria, Niger, Tanzania, Ecuador, Panama, Tajikistan,
                   Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ethiopia.
             	9.	See Andres, Loughnan, and Li (2017) for a complete description of the findings
                   summarized in this subsection.
             10.	 An ethnic group is a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities,
                   and is typically an inherited status based on the society in which a person lives.
             11.	 Five circumstances we considered in this analysis: whether (i) the household lies in the
                   B40 of the income distribution, (ii) the household is in a rural location, (iii) the household
                   head is single, (iv) the household head is a female, and (v) whether the household head
                   is educated. These factors mirror those used in previous studies to assess the inequality
                   of opportunities. The choice of factors was done based on parameters that have shown
                   to be associated with the use of WASH services, and are available and consistent across
                   the countries covered under this initiative. These variables have also been shown to be
                   associated with the use of WASH services, and they are of particular interest because
                   they are circumstantial, that is, they cannot be controlled by a child.
             12.	 In order to deal with the inequality overlaps across these factors, this report uses the
                   Shapley decomposition to calculate the contribution of each circumstance, or factor, to the
                   observed inequality of opportunity across households. The decomposition breaks down
                   the R2 of a regression based on the relative predictive share of each factor in determining


28	   Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
       the effect of the outcome variable. So, by construction, the Shapley decomposition adds
       up to 100 percent. To calculate the impact of each circumstance, the Shapley decomposition
       takes the average of all possible changes to different combinations of circumstances to
       show how much inequality changes as a consequence of adding an additional factor
       (Biller, Andres, and Herrera Dappe 2014). Since circumstances correlate with each other,
       the change in inequality that results when a factor is added depends on the initial set of
       circumstances to which it is added.
  13.	 Chapter 6 in the Nigeria WASH Poverty Diagnostic further (World Bank 2017a) discusses
       the functionality of water points and schemes.
  14.	 Groundwater can be understood to be generally safer than surface water because it is
       less exposed to and can filter contaminants, particularly fecal bacteria. However,
       groundwater is not immune to issues of water quality. For instance, aquifers in many parts
       of the country contain elevated levels of naturally occurring arsenic, which may do grave
       harm to the health of people who consume it long term. Aquafers in low-lying nations on
       the front line of climate change are also vulnerable to another contaminant, salt water, as
       high tides surge inland over distances that are gradually increasing.
  15.	 Fecal sludge is the contents contained in on-site facilities such as pit latrines and septic
       tanks, otherwise known as septage.
  16.	 Map 2.4 shows the interaction between access to sources of improved water and poverty.
       For example: “low/low” is the percentage of households that are both in the bottom
       tercile of access to improved water and in the bottom tercile for poverty; “high/high” is the
       percentage of the population in the top tercile of access to improved water and in the top
       tercile for poverty. This analysis was also conducted in Niger, Tanzania, Ecuador, Panama,
       Tajikistan, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ethiopia.
  17.	 To further flesh out the factors in the poverty–WASH nexus, this report explored differences
       in socioeconomic factors for households that were geographically located near one
       another and exhibited the same poverty levels, but that experienced different levels of
       access to improved water and sanitation. A geographic buffer was generated to capture
       households living in areas with high rates of poverty and high rates of access and
       households living in areas with high rates of poverty but low rates of access that were
       within 50 kilometers of one another. This was done under the assumption that it is more
       accurate to compare households that are located close to one another, since they are
       more likely to share greater similarities across baseline geographic characteristics. Across
       poverty-access tiers, households are concentrated in a handful of states, which suggests
       that there are state-level factors driving differences in access.

  Chapter 3
  All Hands on Deck: Working
  Together to Protect the
  Foundations of Development
  Chapter 2 discussed inequalities in access to water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)
  services across various domains. Chapter 4 will consider how limited WASH resources are
  allocated and the implications of those allocations for efforts to address inequalities in WASH
  services. While much of this report focuses on targets 6.1 and 6.2 of the Sustainable
  Development Goals (SDGs, see chapter 1), this chapter will discuss WASH’s potential
  contributions to accelerating progress toward SDG 2, “End hunger, achieve food security and
  improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture”; and SDG 3, “Ensure healthy lives and
  promote well-being for all at all ages.” (See box 3.1.) This chapter will argue that continuing to
  do business as usual will not contribute much to child health outcomes or stop the
  intergenerational transfer of poverty (also known as the poverty trap). This idea is supported
  by the United Nations Platform on Social Determinants of Health, which states that health
  equity cannot be achieved by acting in the health sector alone; that actions in other sectors—
  including water—are critical (WHO 2015).

  If WASH investments are to speed progress toward SDGs 2 and 3, the prevalence of childhood
  diarrheal disease and undernutrition must be factored in when allocating scarce resources at
  the national and subnational levels. If the goal is, indeed, to “ensure healthy lives,” then the
  focus must first be on young children. Although the correlation between monetary poverty and
  children’s health is clear enough at the country level of analysis, it cannot be simplified to map
  directly to the poor/non-poor and rural/urban binaries outlined in chapter 2. Not all children in
  poor households or in rural areas are undernourished or suffering from diarrheal disease, and,
  in many countries, not all children in non-poor households or in urban areas are well nourished
  or free from diarrheal disease. As a result, targeted WASH investments in rural areas where
  diarrhea and stunting are prevalent are likely to accomplish more than efforts to achieve
  universal coverage by reducing the WASH gaps between poor and rich, rural and urban.


  Breaking the Poverty Trap: Why Basic Services Matter
  Children who lack access to WASH services in the initial stages of life pay dearly—and these
  costs are eventually borne by the rest of society. The primary cost is immediate: poor access to
  water and sanitation is associated with an increase in the incidence of undernutrition and
  diarrheal disease. But there are also important consequences in the long term—both to the
  individual and society—associated with the chronic undernutrition of children: a high risk of
  stunting, impaired cognitive development, lower rates of school attendance, reduced human
  capital attainment, and a higher risk of chronic disease and health problems in adulthood
  (Victora et al. 2010). Thus, inequities in access to WASH and other services early in the life of
  a child further the intergenerational transmission of poverty.

                  Box 3.1: SDG Targets Related to Child Mortality and Malnutrition

                  SDG 2.2: By 2030 end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving, by 2025, the
                  internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under 5 years of
                  age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating
                  women and older persons.

                  SDG 3.2: By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years
                  of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as
                  12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000
                  live births

                  SDG 3.3: By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and
                  neglected  tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and
                  other communicable diseases.

                  SDG 3.9: By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from
                  hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination.

             Too often, inadequate WASH services leave children exposed to a wide range of pathogens
             and consequent health problems. The ingestion of contaminated water, food, or soil as a
             result of the unsafe management of human excreta, a contaminated or inadequate water
             supply, and/or inadequate personal and domestic hygiene provide routes of transmission for
             numerous microorganisms that can cause diarrhea and other severe infections.1 Enteric
             pathogens in particular2 not only cause diarrhea but can also lead to chronic difficulty
             absorbing nutrients. This, in turn, can lead to both stunting and wasting (that is, being
             underweight).

             The World Health Organization’s (WHO 2014) current estimate of the impact of inadequate
             WASH services is 58 percent of total diarrheal deaths. Together, inadequate services in low- and
             middle-income countries are estimated to be responsible for more than 800,000 deaths
             annually (WHO 2014). Despite great progress in reducing diarrheal mortality worldwide,
             diarrhea, along with lower respiratory infections, remains the third-leading cause of death in
             developing countries and the second-leading cause of death in children under 5.3

             The burden of WASH-related neglected tropical diseases (NTDs4) in the 18 economies covered
             by the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative is estimated to be 9,187,380 disability-adjusted life
             years (DALYs) (IHME 2015)—nearly 70 percent of the total DALYs attributed to all NTDs
             worldwide. India and the Democratic Republic of Congo constitute almost half of all WASH-
             related NTDs in these countries—2,646,525 DALYs and 2,576,295 DALYs, respectively. The
             other half is distributed among Nigeria, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Mozambique, and
             Bangladesh (figure 3.1).

             Developed and used by the WHO’s Global Burden of Disease project, DALYs are a common
             health metric that combines both the years of life lost (YLL) due to a particular cause or risk
             factor as well as the years lived with disability. A single DALY can be considered as one year of
             healthy life lost. DALYs are used to provide a summary estimate for the distribution of the
             diarrheal (or enteric) disease burden attributable to inadequate WASH services, calculated
             across different subsets of the population.

  In 2014, 171 million children under the age of five had stunted growth, meaning that they were
  excessively short for their age.5 Children whose early growth is stunted suffer a long-term failure
  to grow, reflecting the cumulative effects of early chronic deficits in food intake and proper
  nourishment, poor health-care practices, exposure to an unsafe and nonhygienic environment,
  and illness. The negative outcomes later in life, some of which can be quantified in economic
  terms, are numerous (figure 3.2).


Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	                                                        33
             Recent World Bank estimates suggest that the per capita income penalty a country incurs for
             not having eliminated stunting when today’s workers were children is around 7 percent of gross
             domestic product (GDP) per capita, on average. In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, these
             figures rise to about 9–10 percent of GDP per capita (Galasso et al. 2017).


             Comparing Stunting Rates between and within Countries
             The country reports carried out under the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative highlight not only
             the variability in stunting rates between countries (figure 3.3), but also the large differences
             within countries, particularly by location (rural or urban) and by level of household wealth (poor
             or non-poor). While in Haiti and Bangladesh the difference between urban and rural stunting
             rates is only 2 percentage points, in Guatemala it is 17 percentage points (figure 3.4). Overall,
             children in non-poor households—those in the top 60 percent (T60) of the wealth distribution—
             are less likely to be stunted than children from poor households—those in the bottom
             40 percent (B40) of the wealth distribution.

             However, there are large disparities as to the degree of the gap. In Guatemala, the difference
             is 21 percentage points, whereas in Niger it is 4 percentage points. Where the national stunting
             rate is low, differences between different subpopulations are not necessarily small. Although
             Tunisia has the lowest stunting rate of the countries considered, the spreads between urban
             and rural children and between children in poor and non-poor households are greater than in
             countries with far higher stunting rates.


             What Will it Take to Address Undernutrition?
             What will it take to address undernutrition? Closer integration of WASH investments with
             investments in related sectors is the key to solving the problem of undernutrition.

  In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of initiatives, both global and
  national, to address the nutritional needs of underserved populations from several angles at
  once. As outlined by a United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) conceptual framework (UNICEF
  1990), the ultimate success of such multisectoral efforts depends on how they address
  inequalities in access to four key factors that determine good health and nutrition over the long
  term (figure 3.5). These are (i) food security, (ii) adequate personal care and feeding practices,
  (iii) a healthy environment (or WASH), and (iv) adequate health-care services.

  The effectiveness of WASH interventions and their ultimate success in furthering progress
  toward the SDGs depend on a holistic view of the inequalities and gaps in access to these
  factors, which, as the underlying determinants of good nutrition and long-term well-being, are
  usually beyond the consideration of any one sector. For example, efforts to promote the
  cultivation of micronutrient-rich fruits and vegetables in home gardens typically have no control
  over access to water. But what if key agricultural interventions were to be accompanied by
  simultaneous improvements in water and sanitation facilities in the same communities?
  Working together rather than in isolation, sector actors could better address the underlying
  determinants of nutrition.

  How inequities overlap, or not, is also important to consider. Thus, the effects of inadequate
  WASH services—as measured by, say, the prevalence of stunting—may be strongest in areas
  deprived of access to services from other sectors. Child nutrition is, in general, the byproduct
  of complex interactions among a host of factors. These include access to water and sanitation,
  parental income and education levels (especially mothers and caregivers), access to health
  facilities, and food security, to name a few.6 Say, for instance, that a child without access to
  adequate WASH services contracts giardia. If he has access to appropriate treatment, such as
  oral rehydration therapy (ORT) or antibiotics, this mitigates the negative impact of the inadequate
  WASH services.

  The WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative sheds new light on how inequalities in access to WASH

                                   Two related but distinct conceptual approaches were applied at the country level to subsets of
                                   the 18 countries studied. The first is a variant of the original UNICEF model of undernutrition
                                   (UNICEF 1990; Black et al. 2013). This allows for a holistic view of the interdependence of the
                                   various sectors relevant to child nutrition. The second approach is the WASH Poverty Risk
                                   Model (WASH-PRM).7

                                   The two approaches provide complementary information. The holistic view provided by the
                                   variant of the UNICEF framework lays the groundwork for more effective multisectoral action by
                                   providing decision makers with the opportunity to assess the potential impact of nutrition-
                                   sensitive investments across different sectors such as water and sanitation, agriculture, social
                                   protection, health, and education. This framework for operational guidance and prioritization
                                   helps identify particularly important gaps (for example, in water or sanitation) that, if addressed,
                                   might serve to strengthen the impact of nutrition-sensitive interventions in other sectors. The
                                   WASH-PRM, meanwhile, is better equipped to inform WASH-specific decisions by revealing how
                                   inadequate water and sanitation might combine with inadequate health care to produce a
                                   disproportionate risk for the populations concerned. It is important to bear in mind that both
                                   of the approaches employed are primarily useful for summarizing correlations rather than
                                   identifying causes.

  Access to the Factors Underlying Nutrition:
  The View from Above
  Very few children have simultaneous access to adequate levels of all four of the determinants
  of long-term health described in the first paragraph of this section. In fact, a great number
  of children do not have access to even one. In-depth country-level analysis based on the
  variant of the UNICEF conceptual framework was carried out for 11 of the 18 countries for
  the four determinants based on data from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys
  (DHS) conducted between 2009 and 2015. Each indicator is composed of various
  subcomponents, based on availability, with the definition of “adequate” based on national
  or accepted international standards.8 Based on the data available, using a strict definition
  for what constitutes access to adequate care or health or environment or food,9 a stark
  picture emerges of the extent to which children have simultaneous access to two or more
  of the four underlying determinants of nutrition. In the countries studied, less than 3 percent
  of children under the age of two had access to all four of the determinants and in fact, in
  six countries effectively no child has access to all four (figure 3.6).10 In fact, except for
  Tunisia, only about one-fifth of the children have access to any of the four determinants. In
  three of the eleven countries, at least half of the children do not have access to adequate
  levels of even one of the four, which are referred to from here on as drivers of nutrition.

  The very small proportions of children with simultaneous access to more than one of the drivers
  of nutrition suggests that isolated efforts to improve access in one sector may be limited or
  vitiated by inadequate access levels in another. Research on sector-specific interventions
  (World Bank 2013) rightly emphasizes the synergies that can be exploited within specific
  sectors such as WASH, agriculture, or social protection. These findings suggest that the
  success of uncoordinated or isolated initiatives may be limited. Extrapolating this finding
  across sectors, coordinated and simultaneous multisectoral interventions covering the same
  geographic areas or groups of children with high stunting rates may yield synergies that will
  effectively reduce undernutrition.

Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	    37
             Stunting and Simultaneous Access to the
             Drivers of Nutrition
             Children with simultaneous access to adequate levels of one (or more) of the four drivers of
             nutrition are less likely to be stunted than children who have access to none. First, children with
             access to one driver are statistically significantly less likely to be stunted than those children
             without access to any nutrition driver (figure 3.7). Those with simultaneous access to two are
             also less likely to be stunted than those with access to just one.11 And those with access to all
             four are less likely to be stunted than those with access to just two or three.12 In fact, the point
             estimates suggest that the highest percentage point decline (8.8 percentage points) in stunting
             occurs between children with access to two drivers and those with access to only one (-0.143
             + 0.055 = -0.088). The decline in stunting observed between other groups of children ranges
             from 5.5 percentage points (those with access to only one driver relative to those with access
             to none) to 3.7 percentage points (access to three drivers vs. access to two). These results
             suggest that the four drivers are not substitutes for one another, and that simultaneous access
             to adequate levels of two or more of the nutrition drivers is associated with lower stunting.

             Access to only one of the four drivers of nutrition is associated with a lower probability of
             stunting, with access to WASH services making the largest difference. In the pooled sample,
             access to adequate WASH services but not to the other three drivers is associated with a
             decrease in stunting of about 10.4 percentage points relative to the stunting rate prevailing
             among children without access to any of the four drivers (figure 3.8). Access to adequate food
             only is associated with about an 8.3 percentage point decrease in the probability of being
             stunted. Access to adequate health care only or to adequate personal care and feeding
             practices only is associated with 1.5 and 3.8 percentage point decreases in the probability of
             stunting, respectively.

  If a child has simultaneous access to WASH services and to one or more of the other drivers,
  then she is less likely to be stunted than a child that does not have access to adequate WASH
  only. Children that have access to WASH services plus other drivers (figure 3.8)—such as
  simultaneous access to adequate WASH services combined with adequate food (WF) or
  adequate WASH services combined with adequate health care (WH)—are associated with
  greater reductions in the probability of being stunted than those not having access to adequate
  levels of any of the drivers or those having access to adequate WASH services only. In fact,
  simultaneous access to WASH services and health care together (WH) appears to halve the
  probability of being stunted compared with access to WASH alone, a decrease roughly
  comparable to that observed with simultaneous access to WASH, food, and health (WFH),
  or WASH, food, health, and care (WFCH).


  Synergies between WASH and Health
  The estimates outlined above also provide evidence of potential synergies between simultaneous
  investments in improved WASH and health services. Consider the set of comparisons labeled
  “W&H” in figure 3.9. The bars estimate the reduction in stunting when children have access to
  adequate WASH services only (blue portion of first bar) and access to adequate health care only
  (dark blue portion)—and compares them with access to both at once (the adjacent aqua blue
  bar), taking as a baseline no access to adequate levels of any of the four drivers of nutrition. The
  longer length of the aqua blue bar suggests that simultaneous investment coordinated across
  the water and health sectors creates synergies, with effects greater than the sum of the parts.13

  Thus, the reductions in stunting that can be accomplished when children have simultaneous
  access to adequate WASH services and health care (WH) are greater than the reductions in
  stunting achieved by providing some children with adequate WASH services only and a different
  group of children with adequate health services only. Similar synergies also appear to be

             present between simultaneous access to adequate health care and food (H&F). No synergies
             appear to be present with simultaneous access to adequate WASH services and food (W&F)
             or with adequate WASH and personal care and feeding practices (W&C).

             Simultaneous access to multiple drivers of nutrition can be brought about by multisectoral
             collaboration. An example from Brazil appears in box 3.2.

                                 Box 3.2: Putting Multisectoral Planning into Action—An Example from Brazil

                                 Between 2003 and 2008 the State of Bahia in Brazil made significant progress
                                 across multiple health indicators for its population but was not reaching its targets
                                 for infectious intestinal disease—that is, diarrhea in children under 5 (50,000
                                 hospitalizations per year) and reductions in low birth weight. Both indicators were
                                 key contributors to the state’s elevated infant mortality rate, which stood at 24
                                 deaths per live births in 2008.

                                 In response, the World Bank helped the government develop a multisectoral health
                                 and water project between 2010 and 2016. The project’s goals were to reduce post-
                                 neonatal morbidity and mortality due to infectious intestinal disease in children
                                 below one year of age and to reduce neonatal mortality (children younger than 28 days)
                                                                                                           box continues next page

       in 25 selected hospitals of the state. The project included five sectors: health, water,
       sanitation, public management, and planning, and was under the administration of
       the secretary of financing (SEFAZ).

       The project identified the 10 municipalities with the largest incidence of diarrhea
       and the worst drinking water and sanitation infrastructure. A series of interventions
       (i) increased the number of people served with simplified water supply systems
       and basic sanitation from 32,295 to 72,295; (ii) trained 800 community health
       agents in environmental control, hygiene, and water and sanitation management;
       (iii) used scorecards and incentives to improve household sanitation and hygiene
       behaviors by setting “green hygiene family goals”; (iv) improved monitoring of water
       quality along with river basin planning; (v) increased the coverage of family health
       teams from 53 percent to 70 percent of the population; and (vi) increased rotavirus
       vaccination in children below one year from 57 percent to 82 percent. Twenty-five
       hospitals were targeted to raise the quality of treatment of cases of diarrhea.
       Key  aspects of the project were performance agreements and result-based
       disbursement systems.

       This multisectoral project was a major success for the State of Bahia. From 2008 to
       2015, the state observed a 70 percent reduction in hospitalizations for diarrhea of
       children under the age of five, along with a 40 percent reduction in the infant mortality
       rate in the state (figures B3.2.1 and B3.2.2). As a result, the organizational culture
       of working with common multisectoral objectives was rapidly incorporated by the
       state, and extended to other geographic areas.a

             A New Tool to Support Water and Sanitation
             Decision Making
             A new model employed by the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative is specifically equipped to
             support water and sanitation decision making. The WASH-PRM (summarized in box 3.3)
             examines how inadequate water and sanitation can combine with inadequate health care to
             produce a disproportionate risk for people living in poor or marginalized areas. Unlike the
             UNICEF conceptual framework that spans multiple sectors affecting nutrition, this model
             focuses on a few key factors (only some of which can be shaped by actions in other sectors,
             such as health) that influence a child’s risk of dying from diarrheal disease (see Cumming et al.,
             forthcoming and appendix B). These factors include a child’s nutritional status, access to
             vitamin A, and oral rehydration treatment. An exposure index and a susceptibility index are
             estimated and combined for each child using DHS data (box 3.3), which produces an overall
             risk index (as a product of the former two indices). The values of these indices for each child
             can then be aggregated for different geographic areas (for example, regions or provinces within
             a country) and different socioeconomic groups (for example, children in households in the B40
             vs T60 of the wealth distribution) to guide new investments by the water sector.

             The rest of this section highlights useful examples of how the model has been applied in some
             of the countries covered by the Initiative to identify priority areas and socioeconomic groups
             where new investments in the WASH sector might produce the greatest benefits in terms of
             reducing the risk of diarrheal infection and reducing stunting. The same model was applied to
             nine countries in total—Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti,
             Mozambique, Nigeria, Pakistan, Ecuador, and Tajikistan. These countries were not intended to

       Box 3.3: The WASH Poverty Risk Model

       The model combines key susceptibility factors and exposure factors that are most
       relevant to the following health outcomes: diarrhea, stunting, and mortality. The
       exposure factors include WASH-related elements that influence the risk of diarrheal
       disease (figure B3.3.2). Three risk factors related to susceptibility include: micronutrients
       (vitamin A), effective treatment (oral rehydration therapy, or ORT), and undernutrition/
       underweight (assessed by a child’s weight-for-age). The relative risk associated with
       these exposure and susceptibility factors represents the level of disease risk among
       exposed individuals—that is, those with a particular risk factor (for example, not
       having safe drinking water)—compared with unexposed individuals without the same
       risk factor. A relative risk value greater than 1.0 indicates that the exposed are at
       greater risk of contracting than the unexposed, and a value less than 1.0 indicates
       that the risk is similar. Relative risk estimates are derived from pooling effect sizes
       from assessments of the effect of a given factor on a given disease, such as the
       effect of safe drinking water on diarrheal disease.

       The risk results from the WASH Poverty Risk Model (WASH-PRM) can then be
       translated into commonly used measures of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs),
       developed and used by the World Health Organization’s Global Burden of Disease
       project. DALYs are used to provide a summary estimate of the distribution of
       the  enteric disease burden attributable to inadequate WASH services, calculated
       across different subsets of the population. Figures B3.3.1 and B3.3.2 illustrate the
       conceptual framework. Appendix B provides more detail.

             For WASH dollars to have the greatest impact on reducing the risk of child mortality from
             diarrheal disease, they need to target geographic areas having little access to services and
             otherwise vulnerable populations. One of the main benefits of the WASH-PRM is its quantification
             of overall disease risk and of disparities in this risk across subnational and wealth-level
             divisions. As an example, Map 3.1 highlights the spatial distribution in Mozambique of the
             exposure index associated with inadequate WASH services and the susceptibility index of
             the factors that amplify or weaken the impacts of inadequate WASH services. A high value of
             the exposure index implies poor WASH, while a high value of the susceptibility index implies
             high vulnerability. The risk index, which is a combination of the exposure and susceptibility
             indices, highlights the provinces where children are at most risk of dying from diarrheal disease.
             Children with the highest risk index values are concentrated in the northern provinces, with
             children from Cabo Delgado, Zambezia, and Tete being particularly vulnerable to disease risk
             (highlighted in dark red).

             One particularly useful finding of provincial maps such as the ones in Map 3.1 is that geographic
             targeting based simply on poor WASH services (high exposure index) may not be the most
             effective in terms of reducing diarrhea. Although Mozambique’s Nampula Province has a high
             exposure risk (meaning poor water and sanitation facilities), its lower susceptibility risk keeps
             it from being particularly vulnerable to overall disease. In contrast, the Cabo Delgado, Zambezia,
             and Tete provinces appear to have both high exposure and high susceptibility risks, resulting
             in a higher overall disease risk. Analogous provincial maps in the country studies carried out
             under the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative are similarly revealing.

             The risk results from the WASH-PMR can also be translated into DALYs (introduced in
             section  3.1). Map 3.2 provides a summary estimate of the disease burden in Nigeria, by
             region, as measured in DALYs. Children from the northwest and northeast regions are seen to
             have higher DALY rates, and thus a greater total disease burden across the wealth distribution.

                                     The burden of children in the northwest is the greatest overall (23,489 DALYs per
                                     100,000 children). Based on these estimates, the national diarrheal burden associated with
                                     inadequate WASH services is 10,083 DALYs per 100,000 children per year. This is approximately
                                     73 percent of that estimated by the Global Burden of Disease project for the country.14

                                     These insights provide a compass for where WASH dollars might have the greatest impact in
                                     reducing the risks of under-5 child mortality from diarrhea and provide a platform for cross-
                                     sector collaboration. The model also enables one to simulate the potential effects on
                                     disease risk of improvements in water access. Map  3.3a analyses improvements at the
                                     province level in Pakistan. Map 3.3a presents a distribution of the risk index across provinces
                                     as it would be if every household with unimproved water were given access to an improved
                                     water source (off household premises). Map 3.3b presents the distribution of the risk index
                                     across provinces if every household with unimproved sanitation were given access to
                                     improved sanitation (nonsewerage). According to the maps, children from Balochistan would
                                     experience the greatest risk reduction in response to these improvements, but all provinces
                                     would benefit.


                                     Conclusions and Policy Considerations
                                     This chapter considered the health of children under 5, as indicated by the incidence of
                                     diarrheal disease and chronic undernutrition (measured by height- and weight-for-age), as an
                                     additional—and critical—factor to consider when allocating resources for WASH services.
                                     While young children’s health interrelates with monetary measures of poverty and other factors
                                     associated with unequal access to WASH services (analyzed in chapter 2), focusing on it
                                     specifically (and independently of efforts to reduce poverty) offers a good opportunity to support
                                     long-term health outcomes with relatively little effort.

                                     To effectively include children’s health indicators in decisions on where to allocate
                                     investment, it is also necessary to understand how inequalities in access to WASH services,


46	                          Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
  health services, and food interact. These inequalities—and their interactions—vary across
  geographic areas and among socioeconomic groups. Various tools of analysis, as outlined
  here, can help identify high-risk pockets. In the context of limited budgets, this knowledge
  is essential to the design and targeting of interventions designed to expand access to
  WASH services.

  The large gaps in access to WASH services documented in chapter 2 are accompanied by
  considerable gaps in access to the main drivers of children’s nutrition—food security, WASH
  services, personal care and feeding practices, and health care. Access to one or more of these
  drivers can strengthen the impacts of WASH investments on children’s health. A lack of access,
  conversely, can undermine them. The findings presented here suggest that progress toward
  reducing stunting, a key measure of child nutrition and long-term health, can be enhanced by
  well-designed, well-implemented, and well-coordinated multisectoral interventions that
  effectively address the main drivers of nutrition, especially among the poorest segments of the
  population in each country. In particular, simultaneous improvements in access to adequate
  WASH services and adequate health care were shown to produce benefits that are greater than
  the sum of their parts.

  The analysis reveals that across all regions and countries studied (that is, 7 of the 18 countries
  covered by the Initiative), the greatest burden of disease associated with unimproved water
  and sanitation is borne by the poorest—across national, urban and rural, and subnational
  populations. Specifically, the risk of death is 2.6 times greater in the poorest quintile (equity
  ratio) than in the richest in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, and Tajikistan, with the
  disparity rising to 3.9 times in Nigeria. This is consistent with patterns of access to water and
  sanitation and health-care services (oral rehydration therapy and vitamin A), and the prevalence
  of undernutrition (again, as measured by height- and weight-for-age).

  Rural populations across all countries analyzed had a greater absolute and population-adjusted
  burden of WASH-related disease. However, the degree of disparity between the poor and non-
  poor was much greater among urban than rural households. Notably, in Ethiopia, Mozambique,
  and Haiti, the ratio of access to improved sanitation between the poor and non-poor is two to
  four times greater among urban children than rural children.

  In sum, a number of priorities for designing more effective WASH investment strategies are
  revealed by this analysis:

    ••   For new WASH investments to have the maximum impact on reducing diarrheal disease
         among children under 5, they must not be based simply on the poor conditions of WASH
         services in a given area. Instead, they must target geographic areas where children have
         both poor WASH access and high vulnerability to diarrheal mortality, as determined by
         their access to key health services and nutrients. This may also facilitate cross-sectoral
         planning, delivery, and monitoring.

    ••   Strategies to target investments toward groups with the greatest risk will require not only
         the identification and location of these groups, but also that the WASH services provided
         or promoted are appropriate, available, and accessible to these groups.

    ••   The analysis describes how WASH-related risk is distributed across wealth levels,
         between rural and urban populations, and by geographic location. A simple next step
         would be to map existing water and health programs against these findings, in order to
         assess the extent to which investments are reaching the children who can gain the most
         from them.

  In combination, these insights into the complex interactions of WASH services with other
  sectors provide a useful compass for where WASH investments can have the biggest impact
  on children’s health outcomes, and provide a useful platform for cross-sectoral efforts to
  speed progress toward the SDGs.

             	6.	The Thousand Days Index (TDI), for example, is a multisectoral tool consisting of
                   28  different indicators classified under the 4 drivers of nutrition. For example, see
                   Lavendez (2015).
             	 7.	 The WASH-PRM includes some characteristics of the WHO’s Global Burden of Disease
                   approach and some of the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), both of which are extensively used
                   in the health sector. The key distinction between these two approaches is that the WASH-
                   PRM’s objective is to estimate the combined effect of the codistribution of risk factors on
                   disease across subpopulations. With respect to LiST, the key difference is that the WASH-
                   PRM model uses actual data on the correlation or codistribution of exposure and
                   susceptibility risk factors within economic and geographic subpopulations, thus accounting
                   for any layering of inequalities. For more details, see Rheingans et al. (2017).
             	 8.	 A more detailed discussion of the methodology used and the specific variables used for
                   the components of care, health, environment, and food security is contained in a
                   background synthesis paper by Skoufias and Vinha (2017), based on the WASH Poverty
                   Diagnostics. Having an “adequate” level of WASH or environment, for example, is defined
                   as follows. A household has adequate WASH, if: (i) it has improved water facilities,
                   (ii) it has improved sanitation (based on the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program [JMP]),
                   and (iii) at least 75 percent of the households in the community have improved sanitation.
                   In the countries where this information is available, access to adequate WASH also
                   includes: (iv) adequate handwashing facilities along with water and soap or detergent, as
                   observed by the interviewer; and (v) the children’s stools are disposed of into an improved
                   sanitation facility.
             	 9.	A child is defined as having adequate access to the drivers of nutrition (care, health,
                   WASH, and food) if the child has adequate access to any two, any three, or all four of the
                   drivers of nutrition at the same time. Although this is admittedly a very strict criterion, it is
                   in line with the UNICEF conceptual framework that assumes that increases in access to
                   adequate levels in one of the four determinants alone cannot substitute for inadequacies
                   in the other three underlying determinants.
             10. Care must be taken when comparing across countries as the definitions for adequate
                   access differ based on data availability and context. As such, access not deemed not
                   adequate in one setting may well have been characterized as adequate in another.
             11. The differences in the point estimates of stunting are statistically significant (see table 4
                   in Skoufias and Vinha [2017]).
             12. The same general relationship holds in both urban and rural areas as well as for children in
                   the B40 and T60 of the distribution of wealth in each country (Skoufias and Vinha 2017).
             13. In fact, it was also confirmed that the “synergy effect” on stunting between WASH and
                   health is statistically significant. Statistically significant synergy effects were also detected
                   for mean HAZ scores as well as separately for rural and urban areas in the pooled sample.
                   The “synergy” effect was not statistically significant when cluster-level fixed effects are
                   used in place of country-level fixed effects (see Skoufias and Vinha 2017).
             14. It is worth noting that the Global Burden of Disease project provides its own estimate
                   of the burden attributable to inadequate WASH. However, this estimate differs from
                   that of the WASH-PRM in several important ways. First, the WASH-PRM accounts for



48	   Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
       the codistribution of inadequate WASH and child susceptibility. Second, by using
       underlying data on the distribution of risk factors, the WASH-PRM examines the
       distribution across economic and geographic subpopulations. Last, both estimates
       use slightly different assumptions regarding the relative risk associated with different
       WASH service levels.

  Chapter 4
  Follow the Money: More and
  Better-Targeted Investments
  to Reflect Policy
  This chapter documents how the inequalities reviewed in chapter 2 result in part from a skewed
  allocation of resources, often in spite of policy commitments to benefit the poor. The analysis
  reveals that to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), countries need to nearly
  quadruple their current capital spending on water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).
  While current WASH funding comes from a combination of household, private sector, donor, and
  public sources, ensuring sustainable and equitable services will hinge on substantial public
  investment.

  Given budget constraints, such public investment will need to be carefully targeted and
  efficiently allocated if, indeed, services to the poor are a priority. This “if” is important. Even
  where policies state an intention to target the poor, relevant allocation criteria are frequently
  not adhered to in practice. Instead, allocations frequently favor urban over rural areas, large
  cities over small towns, and urban centers over peripheral neighborhoods. Water is prioritized
  over sanitation, and given that sanitation is often viewed as a private good by governments,
  this priority disproportionately affects the poor, who typically cannot afford such services on
  their own. If equity is the guiding criteria for resource allocation decisions, then greater
  investment should be directed toward rural areas and toward sanitation.1

  This chapter documents the gap between what public policies aspire to achieve and what
  governments in fact prioritize based on how and where they allocate resources. The WASH
  Poverty Diagnostic Initiative did not explore the upstream political economy—what the 2017
  World Development Report (World Bank 2017) terms the “policy arena”—that contributes to
  this disconnect, but rather calls attention to the ways in which the policy arena obstructs
  attainment of the WASH-related SDGs. Chapter 5 continues the examination begun here of
  gaps between commitments on paper and government actions in practice, while shifting the
  focus from resource allocation to efficiency in order to understand the institutional constraints
  on downstream service outcomes once resources are allocated. Together, the skewed allocation
  of resources and inefficiencies in how they are used frequently result in service delivery failures,
  thereby perpetuating inequalities that are passed down through generations.


  Funding Needs and Composition
  Public capital expenditure on WASH is between 0.20 and 0.40 percent of gross domestic
  product (GDP), on average. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean invest roughly
  0.25  percent of GDP   , and have achieved better access in water but less so in sanitation
  (Fay et al. 2017). In Sub-Saharan Africa, public sector and donor investment in WASH accounts
  for about 0.40 percent of GDP (authors’ own calculations based on Foster and Briceño-
  Garmendia [2009]). Similarly, South Asian countries invest between 0.40 and 0.50 percent of
  their GDP on capital investments in WASH (Biller, Andres, and Herrera Dappe 2014). These
  regional tendencies are reflected at the country level by the analysis carried out for the WASH
  Poverty Diagnostics. In Nigeria, the government spent close to 0.32 percent of GDP in annual


Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   51
             capital investment in the water sector between 2006 and 2010. Tunisia spent 0.42 percent of
             GDP on WASH in 2015. Annual investments in water and sanitation in Guatemala averaged
             close to 0.34 percent of GDP between 2010 and 2015.

             Often, budget allocations are not only insufficient, but have consistently fallen short of delivering
             on policy promises, resulting in a significant financing gap. Niger provides an example of this.
             Since 2005, investment in the WASH sector has represented on average 1 percent of the
             voted budget. While investment in WASH from 2005 to 2015 totaled $136.1 million, the
             projected funding requirements for 2016–30 are close to $3 billion in rural areas alone
             (World Bank 2016).

             Current funding levels are sufficient to achieve universal access to basic WASH services by
             2030; however, achieving the SDGs will cost four times as much. A recent World Bank study
             (Hutton and Varughese 2016) estimated that extending basic WASH services to the unserved
             in a set of 140 mostly developing countries would cost $28 billion a year from 2015 to 2030,
             or 0.10 percent of these countries’ GDP , on average.2 By contrast, the capital funding required
             to achieve universal basic coverage in the areas covered by the Initiative is estimated to be
             about 0.88 percent of GDP , on average. To achieve the more ambitious SDG targets in these
             18 countries, this share would need to rise to a daunting 3.1 percent of GDP (table 4.1).

52	   Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
       Box 4.1: World Bank Support for the Water Sector

       The World Bank’s Water Global Practice is currently managing a lending portfolio that
       includes 177 projects totaling $24.5 billion, accounting for about 11 percent of total
       World Bank lending. In addition, projects with a water-sector-related component
       managed by other global practices total $10 billion. Water supply, sanitation, and
       hygiene (WASH), currently account for about 60 percent of the total water portfolio,
       with about one-third devoted to urban water supply and one-quarter to rural water
       supply. A major change in the past year has been the significant growth of the
       portfolio’s sanitation component under the influence of the long-term Water and
       Sanitation Program (WSP), which is particularly active in rural areas.

       According to the World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group (2017), among the
       WASH projects approved during fiscal years (FY) 2007–16, 87 percent focused on
       urban areas and 74 percent on rural areas (including projects that covered both). Of
       World Bank commitments to water and sanitation during FY 2007–16, 35 percent
       went to water supply and 37 percent to sanitation (including wastewater management).
       These were followed by a general category that includes flood protection and
       development policy lending (28 percent).

  WASH funding comes from a variety of sources, including public expenditure, household
  consumption, private sector investment, and donor contributions. However, most capital-specific
  investments are likely to originate from the public sector, so public resources need to be better
  targeted. In the long term, mobilizing private sector finance will improve the sector’s
  sustainability. The World Bank’s support for the water sector is detailed in box 4.1.

  Households fund the bulk of WASH services, predominantly through tariffs, and self-supply
  solutions such as wells, water tanks, and septic tanks. According to the Global Analysis and
  Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking Water (GLAAS), an annual analysis conducted by the
  World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN), households contribute the most
  to the sector. In a sample of 25 countries, an estimated 66 percent of funding for WASH
  originated from household sources (see figure 4.1), representing $43 billion in annual WASH
  expenditure (GLAAS 2017). These findings are consistent with the WASH Poverty Diagnostics.
  In Tunisia, the bulk of WASH expenditure comes from households, including via tariffs and
  investments in self-supply. On average, household finance accounted for 75 percent of total
  expenditure on water and 57 percent of total expenditure on sanitation. Similarly, households
  in Bangladesh contribute 54 percent of the nation’s total expenditure on WASH. However,
  households in Tajikistan and Pakistan contribute only 16 and 23 percent, respectively.

  Foreign aid also plays an important role. Globally, over $11 billion in grants, loans, and funds
  from high-income countries and other entities were spent on water and sanitation in 2015
  (GLAAS 2017). While external aid flows compose a small proportion of global expenditures on
  WASH, in some countries, the aid received from external sources is substantial and can
  represent the largest source of nonhousehold WASH funding. According to GLAAS (2017),
  more than 20 percent of WASH funding came from external sources in almost half of those
  countries surveyed that reported all their sources of WASH financing.3 In Haiti, the donor
  community finances all water and sanitation investments and 30 percent of the sector’s

             operating expenditures. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, approximately 90 percent of
             sector investments over the past few years have been externally funded, while in the West
             Bank and Gaza, donors finance 76 percent of capital investment, most of which is off-budget
             and may be arranged outside the formal planning process. Thus, there is scope for the better
             targeting of donor investments as well.

             Formal private sector participation in WASH is limited, and most is in the form of public-private
             partnerships. Informal service providers play a significant role in several countries. For instance,
             in Bauchi, Nigeria, private vendors contract with the Bauchi State Water and Sewerage
             Corporation (BSWSC) and connect to its pipe network. In certain areas, cart vendors source
             their water from the BSWSC’s burst pipes, or from public standpipes or boreholes. Water
             delivered by tanker truck is usually purchased directly from sales points maintained by the
             BSWSC. In Haiti, the informal private sector has taken advantage of a lack of government
             capacity amid increased demand for improved water services triggered by a cholera outbreak.
             The percentage of Haitians who resorted to informal providers to satisfy their drinking water
             needs increased from 11 to 26 percent between 2006 and 2012.4 In urban areas, this
             figure was even higher: 57 percent in the Port-au-Prince Metropolitan Area and 45 percent in
             the country’s other cities.


             Policy: Actual Allocations Diverge
             from Written Commitments
             On paper, policies and voted budgets often look “good” in terms of their commitments to extend
             WASH services to poor and marginalized populations. While there are no standard objective
             criteria for judging whether policies are “good” or “bad,” they can be assessed from the
             perspective of providing affordable, sustainable, and equitable services to poor and marginalized
             groups and indigenous communities. While it is infrequent that formal policy declarations are
             overtly “bad” by this metric, in some cases they do not explicitly recognize or target certain
             groups or services. The policy in Niger (PROHESA 2016-30) clearly articulates the state’s
             commitment to ensuring equal access to WASH services, and their affordability, and would, by


54	   Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
  this yardstick, be considered “good.” Likewise, a guiding principle of Mozambique’s National
  Water Policy (PNA) is to increase water coverage for the poorest and most vulnerable. In
  Tanzania, however, except for a funding formula intended to benefit the unserved, the policies
  and laws governing rural water provision do not include explicit measures for targeting the poor.
  Guatemala also lacks a policy commitment that explicitly addresses poor populations.

  The evidence suggests that while countries often commit themselves, de jure, to allocating
  resources to benefit the poor, actual allocations often diverge from these commitments. This
  chapter focuses on one key manifestation of de facto policy: namely, budget allocations. The
  differences between policy statements and actions in a set of 11 countries are presented in
  table 4.2, adapted from a GLAAS analysis of whether these (mostly developing) countries have
  enabling environments for achieving the SDGs (GLAAS 2017). The table presents the countries’
  self-assessment of policies aimed at achieving equitable provision of water and sanitation. The
  de jure columns reflect policy intentions and the de facto columns reflect actions taken.

  An in-depth exploration of the upstream political economy dynamics that play out in the policy
  arena, resulting in a gap between policy and resource allocation, was beyond the scope of the
  WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative. Political economy analysis can be applied at two different
  levels (i) the upstream (“policy arena”) level, where policies are debated, designed, and
  enacted; and (ii) the downstream level, where policies are implemented by service providers.
  Insofar as resource allocation is an expression of policy, it is at the first of these two levels.
  The Initiative took resource allocation as an outcome, but did not probe the upstream “policy
  arena” to understand its reasons. Chapter 5 proceeds to the second level, to analyze the
  downstream dynamics that result in the inefficient use of resources once they are allocated.


  Skewed Resource Allocations
  Despite “good” policies and budgets, there are structural inequalities in how resources are
  allocated. For example, in most of the countries studied as part of the Initiative, budget
  allocations clearly favor urban areas over rural ones, water services over sanitation, and the
  creation of new assets over the maintenance of existing ones. As noted earlier, investing in
  urban areas would be a very sensible pro-poor strategy in certain circumstances. However, if
  policy makers and donors have equity as a goal for WASH spending, current investments are
  systematically missing that goal. In Niger, the rate of access to improved water in urban areas
  stands at 100 percent. Yet in rural parts of the same country only 1 percent of the people have
  access to improved sanitation. While those living in cities saw their access to improved water
  increase by 39 percentage points between 1990 and 2015, open defecation increased in poor
  rural areas. These statistics are difficult to ignore given that 81 percent of the country’s total
  population live in rural areas, as do 90 percent of the poor, who are largely concentrated along
  the country’s southern border.

  Both public sector and donor spending on WASH favor water over sanitation. In a GLAAS survey
  sample of 24 countries (GLAAS 2017), 43 percent of nonhousehold WASH expenditure went
  toward improving sanitation while 56 percent went toward water (figure 4.2 panel a). The
  WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative found a similar pattern. For example, in the Democratic
  Republic of Congo, the limited finance available to the sector is focused on just two institutional
  channels: the urban-focused national water utility (Régie de distribution d’eau, REGIDESO) and
  the “Healthy Schools and Villages” program led by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)
  and the Ministry of Public Health. Both have absorbed the vast majority of WASH funds over
  the past decade, meaning that urban areas and drinking water services receive a
  disproportionate amount of total funding. A similar trend can be seen in Nigeria, where
  96 percent of expenditure on WASH went to drinking water services, and only 4 percent was
  devoted to sanitation services.

  Spending on urban areas also tends to exceed spending on rural areas. A GLAAS survey of
  13 countries found that nonhousehold expenditures on WASH services were more than three

  times higher in urban areas than in rural areas (figure 4.2 panel b). Evidence from the Initiative
  supports this finding. In Niger, a large influx of resources for urban water projects, notably
  through the International Development Association of the World Bank, has tipped financing
  toward that subsector. This parallels the skewing of public expenditures toward the more
  affluent population in the capital city, Niamey, and toward construction of large assets over
  maintenance of existing assets. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, REGIDESO has worked
  to strengthen its financial position through a focus on its traditionally strongest service areas
  in Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, and Matadi, and, within these cities, on relatively rich and centrally
  located neighborhoods. In Nigeria, Tunisia, and Bangladesh at least two-thirds of total WASH
  spending was allocated to urban areas. Mozambique also illustrates the skewing of resources
  toward urban WASH, despite policy commitments to the contrary. While sector policy states
  that budget allocations and fiscal transfers should be based on poverty and basic needs, the
  policy is not borne out in practice, resulting in significant geographic disparities. Over the past
  10 years, a disproportionate share of sector investments has been focused on wealthy urban
  neighborhoods. The World Bank (2010) reports that prior to 2006 almost all donor-financed
  water projects in the country were in urban areas. In 2007 per capita spending on urban water
  exceeded that on rural water by almost 12 times. In Tanzania, rural water supply has been
  relatively underresourced compared with urban WASH services, even though most Tanzanians
  reside in rural areas.

  Expenditures on WASH appear to be regressive. In Pakistan, the lion’s share of overall resources
  go to provincial capitals that are among the richest districts in the nation. Even when national
  capitals are excluded from the analysis, there is no relationship between district-level poverty
  levels and resource allocation. This pattern holds for WASH-specific investments as well.
  Districts where a relatively large share of households have access to improved water and
  sanitation benefit from a higher rate of WASH expenditure per capita than districts where
  access rates are low.


Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	             57
             A potential driver of the divergence between policy commitments and actual resource allocations
             is elite capture, defined by the 2017 World Development Report, as “the ability of influential
             groups to capture policies and make them serve their narrow interests” (World Bank 2017).
             The widespread underfinancing of rural WASH (and rural sanitation in particular) may be seen
             as a form of capture, whereby the interests of urban elites are more effectively represented
             than those of the rural majority, who are likely to have less political power and influence.
             Compared with other services, rural sanitation is very likely to be low on the political agenda.
             The health risks of inadequate sanitation (such as open drains and fecal waste in public areas)
             may not be well understood by citizens, and the wealthiest population groups may be insulated
             from visible service failures such as flooded pit latrines (Mason, Batley, and Harris 2013).
             Higher-income households may not demand improved state provision of sanitation if they can
             opt for private provision (McGranahan 2015). These dynamics and their implications will be
             explored further in chapter 5.



             Limited Planning and Prioritization
             In a context of high population growth, the funding gap further emphasizes the need for an
             informed prioritization of investments. Policy makers are often confronted with a myriad of
             factors to consider in the investment decision-making process. The problem of conflicting
             priorities is particularly acute in infrastructure decisions, which often involve large investments
             and lock-in technologies. In regions and countries where the infrastructure access gap is
             large and public budgets severely constrained, the importance of considering the different
             facets of the decision-making process become even more relevant (Andres, Biller, and Herrera
             Dappe 2015).

             A significant weakness in planning and budgeting has been that responsibility for project delivery
             is often split across agencies and there is no mechanism for coordination. For instance, in
             Yemen, three agencies share the responsibility for planning and budgeting for WASH, without
             any mechanism for joint planning at the local level or for consolidation, the elimination of
             overlap, or the exploitation of synergies either at central or local levels. These coordination
             problems have been exacerbated by the current armed conflict. In the West Bank and Gaza,
             there is no clear mechanism by which investment priorities at the local level can be addressed.
             Local government units lack a stable and predictable source of investment finance for
             strategically planning their water operations. Consequently, plans developed at either the local
             or national level are overambitious and/or unrealistic. In Nigeria, responsibility for the water
             sector is shared across 36 states, making it difficult to implement national programs—though,
             in practice, the federal government plays a substantial role in financing capital investments.
             Coordination of planning and budgeting of investments and of associated operations and
             maintenance is challenging given the number of actors, as well as their diverse incentives
             and priorities for allocating resources to the sector. Institutional arrangements have profound
             implications for the delivery of WASH services, as will be explored further in chapter 5.


             Conclusion
             Disparities in the WASH sector are largely explained by a skewing of resources toward urban
             water over other services. A preference for allocating funds to urban water is particularly evident
             in Sub-Saharan Africa, where access to piped water is between 80–100 percent in Maputo,
             Addis Abba, Kinshasa, and Niamey, but only 27–33 percent in the rural areas outside the four
             capital cities, despite the fact that the latter are home to only about 8 percent of the total
             population and a small fraction of the poor in their respective countries. If policy makers aim
             to achieve equity of access to WASH services, resources will need to be redirected to reach the
             poor and unserved in rural areas, small towns, and peri-urban areas.




58	   Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
  If the world hopes to meet the SDGs, it is essential to close the huge WASH infrastructure gap.
  Current levels of sector funding can cover the capital costs of achieving universal basic services
  for WASH by 2030, provided resources are targeted to the areas of greatest need. However, as
  has been noted, the capital investments required to go beyond basic services to achieve the
  SDG targets for WASH are estimated to be about four times current levels.

  Most countries have limited fiscal space to increase public investments; in some, achieving
  the SDGs for WASH will require a significant reprioritization of investments. Given the capital
  costs of reaching the SDGs, investments will have to be much more efficient. In practice,
  this means that urban water service providers will have to become more efficient. It also
  means that governments will have to allow water providers access to private capital so as
  to widen the fiscal space sufficiently to permit public investments in expanding access in
  areas where people’s ability or willingness to pay for services may be low (for example, for
  urban sanitation, rural sanitation, and rural water), and to support operations and
  maintenance as required. To repeat an important point made in this chapter: policy makers
  are typically confronted with many factors in the investment decision-making process. In
  regions and countries where the infrastructure access gap is wide and public budgets
  severely constrained, the importance of considering the different facets of the decision-
  making process become even more relevant.

  Aligning actions with policy statements is key. This chapter identified significant gaps
  between policy intentions and actions, as expressed through budget allocations. Careful
  planning and implementation are key to achieving the universal aspirations expressed in
  the SDGs, with special attention to the most vulnerable populations. However, as will be
  shown in chapter 5, the distribution of power and institutional weaknesses are often the
  drivers of skewed allocations and inefficiencies in financing, despite policies that look good
  on paper.


  Notes
  	 1.	 Following from the SDGs and the World Bank’s twin goals, this report uses equity as the
        guiding criterion while recognizing that investing in urban areas could be a very sensible
        pro-poor strategy if funding is constrained and there is a greater density of poverty in
        cities, and/or there are economies of scale in city investment, and/or a city’s (marginal)
        productivity is higher and so drives growth in the economy.
  	2.	The unit costs on which these estimates are based implicitly include the prevailing
        inefficiencies in the system. Costs could be lower to the extent that these inefficiencies
        are reduced.

  Chapter 5
  Mind the Gap: From
  Policy to Pipes
            Solutions need to be tailored to specific, widely varying natural, cultural, economic and
                       political circumstances, in which the art of reform is the art of the possible.
                                                                                        – John Briscoe

  In the span of just 12 years (2002–14), the water budget in Tanzania quadrupled, owing in
  large part to enhanced coordination and commitments by donors to achieve the Millennium
  Development Goal for water. Donor support encouraged the country to adopt reforms aimed at
  devolving resources and authority to local governments and encouraging community
  participation in operations and maintenance (O&M)—widely endorsed measures meant to
  enhance sustainability and promote equity. However, even as of 2015, growth in access to
  basic water services had stalled at just over 50 percent of the population, and 40 percent of
  all water points1 in rural areas were not functional.2 An estimated 25 percent of all water points
  in the country break down within two years of construction.

  Niger, too, devolved responsibility to the local level for building and managing water supply,
  sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, with the aim of bringing the government closer to the
  people. But this policy was not accompanied with a commensurate devolution of resources. In
  practice, the transfer of responsibility for WASH service delivery to poorly resourced communes,
  with little state capacity to guide and supervise, is tantamount to the state disengaging from
  the sector. In rural Niger today, the rate of open defecation is 90 percent, among the highest
  in the world.

  Tanzania and Niger are not unique. In most of the World Bank’s client countries, the WASH
  sector is characterized by persistent failures to provide sustainable services to vulnerable
  populations—even when the funding to do so is available. In addition to the resource allocation
  issues discussed in chapters  2 and 4, the kinds of service delivery challenges described
  above point to the critical importance of enhancing the efficiency of resource use. In many
  instances, resources have not been used for the purposes for which they were allocated, often
  because of a misalignment of incentives. As a result, the WASH sector abounds with examples
  of poor management of public investment leading to overly expensive designs; infrastructure
  being built but then poorly maintained; poor budget management leading to delays, cost
  overruns, and waste; and local governments being allocated responsibilities without the
  resources or capacity to carry out their designated functions.

  Enhancing efficiency is especially important now: the capital investments required to achieve
  the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for water and sanitation are estimated to be nearly
  four times current investment levels, as noted several times in this report.


  Gaps between Policy and Implementation
  often Drive Inefficiency
  More often than not, failures to provide adequate (WASH) services to the poor and other
  marginalized groups reflects not bad policy but a failure of policy implementation. As the 2017
  World Development Report (World Bank 2017a: 2) notes: “policies that should be effective in


Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   61
             generating positive development outcomes are often not adopted, are poorly implemented, or
             end up backfiring over time.” Such failures frequently result from a misalignment of incentives,
             given the myriad of actors involved in providing water and sanitation services, and their
             competing interests. While it is now being recognized that political and institutional constraints
             explain the persistence of gaps between policy and implementation (World Bank 2017a),3 this
             understanding has not yet been mainstreamed in operational practice. This chapter represents
             a step in that direction.

             The recognition that the institutional and organizational arrangements that govern the service
             delivery of WASH affect quality and sustainability is not new to the World Bank’s Water Global
             Practice or to WASH practitioners more generally. Past institutional reform efforts focused
             mainly on two approaches: insulation/corporatization and decentralization (Herrera and Post
             2014). While it has long been recognized that politics matter (Baietti, Kingdom, and van
             Ginneken 2006; Locussol and van Ginneken 2008) and that efforts to engender increasing
             autonomy require politicians and civil servants to cede control, this traditional line of thinking
             stops short of suggesting (possibly second-best) options for situations where the political
             environment is not conducive to best practice reforms. Furthermore, reform efforts to date
             have focused primarily on the WASH sector, and have not systematically considered the broader
             governance landscape in which WASH services are provided. Recent analytical work by Laffont
             (2005) and Estache and Wren-Lewis (2009) has pointed to the unique challenges that
             developing countries face in regulating infrastructure, and suggests that rather than prescribing
             best practices, reformers should instead seek to understand institutional context.

             This chapter presents the approach used by the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative to better
             understand the gaps between policy and implementation, and discusses key findings from the
             18 economies in which research was carried out. Among other goals, the Initiative aims to
             understand the broader governance environment—more specifically, the institutional and
             organizational arrangements4 for public management within which WASH services are financed,
             managed, and delivered, and that affect the quality and sustainability of these services.

             Understanding these elements is critical to identify the constraints to improving service
             outcomes and the scope for feasible reforms to ensure that increased spending will in fact
             improve the lives and future opportunities of poor and vulnerable populations. For practitioners,
             the message is to do business differently by looking beyond technical solutions and taking a
             more comprehensive view of WASH service delivery. Understanding the institutional
             arrangements that drive WASH outcomes is the first step in realigning the incentives of actors
             toward safely managed services for all.


             The Public Sector
             To better understand the factors that might impede WASH service delivery, we need to consider
             the types of functions performed by both central and line/sector agencies. Figure 5.1 provides
             a stylized depiction of the public sector within which WASH services are delivered. In particular,
             it shows the links between central and line/sector agencies (World Bank 2012) and between
             “upstream” and “downstream” functions. While upstream functions are most often centralized
             (and downstream functions performed at the local level), this is not always the case—a local
             government can (and often does) perform “upstream” functions. Upstream functions include
             planning and budgeting, public investment management, financial management, accounting,
             fiscal reporting, procurement, and intergovernmental systems that impact all services.
             Downstream functions are those associated with service delivery: the construction of
             infrastructure, O&M, monitoring, coordination, community engagement, billing, collection, fecal
             sludge management, and the like.

             The traditional approach to analyzing the WASH “sector” typically does not include the impact
             of cross-cutting (upstream) functions on the delivery of WASH services. In practice, WASH
             service providers very often operate within the broader public sector. In view of this, shifting the

  focus to the service being provided rather than the sector itself opens up the ambit of any
  reform effort. The political environment and the distribution of power within a country impacts
  both upstream and downstream functions.


  Service Characteristics
  The distinct characteristics of the different WASH services considered—urban water, rural water,
  urban sanitation, and rural sanitation—mean that the political and institutional factors affecting
  the delivery of one may not be relevant for another.5 Relevant characteristics include the nature
  of the service being delivered, the type of market failure being addressed, the tasks involved
  in delivery, and how the service is demanded/consumed. These characteristics have
  implications for the political salience of the service, and therefore the likelihood that it will be
  delivered. For example, building new networked water pipes is a highly visible activity, resulting
  in its political salience and prioritization among many governments seeking to claim credit. The
  O&M of existing infrastructure is less visible, often resulting in its neglect.

  However, service characteristics are not immutable. Understanding constraints on the political
  salience of a particular service is a crucial first step in conceptualizing targeted reforms to


Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   63
             ease those constraints. Appendix D provides additional examples of service characteristics,
             noting, in particular, their political salience.



             Diagnostic Approach: Start with the Problem,
             not the Solution
             As noted earlier, the institutional reforms that have typically been advocated to address WASH
             service delivery challenges have tended to steer clear of the broader governance context in
             which service providers and local government bodies operate. However, in the foreseeable
             future and for rural services in particular, a large majority of service providers will not
             be  corporatized entities and will continue to operate squarely within government. They will
             therefore continue to be influenced by politics and the existing public management systems
             that include  policy making, public financial management, public investment management,
             human resource management, and intergovernmental arrangements. As a result, the functioning
             of state organizations and institutional arrangements that typically lie outside the purview of
             water practitioners cannot be ignored. The 2017 World Development Report (World Bank
             2017a) highlights three functions needed for inputs and policies to deliver effective outcomes:
             commitment, coordination, and cooperation. These functions in turn are shaped by the
             incentives, interests, and systems that comprise the enabling environment. To achieve the
             SDGs, the next generation of reforms and interventions will need to be cognizant of
             the “operating environment” that places limits on the room for maneuver and change.

             Drawing on the literature on governance and institutional reform,6 the WASH Poverty Diagnostic
             Initiative sought to identify both proximate and binding constraints to the delivery of WASH
             services. Using a problem-driven approach, the key service delivery problem(s) identified in the
             18 country-level diagnostics7 provided the starting point for this exercise (see appendix B). For
             example, in Nigeria the key problems identified were a decrease in access to piped water
             through household connections in urban areas (prompting efforts to self-supply), and the high
             postconstruction failure rates of water points in rural areas. In Indonesia, urban water utilities
             are unable to extend services to those without access and provide good-quality services to
             those who already have access.

             In the Initiative’s problem-driven approach, “problems” are not articulated in the form of
             “solutions,” for example, that a utility is not corporatized or that services are not decentralized.
             Instead, the approach provides a methodology for identifying technically and politically feasible
             sets of reforms that target the service delivery problem. Also, it is relatively agnostic about
             what might work in a particular context and does not take a normative position on reform
             solutions.

             After identifying the service delivery problem(s) of a given country, the Initiative critically
             evaluated the institutional arrangements for service delivery and the gaps between policy and
             implementation—what Kingdom (2017) described as “the pitfalls between the policy and the
             pipes.” To identify the binding constraints on implementation, the analysis started with a
             mapping of key functions8 across different tiers of government and different actors. The
             mapping was based on the formal, de jure arrangements. (The exercise was designed to
             critically evaluate both the formal, de jure, and actual, de facto, institutional architecture and
             practices and to be cognizant of the importance of informal institutions.)

             The analysis used three diagnostic lenses to identify constraints and reform options: oversight
             and accountability (World Bank 2004), intergovernmental arrangements (Boex 2015), and
             capacity (World Bank 2017b). Looking through the oversight and accountability lens involves
             considering the relationships between government, service providers, and citizens/clients.
             Next, without taking a normative position, the country studies considered weaknesses in
             intergovernmental arrangements, assessing both the de jure and de facto authority
             and  power  at different levels/tiers of government to undertake the assigned functions.


64	   Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
  This  part  of the analysis draws on the three standard dimensions for assessing
  intergovernmental arrangements—political, fiscal, and administrative. Finally, weaknesses
  in the capacity of the entities/organizations involved in the delivery of services were
  evaluated. (Note here that capacity encompasses both financial capacity, that is, sector
  financing, as well as the capacity of relevant personnel, including end users to the degree
  that they are responsible for covering O&M costs.) Considering all three of these conjoined
  lenses is important, since binding constraints to service delivery problems—and viable
  reform options—are likely to involve all three.



  Emerging Findings
  The analysis reported here focuses on the following subset of the 18 economies for which an
  institutional diagnostic was carried out: Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Indonesia,
  Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Panama, Tanzania, and the West Bank and Gaza. Evidence from the
  other countries is reported subject to availability and relevance.


  Oversight and Accountability
  The World Development Report for 2004 (World Bank 2004) provided influential analysis of why
  countries fail to deliver basic public services to their citizens, highlighting the previously ignored
  roles of politics and accountability. Its framework is built around three core relationships—
  between citizens and service providers; service providers and policy makers/politicians; and
  policy makers/politicians and citizens. The report promoted a “short route” to accountability,
  through which citizens exercise their “client power” to hold service providers directly to account.
  This is contrasted with the more traditional but often less effective “long route,” through which
  citizens influence public service provision by working through representative political institutions
  (that give them “voice”) and policy makers influence frontline service providers through a
  “compact” delegating resources and responsibility.9

  Rural water provision in many countries does not fit neatly into the accountability framework of
  the 2004 World Development Report, since water users themselves play an important role in
  service provision. For example, in Tanzania, community-owned water supply organizations
  (COWSOs) are simultaneously agents of the community and of the local government. Lines of
  accountability are blurred where it is difficult to distinguish between water users and water
  providers. Guatemala offers another example of the same phenomenon: although municipalities
  are legally responsible for providing WASH services in rural areas, communities generally build,
  operate, and maintain their own systems through drinking water committees.

  Where foreign aid plays a large role, this can also blur the lines of accountability. Such is the
  case in Tanzania, where foreign funding contributed between 70 to 80 percent of the total water
  budget in 2007-13 (Development Partners Group 2014; Quinn and Tilley 2013).

  Intergovernmental transfers can also complicate the relationships of accountability and limit
  the scope for client power. In Nigeria, states rely on transfers from the federal government to
  finance their budgets. The amount and timing of these transfers are often difficult to predict,
  resulting in discretionary cash rationing that limits state water agencies’ access to funds.
  When these agencies simply lack the funds to deliver good-quality services, they cannot be
  held directly to account.

  In addition, information asymmetries make it difficult for water users to know what they can
  reasonably demand from the state when it comes to improved service provision. This is often
  a consequence of ambiguous policies. Information asymmetries exist at many levels, precluding
  citizens from monitoring the quality of services as well as the budget allocation process. In
  Guatemala, due to the limited information on the standards and levels of service that clients
  can expect, the long route of accountability breaks down. Because regulations are incomplete,


Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   65
             the responsibility for understanding services and monitoring delivery is borne by citizens, who
             do not have information to evaluate the quality and coverage of WASH services. Without
             information on performance, it is not possible for citizens to raise their voices effectively.

             The nature of political competition in a country also limits the ability of water users to influence
             their elected representatives. For example, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic
             Front (EPRDF) and allied regional political parties dominate Ethiopia’s political system at both
             the national and local levels. Thus, while local councilors are responsible for service delivery
             and theoretically should be responsive to local needs, there is a widespread view that senior
             party members’ instructions and targets overshadow local concerns.

             In other cases, WASH service delivery is not politically salient, which reduces the effectiveness
             of citizens’ voices. For instance, in Indonesia, mayoral incumbents and candidates do not
             appear to regard urban water as a key issue on which to demonstrate performance to secure
             (re)election. This may be because some elements of local government-owned water utilities’
             performance, such as poor water quality, are not immediately visible to consumers, thereby
             reducing the incentives for local leaders to improve service delivery by chlorinating the water.

             The obstacles to accountability relate back to the service characteristics of water and
             sanitation—that is, both the “supply-side” factors affecting the incentives that politicians have
             for improving service delivery, as well as the “demand-side” factors affecting the likelihood that
             citizens make claims on the state for improved service delivery. In Nigeria, resources at the
             federal level are allocated on the basis of garnering political support rather than on prioritizing
             where people’s needs are greatest. To garner and maintain political support, politicians often
             favor new construction rather than maintaining existing infrastructure.

             On the demand side, the frequency and predictability of demand for drinking water, along with
             the fact that water consumers are defined territorially, creates scope for water users to coalesce
             around service issues and therefore in theory raises the likelihood that users will make claims
             on the state. That said, only a subset of water users (women and girls) is typically involved in
             the daily collection of water in most countries, including Tanzania and Niger, and thus aware of
             the particular service delivery challenges affecting their communities. For example, in Niger
             women and girls spend almost an hour fetching water every day. Engrained social norms
             frequently prevent females from advocating individually or collectively for improved services
             (Mason, Batley, and Harris 2013). As a result, citizens’ voices are constrained.

             Citizens’ voices are also constrained by their limited political influence. Thus, low-income
             consumers are unlikely to be able to challenge the problems that plague the urban water
             supply in Indonesia, where information asymmetries and other factors prevent them from
             directly engaging with local governments to demand service improvements. This demand-side
             constraint also manifests in Panama, where rural and especially indigenous populations are
             systematically excluded from access to quality WASH services. These populations face
             particular obstacles to any effort to collectively mobilize to protect their interests and to
             influence policy. The persistence of this “low contestability” (World Bank 2017a) is likely to
             contribute to the existing mismatch between the de jure objective of targeting indigenous
             communities as a national priority, and the de facto reality of the fragmented and inefficient
             institutional architecture characterizing service delivery in the areas where they live.


             Intergovernmental Relations
             Decentralization reforms have been implemented in several countries with the objective of
             making WASH service delivery more efficient and responsive to local needs—largely in
             response to the failures of centralized provision. However, decentralization has not proved to
             be a panacea.

             Decentralization reforms can face difficult challenges in countries with democratic deficits,
             where the elite may be reluctant to share resources and authority with lower levels of


66	   Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
  government in a meaningful way. The potential benefits of decentralization are often
  undermined by inadequate devolution of power, particularly over finance and staff; vague and/
  or inappropriate systems and procedures; underqualified and unmotivated staff; political
  interference and corruption; and a lack of “downward” accountability—that is, of local
  politicians to their constituents (Conyers 2007). For instance, in Ethiopia, responsibility for
  rural water provision is based on the principle of subsidiarity whereby service delivery
  responsibilities are allocated to the lowest possible tier of government, which in theory
  provides space for water bureaus and local councilors to be responsive to local needs. In this
  arrangement, councilors must respond to the demands of their electorate and their seniors at
  the same time. As has been previously noted, the power players in the party hierarchy often
  dominate local decisions, and are likely to favor highly visible construction projects over
  necessary maintenance. The situation in Tanzania is similar. Furthermore, in many cases
  funds are allocated from the top down in a nontransparent manner and can reduce citizens’
  incentive to engage in local politics and hold their locally elected representatives to account
  for any misuse of earmarked funds (Wunsch 2001).

  These tendencies are not unique to Africa. For instance, in the West Bank, 27 political and
  administrative functions (including water and sanitation) have been delegated to local
  government units (LGUs), but not fiscal authority. LGUs are not allowed to collect property
  taxes to finance local services, and the absence of an intergovernmental fiscal transfer system
  leaves them without a reliable source of revenue. Therefore, LGUs rely on their own revenues
  from “enterprise services” (such as electricity and water) to finance their general operating
  budgets. As a result, frequent diversion of revenues from water provision is at the cost of
  reinvestment in the O&M of water systems and affects the quality of services.

  Even where relations between different levels of government have been deconcentrated,10
  they may not be functional. For instance, in Mozambique, management of donor-financed
  rural water sector investments by the National Directorate of Water Supply and Sanitation
  (DNAAS) appears to impede the execution of sector plans. Although subnational agencies
  have been notably more efficient than DNAAS at executing donor funds for rural water, the
  directorate is reluctant to see the further deconcentration of funds to provinces or districts.
  The centralization of sector finances within DNAAS reinforces its position as the principal
  coordinating agency for rural water and amplifies its importance among both donors and
  local state agencies alike. A  significant shift in financial transfers away from DNAAS and
  toward direct provincial allocations, for example, would enable DNAAS staff to better
  concentrate their efforts on their formal policy-making role instead of the busywork of
  reporting to donors, but potentially at a cost to their status in the sector. The government of
  Mozambique may also be reluctant to empower local governments in areas associated with
  the political opposition.

  Intergovernmental arrangements can also create ambiguity and opportunities for capture in
  the budgeting process. In Mozambique, the planning, budgeting, and allocation process is not
  transparent—especially at the central level. Provincial budgetary allocations, and how these
  investments are distributed among districts, are not based on transparent criteria or formulas
  and are subject to change during the budget approval and execution stages at the national
  level. At each stage of the planning process, political actors and appointed administrators have
  considerable discretionary power to influence the final plans and submitted budget, and, as
  such, how allocations are disbursed, limiting the ability of citizens to influence the allocation
  process.

  There are also instances when policies overlap or contradict one another, making it difficult for
  water users, local government officials, and other stakeholders to know which procedures to
  follow and who has authority over what. This is particularly so when sector policies have been
  developed independent of cross-cutting policies for, say, local governments. This may be
  understood as a failure of coordination (World Bank 2017a) and may also be a consequence
  of isomorphism11 to the extent that policies have been developed to reflect international
  standards and donor preferences rather than the local context.


Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   67
             For instance, in Tanzania authority for service provision is characterized by a contradiction
             between the Local Government Acts and the Water and Sanitation Act. A review of the different
             laws reveals clear overlap of functions and responsibilities between urban local government
             authorities and water supply and sanitation authorities, which are independent corporate
             bodies under the authority of the Ministry of Water. This makes the role of the elected local
             government leadership unclear when it comes to providing water and sanitation services in
             urban areas. This ambiguity reflects broader tensions between sector reforms and overarching
             decentralization reforms, as well as a centralizing tendency of the government, aimed in part
             at keeping the country’s long-standing ruling political party in power.

             In the West Bank and Gaza, the Local Government Act of 1997 explicitly allocates water and
             sanitation provision to LGUs, while the 2014 Water Law seeks to extract water service provision
             from being embedded in LGUs. While in theory the 2014 law supersedes the 1997 one, water
             departments have yet to be moved outside LGUs.

             In Bangladesh, while the legal framework assigns responsibilities to different levels of
             government and to agencies within these, there are a number of overlaps. For example, local
             governments are allocated responsibility for water and sanitation and at the same time the
             national Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) is also tasked with carrying out
             activities in the sector. There is also lack of clarity between the respective jurisdictions of the
             DPHE and the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), which are both departments
             of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives.


             Capacity
             Capacity may be understood as “the availability of resources and the efficiency and effectiveness
             with which societies deploy these resources to identify and pursue their development goals on
             a sustainable basis” (World Bank 2017b: 4). Capacity can be usefully unpacked into two
             elements: (i) the stock of human, financial, and technical skills and resources; and (ii) a
             broader set of institutional factors that enable (or constrain) the development of capacity stock
             and its ultimate conversion into development outcomes. For example, if the government’s key
             responsibility in rural sanitation is promoting behavioral change, strengthening the technical
             capacity of water engineers would not address this.

             In some cases, implementation gaps are due to weak capacity of (local) governments and
             other implementing agencies that frequently lack the resources, personnel, and know-how to
             effectively implement the responsibilities that have been devolved to them. Weak local capacity
             is often reflected in the underspending of allocated funds. For example, over the past decade
             Niger spent only $6.80 per capita on WASH, despite a voted budget of $11.80 per capita—an
             execution rate of under 60 percent. Guatemala’s level of execution of WASH investments did
             not exceed 50 percent in any of the past three years (2013–15) for which data are available,
             and was only 17 percent in 2015. Likewise, in Ethiopia 38 percent of the local budget and
             35 percent of the regional budget for rural water supply was not used (World Bank 2016).

             Distortionary staffing of national WASH ministries similarly burdens government capacity to
             deliver services. In 2014, Niger created a regulatory body within the Ministry of Water and
             Sanitation. To date, it has a director but no other staff, and the minimum resource requirements
             are lacking. Meanwhile, 27 of the 31 staff members within Niger’s Department for Hygiene and
             Sanitation (within the Ministry of Health) are at the highest rank level in the administration. But
             most of these staff members serve in border posts (including at airports) (Government of
             Niger, Ministry of Health, n.d.), making the prospect of addressing the high levels of open
             defecation in rural areas unrealistic.

             The financial capacity of water users also represents a challenge. For instance, in Tanzania, the
             financial capacity of COWSOs to cover O&M costs is a key driver of the failure to maintain
             existing and newly constructed infrastructure for water provision. Specifically, COWSOs are


68	   Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
  constrained by their reliance on the contributions of water users. In many rural wards, the
  majority of residents survive on less than $1.25 per day. Furthermore, many Tanzanians lack
  regular access to cash, which can put even seemingly manageable contributions out of reach.
  As a result, the likelihood that such users will pay for water is quite low. Recent estimates
  suggest that nearly two-thirds of all water users never pay for the services they use. Not
  surprisingly, the functionality of water schemes that benefit from users’ payments is better
  than those that don’t.

  Similarly, in Ethiopia, financing of O&M and other life-cycle costs is a major problem. The
  assumption that low-income users across the country are able to self-fund and undertake most
  O&M is questionable, even though the sustainability of the Government of Ethiopia’s WASH
  program depends on this.


  A Need to Do Business Differently
  The efforts to identify service delivery constraints outlined above resulted in two key observations.
  First is the recognition that some dysfunctions in service delivery, in particular to poor and
  vulnerable people, persist even though solutions to these problems may seem obvious.
  Second, political, institutional, and capacity constraints—some of which may, by design, serve
  the interests of those in power—have led to a waste of scarce resources.

  The WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative began by identifying the service delivery problem in
  question—for example, that assets are not adequately maintained, or that poor people do not
  have access to services even when they are willing to pay for them. Importantly, the starting
  point was not a preferred “solution,” such as corporatization, decentralization, or community
  management. This focus on the problem represents a departure from traditional reform
  approaches, which have often focused on preferred organizational forms. Instead, the approach
  seeks to learn from past mistakes. While elements of a traditional reform package may end up
  being recommended as a way forward, the proposed approach focuses on identifying the
  proximate and binding constraints (some of which may be in the broader public management
  sphere) that if mitigated would overcome the service delivery problem in question.

  Looking across a subset of 10 of the 18 countries, a set of common themes emerge. The
  constraints to WASH service delivery identified by the Wash Poverty Diagnostics have been
  identified by others in the literature,12 and reflect broader challenges of decentralized service
  delivery in low-income settings.13

  First, and as has been noted, information asymmetries and a lack of transparency frequently
  make it difficult for end users to know what they can reasonably expect and demand from
  service providers and politicians. Such a lack of information is compounded by constraints on
  the ability of the bottom 40 percent (B40) of a nation’s wealth distribution to effectively voice
  their concerns, reducing the accountability of service providers and policy makers to the
  citizens they exist to serve.

  As a result, the visibility of outputs tends to drive the priorities of policy implementation. Among
  other challenges, this creates incentives to construct new infrastructure, rather than invest in
  the O&M of existing infrastructure or focus on improvements to water quality. A lack of visibility
  also drives political reluctance to prioritize demand creation for sanitation (as opposed to
  highly visible subsidies to finance infrastructure).

  The fact that water and sanitation services have been only partially decentralized in many of the
  cases also creates challenges for implementation. Many of the country cases reveal poor
  coordination across different implementing bodies. The multiplicity of actors and lack of clarity
  in terms of functional assignments frequently results in gaps and overlaps in policy, blurring
  lines of accountability. In addition, decentralized service delivery arrangements frequently
  result in local governments failing to perform their assigned responsibilities, with serious


Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   69
             implications for monitoring, oversight, budget execution, and efficient (needs-based) targeting.
             Such failures are frequently driven by a transfer of responsibilities to the local level without
             commensurate transfer/availability of resources. The failure to sufficiently resource local
             governments is frequently political—reflecting a reluctance on the part of the central government
             to meaningfully share power. Thus, in addition to the horizontal coordination across ministries
             in government discussed in chapter 3, better (vertical) coordination between levels/tiers of
             government is critical for improving efficiency in resource use.

             Finally, the 10 countries are characterized by substantial cost-recovery issues. In a number of
             cases, water users lack the financial capacity to cover O&M—a responsibility that has been
             devolved to them for most rural water supply schemes in line with the “demand-responsive
             approach.”14 Politicians in urban areas frequently intervene when it comes to setting tariffs at
             rates that would facilitate cost-recovery.

             Critically, however, the identification of common constraints does not justify the application of
             common solutions. For example, having seen that weak local government capacity is a common
             challenge across a range of settings and subsectors, it would seem obvious to recommend
             interventions to build the capacity of local government actors involved in the delivery of WASH
             services. However, such a recommendation might not succeed if it did not consider the
             political factors driving such weaknesses. To the extent that local government capacity reflects
             reluctance on the part of the central government to meaningfully devolve resources, an effective
             intervention might rather focus on engaging with relevant central government actors (such at
             the Ministry of Finance or the ministry responsible for local governments). This example
             illustrates what is meant by “doing business differently.”

             A problem-driven approach is necessarily context driven, and—perhaps frustratingly—means that
             would-be reformers cannot begin with a prepackaged toolkit of tried-and-tested reforms. Rather,
             the proposed approach necessitates beginning with a well-identified service delivery problem
             and identifying the broader governance context within which it manifests. Tools such as power
             mapping and political economy analysis can help to identify the relevant actors whose incentives
             can potentially be shifted in a manner to facilitate more efficient and equitable outcomes. This
             approach may be unsatisfying for those looking for quick fixes and grand reforms, but a failure
             to consider the broader governance context almost certainly keeps the SDGs out of reach.

             If the world is to achieve the water and sanitation SDGs, donors need to better understand the
             (political) reasons for the disconnect between stated policy commitments and the reality on the
             ground in many countries. As noted in the 2017 World Development Report (World Bank 2017a:
             11), “Even if physical and administrative capacity exists, policies may still be ineffective if
             groups with enough bargaining power have no incentives to pursue implementation.” If the
             efficiency of resource use is to be enhanced, sector practitioners need to approach their
             business somewhat differently by looking beyond infrastructure and services to paying more
             attention to the institutions that “manage the pipes”—and the distribution of power that
             influences how these institutions perform in practice.

  	 7.	 As noted in the introductory chapter to this report, the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative
        addressed four main questions for the 18 economies surveyed. Service delivery problems
        corresponded primarily to the first two questions: “1. Who and where are the poor and
        vulnerable populations?” and “2. What is their level of access to WASH services, and of
        what quality, relative to better-off segments of society?”
  	8.	These vary by service, but generally include policy/regulation, planning/budgeting,
        financing, human resources, provision, and production.

  10. “Deconcentration” (distinguished from “devolution”) refers to the transfer of decision-
        making authority and responsibility for public functions to lower territorial administrative
        tiers of the central government.
  11. Drawing on the work of DiMaggio and Powell (1983), Andrews, Pritchett, and Woolcock
        (2013: 2) use the term “isomorphic mimicry” to describe cases where countries have
        adopted “the camouflage of organizational forms that are deemed successful elsewhere
        to hide their actual dysfunction.” Here, the concept is extended to policies.
  12. For example, Herrera and Post (2014) document political interference with tariff setting
        across a range of urban settings. Koehler, Thomson, and Hope (2015) note that operations
        and maintenance of rural water infrastructure has barely improved despite widespread
        adoption of DRA principles. In a study of 15 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, they find that
        in spite of the official decentralization of water provision in most cases, the devolution of
        responsibilities to local governments has not been accompanied by sufficient authority
        and resources.
  13. Synthesizing case studies that provide detailed data on service delivery in Africa,
        Conyers (2007) finds that the potential benefits of decentralization are often undermined
        by inadequate devolution of power, particularly over finance and staff; vague and/or
        inappropriate systems and procedures; underqualified and unmotivated staff; political
        interference and corruption; and a lack of “downward” accountability (of local politicians
        to their constituents).
  14. This approach, whereby water users are supposed to demand, own, and maintain their
        water services and participate in their design, has emerged as the leading paradigm for
        rural water supply in recent decades (Koehler et al. 2015). This reflects international
        consensus around the “Dublin Principles,” advanced at the International Conference on
        Water and the Environment (ICWE), Dublin, Ireland, in January 1992, which recognized
        water as an “economic good.”

Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   73
  Chapter 6
  By Way of Conclusion: Looking
  Toward the Sustainable
  Development Goals
  A major lesson learned from the water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) Poverty Diagnostic
  Initiative is the need to think and work differently to address inequalities and constraints in the
  delivery of WASH services that hinder human development. The initiative draws from all
  possible data sources but also contributes new ones (notably in relation to water quality) to
  triangulate the analysis and ascertain the facts. Specific lessons from the Initiative are
  described below.


  Working Together to Protect the
  Foundations of Development
    ••   Coordinated investments that span WASH services, health services, and nutrition can do
         more to reduce undernutrition, stunting, morbidity, and mortality from diarrheal disease
         than uncoordinated efforts or WASH investments alone.

    ••   New tools such as the mapping of multiple forms of deprivation help identify populations
         that are at highest risk of mortality from diarrhea. Mapping where current investments
         in WASH, health, and nutrition are being made at the country level, and comparing those
         investments to the burden of disease, is a logical first step.


  Invest More, Target it with Precision, and
  Allocate it Efficiently
    ••   More money was needed under the Millennium Development Goals to reach universal
         access to WASH services and to gradually eliminate inequalities in service provision.
         Even more will be required under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). On
         average, the world is currently investing between 0.2 and 0.4 percentage points of gross
         domestic product (GDP) in WASH services. To achieve the SDGs, countries will need to
         invest at least four times their current capital investment levels.

    ••   To reduce inequalities in WASH services between more and less vulnerable groups,
         resources must be targeted in a more efficient manner. The WASH Poverty Diagnostic
         Initiative offers new insights on how to use data in innovative ways to identify areas in
         most need.

    ••   Aligning actions with policy statements is key. There are significant gaps between policy
         intentions and actions, as reflected in actual budget allocations. Careful planning and
         more efficient implementation are key to achieving the universal aspirations proposed by




Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   75
                    the SDGs, with special attention to the most vulnerable populations. However, the
                    distribution of power within a country often results in resource allocations that ignore the
                    interests of the poor and vulnerable. Further, weaknesses in the institutional arrangements
                    for service delivery lead to inefficient and wasteful expenditures. Thus the political
                    economy that characterizes the policy arena and the institutional arrangements for
                    service delivery merit more attention than they currently receive.

               ••   The Initiative reveals several examples of inefficient resource use, from dysfunctional
                    infrastructure to underutilization of allocated resources. Addressing these inefficiencies
                    will be critical if progress is to be made on the SDGs. This will require urban water service
                    providers to become more efficient. It will also require governments to allow water providers
                    access to private capital, to free up fiscal space in state coffers to invest in expanding
                    access in areas where people’s ability or willingness to pay for services is low (for example,
                    for urban sanitation, rural sanitation, and rural water), and to support operations and
                    maintenance to ensure that capital investments reach their maximum life span.


             Mind the Gap from Policy to Pipes
               ••   The findings from the Initiative demonstrate that there is a need to better understand
                    the broader governance and institutional environment to gain insights into why bad
                    outcomes persist and to identify feasible entry points for changing the status quo.

               ••   A pragmatic approach that has a greater probability of success would involve a shift from
                    “best practice” reform packages to context-specific “best fit” reforms that “work with
                    the grain”1 of the prevailing political economy and capacity constraints. Such reform
                    efforts are likely to be incremental but arguably more successful than reforms based
                    strictly on international best practices. Instead of trying to change the operating
                    environment, the suggestion here is to be cognizant of the political and technical
                    constraints and find ways to better navigate the operating environment.

               ••   Traditional reform approaches have often focused on forms of organization—for example,
                    corporatization of water service providers to improve efficiency. Analysis from the
                    Initiative finds that water service providers with the same corporate form in the same
                    country can function very differently. On the other hand, there are examples of well-
                    functioning water service providers that are not corporatized and are embedded in the
                    government. What might be the reasons for this? This suggests a need to shift the focus
                    from form to function.

               ••   If resources are to be used more efficiently, development practitioners need to approach
                    business differently by paying more attention to the institutions that manage the pipes
                    and the political economy that influences how these institutions perform in practice.


             Improve Data Collection and Build Capacity
             to Track the SDGs
               ••   Harmonizing and improving data collection at the country level will be critical to monitoring
                    the SDG indicators. This means more consistency across national surveys, but also
                    better use of administrative data. Making more information available to the public
                    (for example, on water-quality levels) can reduce information asymmetries.

               ••   Efforts under the Initiative to work with bureaus of statistics in various countries
                    demonstrate that these agencies face significant challenges to collecting the myriad of
                    indicators required for the SDGs. Providing support to these agencies to help them
                    collect data in the most efficient manner will be critical.


76	   Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
  The tasks that countries and donor institutions face as they look toward the SDGs may appear
  herculean. A key reflection from this initiative is that building cross-sectoral collaborations
  among specialists in water, poverty, health, and governance brings a range of perspectives and
  new insights to bear, opening the door to thinking and working differently. This report is designed
  to inspire decision makers and practitioners to increase their collaboration to ensure that
  goals become realities for the world’s most vulnerable people.

  Appendix A
  Methods Used to Measure
  Inequities and Intersections
  with Poverty
  Human Opportunity Index (HOI). The HOI, created by the World Bank (de Barros et al. 2009),
  measures the inequality of opportunities. Under the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative, the
  HOI provided insights into equity in access, as well as the social and human determinants
  influencing access to WASH services. Specifically, it was used to calculate access to WASH
  services for children under the age of 16.1

  UNICEF Synergies. In 1990, UNICEF developed a conceptual framework that identified food
  security, environmental health, and health care as underlying determinants of undernutrition.
  The World Bank’s poverty economists (Skoufias 2016) have since developed a methodology
  that uses the UNICEF framework as a guide to contrast adequate conditions with what is
  observed in household survey data. The WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative refined the model
  to focus on adequate food, care, health, and WASH. The model uses statistical methods to
  understand the relationships between nutritional outcomes, as measured by a child’s height-
  for-age Z score (HAZ) and underlying factors (Skoufias 2016).

  WASH Poverty Risk Model (WASH-PRM). This model was developed with researchers from the
  London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Florida, and builds on
  the work of Rheingans et al. (2012) to assess patterns of disease across different economic
  and geographic subpopulations of children under 5. The model includes WASH factors (access
  to water, household sanitation, and hygiene) that influence the risk of diarrheal disease, and
  susceptibility factors (the acquisition of micronutrients, effective rehydration treatment, and
  undernutrition) that influence both the risk of infection and mortality due to diarrhea. The
  model allows us to identify the populations of children under 5 with the highest risk of diarrheal
  disease, stunting, and mortality, and to look at population patterns and the socioeconomic
  and geographic distribution of these risks.

  Small Area Estimation (SAE). In response to a lack of policy-relevant data on the spatial inequality
  of WASH services, this initiative invested in research to develop methods for the small area
  estimation of WASH access. These build on methods used to estimate income poverty for
  small administrative areas, previously developed by Elbers, Lanjouw, and Lanjouw (2003) and
  referred to as the ELL approach. The Initiative piloted modern statistical methods (such as the
  Spatial Autoregressive Lag model) to exploit publicly available satellite imagery data combined
  with household survey data (such as those of the Demographic Health Surveys, DHS) to
  estimate WASH access in small areas (Fujii and Vander der Weide 2016). Application of this
  method was restricted to a pilot in Bangladesh and Nigeria, with an intention to roll it out to all
  countries covered by DHS. Similar small area estimation techniques were applied using a
  Bayesian model in Nigeria and Tanzania.

  Aside from distribution analysis, econometric methods were applied to unique datasets in
  individual countries. For example, panel data in Indonesia allowed the team to follow a sample
  of children through time and assess the nonlinear relationship between community-level



Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   79
             sanitation and these children’s height. In Bangladesh, econometric methods were used to
             assess the relationship between water salinity at source and the school attendance of girls
             (which was affected by the time required to fetch potable water). Likewise, econometrics were
             used to assess the relationship between E. coli contamination and the height of children using
             the 2013 Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey. In Niger, econometrics were used to
             assess the role of climatic shocks on health and the protective effect of access to WASH
             services.

             Finally, the initiative invested in a new way of thinking (at least for water sector practitioners)
             about service delivery. The aim is to frame problems so as to bridge the gap between the
             water sector and public sector management professionals (or governance professionals,
             broadly speaking) whose work is relevant to service delivery. This new way of thinking considers
             the political economy, the politics of service characteristics (Mcloughlin and Batley 2012;
             Mason, Batley, and Harris 2014), and the vertical assignment of functions and expenditure
             responsibilities (Boex et al. 2015; World Bank 2012). It employs a problem-driven approach
             (Teskey 2017).2 The initiative supports the idea of shifting from thinking about “best practice”
             solutions in influencing reforms to first understanding context. Importantly, this coincides with
             a focus on the functional problem rather that what development specialists think the form of
             service provision should look like.

             Specifically, the approach recognizes that there are distinct differences in how water and
             sanitation services are provided across contexts and geographical divides (including urban/
             rural). It is vital to understand a particular service, and the role of the state in providing that
             service. As such it is important to map and review the institutional arrangements and
             organizational structures, both on paper (de jure) and in practice (de facto), that are likely to
             influence service delivery. To understand the gaps between policy and implementation in
             the countries studied, the initiative considered: (i) weaknesses in oversight and accountability,
             (ii) weaknesses in intergovernmental arrangements, and (iii) weaknesses in capacity.

             The first two of these focus on the relationships between actors and institutions (that is, “the
             rules of the game”) and the third focuses on the capacity of organizations and entities. A fourth,
             political economy, involves the entire analysis. Because context matters, entry points for reform
             need to pass the test of being technically and politically feasible (that is, do they “go with the
             grain”? [Levy 2014]) if there is hope that reform agendas will be adopted by governments.

             This initiative builds on and utilizes an emerging way of thinking about development by starting
             with a specific problem and asking a range of questions regarding why services are failing. This
             will help understand why low equilibriums persist and what incentive structures support the
             status quo.

  Appendix B
  The WASH Poverty Risk Model
  This appendix is drawn from a background paper by Rheingans et al. (2017).


  Exposure—Service Levels for Water and Sanitation
  Under the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target for water and sanitation, access to
  these two services was classified as “improved” or “unimproved,” with progress on “improved”
  services contributing to progress in meeting the MDG target (WHO/UNICEF 2015). This binary
  classification of water and sanitation into “improved” and “unimproved” masks a gradient of
  ascending service levels that brings differing levels of health and other benefits. More recently,
  the water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector has moved to a “service ladder”
  approach that better describes water and sanitation access as a continuum of ascending
  levels assumed to bring ascending benefits. The new Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to
  “ensure access to water and sanitation for all” by 2030 goes beyond unimproved/improved to
  call for safely managed water and sanitation services.

  In understanding the risk posed by inadequate water and sanitation access to different groups
  it is important to consider multiple service levels or “exposure” scenarios that distinguish
  between, for example, improved sanitation and a sewered connection, and allow for different
  relative risks of a given health outcome for each exposure level. Many systematic reviews pool
  different WASH interventions to arrive at a single relative risk estimate for all interventions
  within a given category (water, sanitation, and hygiene) against a single counterfactual of “no
  intervention,” often failing to account for differences in service level and the control scenario
  (Fewtrell et al. 2005).

  Two previous efforts to assign relative risks (RRs) to various WASH exposure scenarios applied
  literature-based estimates to an ascending level of single and then multiple WASH services,
  but only distinguished between one or two levels of water and sanitation service (Prüss et al.
  2002; Cairncross and Valdmanis 2006). For the WASH Poverty Risk Model (PRM), exposure
  scenarios were adopted along with accompanying RR estimates proposed in a recent burden-
  of-disease analysis led by the World Health Organization (Prüss-Ustün et al. 2014). These RRs
  are based on a metaanalysis derived from a systematic review of various WASH interventions
  corresponding to the different exposure scenarios or service levels.

  For both water and sanitation, the World Bank’s Access Plus framework was considered in
  developing the service-level scenarios. In order for a particular water or sanitation service level
  to be included in the PRM analysis there are two criteria that must be met. First, there needs
  to be a published RR estimate for the service level based on a systematic review of the pooled
  analysis of appropriately designed studies. Second, household data from Demographic Health
  Surveys (DHS) or Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) should be used to estimate
  exposure—or coverage—at a given service level. Taking account of these two criteria, and a
  desire to align, where possible, with the Access Plus framework that informs question 2 posed
  by the WASH Poverty Diagnostic Initiative, three service levels are used for both water (table B.1)
  and sanitation (table B.2). These can be combined to describe a number of exposure scenarios
  with varying degrees of diarrheal disease (table B.3).

                                       Point-of-use water treatment scenarios are excluded due to the challenges of estimating
                                       adequate compliance and the questionable reliability of the RR estimates (Schmidt and
                                       Cairncross 2009). Therefore, only four of the six exposure scenarios are used: unimproved
                                       water, improved community source, basic piped and piped water, and piped water higher quality.
                                       It is important to include a piped, higher quality water service exposure category (piped, on-plot,
                                       continuous) as this corresponds to an optimal service level. However, the evidence of its role
                                       in underpinning the RR estimate is limited.


                                       Sanitation
                                       For sanitation, three exposure scenarios proposed by Wolf et al. (2014) were adopted
                                       (table B.2): unimproved sanitation (including open defecation), improved but no sewer (onsite),
                                       and sewer connection (reticulated, offsite). One limitation of these three scenarios is not
                                       distinguishing between open defecation and basic and unimproved on-site sanitation. While it
                                       has been assumed that any shift from open defecation to fixed point defecation is protective
                                       of diarrheal disease, recent experimental studies provide no evidence for this assumption
                                       (Clasen et al. 2014; Patil et al. 2014; Pickering et al. 2015).


                                       Combined Water and Sanitation
                                       Exposure Scenarios
                                       Previous efforts to create combined water and sanitation scenarios have either constructed
                                       models with literature-derived RR estimates for a limited number of WASH combined exposure
                                       scenarios (Prüss et al. 2002; Cairncross and Valdmanis 2006) or have used a post hoc
                                       method for combining multiple burden of disease estimates for clustered risk factors (Lim
                                       et al. 2012; Prüss-Ustün et al. 2014). For the WASH PRM, neither of these approaches would
                                       work well. There are insufficient rigorous epidemiological studies to derive reliable RRs for
                                       each combination of the water and sanitation exposure levels considered here. And, as the


86	                        Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals
  model includes various other factors that modify the relationship between WASH conditions
  and diarrheal disease (for example, undernutrition), Lim’s approach cannot be applied (Lim
  et al. 2012).

  Estimated RRs for combined water and sanitation scenarios were calculated by multiplying the
  literature-derived RRs (see tables B.1 and B.2). Table B.3 shows illustrative examples of the
  RRs for different scenarios combining various water and sanitation service levels. This approach
  assumes that the RRs of the individual interventions are independent, an assumption that can
  be tested in the validation analysis described below. This approach has a number of limitations.
  For example, some interventions lie on the same exposure pathway but interrupt transmission
  at different points. In this case, the effect may not be additive. However, the RR estimates
  compare well with previous literature-derived and modeled estimates, and they are consistent.


  Susceptibility
  The model includes a number of factors related to children’s susceptibility to diarrheal
  disease and associated death. These range from the acquisition of susceptibility-related
  micronutrients (zinc, Vitamin A) to effective treatment (for example, oral rehydration therapy,
  ORT). These are covered in more detail below and are selected based on the strength of
  evidence and inclusion in other diarrheal control frameworks. For some of these implicated
  susceptibility risk factors, the evidence is inconclusive as to whether or to what extent the
  factor affects the risk of infection given a level of exposure, the severity of illness, or the
  probability of mortality given infection. As a result, these factors are included as a combined
  Susceptibility Index (SusIndexi), which is designed to be proportional to the excess risk
  associated with all of the factors.

                               SusIndex i =   ∏ ∑ (RR
                                              k
                                                         j ,k   ⋅ RiskFactori, j ,k )
                                                  i, j

  Where RRj,k is the relative risk associated with the jth level of risk factor k, RiskFactori,j,k is the
  level of that risk factor for individual i. For some risk factors (for example, zinc supplementation
  and vitamin A supplementation) there are only two levels (yes or no) and RiskFactori,j,k serves
  as a dummy variable. For other risk factors, the levels are continuous.


  Undernutrition
  A number of studies have found associations between nutritional status and death due to
  diarrheal disease. There is an increasing understanding that undernutrition and diarrhea are
  connected in a cyclic feedback loop. In the context of this susceptibility index, the WASH PRM
  focuses on how undernutrition increases the likelihood of mortality from diarrhea. Additional
  effects of undernutrition on the risk of infection are not modeled. Caulfield et al. (2004) and
  Black et al. (2008) estimate the relative risk of cause-specific mortality (including diarrhea) for
  different levels of stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), and underweight
  (weight for age). Relative risks are estimated based on z-scores, with estimates for different
  levels (–1 to –2 SD, –2 to –3 SD, and less than –3 SD) compared with normal (greater than –1
  SD). For the WASH PRM, estimates are used for low weight for age on diarrheal mortality as a
  likely measure of long- and short-term undernutrition effects. RRs are reported for each level
  to estimate a piecewise linear risk function that provides a continuous estimate of excess risk
  as WFA z-scores decline.


  Zinc Supplementation
  Imdad et al. (2011) carried out a metaanalysis of the effect of zinc supplementation on
  diarrheal incidence and associated mortality. They found a significant reduction in incidence
  (RR=0.87; CI: 0.81, 0.94) and a nonsignificant reduction in mortality (RR=0.82, ns).


Reducing Inequalities in Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene in the Era of the Sustainable Development Goals	   87
             A 13 percent reduction is used in the estimates here. They found that this effect varied and
             was greatest in areas with zinc deficiency. Currently, this heterogeneity of effect is not accounted
             for in the PRM model. Other metaanalyses have examined the effects of therapeutic zinc
             treatment on diarrhea severity. Lamberti et al. (2013) observe a 26 percent reduction in the
             risk of diarrhea lasting more than three days (RR=0.74; CI:0.68-0.80). However, there are no
             conclusive studies on the effects of zinc treatment on diarrhea mortality when controlling for
             ORT use. Therefore, this effect is not included.


             Oral Rehydration Treatment (ORT)
             There is substantial evidence of the effect of ORT on the severity and duration of diarrhea.
             Based on 157 studies, Munos, Walker, and Black (2010) estimated a 93 percent reduction in
             mortality due to diarrhea with the use of ORT (packet and home remedy). This includes three
             studies reporting reduction in mortality and 153 reporting failure of treatment. The 93 percent
             reduction is based on modeling full coverage based on 69 percent reduction in the studies with
             a pooled coverage of 74 percent.

             For ORT, data are available only for children who have had a diarrheal episode in the previous
             two weeks. If analyses were restricted to these observations, the coverage of analyses
             would become very sparse, and there would be a likely bias or underestimation of the
             occurrence of diarrhea. As a result, rather than including whether a child received ORT for a
             recent diarrheal episode, WASH PRM estimates the propensity for receiving ORT given the
             household’s wealth quintile, maternal education, region, and child age. Values for children
             without a recent episode are imputed using a logistic regression model built on data from
             children who did have an episode. This offers a more widespread estimate of the likelihood
             of receiving ORT.


             Vitamin A
             Imdad et al. (2011) examined the effect of vitamin A supplementation on diarrhea-specific
             mortality, as well as outcomes related to pneumonia and measles. Based on 12 studies with
             data on diarrhea-specific mortality, they estimated a pooled effect of 30 percent reduction due
             to vitamin A supplementation (RR=0.70; CI: 0.58-0.86) among children 6–59 months of age.
             This estimate is incorporated in the WASH PRM model. An earlier metaanalysis found no effect
             of supplementation on the incidence of diarrhea (Grotto et al. 2003).


             Other Susceptibility Risk Factors
             Other risk factors that are associated with decreasing susceptibility to diarrhea that are not
             included in the WASH PRM model are exclusive breastfeeding, measles vaccination, and
             rotavirus vaccination. The reasons for omitting these susceptibility risk factors in the WASH
             PRM model include difficulty in assessing the alleviation of risk associated with these factors
             in relation to WASH.


             Combined Risk Index
             Susceptibility and exposure risks are combined in a risk index:

                                          RiskIndexi = ExpIndexi ⋅ SusIndexi

  Quantifying the Disease Burden
  The model provides a relative measure of the risk of diarrheal morbidity and mortality that
  can be compared across economic and geographic subpopulations. However, it does not
  provide an absolute measure of disease burden. This is done by combining risk model
  estimates with national burden estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project.
  These provide the overall envelope for diarrheal morbidity and mortality (as events and
  disability adjusted life years, DALYs), and the risk model provides an estimate of the
  distribution across the population.

  This can be expressed as:
                                                           RiskIndexi
                                 Burdeni = DALYBurden .
                                                           RiskIndexi

  where Burdeni is the individual burden for individual i, DALYBurden in the average population
  burden (from GBD), RiskIndexi is the Risk Index above for individual i, and RiskIndexi is the
  corresponding mean risk.

  Appendix D
  Service Characteristics
  This appendix provides two illustrative examples of how service characteristics affect the
  political salience of community sanitation and networked water.1 Table D.1 summarizes the
  typical differences between the two services.


  Nature of Good
  The nature of a good or service is determined by rivalry and excludability. A public good is both
  nonrival and nonexcludable; a private good is both rival and excludable. Public goods result in
  market failures or market underprovision, and thus require public intervention. Piped water
  supply is a private good, while community sanitation is a public good.

  A good is rival if one person’s use precludes another person from using it. Community sanitation
  is not particularly rivalrous. Networked water, however, has high rivalry in terms of access.
  Rivalry tends to lead to competition and variability of treatment, resulting in low client power
  and therefore lower political salience.

  A good is excludable if an individual can be prevented from accessing its benefits. This is also
  known as targetability. Community sanitation has low excludability, whereas there is a higher

             possibility of excluding users from a networked water system and targeting water services to
             particular individuals or groups. Political salience increases with excludability because it allows
             for the targeting of goods and services to certain constituents or clients—a useful tool to
             those seeking to garner political support.


             Market Failure
             Market failure characteristics provide the rationale for state intervention.

             Community sanitation has a low monopoly tendency, as the state and households tend to
             provide these services. Networked water has a strong tendency toward monopoly because the
             potential for scale economies and the large capital requirements often result in the dominance
             of a single utility. This leads to public provision and/or the need for economic regulation. Left
             unchecked, a monopoly tendency restricts the power of the clients by constraining their ability
             to “exit” from the service by choosing an alternative, and thereby reduces political salience.

             Positive and negative externalities result in under- and overprovision in the market respectively,
             as private players often do not see themselves as directly benefiting from social gains or being
             harmed by social losses. Community sanitation has large externalities related to public health
             that can only be internalized if the entire community becomes free of open defecation.
             Networked water also has high externalities related to the public health benefits of getting
             people connected to a safe, improved source of drinking water.

             Information asymmetries arise when users are limited in their ability to assess the quality of a
             good or service, constraining their ability to hold providers to account. Community sanitation
             faces medium-level information asymmetries because while individuals are aware of the
             service they are getting, there is also limited information about the services to which they are
             entitled. Information asymmetries are often high with regards to the quality of networked water,
             as contaminants often lack any discernable taste or smell, resulting in a need for strong
             regulation. However, information asymmetries are relatively low with regards to the quantity of
             networked water (hence the overall score of medium). Where information asymmetries are
             strong, citizens’ voices become weaker and policy makers can less clearly attribute the
             outcomes to their intervention, resulting in low political salience.


             Task
             Task-related characteristics influence the ability of users and the state to control and hold
             providers to account.

             Measurement and visibility of processes and outputs affect their attributability. Community
             sanitation is difficult to measure and has low visibility. Building new networked water pipes is
             a highly visible activity, resulting in its political salience and prioritization among many
             governments seeking to claim credit. O&M of existing infrastructure is less visible, often
             resulting in its neglect. Service providers can less easily attribute an outcome to their efforts
             if that outcome is harder to measure and observe, and therefore they have fewer incentives to
             provide that service, reducing its salience.

             Discretion of staff increases the difficulty of controlling frontline workers, particularly in their
             daily interactions with users. Community sanitation has low discretion, as tasks are easy to
             specify in advance. Discretion is theoretically low for networked water as the service tends to
             be standardized. However, in practice there may be scope for corruption in meter reading and
             for varying the quality of service, for example, through rationing, and thus overall there is a
             medium level of discretion. Where discretion is low, policy makers can exercise more control
             over the frontline provider, strengthening the compact and leading to higher political salience.

  Networked water supplies provided by a single utility are usually characterized by low transaction
  intensity, as there is minimal interaction between users and the utility. However, customer
  interaction may be useful for billing and collection. Depending on the particular scheme,
  community sanitation may result in more or fewer transactions between providers and users.
  Tasks that are more transaction intensive are more difficult to standardize and control, reducing
  their political salience.

  Provider autonomy is high for goods and services associated with highly specialized technical
  knowledge. The degree of specialized knowledge required for community sanitation tasks
  varies based on the level of service. Networked water engineers have a relatively high degree
  of provider autonomy. Where provider autonomy is high, policymakers are constrained in their
  ability to control service providers.


  Demand
  Demand characteristics affect how users and providers interact with one another.

  Demand for sanitation is frequent and predictable. Water demand also tends to be predictable
  and frequent, varying based on seasonality and labor patterns. When a service is both frequent
  and predictable, individuals live a shared experience, increasing the likelihood of collective
  action by users and therefore making the service more politically salient.

  Territoriality measures the extent to which there is a clear geographic delineation of users of a
  good or services. Community sanitation has high territoriality, as communities by definition are
  concentrated in a specific geographic area. Users who are connected to the same networked
  water supply also tend to be defined by a specific geographic area, resulting in high territoriality.
  Clear territoriality raises the likelihood of users regularly converging, interacting, mobilizing,
  and holding providers accountable, thereby strengthening political salience.
