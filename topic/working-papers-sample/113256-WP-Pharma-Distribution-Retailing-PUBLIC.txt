INTRODUCTION


Pharmaceutical usage is growing in emerging markets, primarily driven by three trends:




                                                                                                                                                   Photo © CEphoto, Uwe Aranas | Pharmacy in Chuanzhusi, China.
   1. Volume growth of inexpensive generic medicines
   used to treat chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer,
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and
   even HIV in a growing and aging population;

   2. Increased ability to pay for needed medicines
   through government programs, such as universal health
   coverage; and

   3. Rise of urban middle classes able to increase
   household spending on healthcare.




As this rising tide of medicines sweeps through emerging         such as improved availability of medicines and assurance
markets, there are challenges to sustaining growth at a level    of quality, along with the potential for lower mark-ups
that will enable all to access medicines.                        along the supply chain as the number of intermediaries

While affordability remains a concern, an often overlooked       fastest and most impactful ways of increasing supply chain

complex networks of importers, wholesalers, distributors,
sub-distributors, and amass of retail outlets, where there is
little visibility on what is being purchased and when. This
results in stock-outs and enables substandard medicines to
enter the supply chain.

In cases where supply chains do operate efficiently, private
sector investment in pharmaceutical distribution and
retailing can yield additional benefits to the consumer,

                                                                 believe there are four key areas that must be addressed.
Global pharmaceutical market growth is being driven by
emerging markets and can be explained by volume growth




       1. We suggest a reduction in the layers of distribution. The use of multiple sub-distributors increases the
       number of pricing mark-ups and in extreme cases leads to an exponential rise in the final price of medicine for
       consumers. Distributors often have deep relationships with sub-distributors, which makes dismantling layers of
       distribution difficult. Reducing these layers can also help limit incidents of corruption in the supply chain.

       2. It is important to introduce stronger competition, especially in private sector pharmaceutical
       distribution. Competition among a consolidated set of strong players can increase efficiency across the supply
       chain, cut the time it takes to deliver pharmaceuticals to consumers, and lower prices.

       3. More market-friendly regulations are key to driving improvements across pharmaceutical distribution
       and retail pharmacy systems in emerging markets. Regulators need to permit the consolidation of
       pharmaceutical distributors and retail pharmacies without reducing competition. They could also cap
       pharmaceutical distribution and retail pharmacy margins to protect consumers and increase their ability to buy
       life-saving medicines. Regulators need to increase enforcement capacity.

       4. Finally, technological innovation can increase transparency and efficiency across the pharmaceutical
       supply chain. Numerous innovations, ranging from mobile payment platforms, to devices connected to the
       internet, to drones could increase productivity. Technological innovation could have a notable impact in
       emerging markets with long-standing infrastructure deficiencies. Technology in such regions can ‘leapfrog’
       pain-points in the pharmaceutical supply chain.
