     SUMMARY
               EXECUTIVE
                                                                                                     Executive Summary
 is report seeks to further the body of disaster risk management (DRM) knowledge
Th
in Santa Catarina by identifying flood asset exposure risks and consequently empower
the state government and its institutions to include DRM practices and information in
their daily operations and decision-making processes, respectively. In this context, a novel
study was jointly designed and developed by the World Bank and Santa Catarina’s state
government with the ultimate aim to produce a state-level Catastrophe (CAT) model.

F
 ollowing a well-established methodological process, the team has endeavored a number
of activities that led to a successful and comprehensive CAT modeling as follows:

         A robust set of geo-spatial information plans were generated using national-
        •
         and state-level databases, which were compiled in a single information technol-
         ogy application.

         Residential and nonresidential models were developed to allow both the esti-
        •
         mation of building asset values and vulnerability to flooding events.

         A statewide flood model for different return periods was produced using avail-
        •
         able hydro-meteorological historical information and digital terrain and surface
         models. Climate scenarios were not considered as common assumptions used to
         define those would imply in a rather imprecise mathematical modelling attempt
         in the specific context of the CAT Model.

          A CAT model was derived using exposure, vulnerability, and flood models to
        •
          produce general metrics (for example, Aggregate Exceedance Probability [AEP],
          Occurrence Exceedance Probability [OEP], Exceedance Probability [EP], and
          Annual Average Loss [AAL]) to improve the state’s understanding of its asset and
          financial exposure to natural hazards.

 e novelty and depth of the study allowed the team to draw a number of potential policy
Th
implications and possible decision making to improve the state’s resilience to natural disas-
ters. To the best of the team’s knowledge, this is a first-of-its-kind study in Brazil and has po-
tential direct applications to a wide body of professions and institutions in Santa Catarina.
Finally, the proposed methodological approach was heavily based on the national census as
well as on commonly accessible hydro-meteorological data and topographic information to
ensure replicability in other Brazilian states or municipalities.

           houses were damaged, and R$112 million of public losses were registered (CEPED UFSC

              It
              Disaster response executed directly by the national government (instead of through transfers
              to the state) is not being considered as it was not possible to disaggregate the share of the
              disaster response funds (directly executed by the Federal Government of Brazil) allocated to
              each Brazilian state. However, the practice in many sectors is that the responsible line ministry
              transfers the response funds to the corresponding state-level secretariat, which then becomes
              the institution responsible for the planning, execution, and monitoring of the disaster re-
              sponse programs. Therefore, the execution of such funds is often included in the state budget.

               oreover, it is possible that more general budget lines containing projects related to disaster response
              M
              were not identified by the methodology that was employed. Therefore, given the limitations imposed
              by the nature of the available fiscal data, the fiscal variables presented in this section should be taken
              as proxies and as a basis for further in-depth analysis of the impacts of disasters on the state budget.

              Th
               e next step is to compare disaster response funds with disaster public damages and losses to
              investigate to what extent disaster response funding gaps are a recurrent issue in Santa Catarina.
              In light of fiscal data availability, it was rather difficult to carry out this analysis which was done
              only for the 2009-20146 period.

2. K nowledge Base for DRM Planning in Santa Catarina



         s previously presented, Santa Catarina is exposed to recurrent disaster events, among
        A
        which floods play a major role. The economic effects of such events as indicated by the
        historical damage and losses are significant and, at the same time, the state’s financial
        response capacity is still limited. While over the years, the state has shown significant
        progress in DRM practices and has been, in fact, a benchmark in the country, there
        is still room to significantly improve its DRM strategy. In this context and while the
        historical records discussed above are extremely valuable for DRM planning, adopting
        a forward-looking approach is paramount for the design and update of a DRM strategy
        based on the following pillars of action: (a) risk identification, (b) risk reduction, (c) pre-
        paredness, (d) financial protection, and (e) resilient recovery.

         ith the above DRM framework in mind, this study combines an investigation of the
        W
        historical patterns of natural hazards (and its effects) in Santa Catarina with a CAT flood
        risk model to deliver a state-level knowledge base for DRM planning. Figure 6 illustrates
        the proposed methodology used in the study, which is described as follows:

                 Step 1. Disaster data (each municipality must submit a form informing the char-
                •
                 acteristics of the disaster event) available through the Integrated Information Sys-
                 tem on Disasters was analyzed to identify disaster loss patterns at the state level.

                 Step 2. Geographic data was collected and analyzed for the state of Santa Cata-
                •
                 rina to generate information plans (geo-spatial layers) for a number of variables
                 to build the information base for the study.

                 Step 3. Residential and nonresidential exposure databases were created keeping
                •
                 the 2010 National Census as the main input to produce an estimation of built
                 area, construction patterns, and building costs.

	When simulating a flood event, the loss model is used to estimate the fraction of the total rainfall volume
  turned into direct runoff. The direct runoff is then routed to the catchment outlet using the unit hydrograph
  convolution in the routing model and, finally, the baseflow is added to the direct runoff to obtain total runoff.

            Two   main outputs were sought when building the exposure model: (a) residential exposure
            and (b) nonresidential exposure. Sample data from the 2010 National Census provides
            significant information on the characteristics of each household residency, allowing for
            relatively accurate estimation of construction patterns, standards, and cost of built unit.
            On the other hand, data on nonresidential buildings for the state was scarce. To overcome
            this lack of data, the nonresidential built volume and floor area in each census tract of Santa
            Catarina was estimated. Then the physical vulnerability of each construction pattern was
            estimated and each pattern was cross referenced to its replacement cost (see figure 9).

Nonresidential Exposure

 e estimation of the nonresidential built volume and floor area was performed at the census
Th
tract level, using the Digital Terrain Model and Digital Surface Model imageries of Santa
Catarina captured between 2011 and 2013, in conjunction with the August 2010 Census
(Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics [Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística,
IBGE]). The approach was to derive the built volume and floor area in each census tract using
the cell-level spot heights and then assemble the data at census tract level and subtract the
residential built volume and floor area (estimated from the census 2010 data) to derive the
estimated nonresidential built volume and floor area in each census tract of Santa Catarina.

I
 nitially a feasibility study was carried out in a part of Florianopolis (7 weighting areas
containing 143 census tracts), where the methodology and various hypotheses were de-
veloped and tested out. Then the methodology described above was applied across all the
census tracts of Santa Catarina, which was possible in 10,029 (82 percent) of the 12,227
existing census tracts. The remaining census tracts could not be analyzed either because
of a problem in the weighting area boundaries shape file of IBGE (concerning 412 census
tracts) or because spot height data were not available (concerning 1,786 census tracts).
The 10,029 analyzed census tracts contain 91 percent of the Santa Catarina population.

 e next step was an investigation into the susceptibility of the nonresidential structures
Th
within the state. This involved a manual survey of 100 buildings, undertaken through
Google Street View®, which encompassed urban, suburban, and rural areas. In each case,
areas were chosen at random within three representative cities across the state. This analy-
sis was intended to provide quantitative data to support or disprove the heroic assumption
that there was a 50/50 split of susceptibility types.

 lthough 100 properties represent a relatively small sample size in proportion to the total rele-
A
vant building stock within the state, the survey sample was deemed satisfactory to establish an
initial assessment. The results obtained were stable when the sample size was halved. After the
100 observations were taken, no additional sampling was carried out as the established results
did not vary significantly enough from the even split ratio assumption to warrant further
investigation and because the impact on the loss modeling results would be very negligible.

Th
 e buildings chosen were all located within areas that were within the extent of the flood
model footprint and deemed to be at risk of flooding by at least the 10,000-year return peri-
od flood. In each location, the first nonresidential building identified upon entering Google
Street View was selected for the analysis. Subsequently, a new, nearby location was chosen
and the process was repeated. For each nonresidential building, the following information
was recorded: (a) door material, (b) interior quality, and (c) number of stories (1, 2, or 3+).

W
 ith such information, the susceptibility of nonresidential buildings was defined as high, medi-
um, or low (see table 3). This decision was based on an analysis of the interior characteristics (to the
extent to which this was possible) and then related to the most appropriate vulnerability curves.

 dding information on the exposure of buildings to the flood maps is relevant, for ex-
A
ample, to institutions in charge of allocating disaster risk reduction infrastructure in-
vestment. Thus, by knowing the value and the features of the assets located in the areas
prone to floods, policy makers can be better informed about the target beneficiaries of
such interventions and perform cost-benefit considerations before proceeding with in-
vestment decisions. From a social development viewpoint, the exposure module can be
useful in profiling settlements exposed to flood risk and identifying critical areas where
households are exposed to recurrent (low return period) events so specific programs can
be designed for lower income.

W
 hile the hazard and exposure models are sufficient to indicate the areas and assets at
risk, determining the proportion of damage as a function of the building typology and
type of adverse events is part of the vulnerability analysis. Such a step is crucial as the level
of damage as a function of natural events will provide the means to adopt soft and hard
measures to manage disaster risks and therefore increase social and economic resilience.

V
 ulnerability in this context is an expression of the tendency of an element or a set of ele-
ments to suffer physical damage when subjected to a disaster event. It allows the intensity
of the hazard to be translated into an estimated level of physical damage based on estab-
lished understandings of the fragility of the element or the component set of elements.
The model combines information from the flood hazard and exposure modeling stages,
and produces a new result—the likely mean cost to replace or repair the asset given the
flood event’s intensity, in this particular case, depth of floods.

 is study focused solely on the structural vulnerability of buildings and the financial
Th
losses associated with their damage because of flood hazards. It did not consider the
contents within buildings, the welfare of the inhabitants, or the wider economic conse-
quences of flooding through factors such as business interruption.

 s a common practice, it was assumed that the impact of a hazard would not be equal
A
in all cases. The impact is highly dependent on the physical characteristics of the asset at
any given location. Additionally, some property construction types are more vulnerable
to flooding (for example, a flood event will affect a low-set single storey building to a
much greater extent than a high set multistory building—relative to the total value of
the asset). Finally, mathematical modeling tools and limitations allow for a generalized
approach toward physical damage estimation as flood models cannot anticipate the angle
of impact, energy release, and debris influence, among others.

 rough extensive research, the vulnerability of various property types in Brazil was determined
Th
and appropriate damage vulnerability curves were produced. Then we generated vulnerability
functions that describe the overall ratio of damage that could occur to a property as a percentage
of the total reinstatement cost. This indicates the amount of damage and resultant losses that
may occur to a given property type at different hazard intensity levels. In other words, the rela-
tionship between event intensity and damage is described in the vulnerability curve.

 n spite of the models developed and previously presented, we still did not have a projec-

through the CAT risk model. Box 2 presents the commonly adopted terminologies for
the sake of interpreting the results from any given CAT model.



       Box 2. Terminologies Used for the CAT Model R esults

       Aggregate Exceedance Probability (AEP) represents the probability
       that the total cost of all events within a year will combine to exceed a
       certain threshold. These figures should be used when assessing gross
       loss ratios. Bigger flood events occur (and are exceeded) less often and
       will therefore have a lower annual probability.

       - Occurrence Exceedance Probability (OEP) is the possibility that
       the most costly event in any one year will exceed a certain threshold.
       These figures are more relevant for CAT excess of loss reinsurance but
       were calculated in the analysis and thus are included for information.

       Note that AEP and OEP refer to a loss being exceeded, and not the
       exact loss itself. This approach is favored for CAT modeling, as it is
       beneficial to identify attachment or exhaustion probabilities, calculate
       expected losses within a given range, or to provide benchmarks for
       comparisons between risks or over time. Calculating the probability
       of an exact financial loss is therefore of little value.

       - Exceedance Probability (EP) curve communicates the probability of
       any given financial loss being exceeded. This may be based on AEP or
       OEP. It shows the likelihood of having either aggregate annual losses
       (AEP) or a single event (OEP) in excess of a given amount.

       - Annual Average Loss (AAL) represents an average sum of the annu-
       al losses calculation. It is the mean value of a loss EP distribution. It
       represents the expected loss per year, averaged over many years. The
       one-year return period loss is expected to be equaled or exceeded every
       year. Its EP is therefore 100 percent.

         e OEP result shows that the most costly event in any given year will exceed a certain
        Th
        threshold. Therefore, based on these results there is a 0.01% chance that the most costly
        event in any given year will generate losses of R$2.3 billion or more.

        n the context of this study, the CAT model results can also be used as a baseline to
        I
        update the state-level strategy for financial protection against natural hazards. Based on
        the EP curve previously presented, it is possible to carry out scenario-based analysis of
        potential future funding gaps and, based on it, establish a portfolio of sources of fund
        that is adequate for the state’s risk profile.

         oreover, besides the state-level EP curves, similar analysis were carried out at the mu-
        M
        nicipality level, which means that based on the CAT model it is possible to have a gen-
        eral picture of how flood risk is spatially distributed across the state. Table 3 provides a
        ranking of Santa Catarina’s municipalities which have AAL’s greater than R$10 million.

        A
        losses. These are also among the most populous municipalities in the state and, conse-
        quently, with more exposed assets and infrastructure. However, it is worth noting the
        counter-intuitive AAL for the municipality of Palhoça. Despite it is not being among the
        cities with a meaningful disaster history, the CAT model ranked the city as the second
        at the state. In this context, we would like to highlight the need to complement any
        modeling endeavor with field surveys to allow for a better assessment of whether (i) the
        flood model was not able to capture specific geographical features, or (ii) the exposure
        model was limited or erroneous, which can lead to a misleading CAT modelling attempt.

        Potential modeling limitations might be related to lack of information on risk mitigation

In addition, the products generated by this study were fully integrated into a geo-spatial application
(Smart Risk Profiling) that allows specific queries to be performed by end users according to their indi-
vidual needs (see figure 8). Such an initiative aimed at not only allowing for additional queries/analyses
than the ones usually addressed in studies of this nature, but also to be a repository for DRM products
at both national and subnational levels. Hence, a common platform for integration was developed, which
will ensure continuity and sustainability of the numerous initiatives led by different institutions in Brazil.

Complementarily, the level of detail of the study allows for both macro and microplanning as well as
localized decision-making. For example, based on the localized flood maps produced, (see map 3) it is
possible to identify low-risk areas for public or private investments or select high-risk areas to receive
disaster risk reduction investments. Geo-spatial products can also be used as inputs in developing pre-
paredness strategies as the flood depth and event recurrence are useful information to guide state insti-
tutions to better address risk mitigation and disaster preparedness in areas exposed to natural hazards.

         is section summarizes the findings and potential application of the Santa Catarina
        Th
        Disaster Risk Profile as well as from its specific products. As initially envisaged, the study
        aimed at providing knowledge to Santa Catarina’s various institutions to contribute to-
        ward improved DRM.

         n this backdrop, macro and complex state activities such as planning and investment
        I
        decisions would benefit from additional strategic information on DRM that could lead
        to DRM informed decision making. Hence, the following potential applications (not a
        comprehensive list) from the study can be highlighted to the Santa Catarina state gov-

 Future work is recommended to further explore the linkage between flooding
•
 and slope instability, as high rainfall intensities are linked to landslides as ob-
 served in the 2008 events;

 Pluvial (surface water) flooding has not been considered in this study and it
•
 is advised that this could be studied in future projects. Significant additional
 exposure to loss could be detected taking into consideration such an approach.
 Once a pluvial model is created, additional work could be enabled by exploring
 how site drainage can be improved to mitigate flooding through the use of
 Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems and macro-drainage plans;

 Tidal flood risk should also be considered given the high development in San-
•
 ta Catarina’s coastal areas. Although the state has a limited tidal range, the
 flat and wide coastal land could mean that the impacts of meteorological tid-
 al flooding might be significant. Hence, a study investigating the impacts of
 storm surges could identify additional risk locations along the coast; and

 It is also recommended that climate change be considered. Over time, climate
•
 change could lead to rises in sea level, more frequent tidal storm surges, and
 potentially increases (or decreases) in rainfall, which will alter the risk profile
 in the longer term. Coupled with this, a further study of climatic oscillations
 could identify periods when the likelihood of flooding in any given year is
 higher and therefore ex ante decisions could be made to reduce the impacts.

A Catastrophe (CAT) model is an automated model that generates a set of simulated events. Each simulation
  carries estimations of the magnitude, intensity, and location of an event to determine the amount of dam-
    age and calculate the probable loss as a result of an extreme event. (Lloyd’s Market Association 2013).
