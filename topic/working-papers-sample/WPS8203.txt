    I.       Introduction

Croatia is committed to a fiscal consolidation agenda in the context of its National Reform
Program, aimed at achieving sustainable economic growth, increased employment, and the
reduction of macroeconomic imbalances. As part of that effort, the government has recently
designed and begun to implement a set of tax reforms and aims to align the education sector with
labor market needs, improve the sustainability of the health care and pension systems, and improve
the efficiency of the social benefit system, with the goal of reducing the number of persons at risk
of poverty and social exclusion (National Reform Plan, 2017).2 Given the potential tradeoffs in
terms of meeting fiscal consolidation and social inclusion goals, comprehensive empirical analysis
of the distributional impact of changes in taxes and social spending can help to inform policy by
ensuring that the combination of policies recently implemented and policies being envisaged
achieve the goals laid out by the government.

In this context, work on the role of fiscal policy in Croatia has recently expanded significantly.
Early work using 2007 data highlighted the relatively high pre-fiscal income inequality in Croatia
and despite the relatively large redistributive effect of the policies, these were still less
redistributive compared to Slovenia (Čok et al., 2012). In particular, earlier work using data for
2010 emphasized the fact that horizontal inequities arising from the benefit system dampened to
some extent the redistributive role of fiscal policy (Urban 2014 and 2016). More recent work has
been done in the context of a broader effort to build microsimulation models in the EU through
EUROMOD (Urban and Bezeredi, 2016). This analysis includes the distributional impact of
changes in subsistence and means tested benefits undertaken in 2014, as well as changes in
personal income taxes in 2015. The results suggest that these policies led to an overall increase in
average household disposable income, driven by changes in the increase in personal income tax
allowances. Nevertheless, the main beneficiaries were people located in the upper and middle part
of the income distribution (Urban and Bezeredi, 2016). Similarly, analysis of subsequent changes
that entered into force in 2017 found only slight increases in disposable income in the middle of
the distribution, while most of the gain was concentrated in the top two deciles. As a result, both
the 2015 and the 2017 reforms somewhat increased income inequality (European Commission,
2017).

However, the existing analysis has so far not included the redistributive effects of indirect taxation,
despite the fact that it makes up about half of total tax collections and imposes a relatively large
burden on the population. In addition, most studies do not include the impact of spending on
education and health, despite the fact that they make up more than 40 percent of total social
spending, and are at the root of the National Reform Plan. Finally, existing studies have not focused

on the impact of taxes and spending on poverty. This is important, as a system could reduce
inequality but still lead to greater poverty levels.

This paper aims to move a step in this direction by presenting a more comprehensive analysis of
the distributional impact of taxes and social spending in Croatia. Building on existing work, the
analysis covers the impact of the contributory pension system, direct taxes and transfers. In
contrast to previous studies, this work also includes the impact of value added and excise taxes, as
well as the impact of education and health spending. The analysis assesses the progressiveness of
each fiscal instrument and its contribution to poverty and inequality reduction. The approach
follows the Commitment to Equity (CEQ) approach (Lustig, 2017), allowing for comparisons
between Croatia with other countries where the CEQ methodology has been applied.3

The results suggest that the existing system leads to higher levels of poverty, mostly on account of
indirect taxes. In fact, only the poorest 10 percent of the population receive more in benefits than
what they pay in taxes. Starting from a relatively low level of market income inequality, the
Croatian direct tax and transfer system is redistributive, with progressive and inequality-reducing
direct taxes and transfers, in line with other European countries, and more so than other developing
countries. However, indirect taxes are regressive and inequality-increasing, so much so that the
redistributive power of direct taxes and transfers is offset. With regards to in-kind transfers, when
the value of education and health are included in the analysis, there is an important redistributive
effect, mostly on account of primary education.

In terms of the recent changes to taxes implemented, the analysis finds that both direct and indirect
taxes became more progressive in 2017 compared to 2014. However, since most of the tax relief
accrued to the top of the income distribution, the redistributive impact of personal income taxes
and social security contributions was reduced. As a result, inequality after taxes and transfers is
expected to increase slightly in 2017 compared to 2014. However, when it comes to poverty, the
impact of a lower VAT on electricity and utility bills is expected to be poverty reducing, however
this effect is small relative to the relief that is needed. Finally, a simulation of a reduction in the
standard VAT rate from 25 to 24 percent is presented, yielding a small decline in inequality and a
0.21 percentage point decline in relative poverty at a cost of about 0.41 percent of GDP. Depending
on the sources of financing for such a measure, this impact may be much smaller.

The analysis is built on 2014 household surveys collected by the Croatian Bureau of Statistics,
data from National Income Accounts, and public finance accounts from the Ministry of Finance,
Ministry of Health and Ministry of Science and Education. In terms of coverage of components of
fiscal policy, the analysis includes 50 percent of tax revenue and 49 percent of government
spending. The analysis does not cover the corporate profit tax or VAT paid by government or other
institutions as these are difficult to assign to individual households based on the available
information. On the spending side, the analysis only covers social spending, as it is very difficult

identifying veterans, we are unable to identify veteran benefits separately, but these are included
as part of total pensions and disability benefits.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the structure of taxes and
social spending in Croatia, followed by the general methodology, the data used and assumptions
made in estimating the taxes paid by households and the benefits received. Section IV describes
the overall impact of fiscal policy on poverty and inequality. The incidence of taxes and spending
are presented in section V, followed by simulations of recent tax changes in section VI and
discussion of alternative reforms in section VII. Section VIII concludes.


   II.     The structure of taxes and social spending in Croatia: 2014

The Croatian Public Finance System

Public finance in Croatia consists of the central and local governments and public enterprises.
Social security funds are part of the central government and include the Croatian Pension Insurance
Institute, the Croatian Health Insurance Fund and the Croatian Employment Service. The structure
of tax revenues in Croatia is shown in Table 1.

Indirect taxes made up about 68 percent of the total tax collection of the general government in
2014, with the bulk of indirect taxes collected from VAT (Table 1). Our analysis focused on the
major tax items, namely personal income taxes, VAT, excise, and beverage taxes. These items
made up about 83 percent of all tax revenue in 2014. Corporate taxes were not included given the
difficulty of attributing the tax burden to specific households.

Direct taxes and social insurance contributions

Personal income tax (PIT) revenues accounted for 3.6 percent of GDP in 2014, which was shared
between the central, regional and local self-governments. The PIT applies to employment earnings,
income from self-employment, pensions, rental income, some forms of capital income (including
rental, interest and dividend income). The personal income tax (PIT) system is an individual
system, with spouses being assessed independently. The income tax brackets of the PIT were
reduced from three (12, 25 and 40 percent) in 2011-2015, to two rates in 2017 (24 and 36 percent)
and the basic personal allowance was significantly increased (from a threshold of HRK 2,600 to
HRK 3,800). Other changes in the PIT include a more progressive scale for expanding the personal
allowance for dependent children and other supported family members (see Appendix 1 for details
of the tax and spending system).

In addition, a surtax is paid by PIT taxpayers to local self-governments using the amount of PIT
as the tax base. Local self-governments set the level of the rate with some restrictions. The

and 15 percent in cities with a population over 30,000, except for Zagreb, where the current rate
is 18 percent and could increase to a maximum of 30 percent.

In terms of social contributions, the 2002 reform of the Croatian pension system introduced three
pillars: (i) intergenerational solidarity, (ii) mandatory individual savings, and (iii) voluntary
individual savings. Savings in the second and third pillars are collected by private pension funds.
Two parallel contributory schemes were created: scheme A for people who participate in pillar 1
only, and scheme B for people who participate both in pillar 1 and pillar 2.4 Persons who were
aged above 50 (below 40) in January 2002 were automatically enrolled into scheme A (B), while
people aged between 40 and 50 were able to choose to become members of scheme A or B. People
in scheme A pay a 20 percent contribution to pillar 1 only; these contributions are called Pension

    The terminology for scheme “A” and scheme “B” is taken from Urban and Bezeredi (2016).


                                                                                                                                       5
contributions A. Correspondingly, people in scheme A receive pension from pillar 1 only. People
in scheme B pay contributions to both pillars 1 (a 15 percent “pension contribution B1”) and 2 (a
“5 percent pension contributions B2”).

Social contributions amounted to 12.7 percent of GDP in 2014, of which old-age pensions was the
largest, amounting to 7.4 percent of GDP and health contributions amounted to 5.1 percent of
GDP. Social contributions are paid by wage and self-employed workers based on different
contribution bases. For wage earners, the social contributions base is equal to the gross
employment earnings. Employer social contributions include a 15 percent general health
contribution, a 0.5 percent occupational health contribution, and a 1.7 percent employment
contribution. Employee social contributions include old-age pension contributions of 20 percent.
For the self-employed, the contribution base is not income related, but instead is a lump-sum
obtained as a percentage of the average gross wage of the previous year which ranges from 35 to
110 percent depending on the occupation. Self-employed persons pay the same general health,
occupational health, employment, and old-age pension contributions as wage workers. Those
earning other income (rents, dividends, interest) also pay old-age pension contributions based on
the gross income amount, while the purchaser of services pays the relevant health contributions.
Pensioners pay a special pensioner health contribution at two different rates, depending on the
monthly gross pension.

Indirect taxes

VAT is the single largest component of tax revenue, contributing to about 50 percent of total tax
collection in 2014. VAT is levied at a standard rate of 25 percent on most goods and services, a
13 percent reduced rate applies to accommodation and restaurant services, edible oils and fats,
baby food, delivery of water, concerts tickets, culture/art magazines, etc., while a minimum rate
of 5 percent applies to bread, milk, educational books, medical drugs, newspapers, cinema tickets,
scientific journals. With the 2017 reform, VAT rates remained unchanged, but categories of goods
and services were shifted across rates. In particular, the reduced rate of 13 percent is now being
applied to inputs in agriculture, electricity and utility services with the objective of supporting
small farmers and households. On the other hand, food and drink services were moved from the
reduced to the general rate.

Excise taxes contributed 3.6 percent of GDP in 2014 and are levied on goods that are deemed to
be a harmful to the health of the population or create pollution (“sin taxes”). These include: motor
vehicles for personal use, coffee products, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, tobacco
products, energy products and electricity. Finally, beverages taxes contributed 0.3 percent of GDP
in 2014 and were applied to providers of bar and restaurant services. The tax base is the sales
revenue from served beverages.

Social spending

Overall expenditures in Croatia amounted to 48 percent of GDP in 2014, up from 45 percent in
2008, but have since declined (Eurostat). A large part of public spending is dedicated to social
protection (14.2 percent of GDP), while education (4.3 percent of GDP) and health (5.6 percent of
GDP) are also relatively important (Table 2). Total social spending in Croatia amounted to 24
percent of GDP or 50 percent of total spending. The analysis presented below covers 45 percent
of all government spending and 91 percent of social spending. In what follows, we describe the
main highlights of existing social spending. Direct (non-contributory) transfers include the
following programs.

      Family benefit programs, including a one-time grant for newborn children received by all
       parents of newborn children and a child benefit, which is a means-tested benefit received
       by a parent or other person taking care of one or more children with substantial top-ups for
       households with three and four or more children. Supplements are also given for children
       without one or both parents and for children with health challenges.

      Social assistance programs include a subsistence benefit which became a guaranteed
       minimum benefit in 2014. It is a means-tested benefit intended for households whose
       income is below a basic needs threshold and depends on the characteristics and
       composition of the household. There is also a housing benefit, funded and distributed by
       local self-governments, and is a means-tested benefit that covers the costs of rent,
       electricity, gas, heating, water, and other housing bills for subsistence-benefit recipients.
       Local governments determine the income test and benefit amounts, with a maximum of 50
       percent of the amount of Subsistence benefit. The recipients of the subsistence benefit also
       have the right to claim the benefit for covering wood-heating costs, which is also
       administered and financed by local governments. Finally, there is a lump-sum assistance,
       which is a purpose-defined benefit received by a household for covering the costs related
       to transportation, education, clothing, child birth, funeral expenses (Urban and Bezeredi,
       2016).

      Programs for Croatian Defenders of the Homeland War include old-age pension
       supplement, disability pensions, orthopedic allowances, constant care supplement, survivor
       benefits and child benefits for surviving children. Beneficiaries are persons who
       participated in the organized armed defense in the period from August 1990 to June 1996.
       Disabled veterans (HRVIs) are categorized into 10 groups according to the level of bodily
       impairment sustained during the war, ranging from 20 to 100 percent impairment.
       Unfortunately, it is impossible to identify beneficiaries using the existing household
       surveys, so this is not included in the analysis.

          Local government benefits. Most local governments provide additional lump-sum grants
           for newborn children, cash supplements to low income groups (pensioners, disabled,
           unemployed), subsidies for transportation costs for vulnerable groups (pensioners,
           unemployed, people with disability, school children, etc.), lump-sum benefits and food
           packages for the poor, and benefits for students (grants, subsidies for school books, school
           meals).

Social spending on in-kind transfers in the form of education and health amounted to 10 percent
of GDP in 2014. Kindergartens, primary schools, and secondary schools are financed by central,
regional and local governments, however the bulk of spending on wages is funded by the central
government (World Bank, 2008). The education system is mostly public in Croatia (private
expenditure on education is small at all levels of education).

Health services are provided through the Croatian Health Insurance Fund (HZZO), which is
financed from health contributions and the government budget. Although health contributions
constitute the budget of HZZO, a large part of total health care expenditures are paid for from the
state budget. Dependent family members are insured through other family members who pay
contributions, and certain vulnerable groups, such as older pensioners and people with very low or
no income, are exempted from paying contributions, yet insured nevertheless. The basic health
insurance, which is compulsory, covers about 80 percent of costs of health risks. The basic
“basket” of health care services includes: primary care, specialized care, inpatient services, drugs
from the HZZO’s list, health care while abroad, dental care, and orthopedic and other appliances.
The remaining 20 percent is paid by patients themselves through out-of-pocket outlays, with a
certain upper limit. The HZZO offers the ‘supplemental’ health insurance: for a fixed monthly fee,
one gets an extension of the basic basket of services which covers a part of the 20 percent of costs
not covered by the basic insurance.


    III.      Data sources, method, and assumptions

Data sources
Data for 2014 were used to conduct this incidence analysis study in line with the availability of
survey data. Specifically, we used both the Croatian Household Budget Survey (HBS) for 2014
and the Population Income Survey (PIS) for 2015, which refers to 2014 income.5 The HBS
contains both income and expenditure data, along with demographic and household characteristics,
thus enabling the identification of indirect taxes across the distribution. However, the HBS does
not have the level of detail on income and benefits received available in the PIS, nor a large enough

5
  The PIS serves as the basis for the EU-SILC for Croatia, which aggregates some of the categories to arrive at a
database that is harmonized with other European countries. We used the 2015 PIS, because the survey asks
respondents to report their incomes from the previous year (2014, which is of our interest here).


                                                                                                                    9
sample size to ensure that a sufficiently large variation in household types was captured to assign
and interpret the impact of particular taxes and benefits. As a result, the analysis is primarily based
on the PIS. In order to capture the impacts of indirect taxes on consumption, the analysis employed
survey-to-survey imputation to assign consumption to each household, as detailed in Appendix 2.

Household survey data are combined with data from National Income Accounts and public finance
accounts from the Ministry of Finance. This included information on consolidated central
government budgets, Local government budgets, and annual reports from the Central Bureau of
Statistics on various sectors.

Approach
To analyze the incidence of each fiscal intervention, and the impact of taxes and social spending
on poverty and inequality, we follow the Commitment to Equity (CEQ) approach of Lustig (2017)
and measure per capita income before and after each fiscal intervention as described in Figure 1.
In particular, for every household we define the following income concepts:

       Market income includes pre-tax and pre-contribution wages, salaries, and income earned
        from capital assets (rent, interest or dividends) and private transfers.
       Disposable income is constructed by adding direct transfers and subtracting direct taxes
        and social contributions to market income. The direct taxes considered in the case of
        Croatia include personal income taxes, surtaxes, taxes on vessel, road motor vehicles and
        vacation homes.
       Consumable income subtracts indirect taxes from disposable income. In Croatia, indirect
        taxes included in this analysis include the VAT, excises on alcohol and tobacco, fuel and
        automobiles, and other indirect taxes (not classified as VAT or excises).
       Final income adds in-kind benefits in the form of health and education to consumable
        income.

One area where there is no clear consensus in the literature is on how to treat contributory old-age
pensions and the related contributions. Arguments exist in favor of treating contributory pensions
as individual savings or deferred income, while others argue that they should be treated as a
government transfer, with the related contributions being treated as a direct tax. Following Lustig
(2017), we present three scenarios. Under our “main” scenario we treat old-age pensions as
deferred income, and the corresponding contributions are treated as savings. In an alternative
scenario, contributory old-age pensions are treated as transfers and added to market income. The
corresponding contributions are treated as taxes and thus subtracted from market income to
generate disposable income, in line with standard EU measurement of disposable income. Finally,
in a third scenario in which the first pillar of the pension system (the pay-as-you-go pillar) is treated
as a transfer, while the second pillar is treated as deferred saving. The alternative scenarios are
presented in Appendix 3.

Assumptions
We assume that the economic incidence of direct taxes and contributions are borne entirely by the
income earner. Since personal income taxes (PIT) and social security contributions across
households are not directly identified in the household survey, the burden of these had to be
simulated according to the tax legislation and contribution rules as detailed in Appendix 1.
Statutory rates are used throughout the analysis. To the extent that informality in the payment of
PIT and social contributions is high in Croatia, the distributional impacts could differ and the
analysis is closer to an analysis of the de jure impact of policies. The analysis could further be
refined under alternative scenarios on informality.

Social contributions are simulated only for individuals who reported that these were paid (either
by employers in the case of wage workers or by themselves in the case of self-employed). The
only exception is for people involved in farming/fishery/hunting/forestry, who report social
contributions directly. For this group, the survey has no information that would distinguish each
type of social security contribution. It is only possible to distinguish between pension contributions
and other, non-pension contributions (general health, occupational health, employment). In terms
of applying PIT allowances, only wage earners and pensioners report the number of children and
adults they declare for purposes of the allowance. For other individuals, who were not asked to
report the number of dependent family members declared for purposes of the allowance, we
assume there are no family members who qualify to be used for increasing the allowance, and then
take into account the amount of tax returned to them based on the yearly tax return which they all
are assumed to submit. In terms of the surtax, each local government sets the corresponding rate.
However, given the lack of information for each of the 127 cities and 428 municipalities, the surtax
rate is assumed to be identical for all households and equal to the population-weighted average of

                                                                                                   11
the surtax rates across all the municipalities and cities, including those with zero surtax rate. The
calculated rate is estimated at 8.79 percent.

The burden of indirect taxes is assumed to be borne entirely by the consumer. The burden of
indirect taxes was estimated by applying statutory rates to the detailed consumption data in the
HBS, which were mapped into the Croatian Classification of Goods and Services for which VAT
rates are defined. Note that as in most household surveys, total consumption of households in HBS
using the weights provided by the National Statistics Office amount to 77 percent of total
household consumption reported in National Accounts. No assumptions about informality are
made, such that using statutory rates, the amount of VAT calculated using the HBS constitutes 67
percent of total tax collections paid by the households. For excise taxes, we apply statutory rates
to consumption of alcohol, tobacco, fuel and automobiles identified in the HBS to estimate the
direct burden of these excises on households. Once the burden of each of these taxes was estimated,
we followed the survey-to-survey imputation technique detailed in Appendix 2 to assign indirect
tax burdens to households in the PIS. For both direct and indirect taxation, we employ statutory
rates.6

On the spending side, the PIS provides detailed information on who received payment from
contributory and non-contributory social protection programs. In terms of contributory benefits,
family benefits including the maternity and parental benefits are identified in the survey. Similarly,
unemployment, disability, sickness, survival, caregiver, housing and other benefits can be
identified in the survey. In terms of non-contributory benefits, family benefits including the one-
time grant for newborn children and the child benefit are directly identified in the survey.
Similarly, social assistance benefits, including the subsistence, housing and lump-sum benefits are
directly identified. Since these benefits are not taxable, the reported value can be directly used.
Unfortunately, there is no way to identify beneficiaries of the programs for Croatian Defenders of
the Homeland War (HBDR/HRVI) or beneficiaries of local government transfers. These benefits
are therefore not included in the analysis.

The approach to estimate the incidence of public spending on education followed here is the so-
called “benefit or expenditure incidence” or the “government cost” approach. In essence, we
calculate per beneficiary input costs by level of education from government spending and the
number of pupils in each level and assign the per pupil expenditure to each student. This approach
is also known as the “classic” or “non-behavioral approach”, and it amounts to asking the following
question: how much would the income of a household have to be increased if it had to pay for the

  This assumption could be modified to incorporate the possibility of informality by using an effective tax rate as
opposed to the statutory rate. However, there seems to be under-reporting of incomes in the PIS household survey,
which may to some extent reflect this informality. Further work to assess this aims to use household consumption
instead of income as a point of departure will aim to better assess potential levels of informality.

Since the education system is mostly public at all levels of education in Croatia and there is no
evidence of wide-spread opting-out of public education, benefits were assigned to households
according to the number of children attending each level of education, according to the cost-per-
pupil of delivering education service at each level. For health services, all individuals have access
to services, so we use the cost of insurance approach and assign a per capita benefit equally to all
individuals. This is to ensure that sicker individuals are seen as being “better off”, simply because
they use public services more often.

There are some important caveats about what the fiscal incidence analysis applied here does not
address. First, it does not take into account behavioral, lifecycle or general equilibrium effects and
focuses on average incidence rather than incidence at the margin. Our tax shifting and labor supply
response assumptions are strong because they imply that that consumers have perfectly inelastic
demand and that labor supply is perfectly inelastic too. Second, the analysis does not take into
account the intra-household distribution of consumption. Third, the analysis cannot take into
account the quality of services delivered by the government. In addition, we are unable to include
some important taxes and spending. Corporate profit taxes, VAT paid by government or
institutional consumption, and spending on infrastructure investments are excluded, even though
the impacts of these may be substantial simply because the methods to assign these taxes and
transfers are not robust. Finally, the analysis does not capture the growing debate on how asset
accumulation and returns to capital impacts income inequality.

transfers and pensions in Pillar II are treated as deferred income, the Gini for market income,
including pensions is 0.391. Once direct taxes, social security contributions and noncontributory
transfers are accounted for, we end up with a measure of disposable income that has a Gini of
0.325 in all three scenarios. Indirect taxes are unequalizing as the Gini increases for consumable
income to 0.355, which includes the impact of VAT, excise taxes, and other indirect taxes. Finally,
in-kind transfers in the form of education and health helped to reduce inequality. The overall
reduction in inequality was equivalent to 0.090 Gini points from market income to final income
when old-age pensions are considered to be deferred income, but as much as 0.222 Gini points
when pensions are treated as transfers.

redistributive effort through direct taxes and transfers in Croatia is comparable to other countries
in Europe, with most of the reduction in inequality largely being achieved by pensions. This
finding is in line with the existing literature that has so far focused on the impact on disposable
income.

The impact on poverty

Beyond the impact on inequality, which measures the relative position of households, it is
important to see the impact on poverty, which depends on the absolute level of income of a
household. The results suggest that the combination of taxes and social spending was poverty
increasing in 2014. The share of the population whose market income (including pensions) was
below the per capita US$10 PPP-a-day poverty line was 28 percent (Table 3). Once the burdens
of direct and indirect taxes are considered, these are larger than the direct benefits received from
transfers, so that the share of the population whose consumable income is below the US$10 PPP-
a-day poverty line increases to 50 percent. Similarly, if one were to use Eurostat’s relative poverty
line of 60 percent of the median equivalized disposable income, the headcount poverty rate
increases from 20.5 percent for disposable income to 28.8 percent for consumable income. Most
of the increase in poverty is on account of the burden of indirect taxes, as households are not being
compensated for this burden through direct transfers. Even for extreme levels of poverty (such as
those captured by the US$2.50-a-day poverty line), social transfers are insufficient to mitigate the
burden of taxes so that the level of extreme poverty after taxes and transfers is higher than before
taxes and transfers are considered (Table 3). The poverty gap and the severity of poverty decline
for all poverty lines when going from market to disposable income, but once indirect taxes are
incorporated into the analysis, this effect is reversed.

To the extent that income is underreported in household surveys, one could imagine that this result
is overestimated as households may actually have higher incomes than reported. In fact, there is
evidence that this is the case in Croatia. However, the overall result that poverty increases with
indirect taxes is robust to alternative measures of welfare, including those that use consumption as
the basis for welfare measurement. Regardless of whether we measure welfare using disposable
income in the PIS or HBS surveys, or consumption in the HBS survey, we find that the poverty
rate increases once indirect taxes are taken into account such that consumable income has a higher
level of poverty relative to disposable income (Figure 5A and Appendix 4). Finally, given that
households do not observe the value of the benefits of in-kind education and health, we refrain
from measuring poverty including those benefits, as standard in the literature. In terms of
household type, Figure 5B shows that the impact of indirect taxes on poverty was particularly large
among households with children and among retirees.

How did each of the fiscal interventions contribute to the observed changes in poverty and
inequality? Figure 6 presents the distributional impact of different components of the tax and
benefit system as a share of market income (including pensions) in 2014. Most components of the
system are progressive, with the bottom 10 percent of the distribution being net receivers of social
benefits. However, in cash terms, households beginning in the second decile were net payers to
the treasury in 2014, as the share of taxes paid exceeded the cash benefits received for all but the
poorest 10 percent of the population.

    pensions, and is equivalent to all the cash transfers to households minus all taxes.



Since the influence of specific interventions may be different from that of the overall system, a
fundamental question in the policy discussion is whether a particular fiscal instrument (or a
particular combination of them) is equalizing. If there were a single fiscal intervention, using the
typical indicators such as the Kakwani index7 to determine whether a particular intervention is
progressive or regressive would be sufficient to unambiguously determine whether that
intervention was equalizing. Given there is more than one fiscal intervention, this one-to-one
relationship between the progressivity of a particular intervention and its effect on inequality
breaks down. As Lambert (2001) demonstrates, depending on certain characteristics of the fiscal
system, a regressive tax—for example—can exert an equalizing force over and above that which
would prevail in the absence of that regressive tax. This is because each fiscal intervention interacts
with all the others. For instance, the proceeds of a regressive indirect tax could be used very
effectively in a pro-poor transfer, leading to a situation where post-fisc incomes are more equal
than in the absence of that regressive tax. One way to calculate the effect of a particular fiscal
instrument on inequality is to calculate its marginal contribution. The marginal contribution of a
tax (or transfer) is calculated by taking the difference between the inequality indicator with and

7
 The Kakwani index for taxes is defined as the difference between the concentration coefficient of the tax and the
Gini for market income. For transfers, it is defined as the difference between the Gini for market income and the
concentration coefficient of the transfer. See, for example, Kakwani (1977).


                                                                                                                                                   18
without the tax (or transfer).8 Table 4 shows both the Kakwani progressivity index for each tax and
transfer along with its marginal contribution to reducing inequality and poverty for each tax and
transfer intervention in 2014 under the main scenario. Results for the alternative scenario where
old age pensions are considered as transfers are presented in Appendix 3. We describe each of
these in turn.

Taxes

Direct taxes and social contributions are progressive and inequality-reducing overall, however they
also place a burden on the poor. That they are progressive can be seen by the fact that the Kakwani
coefficient is positive, the fact that they are inequality-reducing can be seen by a positive marginal
contribution to the redistributive effort (Table 4). However, they are also poverty increasing, as
shown by a negative marginal contribution to poverty reduction when poverty is measured using
US$5 PPP-a-day poverty line. There is substantial heterogeneity across categories of taxes and
contributions. For instance, while PIT is progressive and redistributive, direct taxes on
agriculture/fishing/hunting are slightly regressive, potentially because these taxes could be
overestimated by respondents in household surveys from where we take the information. Similarly,
social contributions to pensioner’s health and farmer’s contributions are regressive, but small
enough that they do not make a large impact on poverty or inequality. In particular, we find that
direct taxes in 2014 were not just progressive, but also highly redistributive relative to other
countries (Figure 7A).

In contrast, indirect taxes were regressive and contributed to increasing poverty and inequality in
2014. While it is true that regressive taxes can be equalizing,9 this was not the case in Croatia in
2014. In particular, VAT placed a large burden on low-income households, which was not
compensated for by pro-poor spending, leading to an overall increase in poverty and inequality.
Excise taxes were also regressive, but since they are not as large as VAT, their impact on poverty
and inequality was substantially smaller (Table 4). When taken together, indirect taxes are not only
regressive, but also highly unequalizing relative to other countries, including many Latin American
and other developing countries (Figure 7B). These results point to potential improvements that
could be achieved to reduce the burden on the poor.

  Note that there is path dependence in estimating these marginal contributions, since the order in which each
intervention is considered matters for the size of the estimated marginal contribution. The estimation approach uses
a Shapely decomposition to address this issue, which involves estimating marginal contributions in every possible
path and then taking the average.

Notes:
1. Original income is considered as Market Income plus Pensions
2. Redistributive effect equals the difference between market income Gini and the relevant ending income concept Gini. The shown change is measured in Gini points.
3. Size equals the ratio of the amount collected or spent divided by total market income.
4. Marginal contribution equals the difference between the Gini coefficient of the relevant ending income concept without the intervention in question and the Gini coefficient
of the relevant ending income concept (which, of course, includes that intervention). By definition, the sum of the marginal contributions does not fulfill the adding-up
principle so it will not be equal to the redistributive effect unless by coincidence. The marginal contribution shown above is measured in Gini points.
5. Poverty Reduction effect based on poverty headcount index using the poverty line of $5.00 per day in 2005 PPP.

Social spending

Contributory non-pension benefits and direct transfers are all progressive, reducing both poverty
and inequality (Table 4). Abstracting from old-age pensions, contributory benefit programs are
progressive in both relative and absolute terms – that is, they represent a larger share of the budgets
of the poor, and are pro-poor, as most of the benefits are concentrated at the bottom 40 percent of
the distribution for almost all categories of benefits with the exception of sickness benefits, which
are more concentrated at the top. In particular, 57 percent of maternity benefits10 and 52 percent
of unemployment benefits go to the bottom 40 percent of the distribution, while only 37 percent
of sickness benefits do so (Figure 8).

In terms of non-contributory transfers, all are progressive in relative and absolute terms (they are
pro-poor as a larger share of benefits goes to the bottom of the distribution) as demonstrated by
negative concentration coefficients (Table 4). In particular, 84 percent of social assistance benefits,
and 55 percent of child benefits are devoted to the bottom 20 percent of the distribution (Figure
8). Education benefits are perhaps the least well-targeted, with 49 percent of all benefits going to
the top 60 percent of the distribution, likely because these are designed as performance-based
stipends and not meant to target the bottom of the distribution. In assessing how education and
health spending benefit the poor, we have to caution that our analysis does not address the quality
of such spending. We use government expenditure data on the various forms of education and
health services to estimate unit costs of these programs. The analysis thus assumes that the actual

interpreted with caution.


                                                                                                                                                                                                               22
benefit received by individuals is equal to the amount spent per capita. As the quality of school
infrastructure, teachers, and health clinics and hospitals vary across the country then this is a clear
limitation of the analysis.

The results show that education is progressive in relative terms, and given the amounts spent, it is
also strongly equalizing.11 In other words, the amount of spending on education is relatively high
as a share of the incomes of those at the bottom of the distribution. However, there is variation
across educational categories, with primary education being the most redistributive (Table 4).
Although 50 percent of all spending on secondary is devoted to the poorest 40 percent, 52 percent
of pre-primary and 61 percent of tertiary education spending is devoted to the top 60 percent
(Figure 9). The overall result is a slightly progressive and equalizing education structure, although
the overall concentration of spending in absolute amounts is more or less neutral.

Similarly, health spending is equally distributed across the population in absolute terms. However,
in relative terms, health spending is strongly progressive, as it makes up a larger share of the
incomes of the bottom of the distribution (Figure 9). Thus, the overall impact of in-kind benefits
is a redistributive impact, as shown in Figures 2 and 4 above.

             VI.                    What is the impact of recent changes in taxes and benefits?

As noted earlier, reforms introduced in 2015 and 2017 were aimed at improving the fairness of the
tax system. In 2015/16 the government increased the threshold for the top rate, increased the tax
allowance slightly and introduced PIT on interest income. We estimate these impacts using the
2014 data, by changing solely the parameters of tax design, thus abstracting from any other
changes that would have affected the distribution. The results suggest that the effect of these
changes was a decline in collections and a more progressive PIT (Figure 10A) in relative terms as
poorer households spent a smaller share of their incomes on direct taxes. This is also seen by an
increase in the Kakwani index from 0.3049 to 0.3315. In 2017, the brackets of the personal income
tax (PIT) were reduced from three to two and the personal allowance was increased. In addition, a
more progressive scale for expanding the personal allowance for dependent children was
introduced and the narrowing of eligibility criteria for other supported family members. Pensioners
pay Personal Income Taxes calculated as 50 percent of the amount calculated based on the general
PIT schedule (but their basic personal allowance is no longer lower than for non-pensioners). The
effect of these changes was a further decline in collections and a slightly less progressive PIT, thus
reversing part of the improvement that had taken place in 2016 (the Kakwani fell from 0.3315 to
0.3260).

In terms of changes to indirect taxes, in 2017 the reduced VAT rate of 13 percent is now being
applied to inputs in agriculture, electricity and utility services while food and drink services were
moved from the reduced to the standard rate. The effect of these changes, largely driven by lower
electricity and utility bills was a less regressive VAT system (Figure 10B) as the Kakwani index
for VAT fell from -0.1586 to -0.1515.

Although direct taxes became more progressive in relative terms between 2014 and 2017 (as
poorer people paid a lower share of their incomes), when considering the absolute amount of tax
relief, most of the gains of the changes in policy were concentrated in the top four deciles. This in
turn has meant that the redistributive impact of PIT declined. The PIT’s marginal contribution to
redistribution fell by 0.008 Gini points between 2014 and 2017, while that of social contributions
also fell slightly by 0.002 Gini points. The slight improvement in the redistributive power of the
VAT (0.003) was not enough to offset this increase in inequality, leading to a slightly higher
Disposable income Gini (Figure 11). This combined with an estimated 0.5 percent of GDP
reduction in tax collections from both the PIT and the VAT (European Commission, 2017), implies
that the reforms put in place so far led to lower collections and lower redistribution.

However, when it comes to poverty, the impact of lower VAT on electricity and utility bills is
expected to be poverty reducing. Poverty, measured using the US$10 PPP-a-day poverty line is
expected to fall from 50 to 49 percent on account of the recent changes in VAT (Figure 12).
Similarly, it declines from 17.5 to 16.6 percent using the US$5 PPP-a-day poverty line. However,
this impact is not large enough to mitigate the impact of the burden of other taxes in the system.

   VII.      Alternative reforms: Reducing the VAT rate to 24 percent?

The existing framework can also be used to simulate reforms going forward. For instance, one
potential reform that has been discussed is a reduction in the VAT rate from 25 to 24 percent. A
simulation of the distributional impacts of such a change, holding everything else constant shows
that such a change would lead to a reduction in the relative poverty headcount rate by 0.21
percentage points and it would reduce consumable income inequality by only 0.001 Gini points
(Figures 13). However, the cost of such a move would amount to about HRK1.3 billion in 2014


                                                                                                                                          25
real terms (0.41 percent of GDP), which would have to be financed through expenditure
reductions or tax increases to avoid increasing the deficit and impinging on fiscal sustainability.
Depending on the financing instrument chosen, the distributional impacts could be different than
what is presented here.

 sources to compensate for the loss of revenue envisaged due to a reduction in the tax rate.



    VIII. Conclusions

The analysis presented in this paper finds that starting from a relatively low level of inequality
compared to other emerging high-income countries, such as Poland, the Croatian direct tax and
transfer system is redistributive, with progressive and redistributive direct taxes and transfers, in
line with other European countries, and more so than other developing countries. However,
indirect taxes are regressive and unequalizing, so much so that the redistributive power of direct
taxes and transfers is reversed. In cash terms, inequality is similar after all taxes and transfers than
before them.

The results on poverty, on the other hand, show that indirect taxes effectively lead some
households under the poverty line, and are therefore poverty increasing. With regards to in-kind
transfers, when the value of education and health is included in the analysis, there is an important
redistributive effect, primarily on account of primary education.

In terms of the recent changes to taxes implemented, the analysis finds that both direct and indirect
taxes became more progressive in relative terms in 2017 compared to 2014, as poorer households
paid lower taxes as a share of their incomes. However, in absolute amounts, most of the tax relief
accrued to the top of the income distribution. As a result, the redistributive impact of personal
income taxes and social security contributions was reduced, and inequality after taxes and transfers


                                                                                                     26
is expected to increase slightly in 2017 compared to 2014. When it comes to poverty, the impact
of lower VAT on electricity and utility bills is expected to be slightly poverty reducing, but not to
provide enough of the kind of relief that would be needed given the impact of indirect taxes.

Finally, a simulation shows that reducing the statutory standard VAT rate from 25 to 24 percent
would slightly reduce inequality, but could reduce poverty measured after taxes by 0.21 percentage
points. However, this would cost about 0.41 percent of GDP, which would have to be financed
either through expenditure cuts or tax increases to avoid increasing the fiscal deficit. Depending
on the financing mechanism chosen, the positive impact of a VAT reduction on poverty and
inequality would be smaller. Going forward, it will be important to consider similar exercises to
better understand the redistributive and poverty-reducing impact of policies, including through
assessment of the combination of policies.

Appendix 1. Taxes, Transfers and Methodological Assumptions

This appendix details the assumptions for the Commitment to Equity analysis for Croatia based on the
Croatian Population Income Survey (PIS) and Household Budget Survey (HBS) for 2014. The parameters
and rules of the fiscal system are presented not only for 2014, but also for the following years, so that the
analysis can later be easily updated.

Direct taxes and contributions
Income from employment is first evaluated within the social insurance system. Social security contributions
are paid from dependent employment, self-employment, as well as farming activity.

                                        1.1. Personal income tax

1.1.1. Description of the PIT system

Personal income tax (PIT) in Croatia is levied on individuals acquiring an income from any of the
sources specified by Law on Personal Income Tax. These include:
    income from employment (salaries);
    income from past employment (pensions);
    income from self-employment (income from small business, from independent
       professional activities, from agriculture, fishery and forestry);
    income from property and property rights (rental and lease income, income from
       intellectual property rights);
    income from capital (income from dividends, profit sharing, shares in corporate income,
       interest, capital gains);
    income from insurance (receipts of voluntary retirement and life insurance premiums paid);
    “other income” (basically taxable income not included in any of the above categories).

The taxable base is not equal to the whole income acquired. Parts of income from the sources listed
above are exempted from the PIT. For income from employment, there are a number of them, but
they are too numerous to be mentioned here. Notable examples are the so-called “Christmas
salary” and compensation for annual leave: upon adding up the two, only the amount in excess of
2,500 kunas is contributes to the taxable base. Another example for employment income is the
compensation for sick leave longer than 90 days paid by the employer, which also contributes to
the taxable base only in the amount exceeding 2,500 kunas per year. For capital income, income
from interest was exempted in 2014, but the exemption was abolished in 2015. Income from
dividends was exempted up to 12,000 kunas per year in 2014, and this exemption was also
abolished in 2015. Also, capital gains were exempted until 2016, when the exemption was
abolished.


                                                                                                          30
The taxable base for the PIT can also be lowered through deductions, a number of which are
available. Here we list the most notable among them:
    contributions to the voluntary pension fund (pillar III);
    donations (for education, science, culture, sport, medicine, religious institutions/charities);
    research and development expenditures by the self-employed;
    expenditures for training of young employees by the self-employed;
    deductions for self-employed employing persons from the areas of special state concern.

Depending on the source of income, some or all of the social contributions (see below) do not
contribute to the taxable base:
      for the employed: pension contributions;
      for the self-employed: all their contributions (pension contributions, general health
        contributions, occupational health contributions);
      for “other income” earners: pension contributions;
      for pensioners: pensioner health contributions.

Finally, every individual acquiring income from the sources taxable by the PIT is eligible for the
personal tax allowance. The personal tax allowance consists of:
     the basic personal allowance, which depends on whether the taxpayer is a pensioner or not
        and, if pensioner, on her pension;
     an additional allowance for dependent family members, if any, such as the spouse falling
        below a certain income threshold and dependent children. It depends also on the disability
        status of the taxpayer and the dependent family member(s), as well as on whether the place
        of residence is an area of special state concern.
The allowances for 2014, 2015/2016 and 2017 are shown in Table A1.

Regarding the rates to be applied to the taxable base, there is a general schedule, as well as income-
specific rates. In 2014 through 2016, there were three rates in the general schedule (12, 25 and 40
percent) and two income-specific rates (12 and 25 percent). As of 1 January 2017, there are two
rates in the general schedule (24 and 36 percent) and two income-specific rates (12 and 24 percent).
Tables A2 and A3 show the general schedules and income-specific rates, respectively.

 Notes. (*) If yearly receipts of “other income” do not exceed 210,000 kunas; otherwise, the yearly general
 schedule is used, in which the upper (lower) limit of the yearly taxable base in the first (second) tax band is
 210,000 kunas. (**) Applied only to receipts of dividends above the yearly deduction of HRK 12,000. (***)
 Applied to the tax base reduced by the “standardized expenditures”, which equal either 30% or 55% of the tax
 base.

For the employed and pensioners who regularly receive their salaries and pensions, PIT is withheld
regularly every month. Similarly, for “other income” earners, PIT is to be paid when the income
is paid to the earner. These three types of taxpayers may choose whether they want to submit the
yearly tax return. If they do submit it, the total and final amount of PIT they have to pay for a given
year is determined on the yearly basis, that is, using total yearly income, total yearly amount of
personal allowance (individual’s total monthly personal allowance times 12) and the general
schedule in which the limits of monthly taxable base brackets are multiplied by 12 to get the limits
of yearly taxable base. If they do not submit it, the total amount of PIT paid over the year is
considered final. On the other hand, the self-employed and those who were receiving income at
the same time from more than one employer have to submit the tax return. In addition, if a taxpayer
wants to lower her taxable base through a deduction, she has to submit the return. These rules
applied until the end of 2016. As of 2017, the calculation of the final amount of PIT to be paid will
be done by tax administration for all taxpayers. Effectively, for every taxpayer the final amount of
PIT to be paid will be calculated as if she submitted the tax return.

There is another direct tax that is closely related to PIT, namely the surtax. It is a local tax levied
by local self-government in more than 500 cities and municipalities. As in the case of PIT, the
taxpayers are individuals paying the PIT, the latter being the taxable base for the surtax. The rates
are set by cities and municipalities themselves, but under certain constraints: the rate can be at
most 10 percent in municipalities, 12 percent in cities with population under 30,000, 15 percent in
cities with population above 30,000, the only exception being the City of Zagreb where the ceiling
is set to 30 percent. A city or municipality may choose not to levy it at all, that is, to set the rate at
0 percent. In publically available fiscal statistics, the surtax collected is not reported separately
from PIT, but rather together with it, and under the heading “PIT”. The rates actually set vary
across cities and municipalities from 0 to 18 percent (in the City of Zagreb).

1.1.2. Obtaining PIT amounts from Population Income Survey data

The Population Income Survey (PIS) does not contain data on the amounts of PIT individuals paid,
except for some income sources. In particular, PIT amounts are given for:
    income from agriculture, fishery, hunting and forestry;
    income from renting apartments, rooms and land;
    income from renting business premises and equipment.

For these three income sources, we simply take the amounts of PIT reported directly by the
respondents. For all other income sources, PIT has to be simulated. Most of these incomes are
given as net incomes, where “net” means net of PIT and social contributions, if any. To do the
simulations, we have made some assumptions and done one necessary “intervention” in the data.

We have done the following “intervention” in the data. Some individuals did not report their
incomes as single numbers, but rather chose one out of a number of intervals to which their
incomes belong. To assign them single-number incomes, we use the following procedure. Using
incomes of those who reported them as single numbers, we compute the median for each of the
intervals offered to those who did not report their incomes as single figures. The medians are then
assigned to those without single-number incomes, depending on the intervals they chose. The
income sources to which this was applied are: salaries of the employed, pensions, income from
self-employment (apart from self-employment in agriculture, fishery, hunting and forestry) and
income from interest on savings accounts.

The assumptions we have made are the following:
   1. Where the question asking respondents to report the amount of an income source is not
       explicit on whether the reported amount should be net or gross of PIT and social
       contributions, we assume respondents reported net amounts.
   2. We simulate PIT under the assumption that all taxpayers do submit the yearly tax return;
       that is, the return is submitted even by those who are not obliged to do so. For those who
       are not obliged to submit it, we do not use information from the data on the amount of PIT
       returned to them by tax authority (if any), as well as information on how much they had to
       pay (if anything), in order to avoid double counting.
   3. We do not distinguish households from families, but rather assume that all individuals
       living in the same household constitute a family.
   4. Only salaried workers and pensioners were asked to report the number of dependent adults
       and the number of dependent children in their families who are used for the purpose of
       reducing the workers’ and pensioners’ taxable bases through increasing their personal tax
       allowances above the basic personal allowance. We assume what respondents reported can
       be trusted, and thus do not check if there are other family members who qualify to be
       dependent and who therefore could be used for increasing the personal tax allowance of

                                                                                                34
     the family members who do not receive salaries or pensions but receive income from other
     taxable sources. In other words, we assume that all family members who qualify to be
     dependent are used by those family members (salaried workers or pensioners) who reported
     using them for increasing their personal tax allowance.
5.   For families where no individual is either salaried worker or pensioner – which means that
     no one was asked to report the number of dependents – we do not look for dependents even
     if there might be some who are used by earners of taxable income sources (other than
     salaries and pensions). This, however, does not necessarily mean that we overestimate
     these taxpayers’ final amount of PIT paid, since we assume that everybody acquiring
     income from taxable sources submit the yearly tax return (see assumption 2 above). In fact,
     we initially overestimate their PIT, but adjust it for the amount of returned to them, if any,
     upon the final calculation by tax administration of the amount of PIT they have to pay, and
     the final calculation takes into account, among other relevant information, information
     about the number of dependents (if the taxpayer provides the necessary documents proving
     there are any). And from the data we know how much was returned to the taxpayer after
     the final calculation on the part of tax administration.
6.   In the data, we do not have income from dividend reported separately from other sources
     of capital income (shares in profit, interest on bonds, and income from other securities): all
     of them are reported together as income from investment in securities. We assume the
     whole amount reported is income from dividend.
7.   Pensions from abroad are assumed to be public pensions from Germany. And public
     pensions from Germany are taxed in there, not in Croatia. We suppose that most people
     who worked abroad for a foreign employer, or who were self-employed abroad, did so in
     Germany, given that this country has been, and perhaps still is, the most frequent
     destination for Croatian people working abroad. We suppose that people who worked, and
     thus earned their pensions, in one of the countries formed after the break-up of Yugoslavia
     (other than Croatia) do not consider their pensions as pensions from abroad. In principle,
     the assumption makes a difference because pensions earned in ex-Yugoslavian states are
     taxed in Croatia.
8.   All individuals who reported to have income from self-employment (other than income
     from agriculture, fishery, hunting and forestry) are assumed to pay PIT, rather than profit
     tax (corporate income tax). In addition, although some of the self-employed pay PIT as
     lump-sum, we do not have enough information in the data to identify them, and for that
     reason we assume that all pay PIT according to the general schedule.
9.   Households (not individuals) with income from activities in agriculture, fishing, hunting
     and forestry were asked to report the amount of tax paid on that income. We do not simulate
     the amount of tax paid by these individuals, but rather simply take the amount reported.
     However, since the total amount reported largely exceeds the total amount of PIT recorded
     in administrative data, we do not consider it to be only PIT, but to include other types of
     taxes, including profit tax. We thus term these taxes “direct taxes paid on income from


                                                                                                35
              activities in agriculture, fishery, hunting and forestry”. The amount of PIT included, if any,
              may be paid either as lump-sum or according to the general schedule. We do not have
              enough information in the data to ascertain in what form these taxpayer pay PIT.
          10. Some income sources considered by law as “other income” are exempted from PIT (for
              example, honoraria of sport referees). Since we do not enough information in the data to
              identify such income sources, we assume no one receives any of them.
          11. With a few exceptions, most of in-kind components of salaried workers’ compensation are
              subject to PIT (in some cases only if they exceed certain yearly threshold). The amount by
              which they contribute to the taxable base is equal to their market value in the place they
              were “paid out” to the receiver. Lacking information on whey they were “paid out”, we
              assume the reported amounts equal the actual market values.
          12. We do not know from the data the city or municipality in which individuals reside, and
              thus cannot know the exact city/municipality-specific surtax rate. We assume everybody
              pay the same surtax rate, calculated as the population-weighted average of the surtax rates
              over all cities and municipalities. So calculated, the single surtax rate is 8.8 percent.
              Perhaps it would be better to assign the surtax rates to individuals based on population
              density in their place of residence (densely, moderately or thinly populated), as in Urban
              and Bezeredi (2016), but the Croatian Bureau of Statistics, the institution administering the
              survey, did not provide the relevant variable.

                                               1.2. Other direct taxes

    Besides PIT and the related surtax, there are a couple of other direct taxes, as described below.

                                         1.3. Social contributions
    There are five types of social contributions (SCs):
         general health contribution;
         occupational health contribution;
         pensioner health contributions;
         employment contribution;
         pension contributions
               o scheme A: only intergenerational solidarity (pillar 1)
               o scheme B: intergenerational solidarity (pillar 1) and mandatory saving (pillar 2)12
    Description of the system of SCs is best structured by income source. Table A5 describes, by
    income source, which types of SCs are paid on which source, at which rate, on which base and by
    whom.



    12
         There is also voluntary saving (pillar 3).

Besides incomes of various professionals and craftsmen, self-employment income includes
incomes of the self-employed in agriculture, fishery, hunting and forestry. Table A6 presents social
contributions is for the self-employed who do bookkeeping on cash basis and are PIT payers. They
constitute the largest type of the self-employed.

SCs on sickness, maternity and parental benefits

For individuals receiving sickness, maternity or parental benefit, the state pays from the budget
the pension contribution for pillar 2 (mandatory saving). The base equals the amount of benefit,
and the rate is 5%.

Obtaining SCs from Population Income Survey data

In the PIS data, the amounts of SCs are not directly reported by the respondents, except for SCs
paid by those with income from activities in agriculture/fishery/hunting/forestry. For them we just
take the amounts reported. The relevant survey questions did not ask the respondents to report each
type of SCs separately. Precisely, all non-pension contributions are reported together as a single
amount.      Therefore,    for     individuals    receiving    income      from     activities   in
agriculture/fishery/hunting/forestry the data allowed us only to have non-pension contributions
and pension contributions.



                                                                                                                39
For others, the amounts of SCs are simulated. The simulation was done after the simulation of PIT,
since the income after SCs is the income before PIT. This order of simulation is necessary because
the starting incomes, those that we have in the data, are incomes net of PIT and SCs. In the
simulations, we have made the following assumptions:
      1. The general health contribution rate was 13% until April 2014 and 13% thereafter, with
          no changes in the following years. We assume there was only one rate throughout 2014,
          equal to (0.25 * 13%) + (0.75 * 15%) = 14.5%.
      2. We assume that all self-employed individuals do bookkeeping on cash basis, meaning
          that they pay PIT (rather than profit tax) and SCs.
      3. Individuals with income from employment (salaried workers) were asked in the survey
          to report which types of SCs their employers paid for them. Similarly, the self-employed
          (apart from those in agriculture/fishery/hunting/forestry) were asked to report which SCs
          they paid for themselves. We assume that all respondents reported truthfully and
          correctly, and then simulated only those SCs actually paid, if any.
      4. The contribution bases for the self-employed are determined as lump-sum, as the product
          of the average (national) gross wage from January to August of the preceding year and
          an occupation-specific coefficient (see section 2.3.3.). In the survey, information on
          occupation is not detailed enough to allow identifying the occupational type of a self-
          employed person and assign her the coefficient that actually pertains to her. We assume
          the coefficient is 0.65 for everyone, as this coefficient pertains to all sorts of craftsmen,
          supposedly the largest group among the self-employed.
      5. SCs are not paid on some income sources from the category “other income” (for example,
          income that journalists, artists, researchers and scholars earn thorough “selling” their
          original works). Lacking detailed enough information, we assume that SCs are paid on

                                           2.1 Value Added Tax

There are three VAT rates: one standard rate and two reduced rates. The standard rate is 25 percent, and
the reduced rates are 5 percent and 13 percent. Below we list the goods and services to which the reduced
rates applied in 2014.

In the computation of VAT paid by households, we had to make a couple of assumptions:
•        All books have the content that qualifies them for the 5 percent rate.
•        In the Household Budget Survey (HBS), expenditures for cinema, theater and concert tickets are
reported together, as one expenditure category. We assume that the structure of expenditures is: 50, 20 and
30 percent for cinema, theater and concerts, respectively.
•        All drugs are from the Croatian Health Insurance Fund’s list, qualifying them for the 5 percent rate.
•        All white sugar is crystal sugar, qualifying it for the 5 percent rate.
•        All periodical magazines have the content that qualifies them for the 13 percent rate.

                                                                                                           40

As of the beginning of 2017, changes in Table A9 were introduced. In the simulations of 2017 reforms, we
were not able to take into account all the changes as described below.

                                                 2.2 Excise tax

2.2.1 Excises on alcohol

There are excises on beer and on ethyl alcohol:

•          beer: 40 kn per 1 percent volume of pure alcohol in a hectoliter (hl)

•       ethyl alcohol: 5300 kn/hl (applies only to pure alcohol and that contained in liquors, but not to that
contained in wine)

                                                                                                           41
In the HBS, there are four categories of beer: “alcoholic beer”, “other alcoholic beer”, “low-alcohol and
non-alcoholic beer”, “beer-based beverages”. We assume that “alcoholic beer” and “other alcoholic beer”
are the regular beer with 5 percent alcohol volume, a reasonable assumption given that the most popular
brands have about 4.9-5 percent. This assumption implies that the excise is 2 kn/l of the regular alcoholic
beer. The categores “low-alcohol and non-alcoholic beer” and “beer-based beverages” are assumed to
consist entirely of non-alcoholic beer. The assumption, reasonable or not, cannot affect the results as there
are less than ten households with non-zero expenditure on these types of beer.

Households in the HBS report the expenditure for “alcoholic drinks and liquors with high volume of
alcohol” and for “alcoholic drinks with low volume of alcohol”. As the latter is non-zero for only a few
households, we focus on the former only. We assume the volume of alcohol is 40 percent, which is the case
for most popular hard liquors in Croatia. The assumption implies that the excise amounts to 21.2 kn/l of
“alcoholic drinks and liquors with high volume of alcohol.

Excises on tobacco

There are excises on cigarettes, on finely cut tobacco, on other smoking tobacco and on cigars/cigarillos as
described in Table A10. Changes introduced after 2014 are taken into account in the 2016 and 2017 tax
reform simulations.

                                     Table A10. Excises on Tobacco
         Cigarettes               Finely cut       Other smoking tobacco           Cigars/cigarillos

 210 kn/1000 cigarettes 520 kn/kg after 5 450 kn/kg after 5 March
 after 5 March 2014       March 2014       2014
                                   Changes April 2015
 increase from 210 to 230 increase    from
 kn/1000 cigarettes       520 to 550 kn/kg
 increase from 37% to
 38% of the retail price
                                Changes November 2016
 increase from 230 to 275 increase    from
 kn/1000 cigarettes       550 to 600 kn/kg
 reduction from 38% to
 36% of the retail price


In the HBS, the quantity of cigarettes is reported as the number of packs. According to the list of all cigarette
brands on the Croatian market in 2014, prepared regularly by the Customs Authority (Carinska uprava), 95
percent of all brands had 20 cigarettes per pack, and we assume this holds for every pack reported in the
HBS. This implies the specific excise of 3.94 kn/pack until 5 March 2014 and 4.20 kn/pack after 5 March
2014. From these two, we compute the specific excise for the whole year as (0.18 * 3.94 kn/pack) + (0.82
* 4.20 kn/pack) = 4.15 kn/pack, where 0.18 and 0.82 are obtained as, respectively: 0.18 = 2.16 months / 12

                                                                                                              42
months; 0.82 = 9.84 months / 12 months. The proportional excise (37 percent of the retail price) is calculated
straightforwardly.

As for the other tobacco products, in the HBS there is only one category, namely “tobacco for pipe,
cigarettes and chewing”, with quantity expressed in packs. We assume that the relevant excise is that on
“finely cut tobacco” (see above), which was 450 kn/kg until 5 March 2014 and 520 kn/kg after 5 March
2014. In the HBS, the quantity is reported in packs, and we assume that each pack contains 40 grams of
tobacco, implying the following excises: 18 kn/pack until 5 March 2014, 20.8 kn/pack after 5 March 2014.
Using the same weight as in the case of cigarettes (0.18, 0.82), the average excise for the whole year is 20.3
kn/pack.

The excises on other smoking tobacco and on cigars/cigarillos are not calculated at all: in the case of
cigars/cigarillos because no household reported non-zero expenditure on them, and in the case of other
smoking tobacco because there is no tobacco product in the HBS other than “tobacco for pipe, cigarettes
and chewing” to which we could apply it.

2.2.2 Excise on electricity

The excise on electricity was 7.5 kn/MWh (or 0.0075 kn/kWh). To compute the total excise paid by a
household, we need to determine the number kilowatt-hours spent by the household. We determine it by
dividing the household’s reported yearly expenditure for electricity (inclusive of all taxes) by the average
price per kilowatt-hour (inclusive of all taxes). According to Croatian Energy Regulatory Agency (HERA),
in 2014 it was HRK 0.99 per kilowatt-hour. The excise is then calculated as 0.0075 kn/kWh times the
number of kilowatt-hours.

2.2.3 Excises on oil derivatives

Excises on petrol, on diesel, on natural gas, on propane-butane and on heating oil are presented in Table
A11. Changes introduced after 2014 are taken into account in the 2016 and 2017 tax reform simulations:

                                Table A11. Excises on Oil Derivatives
       Petrol             Diesel         Natural gas             Propane-butane      Heating oil:
 3.46 kn/l until 14 2.66 kn/l until 14 8.10 kn/MWh               0.10 kn/kg         160 kn/kg
 April 2014         April 2014
 3.66 kn/l after 14 2.86 kn/l after 14
 April 2014         April 2014

                                  Changes April 2015
 increase from 3.66 increase from 2.86
 to 3.86 kn/l       to 3.06 kn/l


For each of these, to calculate the total excise paid by a household, we need the quantity spent by the
household, and since these are not reported in the HBS, we derive them indirectly. For this purpose, we use
the information on household expenditure (inclusive of taxes), external information on the average price



                                                                                                           43
per unit (inclusive of taxes) and, in the case of propane-butane for car (as opposed to household) use,
additional external information.

The quantity of petrol is derived by dividing the petrol expenditure by the average price of petrol. According
to Hrvoje Požar Energy Institute, the average price of the Eurosuper 98 type of petrol was HRK 10.99 per
liter, and that of the Eurosuper 95 was 10.47 kn/l. Since we do not have information on the structure of
petrol consumption, we take the average of the two to get 10.73 kn/l. Since the excise per liter changed on
17 April 2014, we use the weighted average of the excise that was applied until the date and the excise that
was applied after the date, with the weights being equal to the respective fractions of the year (similar to
what we have done in the case of cigarettes; see above): (0.3 * 3.46 kn/l) + (0.7 * 3.66 kn/l) = 3.60 kn/l.

The average price of diesel, according to Hrvoje Požar Energy Institute, was 9.85 kn/l. As in the case of
petrol, the excise changed on 14 April 2014, meaning that the weights for the calculation of the weighted
average of excise for the whole year are remain the same.

According to HERA, the average price of natural gas was 0.414 kn/kWh. To get the quantity, we first
subtract from the reported yearly expenditure the yearly fixed fee, which varies depending on the quantity
spent, and we assume all households pay the lowest fee (i.e. that they do not use more than 25.000 kWh).
Then we divide by the average price.

Propane-butane is used in households for cooking, but also as a motor fuel. The first use can be directly
identified from the HBS, since households report their propane-butane expenditures. In Croatia, people
usually buy propane-butane in 10-kilogram steel bottles, and here we assume that everybody do buy it in
such bottles. The price, for propane-butane purchased in such bottles and at INA (the biggest supplier), was
9.22 kn/kg. As for the car use, it is not reported in the HBS explicitly as propane-butane. Rather, we take
“other motor fuels” to be mainly propane-butane, as some people use it in cars. According to Hrvoje Požar
Energy Institute, the average price was 5.09 kn/l. Since the excise is expressed in kn/kg rather than in kn/l,
we had to use the following calculation for conversion. Propane-butane is half propane, half butane. Their
specific densities (weight per unit of volume) are 0.51 kg/l and 0.57 kg/l, respectively, and the density of
propane-butane is thus the average of the two, 0.54 kg/l. Since the excise is 0.10 kn/kg, the excise per liter
is: 0.54 kg/l * 0.10 kn/kg = 0.054 kn/l.

We were unable to find the average price of heating oil in 2014. We assume the ratio of the average price
of heating oil to the average price of diesel was the same in 2014 as it is as of writing this: 0.53. Since the
average price of diesel was 9.85 kn/l (see above), we infer the average price of heating oil to be 0.53 * 9.85
kn/l = 5.22 kn/l.

2.2.4 Excises on coffee and non-alcoholic beverages

Coffee and some non-alcoholic beverages are subject to the following excises:




                                                                                                            44
                 Table A12. Excise rates on coffee and non-alcoholic beverages
                       Coffee                                       Non-alcoholic beverages
 roasted coffee: 6 kn/kg                               water, including mineral and sparkling water,
                                                       sweetened or aromatized, except fruit juices and
                                                       nectars: 40 kn/hl
 substitutes for roasted coffee that contain coffee: 6 other beverages with less than 1.2% of alcohol
 kn/kg                                                 volume, except mixtures of beer and non-alcoholic
                                                       beverages with more than 0.5% alcohol volume:
                                                       40 kn/hl
 non-alcoholic beverages containing coffee or syrups and concentrates for preparation of non-
 extract/essence/concentrate of coffee: 6 kn/kg        alcoholic beverages, except fruit syrups: 240 kn/hl
 extracts, essences and concentrates of coffee: 20 powders and granules for preparation of non-
 kn/kg                                                 alcoholic beverages: 400 kn/100 kg


Information from the HBS that we use to calculate the excises consist of expenditures and quantities, both
directly reported by households. The only item which we were not able to identify in the HBS is “non-
alcoholic beverages containing coffee or extract, essence or concentrate of coffee”. For all other items we
were able to find the corresponding item in the HBS.

                                         2.3 Other indirect taxes

Special tax on the premiums of insurance from automobile responsibility

This tax is paid on the premiums of the so-called “insurance from automobile responsibility”. The tax base
is the value of premium, and the rate is 15 percent. In the case of casco-type insurance of road vehicles, the
rate is 10 percent. In the HBS we were able to identify the expenditure on car insurance, but not if it is
casco-type or not. Thus we apply the 15 percent rate.

Consumption tax

The tax is paid on consumption of drinks in cafes, bars, restaurants and similar establishments at 3 percent.
The tax base is the sales price net of VAT, and we calculate it from the expenditure for “catering services”
in the HBS.

Social Spending
3. Family Benefits and Social Assistance

Direct transfers including the one-time grant for newborn children, the child benefit, subsistence, housing
and lump-sum assistance are directly identified in the PIS. Unfortunately there is no way to identify benefits
related to HBDR/HRVI or benefits provided by local governments.




                                                                                                           45
Appendix 2. Survey-to-Survey Imputation for Indirect Taxation

The Population Income Survey (PIS) used to obtain personal income tax, other direct taxes, social
contributions and government transfers is very rich in terms of income components, and is a larger survey,
thus can better represent smaller groups within the population. However, it does not contain information on
household consumption expenditures. This information is contained in the Household Budget Survey
(HBS), which we used to calculate indirect taxes – VAT, excises and other indirect taxes. In order to assess
the distributional impact of both direct and indirect taxation, social contributions and government transfers,
we imputed indirect taxes calculated in the HBS to every household in the PIS.

The imputation procedure is based on modeling the ratio of an indirect tax to household income as a function
of household income. All indirect taxes computed from the HBS were first grouped into three groups: VAT
(see Appendix 1 section 2.1.), excises (see Appendix 1 section 2.2.) and other indirect taxes (see Appendix
1 section 2.3.). Then household disposable income was created in the HBS as the sum of incomes from all
sources (employment, pensions, self-employment, capital, and property), net of personal income tax and
social contributions, plus the total amount of government transfers. The different income categories are
contained in the HBS, net of personal income tax and social contributions, rather than as gross incomes.
Therefore, we did not simulate personal income tax and social contributions to go from gross to net
amounts. However, the disposable income aggregate that emerges from the HBS is not identical to the one
obtained from the PIS, but the two are very close. Hereafter we refer to the former as “HBS disposable
income” (HBSDI for short).

The following variables are constructed in the HBS for the imputation procedure:
     VAT  T VAT / Y
         EXC  T EXC / Y
         OIT  T OIT / Y
        powers of ln y
where, for a given household, T VAT , T EXC and T OIT are the amounts of VAT, excises and other income
taxes, respectively,   Y is HBSDI, and y is HBSDI per household member. We regress  VAT ,  EXC and
 OIT on a constant and a number of powers of ln y . For each of the three types of indirect taxes the initial
specification includes only the constant and ln y . Then we keep adding further powers of ln y until the
adjusted R2 started to increase only marginally. Doing so, we end up with the following specifications:


iVAT  VAT  1VAT ln yi  2
                              VAT
                                  (ln yi )2  iVAT
 iEXC   EXC  1EXC ln yi  2EXC(ln yi )2  iEXC
 iOIT   OIT  1OIT ln yi  2OIT (ln yi )2  3OIT (ln yi )3  4OIT (ln yi )4  5OIT (ln yi )5  iOIT

The OLS estimates of the parameters are given in Table A2.1.

 Notes. OLS estimation. Standard errors are in parentheses. All estimates are significant at 0.01%. Estimates
 pertaining to VAT and OIT for 2016 are the same as those for 2014. Estimates pertaining to OIT for 2017 are the
 same as those for 2014. Sampling weights used in estimation.

The estimated parameters are then used together with data on disposable income in PIS – call it PISDI for
short – constructed carefully to resemble HBSDI as much as possible. We then use the following equations
to impute the thetas in PIS ( i

Notes:
1. Original income is considered as Market Income.
2. Redistributive effect equals the difference between market income Gini and the relevant ending income concept Gini. The shown change is measured in Gini points.
3. Size equals the ratio of the amount collected or spent divided by total market income.
4. Marginal contribution equals the difference between the Gini coefficient of the relevant ending income concept without the intervention in question and the Gini coefficient of the
relevant ending income concept (which, of course, includes that intervention). By definition, the sum of the marginal contributions does not fulfill the adding-up principle so it will not be
equal to the redistributive effect unless by coincidence. The marginal contribution shown above is measured in Gini points.
5. Poverty Reduction effect based on poverty headcount index using the poverty line of $5.00 per day in 2005 PPP.
