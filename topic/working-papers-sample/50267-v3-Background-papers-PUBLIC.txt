This volume contains four background papers commissioned from various authors by the World
Bank as the initial step following the decision to embark, jointly with the European Commission,
on a study of migration in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region. The papers thus
constitute singly the building blocks and, together, the foundation of the main study contained in
the main volume. The four papers have many commonalities. They deal—in different depth and
breadth—with the main migration parameters (stocks, flows, migrant characteristics) and their
determinants: (i) the role of education and skills; (ii) the economic impact of migration,
especially remittance flows; (iii) the prospects for offshoring and outsourcing; and (iv) the role of
migration institutions, policies, and management.

The first two papers—by Gubert and Nordman, and Koettl—focus on labor migration from the
MENA Region to member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) (Europe especially) and the convergence of interest between the two.
These papers draw heavily on population and labor force projections to ask “Can migrants from
the MENA Region help filling labor market gaps in OECD countries?” (Gubert and Nordman)
and to point out good migration policy practices for Europe (Koettl). If the first two papers deal
largely with the demand side, the last two address the supply (MENA) side. These papers are
strong on institutions and point to good migration policy practices as well as shortcomings
among migrant sending countries. The first of these two papers (Corm) looks at the region as a
whole, whereas the second (Schramm) is a synthesis of three country case studies (the Arab
Republic of Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia) carried out in 2006 by Tahar Abdessalem, Ahmed Basti,
Mohamed Khachani, Fouzi Mourj, and Ayman Zohry, and the International Organization for
Migration (IOM) country branches of Tunis and Cairo.

The caveats about the data noted in the Introduction to the main volume apply here, too, and are
reiterated in the individual background papers. The papers that follow are based on the best and
most up-to-date data available as of the time of their preparation.

World Bank staff commented extensively on the papers in this volume, but the views expressed
in them are the authors’ and do not necessarily represent those of the Bank.

                                      INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

Migration from the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to member countries of the Organisation
of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has been and continues to be one of the
most controversial subjects of concern over the past few years because of the increasing
perceptions among governments and political observers in the latter countries that (i) migration
from LDCs to more developed countries has to be regulated on a selective basis; and (ii) the
aging population process in developed countries entails demographic transitions and potential
economic upheavals in their labor markets. Hence, it is expected not only that more jobs will
become available in the near future, but also that medium- and high-skilled workers will be
sorely lacking.

The rising deficit of medium- and high-skilled workers is often presented as a European
challenge of increasing importance. As Constant and Zimmermann note,
   “This is a matter of size and intensity. Even in the long-term, it will be difficult for European
   firms to hire the appropriate quantities on their local labor markets. Supply is not likely to
   keep pace with demand. A permanent effort will be needed to participate in the rising world
   market for flexible high-skilled workers. This international effort is a prerequisite for keeping
   the own talents and the hired migrants of the European Union member countries. Appropriate
   policy instruments have to be found to enable companies to deal with this challenge. 1 ”

Little is known about the specific economic, demographic, and labor market determinants of
migration from certain regions of the developing world. In this report, we shed light on the
trends, determinants, and prospects of migration from the Middle East and North Africa
(MENA) Region to OECD countries. 2 We exclude intraregional migration from the analysis
even though it has important economic and demographic impact on both host and origin
economies.

The report is in three parts.

Part I provides a picture of the levels and trends of migration from the MENA Region to OECD
countries. The overall discussion is based on two complementary databases made available only
recently on the stocks of international migrants in OECD countries: that of Docquier and
Marfouk (2005) and that of Dumont and Lemaître (2005). Based on the 2000 round of censuses
held in each OECD country, these two databases provide a detailed, comparable, and reliable
picture of immigrant populations within OECD countries.

Based on statistical analyses using these data sets, our findings are as follows. First, migrants
from the MENA Region represent a small share of the migrant population in most OECD
countries. Second, their skill composition strongly varies between receiving countries because of

 According to the World Bank’s country classification, the MENA Region includes 19 countries: Algeria, Bahrain,
Djibouti, the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco,
Occupied Palestinian Territories, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), and the Republic of Yemen. All MENA countries except Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
and the UAE are low- or middle-income countries.

differing migration and labor market policies. Migrants from the MENA Region are much more
educated on average in Anglo-Saxon destination countries than in the traditional destination
countries of Continental Europe. Given the skill composition of the migrants, “brain drain”
appears to be nonnegligible in Algeria, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Lebanon, Morocco, and
Tunisia although estimates strongly vary. Furthermore, for all MENA countries, the overall level
of education of the migrants increased between 1990 and 2000. Third, destination also strongly
varies with origin. Emigration from the Maghreb countries is strongly concentrated toward
Continental Europe, while that from the other MENA countries is focused on the group of
Anglo-Saxon countries.

Part II provides econometric analyses of the determinants of migration from MENA to the
OECD countries. In particular, the influence of economic, demographic, and political factors on
the size and composition of migration flows from MENA to OECD countries over the period
1990–2002 is investigated.

We first provide a brief survey of the economic literature on international migration and discuss
the role of potential key determinants of migration (“push” and “pull” factors 3 ), such as
economic and demographic pressures, network effects, or the so-called welfare magnet effect.

Two complementary econometric analyses are then carried out. First, a cross-sectional data
analysis builds on Docquier and Marfouk’s database on international migration, which provides
data on the stocks of MENA immigrants in all OECD countries by education attainment in 1990
and 2000. Second, a panel data approach makes use of annual migration flows made available
online by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI). The two alternative data sets are then combined
with economic and noneconomic data on both the origin and the destination countries to estimate
gravity models. In its most basic form, the gravity model explains migration flows (or stocks)
from one country to another by each country’s economic characteristics and bilateral geographic
characteristics. In our approach, we examine the impact of other determinants of migratory flows
or stocks, such as demand factors in the host country, and their potential pull effects. We focus
on the following questions: How much do the “pure” economic factors like differences in income
and unemployment levels, returns to education, or labor productivity growth explain migration
behavior? How much is explained by other factors such as immigration policies, social networks,
cultural and linguistic distance, threat to own freedom such as the level of political rights, and
civil liberties in home country?

The emerging findings emphasize the relevance of pull factors to explain the magnitude of
expatriation rates from developing to OECD countries despite restrictive immigration policies in
most destination countries. Next to economic factors (income levels, returns to education, labor
productivity growth), demographic determinants in particular appear to be strong predictors of
migration flows. These findings are consistent with the premise that migration is partly demand-
driven and used by some countries to compensate for population aging. The results support the
idea that different forces are at work concerning the migration of high-educated and low-
educated individuals. Push and pull factors have a notably different impact according to the type

3
  A push factor is a feature or event that encourages a person to leave his or her country (high unemployment,
poverty, famine, drought, natural disasters, political oppression or persecution, and so on). A pull factor is a feature
or event that attracts a person to move to another country.
                                                -3-



of migration considered. This should be taken into account by governments that wish to
implement selective immigration policies.

Part III of the report examines whether migration from MENA countries can be a solution to
labor shortages in OECD countries.

We first present a general overview of job vacancies in some European countries. We then focus
on one OECD country, France, and present a more detailed picture of the recruitment difficulties
and skill shortages faced by this country. Despite methodological problems, all the available data
confirm that labor markets are tight in several OECD countries. Labor shortages are experienced
in all sectors, particularly in the Wholesale and Retail Trade, Hotels and Restaurants, and
Transport and Communication subsectors. The number of job vacancies is also high in the Public
Administration Education and Health sector, partly due to the nurse shortages that affect most
OECD countries. In some European countries, namely France and Germany, substantial
unsatisfied labor requirements are observed despite persistently high rates of unemployment. In
these countries, labor shortages could be attenuated through domestic reforms aimed at
mobilizing the unused local labor supply. However, such reforms are unlikely to have an
immediate impact on the population’s education, occupation, or location choices. Under these
conditions, turning to labor migration programs could be a more rapid and effective means of
addressing shortages.

We then investigate whether the MENA Region can fill labor gaps in OECD countries.
Compared with Eastern European and former Socialist countries, MENA economies have the
demographic potential for large-scale emigration to OECD countries. From a strict quantitative
standpoint, the diverging demographic trends and structural differences between most European
countries and MENA economies thus add credence to the idea that potential synergies need to be
developed between the two regions. In particular, increased labor mobility from the MENA
Region could compensate for demographic trends in European labor markets in the next two
decades, while constituting a response to the lack of employment in the home countries.
Evidence from the estimated gravity models (see part II) does suggest that migration flows from
one country to another are strongly driven by demographic features.

The central question of interest is not so much whether the MENA region can provide high
numbers of working-age individuals but, rather, what kind of migrants the region can provide.
We thus scrutinize whether there would be a match between Europe’s skill requirements and
MENA’s skill supply by first looking at the current labor market situation of migrants originating
from the MENA Region in OECD countries. Then, in a more prospective approach, we examine
available data on unemployment rates by sector within MENA countries. High unemployment
numbers in some sectors are likely to be due to skill mismatch or to lack of available jobs in
these sectors. If the latter is true, migration might be an appropriate means for job seekers to find
a suitable job in the same sector abroad.

As noted, the analysis confirms that increased labor mobility from the MENA Region could
compensate for labor shortages in European labor markets in the coming decades, while
responding to the lack of employment in some home countries. This finding needs to be taken
with caution, however, because of the lack of more disaggregated data on both labor shortages in
OECD countries and labor surpluses in MENA countries as well as on skill requirements.

Finally, we explore the question of whether offshoring could gain ground in the MENA Region.
By comparing wages in some MENA countries with those prevailing in countries where
offshoring has been gaining ground for the last 10 years, we find that some MENA countries
offer significant cost advantages. However, offshoring business process or services is not simply
cost driven. In some other regards, MENA countries are disadvantaged compared with other
countries. So far, the region has not taken advantage of the opportunities for the outsourcing of
business service jobs, offered mainly by U.S. or British firms. However, given the conditions
prevailing in some of the French-speaking MENA countries (namely, Morocco and Tunisia),
these countries could appear in the future offshoring plans of French and other continental
countries.

                           I.      OVERVIEW OF REGIONAL MIGRATION TRENDS

This section provides a picture of the levels and trends of migration from the MENA Region to
OECD countries. All MENA countries except Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the
UAE are low- or middle- income countries.

The overall discussion is based on two databases made available only recently on the stocks of
international migrants in OECD countries: that of Docquier and Marfouk (2005) and that of
Dumont and Lemaître (2005). Based on the 2000 round of censuses held in each OECD country,
these two databases provide a detailed, comparable, and reliable picture of immigrant
populations within OECD countries. 4 The two databases differ in the way they define a migrant.
Docquier and Marfouk (2005) count as migrants all working-age (25 and over) foreign-born
individuals living in an OECD country, where foreign born is defined as an individual born
abroad with foreign citizenship at birth. By contrast, Dumont and Lemaître (2005) count as
migrants foreign-born individuals age 15 and over living in an OECD country. Given this
definition, people born, say, with French nationality outside of France (in Algeria, for example)
are counted as foreign born. Another difference between the two databases lies in the reference
year: while Docquier and Marfouk’s database covers both 1990 and 2000, Dumont and
Lemaître’s database delivers information on migrant stocks in 2000 only. In what follows, we
use one database or the other alternatively, depending on the question at hand.

Migration from MENA to OECD Countries: A Host Countries’ Perspective

Stocks

The two complementary databases of Docquier and Marfouk and Dumont and Lemaître provide
a rich picture of emigration from the MENA Region, the salient features of which are as follows.

First, the share of migrants from MENA countries in the total stock of migrants is rather low in
most OECD countries (see annex A, table A1). This stock is higher than 10 percent in only eight
OECD countries, all of them being located in the European Economic Area (Belgium, Denmark,
France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Norway). In North America, the share of
migrants from MENA countries is still lower: 5.3 percent in Canada, and 2.6 percent in the

4
    The picture provided, however, focuses on recorded migrants only.

United States. At a more aggregated level, the same pattern emerges. In figure I.1, OECD
countries are classified into one of five groups according to their welfare state regime and their
migration policy general orientation. Following Esping-Andersen (1990), the group of
Continental European countries consists of Austria, Belgium, France, Luxemburg, the
Netherlands, and Switzerland; the group of Northern European countries consists of Denmark,
Finland, Norway, and Sweden; the group of southern European countries includes Spain,
Portugal, Italy, and Greece; and the group of Anglo-Saxon countries consists of Australia,
Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, plus Japan. The
Other category includes Republic of Korea, Mexico, and Turkey. Former socialist countries
(Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and the Slovak Republic) and Germany are excluded
here because of the unavailability of data on the country of origin of a large share of their
migrants. As shown by figure I.1, the MENA region ranks second in Continental European
countries behind the group of high-income countries, but only third and fourth in Northern and
Southern European countries, respectively. In the two other groups of OECD countries, migrants
from the MENA region account for a marginal share of the migrant population.

However, one needs to be cautious with regard to migration statistics. Quoting CARIM’s (the
Euro-Mediterranean Consortium for Applied Research on International Migration)
Mediterranean Migration 2005 Report,
       “With no exception in the case of Med-MENA countries, migrants counted by country of
       origin are in excess compared with those counted by host countries. In the European
       Union, there is an aggregated difference of 2.5 million migrants for five Med-MENA
       countries of origin for which calculation is possible (Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia
                                                                 -6-



            and Turkey). 5 This figure reflects a variety of situations, including dual citizens, former
            migrants who have now left the country, and irregular migrants.” 6

Second, destination strongly varies with origin (see figure I.2). In Continental and Southern
Europe, respectively, 90 percent and 77 percent of migrants from the MENA Region come from
a Maghreb country, while this share is less than 10 percent in Northern Europe and in the group
of Anglo-Saxon countries. The sudden rapid growth of North African immigration to Southern
European countries such as Italy and Spain is the result of a number of factors among which the
interruption of immigration in the countries that traditionally received North Africans. 7 Quoting
Giubilaro,
        “Initially, the absence of legal requirements defining conditions of entry and residence in
        the Southern European countries, together with the manpower requirements of certain
        sectors, facilitated this movement, which could subsequently be kept going by means of
        migration networks. However, under pressure from their European partners, Italy and
        Spain have adopted a legal system in respect of immigration, which is comparable to that
        of the rest of Europe. With this new situation, the flows would appear to be stabilizing.”

In the group of Anglo-Saxon countries, as in the group of former socialist countries, more than
40 percent of migrants from the MENA region come from the Mashreq. In Northern Europe and
in the Republic Korea, Mexico, and Turkey, nearly two-thirds of the migrants from the MENA
Region are either Iraqis or Iranians. (A more detailed picture of the distribution of migrants from
the MENA Region by country of origin is provided in annex A, tables A4, A5, and A6 for some
selected OECD countries.)

Third, the share of highly educated migrants from MENA countries in the total stock of highly
educated migrants is rather low in most OECD countries (see figure I.3 and annex A, table A7,
column 4). Migrants from MENA countries appear to be less educated on average than other
migrants in seven out of the eight aforementioned countries in which they represent more than 10
percent of the total stock of migrants (Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain,
Sweden, and Norway). In these countries, indeed, the share of highly educated migrants from
MENA countries in the total stock of highly educated migrants is lower than the share of
migrants from MENA countries in the total stock of migrants. In Belgium, for example,
individuals born in MENA countries represent 14.6 percent of the foreign born, but among them,
the highly educated represent only 10.1 percent of the highly educated foreign born.

Fourth, among migrants from MENA countries, the share of the highly educated strongly varies
by country of destination and reflects differences in migration policy regimes (see figure I.3 and
annex A, table A7, column 3). It is rather low in most countries of the European Economic Area
except for the former Socialist countries (Hungary, Poland, the Slovak Republic, and the Czech
Republic) and the Anglo-Saxon countries (Ireland and the United Kingdom). It is rather high in
North America (Canada and the United States). Thus, countries where migrants from the MENA
Region account for a marginal share of the migrant population are also those where migrants
from the MENA region are the most educated.

Flows

Even though data on migratory flows are scant, the available evidence suggests that the share of
migrants from MENA countries in the migratory flows to OECD countries has been rather low
and rather stable for the last 10 years, except for a few European countries—that is, Sweden, the
Netherlands, and Norway (see figure I.4 and annex A, table A8).

Migration from MENA to OECD Countries: A Sending Countries’ Perspective

General Stylized Facts

Adopting the sending countries’ perspective, the four following features emerge from the data.

First, as shown by figure 1.5, expatriation rates from MENA to OECD countries are generally
rather low, either because emigration flows are directed to non-OECD countries (Egypt is one
such example, with migration flows mostly directed to Arab oil countries) or because emigration
flows are rather low on the whole (this is particularly the case of labor-importing countries such
as Libya, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Republic of Yemen). 8 Exceptions include the
Maghreb countries that have strong historical links to Europe and Lebanon.

Second, emigration from the Maghreb to OECD countries is strongly concentrated toward
Continental Europe, while emigration from the other MENA countries is focused on Anglo-
Saxon countries (see figure I.6). This second stylized fact suggests that past colonial links and
common language are strong pull factors, as further developed in part III.

 Expatriation rate from country of origin i to OECD countries is calculated by dividing the expatriate population
age 25 and over from that country by the native-born population age 25 and over of the same country.

Third, available data on the size of the brain drain by MENA country exhibit stronger disparities.
In figure I.7, brain drain is measured by the highly educated expatriation rate, that is, the number
of individuals with tertiary education (13 years and above) born in country j and living in an
OECD country, divided by the total number of individuals with tertiary education born in
country j. 9 Three sets of estimates have been reported, based on different data sources. As
suggested by the figures, emigration of highly educated workers particularly affects the Islamic
Republic of Iran, Lebanon, and the Maghreb countries. In contrast, the brain drain is rather low
in the Gulf States. Compared with other developing regions belonging to the middle-income
group, based on the World Bank classification, the size of the brain drain is higher in the MENA
Region (10.5 percent) than in Latin America (7.5 percent), East Asia and the Pacific (6.1
percent), and Eastern Europe and Central Asia (3.9 percent). 10

Fourth, for all MENA countries, the share of the highly educated in the total stock of migrants
has increased since 1990 (see figure I.8). This evolution is due to both the adoption of selective
migration policies biased toward the highly-skilled in receiving countries and to the increasing
proportion of educated individuals in the sending ones.




9
  In what follows, the diagnosis on the size of the brain drain by country of origin is biased, because several major
destinations such as the Persian Gulf countries are ignored. In particular, given the importance of migration flows
from Mashreq to Gulf countries, the size of the brain drain in these countries of origin is likely to be much higher.
10
   Because of the significant size of their brain drain, very small countries and islands were removed from the
different subgroups (Guyana and Suriname, for example, were dropped).

Country Facts

Algeria

Emigration from Algeria is concentrated toward France: 84.2 percent of Algerians residing in an
OECD country live in France, 11 despite a diversification of migration flows from Algeria in the
last 30 years (see table I.1).

In terms of qualifications, the composition of Algerian migrant stocks is highly varied between
Europe and North America: respectively, 84.1 percent and 72.8 percent of Algerian migrants are
highly educated in Canada and the United States, but only 10 percent in Europe’s main
destination countries (Belgium, France, and Spain). Two factors explain this diversity. First, the

earlier the migrating cohort, the less educated it tends to be. Second, migration and labor-market
policies are generally biased toward the highly educated in North America.

However, compared with other MENA countries (Egypt, Jordan, Libya, and so on), the
expatriation rate of the highly educated is rather high, with estimates varying from 9.4 percent to
18.0 percent (see figure I.7). Because migrant stocks are particularly large in France, even
though the share of highly educated Algerian migrants is low, France has drained many highly
educated Algerians: on average, one can estimate that about five to six highly educated Algerians
out of 100 migrantsreside in France.

Morocco

Moroccan nationals are predominantly found in France (38.8 percent according to Docquier and
Marfouk (DM) figures and 45.8 percent from Dumont and Lemaître’s (DL), followed by Spain
(DM: 19.8 percent; DL: 18.2 percent), the Netherlands (DM: 13.5 percent), and Italy (DM: 9.9
percent). Compared with the Tunisians and Algerians, the Moroccans are widely distributed over
all European countries. This characteristic, already manifest in the seventies, has been further
accentuated in recent years.

In France, Moroccans are largely low-educated individuals with only primary education (79
percent DM), whereas this share is 66 percent in Spain where individuals with secondary level
education represent 28.6 percent of the total stock of Moroccan migrants (compared with 7.8
percent and 16 percent for France and the Netherlands, respectively). However, the same contrast
as for Algeria emerges between Europe and North America: Moroccan migrants are highly
educated in Canada (72.2 percent) and the United States (64.2 percent).

The expatriation rate of the highly educated is rather high with regard to other MENA countries
(on average 9.9 percent, according to DM), with estimates varying from 17 percent to 19.5
percent.

Tunisia

Emigration from Tunisia is mainly directed to France (DM: 69.9 percent; DL: 78 percent)
followed by Italy (DM: 12.2 percent; DL: 9 percent) and Germany (DM: 4.9 percent).

In terms of qualification, the stock of Tunisian nationals residing in the traditional European host
countries is predominantly made of individuals with only primary education (DM: 80 percent in
France; 78.1 percent in Italy).

The highly educated population’s expatriation rate ranges from 12.5 percent to 21.4 percent,
which is also quite high, compared with other MENA countries.

Emigration from Egypt is mainly directed to the Gulf area (see table I.2). Meanwhile, since the
early 1960s, some Egyptians have migrated permanently to the Australia, Canada, the United
States, and Western European countries (France, Italy, and the United Kingdom). The preferred
destination is the United States, where about two out of five permanent Egyptian migrants are
found, followed by Australia and Canada, where about one-fourth of permanent Egyptian
migrants live.

In terms of qualifications, most Egyptians migrants residing in North America are highly
educated. The pattern is different in the main European destination countries (France, Italy, and
the United Kingdom); nearly a third of Egyptian migrants there have only primary education.

Brain drain is less than 5 percent. However, it is likely that the estimated size of the brain drain
for Egypt would be much higher if the number of highly skilled Egyptian expatriates living in
Persian Gulf countries were included in the calculation.

Jordan

Among OECD countries, Jordan migrants are predominantly found in the United States (66.4
percent), followed by Germany (9.5 percent), Canada (5.5 percent), and Australia (4.1 percent).

In terms of qualifications, most Jordan migrants to North America and Australia have completed
tertiary education. This pattern is different in Germany and the United Kingdom, where more
than one-third of Jordanian migrants have only primary education.
                                               - 15 -



On the whole, brain drain is rather limited, with estimates varying between 3.3 percent and 7.2
percent. As with Egypt, however, the size of the brain drain would be much higher, were skilled
labor exports to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states accounted for.

Lebanon

Among OECD countries, Lebanese migrants are predominantly found in North America (Canada
and the United States) and Australia, followed by some Western European countries (France,
Germany, and Sweden). The preferred destination is the United States, where about one-third of
Lebanese migrants live.

In terms of qualifications, the share of low-educated Lebanese migrants is rather low in the
United States (11.4 percent), but rather high elsewhere (between 30 and 42 percent).

Brain drain is very high. It is estimated that about 4 out of 10 highly educated Lebanese reside in
an OECD country.

Syria

Syrian nationals are mostly found in the United States (DM: 40.7 percent), then in Germany
(11.4 percent), Canada (10.9 percent), Sweden (9.3 percent), and France (8 percent). In 2000,
Syrian nationals in these countries had remarkably similar characteristics.

Differences appear in terms of qualification structures across the five dominant countries of
Syrian emigration: the share of poorly educated migrants is significantly lower in the United
States (16.8 percent) than in Germany (35.7 percent), Canada (29.5 percent), Sweden (40
percent), or France (32.4 percent). Hence, the share of highly educated Syrian migrants is higher
in the United States (52 percent) but also in Canada (57 percent).

Brain drain indicators show that Syrian highly educated emigration is rather low, ranging from
only 4.4 percent to 6.1 percent.

GCC States

Labor-importing GCC States do not send many migrants to OECD countries. Rather, they have
been the main recipients of migrants from Egypt, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Syria, and
the Republic of Yemen moving to the Gulf primarily to take up employment. An overview of
migrant stocks from these countries in OECD countries, computed from Docquier and Marfouk’s
database, is provided in annex A, table A23.

Other MENA Countries (see annex A, tables A24–A33)

Djibouti

Few migrants from Djibouti reside in OECD countries (DM: 1 638 individuals in 2000).

Islamic Republic of Iran
                                                - 16 -




Emigration from the Islamic Republic of Iran to OECD countries is mainly directed to North
America and some Western European countries (marginally France, the Netherlands, Sweden,
and the United Kingdom). The preferred destination is the United States, where about one out of
two permanent Iranian migrants live, followed by Germany and Canada, where about one-fifth
of permanent Iranian migrants are found.

In terms of qualifications, three out of four Iranian migrants residing in North America are highly
educated. The pattern is different in Western Europe.

Brain drain is rather high, with estimates varying from 8 percent to 18 percent.

Iraq

Emigration from Iraq to OECD countries is directed to the United States and some Western
European countries (Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom).

In terms of qualifications, no clear pattern emerges. The share of highly educated Iraqi migrants
is slightly higher in Australia, Canada, and the United States than in other destination countries.

Brain drain is rather high (6 percent to 11 percent).

Libya

Libyan migrants are found almost equally in the United States (DM: 33.2 percent) and in the
United Kingdom (DM: 32.4 percent). Their shares drop to 7 percent, 6 percent, and 5.9 percent
in Germany, Australia, and Canada, respectively.

In the United States, the proportion of educated Libyan migrants is overwhelming (80.5 percent)
as compared with that of the United Kingdom (42.7 percent) or Germany (27.5 percent).
Consequently, the share of poorly educated Libyan migrants is low in the United States (2.1
percent) compared with the other seven main countries of emigration (on average 32 percent for
Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, and Switzerland);

Brain drain is low at only 2.4 percent. However, this is consistent with the rather low
expatriation rate of the Libyan population age 15 and over (1.8 percent, with an average of 2.8
percent for MENA countries).

Occupied Palestinian Territory

Within OECD, nearly 8 emigrants from the Palestinian territory out of 10 are found in North
America, mainly in the United States.

In terms of education, Palestinian migrants in North America are more educated on average than
those in Europe.

The Republic of Yemen

As with Egypt, emigration from the Republic of Yemen is mainly directed to the Gulf area (see
table I.2). Yemenite nationals residing in OECD countries (20,949 in 2000) are predominantly
found in the United States (DM: 55.4 percent) and then in the United Kingdom (28.3 percent).
The remaining migrants are divided among Germany (4.3 percent), Canada (3.3 percent), France
(2.8 percent), and Australia (1.4 percent).

The structure of qualification of the Yemenite migrants is almost similar across the United States
and the United Kingdom. Additionally, the shares of highly and poorly educated individuals is
almost equal in these two main host countries (30 percent, against 31 percent in the United
States, and 35 percent, against 38 percent in the United Kingdom).

Brain drain is 6 percent (according to DM).

                  II. GRAVITY MODEL ANALYSES OF MIGRATION TRENDS FROM
                                MENA TO OECD COUNTRIES

This section empirically investigates the influence of economic, demographic, and political
factors on the size and composition of migration flows from MENA to OECD countries in recent
years. The focus is on both the supply and demand determinants of immigration patterns. The
following questions are addressed: What are the main driving factors of migration from MENA
to OECD countries? Are these drivers mainly economic or demographic? Given destination
countries’ restrictive immigration policies, do flows respond to economic incentives? Is there a
“welfare magnet effect”?

The section is structured as follows. The first part briefly surveys the economic literature on
international migration and discusses the role of potential key determinants of migration. The
second part describes the data sets. The third part analyzes, using gravity models, the
determinants of bilateral migration flows from MENA to OECD countries. We first run cross-
sectional regressions using as dependent variables expatriation rates by education group in 2000,
computed from Docquier and Marfouk’s database. We then run panel data regressions using
yearly data on immigrant flows to 14 OECD countries by country of origin between 1990 and
2002.

A Review of Migration Theories and Determinants 12

In what follows, we look at the central elements of the theoretical issues in relation to
international migration from LDC to industrial countries, as well as some special aspects that we
wish to consider in our econometric analysis.

Traditional Explanations

In the neoclassical approach at a macro level, migration is a consequence of differentiated
economic opportunities across regions or countries, especially earnings differentials. 13 Migration

12
   This section is mainly based on Rotte and Vogler’s (1998) and Constant and Zimmermann’s (2005) literature
review.
                                                - 18 -



is viewed as the optimal allocation of labor into regions of highest productivity, leading to an
equalization of wages if there are no migration costs.

In the human capital approach to migration, Sjaastad (1962) gives up the assumption of
homogeneous labor. Depending on their skill levels, individuals calculate the present discounted
value of expected returns on their human capital in every region or country. Migration occurs if
the returns, net of discounted migration costs, are larger in a region or country than those in the
country of origin. Every individual evaluates the returns and costs in a different way so that
migration may be worthwhile for some individuals in a country and not for others. As a result, in
the analysis of migration patterns, one should not only pay attention to aggregate labor market
variables (such as wage and unemployment difference), but also consider the importance of the
heterogeneity of individuals.

Nearly all empirical studies using aggregated data find a statistically significant positive effect of
income or wages in the destination country, or of the income and wage differential between the
sending and the receiving countries, and a negative effect of income and wages in the sending
country. Evidence on the influence of unemployment rates both in the sending and in the
receiving countries is more varied. Some studies conform to the predictions of the Harris-Todaro
model and find a positive influence of the probability of employment in the destination country
on the migration decision. 14 Other studies find that individuals are attracted to regions with
shortage of jobs.

In our empirical investigation, difference in economic opportunities between origin and host
countries, especially income and unemployment rates, are captured by the levels of gross
domestic product (GDP) per capita in both the host and origin countries, as well as
unemployment rates in the destination country.

Labor Market Disequilibrium

The labor market disequilibrium issue has to deal with the question of whether and how the
native population is affected by immigrants. 15 The evaluation crucially depends on the
conditions in the labor markets of the host countries. These markets may be either competitive or
in disequilibrium—that is, labor supply equals labor demand or not, respectively. A further
decisive aspect is that the labor force in the host country is likely to be heterogeneous and of
diverse quality. Then, the immigration impact depends on whether immigrants are uneducated or
educated. This is the reason why it is important to understand the determinants of emigration
rates of different groups of individuals, namely, the educated and uneducated workers.
Disequilibrium situations in labor markets may occur when there are institutional constraints in
the market for unskilled labor, such as union wages, minimum wages, or transfers like social
assistance, or when the education system is not able to provide the necessary supply of workers
for the skilled labor markets. Another issue is whether educated and uneducated workers are
complements or substitutes to the local population. A reasonable (and standard) assumption is

that high-educated and low-educated workers are complements, which implies that one group
becomes more productive (and relatively scarce) when the input of the other group is increased.

Self-Selection of Migrants

Emigrants are not a random sample of a country’s population. This aspect has already played an
important role in the brain-drain debate concerning emigration of the highly educated and its
negative consequences for sending country’s economy. The question of self-selection of
migrants gained renewed attention with analyses of the performance of migrants in the host labor
market. 16 A popular model in the migration literature to analyze the self-selection of migrants is
the Roy model. 17 The basic idea can be summarized as follows: When looking at who chooses to
emigrate to the United States, one ready-made answer is that workers from low-wage countries
will immigrate. This may be true on average, but it is probably too simple. The workers
immigrating to the United States are probably not a random subset of the sending country’s
workforce. Rather, one should expect that potential migrants make some rough comparison of
their wages in the home country and their expected wages in the United States. On average, one
would expect those who emigrate to have higher expected earnings in the United States than in
the home country and vice versa for those who stay.

Hence, the relative wage on observable and unobservable abilities in home and host country
determines the kind of selection, while the level of income affects the volume of migration. In
our econometric analysis, we shall introduce a proxy for the potential reward for observable and
unobservable abilities in the host country, together with GDP per capita levels, to control for
both effects. A natural belief is that we may observe differentiated effects of, for instance, the
private rate of returns to schooling in the host country on the emigration rates of high-educated
and low-educated workers.

Push and Pull Factors of Migration

In public discussion about present or future international migration from developing countries,
the term “migration pressure” is often used. 18 Some authors define migration pressure as the
difference in the numbers of people who are willing to migrate under current circumstances and
those individuals the country of destination is prepared to accept. From the perspective of the
sending country, Bruni and Venturini (1995) define migration pressure as an excess supply of
labor regarding the demand of labor. However, the problem remains that excess labor supply
does not necessarily result in emigration. Schaeffer (1993), therefore, defines migration pressure
in terms of effective demand.

The general consensus is that several factors in the sending and the destination countries
determine whether an existing “migration potential” results in actual migration. For factors
concerning the home country, one refers to the so-called “push” factors; for those concerning the
host country, one uses the term “pull” factors. Important push factors for developing countries

include population growth and the corresponding unemployment, poverty, and political
instability. Pull factors are mainly high wages in the receiving countries, their social security
systems, and political stability, as well as a potential past colonial relationship or common
culture between host and origin countries. The generosity of the welfare state, therefore, may
play an important role in migrants’ decision of choosing country of destination. This is the so
called welfare magnet effect. To control for these push and pull effects as determinants of
migratory flows, we will apply bilateral “cultural distance” indicators between the host and
origin countries (colonial relationship, common language), as well as variables indicative of
potential demographic pressure, such as population density, urban population growth, or the age
structure of the populations. We also account for political and civil factors in the sending
country, as well as use proxies for the welfare magnet effect in the host country.

Most attention regarding persistent migration is directed to the so-called network effects. 19
Existing connections between individuals in a host country and friends and relatives left at home
increase the likelihood of the latter following the former to the country of destination. In that
case, network effects may counteract cultural distance, if the concerned ethnic group is already
present in the destination country. Indeed, migrants’ links to their home country reduce the costs
and uncertainty for further potential migrants. Moreover, these contacts in the destination
country facilitate accommodation and job search for follow-up migrants, which also increases
migration incentives. A few studies show that network variables always have a significant and
positive impact on migratory flows. 20

From this brief literature review, we now turn to the following questions: How much do the
“pure” economic factors, like differences in income and unemployment levels, returns to
education, or labor productivity growth, explain migration behavior? How much is explained by
other factors such as immigration policies, social networks, cultural and linguistic distance,
threat to personal freedom (such as the level of political rights), and civil liberties in home
country?

Data Collection

Cross-Sectional Analysis

Our cross-sectional analysis builds on a new comprehensive and consistent database on
international migration. 21 The data set (hereafter DM05) describes the stocks of immigrants in all
OECD countries by education attainment in 1990 and 2000. 22 As Docquier and Marfouk argue,
“regarding statistics, it has long been recognized that migration flow data are less reliable than
stock data, due to the impossibility of evaluating emigration and return migration movements.” 23
Migrants are defined as all working-age (25 and over) foreign-born individuals living in an
OECD country. Using the category of working-age population maximizes the comparability of
the immigration population with data on education attainment in the source countries. The

foreign-born concept (defined as an individual born abroad with foreign citizenship at birth)
better captures the decision to emigrate, compared with citizenship used alone. Indeed, in some
receiving countries, immigrants’ children often keep their foreign citizenship. 24 However, in a
limited number of cases, immigrants are classified only by citizenship (Germany, Greece, Italy,
Japan, and the Republic of Korea). 25

Three levels of schooling are distinguished. Low-educated workers are those with primary
education (up to eight years of schooling); medium educated workers are those with secondary
education (9 to 12 years of schooling); and high-educated workers are those with tertiary
education (13 or more years of schooling). This definition of education categories is consistent
with Barro and Lee’s data set on education across countries, which is based on the International
Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). 26

The preceding literature review and discussions on the determinants of migration have shown
that what really matters in the migration process are stocks instead of flows. Indeed, there are
many reasons to believe that, with international migration, we are dealing with a disequilibrium
situation, as there might be significant rationing. In this context, observed flows may be part of
an adjustment to a desired stock of migration. Therefore, rather than estimating emigration flows
over a 10-year period (by retrenching the stocks of immigrants in 1990 from the stocks of
immigrants in 2000), we prefer to specify our model to explain the stocks of migrants at the end
of the period and to include lagged values of our considered determinants of migration as right-
hand-side variables.

For our purpose, we thus compute expatriation rates by education level s for the year 2000 for
each couple of receiving country i and sending country j in the following way:

                         Stock s ij 2000

         ij , 2000   =                                                                                (II.1)
                       Population sj 2000

After eliminating observations with missing values or outliers, the sample of bilateral
expatriation rates for 2000 amounts to 4,650 couples of LDC-OECD countries, of which 570 are
MENA-OECD couples. Other sending subregions include Sub-Saharan Africa (1,410 couples),
South Asia (240), Latin America and the Caribbean (900), Europe and Central Asia (780), and
East Asia and the Pacific (630). The list of sending and receiving countries is reported in annex
B, table B1.

Panel Data Approach

Our panel data approach makes use of annual migration flows coming mainly from the MPI Web
site, an “independent think-tank dedicated to the study of the movement of people worldwide.” 27

To complete MPI’s database, we also use some of the data contained in the most recent OECD’s
annual reports on Trends in International Migration or those made available on the Web sites of
destination countries’ National Statistical Institutes.

Our two alternative data sets on bilateral immigration stocks and flows are then combined with
economic and noneconomic data on both the origin and destination country of each country
couple to estimate gravity models.

All the bilateral geographic data (distance and dummies for land border, colony, island, and
common language) are taken from Glick and Rose (2002). This data set has been updated for
many missing data on LDCs and OECD countries.

Most data on macroeconomic variables such as GDP per capita (in purchasing power parity,
PPP), country population, age-dependency ratios, population density, urban and total population
growth, unemployment rates, and literacy rates come from the World Development Indicators
and the Penn World Table, release 7.0. Information on origin and destination countries’ share of
young population comes from the Population Division of the United Nations. Information on
productivity growth comes from OECD’s annual Employment Outlook reports.

Demographic factors include population density (PopDens) in destination and source countries,
age-dependency ratio in destination and source countries AgeDepend), the share of the
population ages 15 to 24 (1524Share) in destination and source countries, and the urban
population growth (UrbPopGrowth) in destination and source countries. The higher the relative
population growth in the source country and the larger the proportion of the population in the
younger adult age-group, the larger the migration pressure is expected. We also include two
variables (Literacy and MeanEduc) reflecting the education level of the source and destination
countries.

To complement the database for some countries, we collected unemployment rates from the
OECD’s annual Employment Outlook reports for the years 1990–2000. In particular, for the year
1994, we use unemployment rates by education level following Barro and Lee’s classification
(that is, regrouping the different ISCED’s schooling levels into the three main categories
described above).

Data on schooling participation by country are taken from Barro and Lee’s data set (2000). We
also collected the estimated Mincerian private return to education specific to each OECD country
from Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004). The few missing returns in their study for some
European countries were replaced by estimates made available by the PURE Project of the
European Commission on the returns to education in European countries. 28

Since political pressure in the source country may influence migration, we include two variables
(PolRights and CivLib), which measure the level of political rights and civil liberties in source
countries. Each country is assigned a rating for political rights and a rating for civil liberties
based on a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 representing the highest degree of rights or freedom and 7 the

lowest one. These two variables come from Freedom House’s Freedom in the World country
ratings.

Finally, we include a variable (PubExpComp) assumed to capture potential pull factors relating
to the “welfare magnet” theories as presented by Borjas (1987, 1999). It is a measure of the level
of public social expenditure devoted to unemployment compensation expressed as a percentage
of GDP in destination countries. According to the welfare magnet theory, we expect higher
migration flows into countries with relatively higher levels of public social expenditure. This
variable stems from OECD’s annual Employment Outlook reports.

Descriptive statistics for the data sets are given in annex B, table B2.

The Determinants of Migration: A Gravity Approach

The basic gravity model has been used several times to analyze gross trade flows between
countries. 29 It assumes that those flows depend on the size of each of the two trading countries
(measured as their GDP) and any determinant of bilateral trade cost, such as distance, contiguity,
trade agreements, and so on. Only recently, the gravity approach has been used to explain
bilateral migratory flows. 30 In its most basic form, the gravity equation explains the total
emigration from one country of origin to a country of destination by using the economic
characteristics (population and GDP per capita) of each of the two countries and the bilateral
geographic characteristics (distance, common border, access to sea, common language).
Occasionally, if the data allow it, additional characteristics of the countries of origin and
destination are included to account for immigration policies and other relevant characteristics. In
this respect, our empirical strategy follows the general guidelines described in the previous
studies. In addition, we stress the impact of new determinants of migratory flows, such as
demand factors in the host country, and their potential pull effects.

Cross-Sectional Data Analysis

Empirical models

We run two types of regression using alternative specifications for the dependent variable (total
expatriation rate, expatriation rate of the low educated, expatriation rate of the medium educated,
and expatriation rate of the high educated).

To analyze carefully the effect of bilateral characteristics (such as distance, having a common
border or a common language, and so on) on expatriation rates by level of education, we first run
a basic gravity equation in which all characteristics of the countries of origin and destination are
controlled for through the inclusion of origin and destination dummies. The basic regression is as
follows:

     m s ij , 2000 = c1 log(distance ij ) + c2 Borderij + c3 Language ij + c4Colony ij + c5 Island ij + α i + β j + ν ij (II.2)

where msij is the expatriation rate from j to i of individuals belonging to the education group s; αi
is a set of 28 country of destination fixed effects and βj is a set of country-of-origin fixed effects.
The other variables are relative to each couple (i,j).

The same regression is run separately for each skill group using two alternative samples: in the
first sample (hereafter the OLDC sample, for Other Least Developed Countries), all countries of
origin are included, except countries from the MENA Region (in this case, βj is a set of 127
country-of-origin fixed effects), while in the second sample (hereafter MENA), only countries
from the MENA Region are included (in this case, βj is a set of 19 country-of-origin fixed
effects).

Country-specific effects enlighten us as to whether differentiated country impacts exist on the
migration pattern. Naturally, these fixed effects are difficult to interpret, because they capture a
wide range of country-specific effects, such as differences in income levels and economic
incentives, employment opportunities, demographic pressure, and so on.

To identify the impact of all these variables on the magnitude of expatriation rates, we run a
second set of regressions in which we explicitly introduce GDP per capita in 1995 (in PPP) for
the host (i) and the origin (j) countries, and new determinants of migration reflecting both the
labor market and demographic structures of each country. The vector of regressors include the
private return to education in i, unemployment rates by educational level in i, the labor
productivity growth in i, the average years of schooling among the population of country i, the
literacy rate in j, the population density in i and j, the share of population age 15–24 in i and j,
the age dependency ratio in i and j, and the urban population growth in i and j. Finally, we
account for institutional incentives to migrate by including the share of public expenditure
related to unemployment compensation in i and two variables measuring the level of political
rights and civil liberties in origin countries.

In this type of specification, country fixed effects cannot be identified. However, regional
dummies regrouping host and origin countries are added to the vector of regressors. These
regional dummies are introduced to test whether migration within particular regions is more
intense, once bilateral and country-specific characteristics are controlled for. The regression is as
follows:


m s ij , 2000 = c1 log(distanceij ) + c2 Borderij + c3 Languageij + c4 Colonyij + c5 Island ij + φi + χ j
        + δ 1 log(GDPpci ) + δ 2 log(GDPpc j ) + δ 3 PopDensi + δ 4 PopDens j

where φi and χ j are respectively subregions of destination fixed effects and subregions of origin
fixed effects.

As for specification (II.1), the same regression is run separately for each skill group using the
two alternative samples defined above. The models are estimated using ordinary least squares
(OLS) with reported standard errors being robust to clustering, because pairs of countries are
likely to be highly dependent over time.

Empirical results

Annex B, tables B3 and B4, report the estimation results of the two alternative gravity models
presented above.

In table B3, columns (1) and (2) report the estimated coefficients of specification (II.1), which is
separately estimated for MENA-OECD and OLDC-OECD couples and for each education group.
The other six specifications report the coefficients for the same regression run separately for each
education group (primary, secondary, and tertiary levels), that is, allowing the explanatory
variables to have different effects on the expatriation rate of each group. In this setting, 16
percent to 42 percent of the variation in expatriation rates across couples is explained by
geographic and cultural proximity variables and country-specific effects. 31

In Table B3, columns (1) and (2) show that the bilateral variables are not always significant.
While distance between two countries and past colonial relationship have the expected sign and
enter significantly into the two regressions, sharing a border and speaking a common language
are statistically significant in only one of the two specifications. Turning to the variable
indicating whether there is an island (or two) in the couple, results show that it is never
significant.

Considering separate regressions for each education group, few interesting indications emerge.
First, the two groups of intermediate and highly educated workers in the OLDC sample are
sensitive (negatively) to the presence of a common border, although the less educated are not. By
contrast, expatriation rates from the MENA region are not sensitive to the presence of a common
border between host and origin country, which is not a surprising result given the limited number
of such cases. Second, the linguistic commonality plays a role for only the most educated
workers, whose jobs may involve professional skills for which mastering a language is
important. Last, the effects of geographic proximity and historical links are significant in all
education groups. For countries of the MENA region, however, the group of highly educated
workers appears to be less sensitive to distance than the other two groups, suggesting that highly
educated people are better equipped to seize good job opportunities in distant countries.

Table B4 reports the results obtained for specification (II.2) which replaces the country fixed
effects by country-specific effects. Regional dummies regrouping host and origin countries are
also included.

31
   The hypothesis of joint nullity of the country fixed effects is rejected at the usual confidence intervals, suggesting
that the specific conditions in the origin and destination countries play a significant role in explaining expatriation
rates.
                                                        - 26 -




A similar grouping as that proposed by Esping-Andersen (1990) was adopted to compute the
regional dummies: the group of Northern European countries includes Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Norway, and Sweden; that of Anglo-Saxon countries includes Australia, Canada,
Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States; that of Continental European
countries includes Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and
Switzerland; and that of Southern European countries includes Greece, Italy, Portugal, and
Spain.

The interesting aspect of the regressions reported in Table B4 is that we added a wide range of
lagged country-specific effects (referring either to 1990, 1995, or the period from 1990 to 2000),
such as income and social indicators (GDP per capita, education or literacy), economic
incentives (returns to education, labor productivity growth), employment opportunities
(unemployment rates for each education level), various indicators of demographic pressure, and
institutional incentives to migrate.32

Let us first focus on the explanatory power of the different models. Respectively, 31 percent and
54 percent of the variability in expatriation rates is explained in the OLDC and MENA samples
(compare table B4, columns 1 and 2). At first sight, a noticeable result is that pull factors are
often more significant than push factors despite immigration restrictions in most destination
countries. This is the case with the impact of the GDP per capita in the host country, which is
always highly significant and positive in all regressions, while the effect of the GDP per capita in
the origin country is not significantly different from zero in almost all models. The only
exception appears in column (4), where the dependent variable is the expatriation rate of low-
educated workers originating from the MENA Region. In this regression, per capita GDP in the
sending country operates as a push effect. This result might be consistent with the idea that lower
levels of per capita GDP in the source country both increase incentives to leave and make it
difficult to overcome poverty constraints. Expatriation rate is lower for the least educated
individuals because they are too poor to afford the fixed costs of migration. Indeed, further
regressions (not reported to save space) revealed that, in the case of the MENA Region, there is a
significant negative sensitivity to distance in GDP per capita between host and origin countries
for the less educated group. In other words, the more distant the countries in terms of income per
capita, the lower the emigration rate of the least educated individuals. This is consistent with the
idea that fixed migration costs constitute huge barriers to migration, especially for low-educated
people originating from poor countries. These fixed out-of-pocket money costs, such as
transportation costs and housing, are generally considered important in human capital migration
models. 33


32
   Due to missing data for many countries, we were forced to make trade-offs between accuracy of the proxy, data
availability, and preservation of the size of our initial samples, as much as possible. Some variables were then
chosen to the detriment of others to save on degrees of freedom (this is the case for the literacy rate instead of the
mean education for country j). In table B4, many couples of countries present in previous regressions are
nonetheless dropped from the estimation because of missing variables. Among OECD countries, note that the
regressions are performed without the Czech Republic, Hungary, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Poland, the
Slovak Republic, and Turkey. For this reason, results in table B4 should not be compared with those presented in
table B3.

All the variables introduced to account for demographic pressures in host and sending countries
are found significant in almost all regressions. Here, again, a striking result is that demographic
characteristics in the destination country generally have a much more significant impact on the
size of expatriation rates than those in the origin country. In particular, the old-age dependency
ratio (dependents to working-age population, calculated as the number of people age 65 or more,
divided by the number of people ages 15–64) and the urban population growth in the origin
country are found to play no role at all. Population density and the share of the population age
15–24 in the origin country are found to be significant, however, but not in all specifications.
More specifically, in both OLDC and MENA samples, the expatriation rates of the most
educated migrants are also the most reactive ones to the population density in the origin country
(compare columns (7) and (8) versus columns (3) and (4). One interpretation of this finding is
that the brain drain is responsive to demographic pressure in the origin country.

Turning to the demographic characteristics of the destination country, population density, urban
population growth, and the age dependency ratio are all found to significantly increase the size of
the expatriation rate, while the share of the population age 15–24 is found to decrease it.
Estimated coefficients for the population density variable are always larger using the OLDC
sample but, in both cases, the effect of population density in the host country is stronger on
expatriation of the highly educated. The same holds true for the effects of urban population
growth and of the age dependency ratio.

As expected, the share of population age 15–24 in the host country exerts a negative effect on
expatriation rates. This result might be explained by the demand side of international migration:
destination countries with a rising share of elderly (and a decreasing share of young individuals)
in their population might be tempted to “import” population from other countries to compensate
for population aging. 34 Conversely, the significant positive sign found on this variable in origin
countries in the regression of expatriation rates of migrants originating from the OLDCs would
seem to reflect the supply side of international migration, namely the push effect—or
demographic pressure—exerted by the share of young people in the origin country.

Another notable finding concerns the private returns to education in the destination country. This
variable is indeed found to be highly significant in all regressions. The size of the estimated
coefficients also indicates that the reward for education is an important determinant of
expatriation rates across countries. Moreover, not surprisingly, the magnitude of the effect
increases with the education category. Hence, this original finding is all the more accurate for the
most educated workers for whom access to qualified and well-paid jobs is probably the most
important motivation behind migration. This a key issue in the context of international
transferability of human capital. 35 Indeed, human capital acquired at home may not be fully
transferable to the host country. Then, it is expected that the lower the international
transferability of human capital, the higher the earnings disadvantage of the migrants at the time
of migration. However, our results suggest that careful comparison by the individuals of the
returns to education across potential host countries is an important factor in the decision to
migrate to one country instead of another. This is somehow a self-selection or self-correcting

trends may entail in OECD countries.

behavior, that is, educated individuals make decisions related to the most appropriate
transferability of their acquired human capital. In the case of the MENA Region, the impact of
the return to education in the host country is sizeable for the least educated category (above that
estimated using the OLDC sample), while it remains larger for the most educated group of
migrants (but far below that estimated using the OLDC sample).

Let us now turn to the impact of the unemployment rates by education category in the host
country. Introducing these variables in the models is revealing because, according to Harris and
Todaro’s (1970) theory, low (high) unemployment rate in the destination (source) country will
cause higher immigration flows. Besides, we are able to disentangle this effect by education
level, because we benefit from differentiated rates in host countries in 1994 across three
education groups, which correspond to our three categories of migrants. 36 Interestingly, the
traditional prediction mentioned above is not always supported by the data. For instance, the
unemployment rate among low-educated workers in the host country exerts a positive impact on
the expatriation rate of low-educated individuals originating from the MENA region. This result
might be explained by the existence in the sample of host countries with both high
unemployment rates and generous welfare allowances. Because they have restricted access to
unemployment benefits and social assistance, immigrants have a lower reservation wage than
natives and accept to take up low-skilled, low-status, and low-paid work. Many professions
(construction, transport, and agriculture) have indeed become associated with immigrant or
ethnic minority workers.

At the same time, the unemployment rate among the intermediate educated individuals in the
host country is found to decrease the expatriation rate of individuals originating from the MENA
Region, whether or not they are educated. This finding is well explained by standard theory,
namely, the fact that a high unemployment rate in the destination country will cause lower
immigration flows.

Finally, the unemployment rate among the highly educated individuals in the host country is
found to increase the expatriation rates of individuals from both MENA and OLDC regions. This
last finding is somewhat puzzling, but it is robust and consistent across regressions and sending
regions. 37 A first explanation would be that the migration decision of highly educated individuals
in LDCs is based on intermediary job opportunities in the host country rather than on high-level
job opportunities, given the lack of transferability of human capital internationally. However,
this does not totally explain the positive correlation between the unemployment rate among the
highly educated in the host country and the expatriation rates. Another argument relates to the
persistence of welfare magnet effects mentioned above, that is, host countries with high
unemployment rates are also those with generous welfare states. The welfare magnet effect
would then more than counteract the disincentives to migration induced by poor job
opportunities in skilled jobs in the host country. This puzzling result deserves further
investigation and should be the object of future research.



36
  Regrettably, we did not find such disaggregated information for the sending countries.
37
   The only exception is for migrants coming from Latin America and the Caribbean for which the unemployment
rate of tertiary level residents is insignificant in the model.

The last four variables in table B4 are also worth considering. Labor productivity growth in host
countries produces a strong—and expected—pull effect. Furthermore, the highly educated group
is found to respond more strongly to an increase in labor productivity. In other words, when
labor productivity is high, demand for labor is rather human-capital intensive. Public expenditure
related to unemployment compensation in host countries (as a percentage of GDP) also affects
the expatriation rates significantly and positively with, again, a stronger effect for the most
educated group. This confirms the welfare magnet theories as presented by Borjas (1987, 1999).
The last two variables measuring the level of political rights and civil liberties in origin countries
are usually found insignificant in this setting, except for the level of political rights—at the 10
percent level, however—which appears negatively correlated to the expatriation rate of the
highly educated individuals originating from the MENA Region.

Finally, regional dummies are interesting, because they may capture common features in the
immigration policies of some countries. Our results using the MENA sample show that, after
controlling for bilateral and country-specific characteristics, Continental and Southern European
countries are associated with higher expatriation rates from low-educated individuals than
Anglo-Saxon and Northern European countries. However, this ranking is somewhat modified
when one looks at the expatriation rates among medium and highly educated individuals:
Southern European countries remain alone on top of the destination countries, followed by
Continental European, Anglo-Saxon, and Northern countries. This last result is at odds with the
generally admitted idea that Anglo-Saxon countries have had immigration policies biased toward
the highly educated in the recent period as compared with other destination countries. However,
this finding is not totally counterfactual, because Italy had implemented in 1998 policies
potentially favoring the admission of foreign skilled workers via the allocation of an annual
quota of residence permits to foreigners seeking employment. 38 This may have affected the
expatriation rates of highly educated workers in the late 1990s, and hence driven our results. 39

To conclude this section, our findings emphasize the relevance of pull factors in explaining the
magnitude of expatriation rates from developing to OECD countries despite restrictive
immigration policies in most destination countries. At this stage of the analysis, these results,
though not counterintuitive, need more empirical investigation to be confirmed. In particular, it is
likely that unobserved time-invariant country-specific effects are at work in the different
processes. The “panel data analysis” that follows is thus useful to check for robustness.

Panel Data Analysis

The major drawback of the approach we have adopted so far lies in the nature of the data used.
Inference has been drawn on a cross-section of country data in one time-period. However,
heterogeneity across countries in expatriation rates or migration flows is extremely likely and




38

39
  It is generally tempting in this connection to interpret the size and sign of fixed effects in econometric analysis
while, in fact, the latter may capture a wide range of effects, and not just the one we would like to comment on.

therefore should be accounted for in the model. It is also likely that the business cycle (or “time”
effect) affects bilateral migration flows. Ignoring these effects could result in biased estimates. 40

To identify these effects and hence enrich our previous analyses, we use a panel data set.
Because time-series on migrants’ stocks do not exist, we use yearly data on immigrant flows into
OECD countries by country of origin, between 1990 and 2002, and estimate a panel gravity
model. As a consequence, this panel data analysis of migration flows should also be seen as a
complement of our previous analysis based on stocks of migrants.

Empirical model

We exploit the panel structure of the data set and estimate two sets of regressions. In the first
one, we introduce dummy variables for both destination and origin countries. This allows us to
control for unobserved time-invariant country-specific effects.

The basic empirical specification is a follows:

     Inflows ijt Pop jt = α i + β j + γ t + c1 log(distance ij ) + c2 Borderij + c3 Languageij
                        + c4Colonyij + c5 Islandij + δ1 log(GDPpcit −1 ) + δ 2 log(GDPpc jt −1 )
                        + δ 3 PopDensit −1 + δ 4 PopDens jt −1 + δ 51524Shareit −1 + δ 61524Share jt −1
                                                                                                                   (II.4)
                        + δ 7 AgeDepit −1 + δ 8 AgeDep jt −1 + δ 9UrbPopGrowthit −1 + δ10UrbPopGrowth jt −1
                        + δ11 log(MeanEduc)it −1 + δ12 Literacy jt −1 + δ13UnempRateit −1 + δ14 ProdGrowthit −1
                        + δ15 PubExpCompit −1 + δ16 PolRights jt −1 + δ17CivLib jt −1 +ν ijt

where i is the destination country; j is the origin country, and t is time. Inflowsijt/Popjt is the
emigration rate from j to i at time t. As before, Distanceij, Borderij, Languageij, Colonyij, and
Islandij are variables measuring both geographic and cultural proximity between countries i and
j. All the other variables are included to capture push and pull factors such as economic
development, demographic, and political factors. All time-varying explanatory variables are
lagged by one year to account for information on which the potential immigrants based their
decision to move.

In the second set of regressions, we rely on the robust fixed effects “within” estimator, which
essentially adds a set of country-pair specific intercepts to the equation, and thus exploits only
the time-series dimension of the data set around country-pair averages. The vector of explanatory
variables is exactly the same as before, except that we drop regressors that are constant within
country pairs (Distance, Border, Language, Colony, and Island). The return to education in the
destination country is also dropped, because we could not get a longitudinal series for this
variable.

Empirical results
40
  For example, in specification (2) (table B4), we found a positive coefficient on the destination country’s GDP per
capita. Based on this sole result, it is not clear whether immigrants go to countries with higher GDP per capita or
whether countries with higher GDP per capita have other characteristics that attract immigrants.

The results from estimating a gravity model of the gross migration inflows from 101 sending
countries to 14 receiving OECD countries on annual unbalanced panel data for the period 1990–
2002 are presented in annex B, tables B5 and B6. 41

Table B5 reports the estimates of the basic specification with year, sending, and receiving
countries’ dummy variables. Estimates on the whole sample are reported in column (1). Findings
with regard to pull economic factors in destination countries suggest that (log) GDP per capita as
a measure of gross income and unemployment rate as a proxy for employment opportunities
have no significant impact on migration flows once destination and origin countries’ fixed
effects are controlled for. By contrast, welfare state attractors, measured by the level of public
social expenditure devoted to unemployment compensation expressed as a percentage of GDP,
are found to have a strong and positive impact on migration inflows.

Turning to the demographic variables, the share of population age 15–24 in the host country is
found to exert a negative effect on migration flows. This result, which is similar to the one
obtained using cross-sectional data, is consistent with the idea according to which migration is
partly demand driven and used by some countries to compensate for population aging. Last,
among the variables affecting the costs of migration, distance between destination and origin
countries appears to be of importance.

Estimates on the MENA sample are reported in column (2). First, sharing a border and speaking
a common language positively and significantly affect emigration rates from countries of the
MENA Region. The other findings using this restricted sample do not significantly differ from
those reported in column (1): pull economic factors in destination countries are not significant
except the share of public social expenditure devoted to unemployment compensation;
demographics, in particular the share of the destination country’s population age 15–24, shapes
bilateral flows and distance has a dampening effect on migration. Findings also suggest that
lower degrees of political rights create emigration incentives. Political instability or a climate of
insecurity not only can drive individuals to emigrate but also encourage governments to adopt a
benign attitude toward the departure of individuals dissatisfied with their lot, as such persons
could cause social unrest.

Finally, columns (3), (4), (5), and (6) of table B5 report the results of the same gravity model
estimated after splitting the destination countries into subgroups. Contrasted results emerge. The
unemployment rate in the host country is found to have a strong significant negative effect on
migration flows when the sample is restricted to European Continental countries while its effect
is not significant for Anglo-Saxon and Southern countries. The effect of the share of public
social expenditure devoted to unemployment compensation also varies between groups; it is
significantly positive for European Continental countries and not significant elsewhere.

Estimates of a gravity model with country-pair fixed effects are reported in table B6. The
country-pair fixed effects allow us to control for time-invariant features of the destination
country’s immigration policy that are specific for each sending country. Overall, the explicative
power of all the independent variables is much higher once we control for country-pair specific

41
     For many OECD countries, yearly data on migration flows disaggregated by country of origin are unavailable.

effects. Using the MENA sample, both income and employment opportunities in sending
countries are now found to have a significant effect on migration (although negative in the case
of income), and demographic determinants appear to be strong predictors of migration flows. In
particular, the share of young adults in the population of the sending country is found to have a
positive effect on migration, as predicted by theory (since the present discounted value of net
migration benefits is higher the longer the remaining work-life time). This variable is also an
indicator of demographic pressure. In many MENA countries, the economically active
population is currently increasing at a more rapid rate than that of the total population, because
of a time lag of about 20 years between the decline in fertility and its effect on the number of
young persons entering the labor market. Such growth has an impact on the labor market
(unemployment is highest among young people and women) and constitutes an important
element that influences migration pressure.

By contrast, the share of young adults in the population of the receiving country is found to have
a negative effect on migration. This latter result suggests here again that demographic
imbalances in receiving countries are associated with increased migrant flows. Urban population
growth in the sending country is also found to increase emigration rate. Quoting Giubilaro,
       “New arrivals in the towns are for the most part young persons who have a higher level
       of education than the average in their areas of origin. Faced with the impossibility of
       finding employment in the structured sector, this workforce contributes to the increase in
       the number of precarious and under-paid jobs in the informal sector. The expansion of
       marginal employment and unemployment in the urban areas fuels socio-economic
       tensions in the countries concerned and increases emigration pressure.” 42

Last, we find a positive impact on migration flows stemming from literacy rates in the origin
countries. Generally, any increase in the literacy rate reduces barriers to migration and is
consequently associated with higher migration flows to rich OECD countries.

To synthesize our key findings in a comparative way, table II.1 reports the signs and robustness
levels of the effects of the determinants of migration using the alternative gravity models
described above. Columns (1) and (2) display the results obtained using the cross-sectional
analysis of expatriation rates (ratio of total stocks of migrants), while columns (3) and (4) display
the findings stemming from the panel data analysis of yearly emigration rates (inflows).

               III. CAN MIGRANTS FROM MENA COUNTRIES PROVIDE A SOLUTION FOR
                             LABOR SHORTAGES IN OECD COUNTRIES?

One of the key concerns associated with demographic changes in OECD countries is the decline
in labor supply caused by population aging. Demographic projections are uncertain, but
according to the “average” scenario, the ratio of people over 65 years of age to those between 20
and 64 could double between now and the middle of the century. In some countries, such as
Italy, Japan, and Spain, this aging will be much stronger. 43 There have also been many
discussions on skill shortages in the highly qualified segment of most OECD economies. 44 Both
population aging and skill shortages call for an increase in the number of medium- and high-
skilled immigrants. This section provides an overview of the magnitude of skill shortages in
OECD countries and examines whether migrants originating from countries of the MENA
Region can help filling labor market gaps.

Labor Shortages in OECD Countries

Identifying and projecting labor shortages for skilled and unskilled personnel is rather difficult,
as rapid technological and labor market changes require a continual reevaluation of which skills
are needed. Eurostat, the statistical office for the European Union, has recently undertaken an
effort to develop an EU-wide job vacancy survey. At the same time, several countries have
developed mechanisms to assess needs (see, for example, Italy’s Excelsior system, the United
Kingdom’s Employers Skills Survey, and others). In what follows, we first present a general
overview of job vacancies in some European countries. We then focus on one OECD country,
France, and present a more detailed picture of the location of recruitment difficulties and skill
shortages for this country. The discussion heavily draws on a report entitled “Selective
Immigration Policies and Needed Skills,” which recently was made available by the French
Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industry.

Overview

We first present statistics on job vacancies in some European countries made available by
Eurostat. These figures concern but a few European countries, and some important countries,
such as France, Germany, and Italy, are missing from the list of selected countries. The available
statistics do allow us to evaluate potential migration needs with a comparative approach.

Figures III.1 through III.4 provide a picture of job vacancies and job vacancy rates at the
aggregated level for nine European countries (Austria, Finland, Greece, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom). According to Eurostat, job
vacancy is defined as a post newly created, unoccupied, or about to become vacant (i) for which
the employer is taking active steps to find a suitable candidate from outside the enterprise
concerned and is prepared to take more steps; and (ii) that the employer intends to fill either
immediately or in the near future. An occupied post is a post within an organization to which an
employee has been assigned. The job vacancy rate (JVR) measures the proportion of total posts

that are vacant, according to the definition of job vacancy above, expressed as a percentage as
follows:

JVR = 100 x number of job vacancies / (number of occupied posts + number of job vacancies)

Figures III.1 and III.2 illustrate that, compared with Austria, Finland, Greece, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden, the number of job vacancies in the United Kingdom
has been much higher over the period 2001–04. This number has to be seen against that of
occupied jobs in each country, which shows that the United Kingdom is far on top of the job
providers among this short list of European countries. The United Kingdom is then followed by
Spain, Sweden, Austria, Portugal, Greece, Finland, and Luxembourg. It is more informative,
however, to look at the JVR (see figure III.3). In 2004, with a JVR of 4.2 percent, Greece stood
far ahead, followed by the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Spain, Portugal,
and Luxembourg.

One limitation of the vacancy rate measure is that no single level of vacancies is considered to
reflect shortages. There is, however, general agreement that an increase over time of the vacancy
rate indicates a tight labor market. Figure III.4 depicts annual changes in job vacancy rates by
country. The figure shows irregular drops and increases, although the magnitude of the variations
is small and ranges from −0.7 to +0.2 percent only over the period under consideration (2001–
04). Job vacancy rates have been on the rise in five of the seven selected countries between 2003
and 2004. This evolution may reflect a shortage for some economic activities.

Let us now analyze job vacancies at a more disaggregated level, using the NACE (General
Industrial Classification of Economic Activities) classification of economic activities, for 2005
(see figure III.5). 45 The sectors hit hardest by labor market tightness vary from country to
country. In the Austria, Portugal, and the United Kingdom, the number of job vacancies is the
highest in the category combining sectors F (Wholesale and retail trade), G (Hotel and
restaurants), and H (Transport and communication). More than 232,000 jobs in these sectors are
vacant in the United Kingdom, 17,000 in Austria, and 6,000 in Portugal. 46 The category that
combines sectors K (Public administration), L (Education), and M (Health) also records a high
number of job vacancies: it is the second-hardest-hit category in the United Kingdom and the
first one in Sweden, and probably in Finland (for this country, data relating to the Finance sector
are missing, though). The category including sectors I (Finance) and J (Real estate and firm
services), however, is on top of the job vacancy suppliers in the Netherlands, while this category
ranks third in the United Kingdom, and second in Austria and Sweden. Among the selected
countries, the number of job vacancies in the construction sector in 2005 is low compared with
that recorded in the other sectors. This sector has a long tradition of hiring foreign workers and,
as a consequence, often appears as the traditional immigration sector.

   NACE is the European Community’s Classification of Economic Activities (Sector A: Agriculture, hunting and
forestry; Sector B: Fishing; Sector C: Manufacturing ; Sector D: Electricity, gas and water supply; Sector E:
Construction; Sector F: Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles, motorcycles and personal and
household goods; Sector G: Hotels and restaurants; Sector H: Transport, storage and communication; Sector I:
Financial intermediation; Sector J: Real estate, renting and business activities, consulting; Sector K: Public
administration and defense; compulsory social security; Sector L: Education; Sector M: Health and social work;
Sector N: Other community, social and personal service activities; Sector O: Activities of households; Sector P:
Extra-territorial organizations and bodies).

   Unfortunately, we do not have data on the level of skills or type of occupations at which shortages are experienced
for each of these categories.

Another way to scrutinize job vacancies across countries and sectors is reported in figure III.6. It
gives a more insightful idea of which sectors have the highest number of job vacancies across a
selection of 13 European countries now including some Eastern countries such as the Czech
Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Slovakia Republic, and Slovenia.

From this figure, it appears that the most serious recruitment difficulties or labor demand and
supply mismatch are in the sector composed of wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants,
and transport and communication, with about 344,000 vacant jobs in 2005. This sector is
followed by the Public Administration and the Finance sectors which, respectively, record
279,000 and more than 224,000 vacant jobs. Vacancies for the Industry sector (excluding
construction) stand far below, with 124,000 vacant jobs. If we add the number of vacant jobs
recorded in the Construction sector to this figure, we get a total of 180,000 vacant jobs in 2005,
which represents only about half that of the hardest-hit sector.

Box III.1. Nurse Shortages in OECD Countries

A recent OECD report provides evidence on current nurse shortages and surpluses in OECD countries. According
to the report, the majority of OECD countries suffer from nurse shortages. Some countries have published
estimates of how many headcounts of full-time equivalent nurses per year over the next decade would be needed
to match demand for and supply of nurses:
- Australia reports a shortage of around 6,000 registered nurses (around 3 percent of practicing registered nurses);
- Canada’s shortage of registered nurses is estimated at 16,000 or 6.9 percent of the current workforce;
- The Netherlands has reported a shortage of 7,000 nurses (1 percent of the workforce);
                                                       - 39 -



- In Norway, the shortage has been estimated at 3,300 full-time equivalents, or about 5.4 percent of practicing
nurses;
- In Switzerland, there are 3,000 (4.6 percent) fewer generalist nurses than required; and
- The U.S. government reported a shortage of 110,700 registered nurses (5 percent of the workforce) in 2000.

These national shortages are often unevenly distributed geographically and by specialty area. In the United
Kingdom, for example, vacancy rates varied from 1.8 percent in district nursing to 4.7 percent in the category of
“other psychiatry.” In Australia, employers in rural and remote settings have trouble finding sufficient numbers
of qualified staff to work in areas such as long-term care.

As explained by the authors of the report, these nurse shortages arise as a result of (i) increasing demand for
nurses because of aging populations, new technologies that increase the range of conditions that can be treated,
and a greater range of professional activism; and (ii) a falling or slow-growing supply due to fewer younger
people entering the workforce, a greater range of professional opportunities, the low social value given to
nursing, negative perceptions of nurse conditions of service, and an aging nurse workforce.

Data on job vacancies suffer from a strong limitation, however, because they do not differentiate
between the frictional and structural causes of vacancies. Job vacancies, in practice, are not only
unfilled positions but also recruitment processes a certain amount of time being required to
recruit, hire, and train new workers. Moreover, relying on information given by employers may
produce a partial picture of the scale and causes of shortages. Despite these methodological
problems, all the available data confirm that labor markets are tight in several OECD member
countries. Labor shortages are experienced in all sectors, as well as in all kinds of jobs.
According to Doudeijns and Dumont,
        “During the period from the second quarter of 1999 until the third quarter of 2000,
        employers increasingly complained that shortfalls in the supply of qualified labor caused
        limits to their production. Increasing difficulties related to labor shortages were reported
        by employers in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands Austria, Portugal and the UK.
        Employers also report on tightness not only in labor markets for professionals with
        knowledge of and experience with the latest technologies, but also for personnel with low
        and medium level of qualifications. 47 ”

Given the aforementioned limitations, the next section provides a more detailed picture of the
location of recruitment difficulties and skill shortages for France. Focusing on this country is
particularly relevant in the present study, as nearly one out of every two migrants originating
from the MENA Region resides in this country.

Recruitment Difficulties and Skill Shortages in France

A recent report by the French Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industry provides a detailed
picture of recruitment difficulties and skill shortages in France. It is based on three data sources:
(i) UNEDIC (Union Nationale pour l'Emploi dans l'industrie et le Commerce) surveys on labor
needs; (ii) statistics on demand and supply of labor by sector of activity provided by the ANPE
(Agence Nationale pour l’Emploi); and (iii) the report on jobs and qualifications published by

Short-Term Labor Needs

UNEDIC surveys on labor needs (enquêtes: “Besoins en main d’oeuvre”) are annual qualitative
surveys based on indirect interviews involving a large number of employers of different scale
across different sectors and localities in France. According to the 2005 survey, recruitment
difficulties are high in the following occupations:

                           •     Occupations in the construction industry: skilled workers in heavy construction; skilled
                                 workers and technicians in engineering works; plumbers, painters, carpenters, tillers, and
                                 so on

                           •     Occupations in the restaurants and hotel trade: chefs and cooks, employees in the hotel
                                 trade

                           •     Personal service occupations: nursery nurses or child minders, security guards, nurses
                                 and midwifes, and care assistants

As explained by the authors of the report, however, UNEDIC surveys suffer from the fact that
they do not allow identifying the causes of these recruitment difficulties. They could be caused
by an aggregate shortage of labor (in which case increased immigration could be part of the
solution) or by problems of mismatch between labor demand and supply (in which case
promoting better matching of people to jobs would be a more adequate response).

ANPE statistics on labor demand and supply by occupation provide a useful complement to
UNEDIC qualitative surveys because they enable us to calculate labor market tightness index by
sector of activity. This index is given by the number of jobs offered in a given occupation,
divided by the number of job seekers in that occupation. The higher the index, the stronger the
tension in the labor market due to labor shortages. Table III.1 shows the 20 occupations with the
highest index over the period from July 2004 to June 2005.

Note: The French occupational classification created by DARES (FAP or nomenclature des familles
professionnelles) distinguishes 224 occupations in its most detailed version and 84 at a more aggregated level.
Occupations considered in the table belong to FAP-84. For a proper definition of each occupation, the reader should
refer to FAP (http://www.travail.gouv.fr/IMG/xls/2_FAP_PCS_ROME_23fev06.xls)
a. This category includes first-line supervisors/managers of construction trades and extraction workers and skilled
construction trades workers.
b. This heterogeneous category includes pump attendants, dry cleaners and launderers, self-employed workers such
as morticians, directors of advertising or matrimonial agencies, and salaried workers (employees in gaming houses,
janitors of changing rooms, and so on).
c. This category includes architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy (geometers,
quantity surveyors, and so on).

Most occupations with high recruitment difficulties are associated with a high index of labor
market tightness (higher than or equal to 0.85), suggesting that labor shortage more than skill
mismatch is the cause of hard-to-fill job vacancies. Exceptions are for personal service
occupations for which recruitment difficulties are high, but the index is low: 0.45 for care
assistants, 0.2 for nursery nurses or child minders, and 0.65 for security guards. For these
occupations, recruitment difficulties seem to be due to problems of mismatch between labor
demand and supply. Because of information deficits and other inefficiencies on the labor market,
unemployed workers do not acquire information on relevant existing vacancies, and firms or
                                              - 42 -



employers do not have the information necessary to find people with adequate qualifications.
The response to this problem is to promote better matching of people to jobs rather than to
increase migration flows.

Last, we investigate whether labor market tightness in occupations with high recruitment
difficulties is a structural or cyclical phenomenon. To do so, we examine whether occupations
with a high labor market tightness index in 2005 already had a high labor market tightness index
in 2000. We find that most occupations facing labor shortages in 2005 were already under
pressure in 2000. For four occupations in the industrial sector (wood industry unskilled workers,
electrical and electronics skilled workers, and skilled workers in the metal industry), however,
the number of created jobs has been rather low over the last four years (less than 4,000 created
jobs in four years).

It thus seems that labor market needs in the short run are particularly high in the following
occupations: skilled workers and technicians in the contracting industry; chefs and cooks;
employees in the hotel trade; nurses and midwifes; skilled workers in heavy construction;
mechanical engineering technicians and skilled workers; butchers, pork butchers, and bakers;
sales representatives; and sales managers and assistants. For these particular occupations, labor
shortages could be alleviated through domestic labor market reforms (such as training or
retraining programs for the currently unemployed, promotion of occupation and geographic
mobility, job-search assistance, and so on) or through increased migration.

Long-Term Labor Needs

To assess labor and skill needs in the longer run, we use DARES projections on job creations and
losses in labor supply resulting from the retirement of baby boomers by occupation. Assuming a
growth rate of 2 percent per year over the period 2005–15, there would be 750,000 job openings
per year.

The greatest retirement pressures will be in the following sectors: contracting industry (413,000
vacant jobs due to retirements over the period); tourism and transport (444,000 vacant jobs);
accounting and administrative services (641,000 vacant jobs); trade (453,000 vacant jobs);
personal services (790,000 vacant jobs); and public administration (500,000 vacant jobs).

In net terms, most job creations will be in the tertiary sector both at the skilled and unskilled
levels. Most unskilled jobs will be created in the following sectors: personal services (more than
416,000 jobs over the period), transport and tourism (more than 225,000 jobs), trade (more than
196,000 jobs), and contracting industry (more than 116,000 jobs). By contrast, most skilled jobs
will be created in the health sector (more than 304,000 jobs) and accounting services (more than
197,000 jobs). Labor and skill needs will be particularly high in the following occupations:

   •   Managers and professional occupations: teachers, managers, and administrative officers;
       software and information technology professionals; sales managers and technicians;
       managers and technicians in the contracting industry; and research engineers and
       researchers
                                                - 43 -



       •   Technical and skilled occupations: executive assistants, nurses, sales representatives,
           intermediate sales and service occupations, administrative clerks, supervisors, and
           processing occupations

       •   Skilled workers: skilled drivers, skilled workers in processing, skilled workers in
           storehouse management, and skilled workers in heavy construction

       •   Unskilled occupations: child minders, care assistants, in-home employees, light-duty
           cleaners

Domestic Labor Market Reforms or Increased Migration?

The previous discussion has shown that many OECD countries are currently experiencing
substantial unsatisfied labor requirements in a number of sectors despite persistently high rates of
unemployment. This suggests that, in most cases, labor shortages are not caused by an aggregate
shortage of labor, but instead can be attributed to problems of mismatch between labor demand
and supply. Jobs remain unfilled because workers lack the relevant qualifications or skills
(qualitative mismatch), are reluctant to take up work in particular occupations or geographic
areas (preference or regional mismatch), or have insufficient information about job opportunities
(mismatch due to information deficits). In addition, employers may be unwilling or unable to
offer sufficiently attractive salaries or conditions to encourage occupational or geographical
mobility. 48

Increased immigration is not the only policy option to fill labor gaps. Several measures could
promote better matching of people to jobs. First, the problem of hard-to-fill vacancies may be
addressed through offering more attractive salaries or working conditions. Some particular jobs
in the health sector and in the hotel industry are indeed hard to fill because of heavy workloads,
the increased use of overtime, and low remuneration. These jobs could be made more attractive
through higher wages and a reorganization of working time. Second, labor shortages could be
alleviated through relevant training and education measures to increase the supply of qualified
domestic workers. Inadequate qualifications are indeed one of the main factors that explain labor
tightness in some qualified jobs. Third, policies introducing incentives to encourage mobility
may solve the problem of hard-to-fill vacancies in particular regions. Last, any increase in
participation rates (especially those of married women) or in the number of years spent in work
could help fill labor gaps. However, most of these measures require several years to take effect.
Moreover, many low-skilled, low-status, and low-paid professions have become associated with
immigrant or ethnic minority workers. Under these conditions, turning to labor migration
programs may be a more rapid and effective way to address shortages.

Can Migrants from the MENA Region Help Fill Labor Market Gaps in OECD Countries?

Demographic Prospects

A recent paper compares demographic trends in Western and Central Europe 49 with those in
Eastern Europe, the Balkans, Turkey, and Central Asia (hereafter EECA-20 50 ) and those in the
MENA Region (hereafter MENA-20 51 ). 52

As shown in this report, using Eurostat data and projections by the United Nations, demographic
trends in Western and Central Europe and in most countries of the EECA-20 are quite similar:
because of low fertility and increasing life expectancy, total population size in these two groups
will remain stable during the next 20 years and will start to decrease only during the following
decades. But the number of younger people will shrink and the number and share of older people
will increase during the same period. As a consequence, the old-age dependency ratio (the ratio
of the number of people age 65 or older divided by the number of people age 15 to 64) will
dramatically rise. In Western and Central Europe, the ratio is expected to increase from 25
percent in 2005 to 35 percent in 2025 and 55 percent in 2050. A diminishing and aging working-
age population necessarily results in a diminishing and aging labor force. At constant
participation levels and in the absence of immigration, the labor force is projected to decrease by
66 million people, from 226 million in 2005 to 160 million in 2050 (−29 percent). 53 As shown
by this author, neither an increase in overall participation rates or in the participation rate of
women, nor an increase in the retirement age would be sufficient to hold the labor force at its
2005 level.

In contrast, the situation in the MENA-20 is characterized by higher—but declining—fertility,
increasing life expectancy, and sustained demographic growth. Total population in the MENA-
20 will grow steadily from 316 million in 2000 to 492 million by 2025 (+55.7 percent) and to
638 million by 2050 (+102.0 percent). During this period, the number of people between ages of
15 and 64 will more than double, from 187 million in 2000 to 323 million by 2025 (+72.7
percent) and will continue to grow at almost the same rate to 417 million by 2050 (+123.0
percent). 54 Koettl gets comparable trends using a sample restricted to 12 MENA countries. 55

job-seeking population will increase by 93 million in the MENA-20. 56 As suggested by these
two authors, the main challenge in this region will be to absorb those currently unemployed
(compare table III.2 for statistics on unemployment rate by country) and those entering the labor
market during the next two decades. To fully cope with this challenge, the MENA-20 countries
would have to create 45 million new jobs until 2010 and more than 100 million until 2025.
According to Münz, “The current labor market conditions in many MENA-20 countries raise
doubts as to whether these economies will be able to absorb the significant expansion of the
labor force. As a consequence, migration pressures on the contracting labor markets in Europe
will increase.” 57

From a strict quantitative standpoint, the diverging demographic trends and structural differences
between most European countries and MENA economies confirm that potential synergies need
to be developed between the two regions. In particular, increased labor mobility from the MENA
Region could compensate for demographic trends in European labor markets in the next decades,
while responding to the lack of employment in the home countries. Besides, evidence from the
estimated gravity models (section III of this study) does suggest that migration flows from one
country to another are strongly driven by demographic features. As shown by Koettl, however,
the potential of MENA emigration countries to provide labor migrants to European countries will
decrease rapidly after 2020, since the 25–39 age-group, which is the most likely age-group to
migrate, will grow at a much lower rate between 2020 and 2050. 58

The central question of interest is not so much whether the MENA region can provide high
numbers of working-age individuals or not but, rather, what kind of migrants the region can
provide. In other words, what is needed is an evaluation of the quality of the matching between
the labor and skill requirements of European labor markets and the skills of people migrating
from the MENA region to Europe.

Europe’s Skills Requirements and MENA’s Skill Supply: Is There a Match?

Providing a definite answer to the above question is rather difficult, particularly given the lack of
detailed information on the level and structure of qualifications of MENA countries’ population,
on the employment conditions prevailing in the labor markets of these countries (which
condition the desire of people to migrate), on human capital transferability, and so on. To get an
idea of what the answer could be, however, we can look at the current labor market situation of
migrants originating from the MENA Region in OECD countries. In a more prospective
approach, it is useful to examine available data on unemployment rates by NACE sector in
MENA countries.

Current labor market situation of immigrants originating from the MENA Region

The current labor market situation of migrants from the MENA Region strongly varies from one
OECD country to another, as a result from the diversity of the socioeconomic composition of the
migrant populations in destination countries (compare section I). This diversity itself results from
the period of migration and from migration and labor-market policies in destination countries. 59
Generally, the earlier cohorts of migrants from the MENA Region to OECD countries were
composed mainly of individuals with low qualifications, whereas the more recent ones are
composed of people with medium to high qualifications.

Available statistics on European countries show that immigrants from Maghreb countries have
lower labor force participation rates and higher unemployment rates than natives. In France, in
particular, the unemployment rate for North Africans in 2002 (which was 7 percent for natives)
was 26 percent for Algerians, 26 percent for Moroccans, and 22 percent for Tunisians.60
Unemployment rates are even higher if one considers the 15–24 age-group alone. The same
holds true for women, partly because they are often unskilled workers. Among French women,
the unemployment rate was 8 percent in 2002 against 30 percent for Algerian women and 31
percent for Moroccan women. In the Netherlands, the unemployment rate in 1994 was 6.4
percent for nationals but 31 percent for Moroccans. At the same time in this country, the
Moroccan population showed the lowest rate of participation in the labor force. Statistics for
Spain are given in table III.3 which depicts the distribution of immigrants originating from
Maghreb and Mashreq countries by type of activity, in 2001.

The employment rate among immigrants from Maghreb and Mashreq countries is relatively low
(49.5 percent) compared with the EU-15 average (64 percent). This rate varies from one origin
country to another. While it is 44.5 percent for Syrian immigrants, it amounts to nearly 60

percent for Tunisians. Overall, a large proportion of immigrants are still studying (19 percent and
18 percent for individuals from Maghreb and Mashreq countries, respectively), while about 11
percent are unemployed and 18 percent to 20 percent do not participate to the labor market for

Many factors explain the gaps in employment and unemployment rates between natives and
immigrants from the MENA Region. The first factor is the reduced employability of this
category of labor. With the exception of Greece, Ireland, Italy, and Spain (that is, countries in
which labor immigration dominates), immigration flows to most other European OECD
countries mainly include categories of individuals admitted on humanitarian or social grounds
(annual refugee quotas, asylum seekers, family reunion) who face difficulties in integrating into
the labor market. 61 A second factor is the mismatch between the skills of people migrating to
Europe and the requirements of Europe’s formal labor markets. Hidden barriers for access to
employment (such as a poor understanding of cultural and workplace norms) as well as
employers’ discrimination also explain the greater vulnerability of foreign workers to
unemployment and their lower degree of employability.

To conclude, the current labor market situation of immigrants originating from the MENA
Region suggests that a significant proportion of these immigrants is not necessarily endowed
with the required skills. To investigate whether this situation can be improved in the near future,
the next section aims to identify the sectors of MENA countries in which unemployment is a
particularly severe problem (and in which, as a consequence, people may have a stronger
incentive to migrate).


61
  A significant proportion of population movements within and from MENA results from political instability and
armed conflicts. Over the recent period, people from Iraq, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Algeria have been
among the largest groups of asylum seekers in Europe.

In which sectors of MENA economies is there an excess supply of labor?

In what follows, our approach compares the potential for emigration in origin countries by sector
with the labor shortages of potential host countries that were detailed in the previous section.
One way of doing this is to look at unemployment figures for each segment of the labor market
in MENA countries—that is, for each NACE sector listed in footnote 45. High unemployment
numbers in some sectors are likely to be due to skill mismatch or to lack of available jobs in
these sectors. If the latter is true, migration might be an appropriate means for job seekers to find
a suitable job in the same sector abroad. Hence, it is interesting to investigate whether sector-
specific labor shortages in receiving countries correspond to complementary sector-specific labor
market imbalances in potential sending countries.

To do that, we use ILO data on unemployment figures disaggregated by NACE sector for four
important sending countries (Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and, for a comparative purpose, Turkey).
To observe whether there are complementary imbalances between sending and receiving
countries, compare the histograms in figures III.7 to III.10with the number of job vacancies by
sector in 2005 for 13 European countries (see figure III.6).

Several interesting patterns emerge:

                       •   In the case of Egypt (figure III.7), unemployment figures are the highest for the
                           Wholesale and Retail Trade, Hotels, Transports and Communications sector. Interestingly
                           enough, this sector is actually the one facing the most serious recruitment difficulties in
                           European countries, as suggested by figure III.6 (with about 344 thousands vacant jobs in
                           2005). Unemployment figures in this sector are also relatively high in Turkey and, to a
                           lesser extent, in Algeria. By contrast, the Moroccan case exhibits low unemployment
                           figures in this sector. There have indeed been long-standing labor shortages in the branch
                           of tourism and hotels in this country. Emigration from unemployed Egyptians, Algerians,
                           and Turks in this sector could thus represent a solution to some specific labor shortages in
                           European countries.

                       •   Unemployment figures in the Industry, Excluding Construction and Public
                           Administration sectors strongly vary from one country to another. In the Industrial sector,
                           figures are rather low in Turkey, while they are quite high in Morocco and at an
                           intermediate position in Algeria and Egypt. In the public sector, unemployment figures
                           are low in Egypt and Turkey, while they are high in Algeria and Morocco. In terms of job
                           vacancies in European countries, the Public Administration sector was found to be the
                           second-hardest-hit sector. Whether increased migration from unemployed Algerians and
                           Moroccans could alleviate labor shortages in this sector is not clear, however, because
                           many occupations in public administration are not open to nonnationals.

                       •   Two cases of noncomplementary imbalances are visible. First, labor shortages in the
                           Finance, Real-Estate[,] and Firm Services sector in European countries cannot be
                           alleviated through increased migration from Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Turkey, as
                                                - 51 -



        unemployment figures are rather low in these countries. Second, despite high
        unemployment figures in the Construction sector for the four origin countries under
        consideration, this sector in host countries no longer appears to face strong recruitment
        difficulties.

To sum up, available data on labor market imbalances in both sending and receiving countries
suggest that increased labor mobility from the MENA region could compensate for labor
shortages in European labor markets in the next decades, while responding to the lack of
employment in some home countries. This is particularly true in the Wholesale and Retail Trade,
Hotels, Transports, and Communications sector. This conclusion needs to be treated with
caution, however, because more disaggregated data are lacking on both labor shortages in OECD
countries and labor surpluses in MENA countries.

Is there a potential for outsourcing?

Outsourcing (or contracting out) means delegating operations or jobs from internal production
within a business to an external entity (such as a subcontractor) that specializes in that operation.
The decision to outsource is often made to lower costs. A related term, offshoring, means
transferring work to another country, typically overseas. Offshoring is similar to outsourcing
when companies hire overseas subcontractors, but differs when companies transfer work to the
same company in another country. Business segments typically outsourced include Information
Technology, Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate Management, and Accounting. Many
companies also outsource customer support and call center functions, manufacturing, and
engineering. 62 According Bardhan and Kroll,
        “Firms involved in outsourcing are rapidly gaining ground in China, the Philippines,
        Malaysia, Russia, Israel and Ireland. While it is difficult to estimate the exact number of
        jobs created in these countries, tentative evidence suggests that outsourcing has generated
        at the very least over a million jobs in the 1990s and hundreds of thousands more since
        the turn of the century”. 63

Bardhan and Kroll outline the following attributes of outsourced jobs:
   • No face-to-face customer servicing requirement
   • High information content
   • Work process is telecommutable and Internet enabled
   • High wage differential with similar occupation in destination country
   • Low setup barriers
   • Low social networking requirement 64

Whether offshoring could gain ground in the MENA Region is not only conditioned by the
business environment prevailing in MENA economies but also by labor costs, skill availability,
and so on (see figure III.11).

As suggested by table III.4, the business climate is a challenge in the region: in Maghreb
countries, for example, Algeria and Morocco, respectively rank 128 and 102 out of 155 in terms
of “Ease of doing business.” Egypt and Syria are also very poorly ranked, as are Iraq and the
Islamic Republic of Iran. By contrast, countries currently involved in offshoring are relatively
better ranked: 21 in the case of Malaysia, 28 in the case of South Africa, 79 in the case of the
Russian Federation, and 91 in the case of China. There are exceptions, however, as India ranks
116 and the Philippines 113, suggesting that firms consider other elements in their decisions to
hire overseas subcontractors. The cost of labor is one of these other elements. Unfortunately,
getting information on labor costs by NACE sector is rather difficult. Figure III.12 reports
prevailing wages by economic activity for a small list of countries for which data are available.
This figure compares wages in some MENA countries with prevailing wages in countries in
which offshoring has been gaining ground over the last 10 years (including India, Malaysia, the
Philippines, and Russia). In this comparative approach, we have chosen the economic sectors
that have been the most prevalent in offshoring.

Overall, data suggest that some MENA countries offer significant cost advantages, compared
with other countries. In Algeria and Egypt, in particular, wages appear to be lower than in some
of the countries currently providing offshored services. Offshoring business process or services
is not solely cost driven. In addition to cost advantages, the location choice of offshored services
is conditioned by other factors among which are the presence of an English-speaking population
(as U.S. businesses dominate the global share of offshoring, accounting for some 70 percent of
the total market); a common accounting and legal system based on the common law structure of
the United Kingdom and the United States; a time-differential determined by geographic location
leading to a 24/7 capability and overnight turnaround time; and a steady and large supply of
technically savvy graduates. 65 On some of these particular aspects, compared with other
countries, MENA countries are undeniably disadvantaged. Furthermore, barriers in some MENA

     As explained by Bardhan and Kroll 2003.

economies often cause high transaction costs for foreign investors. These barriers include
arbitrary government behavior affecting the investment climate, corruption, discrimination
against foreign investment, insecure or unregulated financial systems, restrictions to the free flow
of capital, and the nonadoption of international standards of accounting and arbitration.

The question of whether offshoring could gain ground in the MENA region is a complex one.
Thus far, the region has played a minor role in the ongoing outsourcing of business service jobs,
the latter being mainly generated by U.S. or British firms. Given the prevailing conditions in
some of the French-speaking MENA countries (namely, Morocco and Tunisia), these countries
could appear in the future offshoring plans of French and other Continental countries. As an
illustration, Morocco has a significant French legacy as well as some Spanish. French is the
language of business, government, and diplomacy; its civil law draws from the French and
Spanish civil laws; and, geographically, it is separated from Spain by the narrow Strait of
Gibraltar.
