 How to use this document
 This report was designed to be a flexible tool, to be read through or in parts. Certain sections (e.g., those in the first section) may be
 more relevant to the preparation of background sections or policy documents, given their emphasis on climate change and health links.
 Other sections provide approaches and tools that can be directly extracted and built into projects and programs. These are primarily
 located in chapters two and three. More than 20 case studies* appear throughout to illustrate the practical value in connecting climate
 change and health.



 Intended audience
 This document is primarily directed to development staff working on health sector and health system projects and programs. However,
 much of the content may be useful to staff working on related issues in environment and natural resources, water, energy, transport,
 urban, or others. As a cross-cutting discipline, climate change and health issues are germane to projects in many disciplines. Though
 some of the language in this document is topical to WBG policies and procedures (e.g., “task team leaders,” “global practices”), the
 document has value beyond this institution as other development banks, bilateral aid agencies, and communities are tackling common
 issues. Tools and approaches here can be applied in many of these contexts.
     Policy makers and managers likely will find this document useful as it provides strong context for climate change impacts and
 opportunities within the health sector that may inform higher-level dialogue and decision making. Operational teams should find value
 in the specific tools and approaches here that can be integrated within development lending programs. The many examples should
 also provide useful context for all readers. More succinct operational guidance will be produced after publication of this document to
 provide tools useful for those involved in direct lending. This more robust document was produced as a necessary first step to contex-
 tualize this climate change and health work and consolidate background, mitigation, and adaptation resources in a single resource.

Climate change is a risk multiplier that threatens to unravel decades of development gains. Among the
most critical and direct risks to humans is the impact of climate change on health. Heat stress will worsen
as high temperatures become more common and water scarcity increases; malnutrition, particularly in
children, could become more prevalent in some parts of the world where droughts are expected to become
more frequent; and water- and vector-borne diseases are likely to expand in range as conditions favor mos-
quitoes, flies, and water-borne pathogens. Worse still, these threats will be greatest in regions where the
population is most dense, most vulnerable, and least equipped to adapt, pushing more people in poverty
and reinforcing a cycle of environmental degradation, poor health and slow development.
    Addressing these climate-associated health risks is critical. Alongside risk, there is opportunity. Responses
to climate change have unearthed significant potential for improving both human health and the environ-
ment. Low carbon hospitals can draw upon the many advances made by the energy sector in developing
cleaner and renewable resources. Pharmaceutical supply chains can benefit from more efficient and less
polluting transport. And food and nutrition can be improved by the advances achieved through climate-
smart agriculture.
    Climate change challenges are multi-sectoral and so too are the solutions. At the World Bank Group, we
are tackling different dimensions of these environment and health threats in different ways. For example,
the ‘Pollution Management and Environmental Health’ Trust Fund addresses air pollution, toxic land pol-
lution, and marine litter. Work on Climate-Smart Agriculture aims to sustainably increase food productivity
and human well-being in a changing climate. We are putting in place a new operational framework for
strengthening human, animal, and environmental health systems in response to disease threats. And within
the health sector, we have made Universal Health Coverage core and increasingly considerate of climate
change and resilience.
    At the World Bank Group, we work with the broader development community to create solutions that
can respond to and reduce these risks. Our work aligns with other global efforts aimed at improving envi-
ronmental and human health, such as the work of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, Global Alliance
for Clean Cookstoves, One Health and Planetary Health communities, and broader efforts to achieve the
Sustainable Development Goals.

      In this report we identify climate and health challenges to establish a basis for health sector action and solutions. The health sec-
  tor has a substantial role to play in both mitigating climate change through the adoption of low-carbon strategies, while also building
  resilience to climate impact in ways that plan for environmental change and expanded health threats. Taken together, these efforts
  comprise a “climate-smart” approach that will help health planners and decision-makers adjust to a new era of climate reality while
  improving health, environment, and development.
      The work presented here is expected to assist the development community in further mainstreaming climate change and health into
  development operations so that we may address the emerging needs of vulnerable communities, particularly women and children. We
  are committed to working with development practitioners around the world on climate change and health, capitalizing upon associ-
  ated opportunities and technologies, and contributing to the overall goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

Executive Summary


Climate Change Affects Health
Climate change is damaging human health now and is projected to have a greater impact in the future.
Low- and middle-income countries are seeing the worst effects as they are most vulnerable to climate
shifts and least able to adapt given weak health systems and poor infrastructure. The cumulative threats
of climate change to health has been extensively discussed for decades and understanding is growing,
but so too are the impacts.
     Climate change could drag more than 100 million people back into extreme poverty by 2030 (World
Bank, 2016), with much of this reversal attributable to negative impacts on health. There is clear and
mounting evidence that health outcomes will predominantly be negatively affected by rising sea levels
and temperatures, different patterns of precipitation, and more frequent extreme weather. Several of
the emissions that drive climate change also affect health directly, resulting in respiratory and cardio-
vascular disease.
     An effective response to these new challenges will necessarily require engagement and coordina-
tion across many sectors. Chief among these is, of course, health. Hospitals, health centers and public
health workers are first responders to the health effects of climate change. Health systems need to be
resilient and remain operational to provide care during extreme weather events. They must also respond
to the longer-term, climate-induced changes in disease patterns. While vastly differing in scale, each
nation’s health sector also releases greenhouse gases while delivering care and procuring products and
technologies from a carbon-intensive supply chain.


An Opportunity for Low-Carbon Healthcare Solutions
Middle- and low-income countries increasing their investment in more robust health systems can seize
the opportunity to support technology and management systems that are less expensive, more produc-
tive, and less carbon intensive. A low-carbon approach can provide effective, cheaper care while at the
same time being ‘climate smart’.
    Low-carbon healthcare can advance institutional strategies toward low-carbon development and
health-strengthening imperatives and inspire other development institutions and investors working in
this space.
    Low-carbon healthcare provides an approach for designing, building, operating, and investing in
health systems and facilities that generate minimal amounts of greenhouse gases. It puts health systems
on a climate-smart development path, aligning health development and delivery with global climate
goals. This approach saves money by reducing energy and resource costs. It can improve the qual-
ity of care in a diversity of settings. Low-carbon healthcare strengthens health systems by increasing
facilities’ resilience to extreme weather events and other disasters, while also promoting approaches

 1        The Imperative, Context, and Rationale
          for Development Community Engagement


          Connecting Health and Climate Change
          Climate change is impacting people’s health now will continue to do so in the future if the root causes
          and effects are not rapidly addressed. Extreme heat, rising sea levels, changes in precipitation result-
          ing in flooding and droughts, intense hurricanes, migrating disease vectors, and degraded air quality,
          directly and indirectly affect our physical, social, and psychological health.3
              The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)4 has described the types of impacts that
          climate change may have on human health outcomes globally, including:
           •	 A risk of mortality and morbidity from an increase in the frequency or intensity of heatwaves,
              principally in older age groups and among the urban poor
           •	 Increased risks of infectious disease, particularly in low-income countries following extreme weather
              patterns, flooding, and displacement
           •	 An increase in vector-borne infections, particularly in populations at the margins of the current
              distribution of diseases
           •	 An increase in the number of undernourished people in low-income countries, following more
              vulnerable food supplies in drought or flooding conditions
           •	 Increases in morbidity and mortality following exposure to ozone and other air pollutants
           •	 In some settings, the impacts of climate change may cause social disruption, economic decline, and
              displacement of populations. The health impacts associated with such socioeconomic dislocation
              and population displacement are substantial.
              Many of the impacts of climate change and its drivers are preventable through a range of proven
          interventions (for both adaptation and mitigation) that can reduce emissions or increase resilience.
          According to the IPCC, there is substantial potential to reduce climate impacts on health across eight
          dimensions5 by shifting to higher levels of adaptation than those currently proposed. Whether in infec-
          tious disease, heat waves, or natural disasters, history has shown that preparedness and response to
          threats can greatly limit the losses to health, human life and economies.
              For example, in 1970 a Category 3 hurricane battered East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh) result-
          ing in 500,000 deaths. Similar storms hit Bangladesh again in 1991 and 2007, causing 140,000 and
          3,400 deaths, respectively. Collaborative adaptation over the intervening decades led to these dramatic
          reductions in lives lost (Smith et al., 2014) by increasing Bangladesh’s resilience to natural disasters.
          The country shifted to a higher level of adaptation that included improving general disaster education
          (greatly assisted by rising literacy rates, especially among women), deployment of early warning systems
          (which included community mobilization), building a network of cyclone shelters, relocation efforts,
          and increasing connectivity of health facilities in high-risk areas.

     Box 4: Climate-Smart Healthcare: The Intersection of Low-Carbon Healthcare
     and Resilience
     The IPCC identified key risks from climate change that include flood impacts and landslides due to extreme precipitation, impacts on water availability,
     wildfire impacts, and heat-related mortality.42 All significantly impact health in the communities where they occur. As first responders, hospitals and
     health centers need to be resilient to these impacts and remain operational during and immediately following these events to safely shelter patients
     in place and provide needed medical care to communities and responders.43 As hospitals and health systems explore opportunities for low carbon
     healthcare, they are finding significant overlap between mitigation or “sustainability” measures and climate change resilience interventions. Accordingly,
     we propose a new term that captures both sides of climate-health impact and response equation: “climate-smart healthcare.”

 2        Development Community Role
          Promoting Climate-Smart, Low-Carbon
          Healthcare Solutions


          This section reviews the tools and approaches for low-carbon healthcare. Existing initiatives are pre-
          sented as models from which further work can be built and integrated into development projects and
          programs. Details of methods are provided wherever possible. Case studies providing examples of
          country implementation appear throughout to establish a sense of real-world applicability.


          Existing Initiatives
          The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identifies several interventions that can reduce
          carbon emissions.45 Based on these, the World Health Organization issued a set of preliminary findings
          on the benefits and co-benefits of carbon mitigation in health facilities.46 It reviewed published evidence
          on eight IPCC and four extra mitigation strategy impacts by considering the evidence of:
           •	 improvements to health services
           •	 reduced environmental and occupational health risks
           •	 reduced risk of specific diseases
           •	 improved health equity and access to healthcare services
               The findings identified a range of mitigation measures common to structures and activities that
          might have special relevance to healthcare facilities for the provision of improved services. These are
          summarized in Table 2.1. The WHO findings also identify a need for more systematic measuring and
          benchmarking of health sector energy consumption and emissions, as well as of overall environmental
          performance in the context of ‘greener’ facility design and use of renewable energy sources.
               Together with Health Care Without Harm, WHO has also issued a discussion document detailing
          seven aspects of a climate friendly hospital, alongside global examples of carbon mitigation in health-
          care settings.47 The seven components of a climate friendly hospital relate to driving energy efficiency,
          utilizing green building design principles, adopting alternative energy generation, clean transportation,
          sustainable food, clean waste management, and water conservation.
               For example, Hospital General Dr. Agustino Neto in Cuba audited its energy consumption to iden-
          tify areas for improvement in energy practices and subsequently reduced their energy consumption by
          21 percent.48 Peru’s Hospital Nacional Dos de Mayo was designed to maximize natural ventilation (with
          high ceilings, large windows, and orientation to take maximum advantage of local prevailing winds) to
          keep the hospital air fresh and comfortable. In Rwanda, there are health clinics with no connection to
          the country’s power grid, relying instead on more reliable and less polluting hybrid solar/diesel sources.
               The 2020 Healthcare Climate Challenge, led by Health Care Without Harm’s Global Green and
          Healthy Hospitals Network, can provide useful support for those seeking to assess their footprint,
          measure progress, and take part in a collaborative global effort. The 2020 Challenge has a three-pillar
          framework of mitigation, resilience, and leadership.49 It sets an ambitious target to mobilize hospitals
          and health centers on every continent in a collective effort to reduce the health sector’s greenhouse

*As there is a clinical benefit to providing access to daylight and views in patient rooms (studies have shown that high levels of daylight in patient rooms can lead to shorter
patient stays67), daylighting gains added significance in a hospital setting. Similarly, healthcare’s need for heat create an opportunity for benefits from combined heat and
power and solar water heating. These interventions drive design considerations that are especially important in hospitals.

 3        Development Community Role Promoting
          Climate-Smart Resilience in Healthcare


          This section reviews the current state of climate change resilience, adaptation planning and implemen-
          tation in the health sector, with a focus on low- and middle-income countries and identified climate/
          health impact hotspots. Various tools are listed, as are approaches to integrating these into development
          operations. Ultimately, this section describes how health lending and investment can build resilience
          and adaptive capacity in response to climate change.


          Diagnostic Tools That Can Help Assess the Impact
          of Climate on Health
          Building resilience to the health impacts of climate change is largely about risk reduction. It is widely
          understood and accepted that climate change will have broad impacts on human health and that it will
          be the poorest and most vulnerable that feel the full force of impact. Though it may not be possible to
          diminish this risk of health impact to zero, more can be done to predict and prevent impacts, and build
          resilient health systems that will be sturdy in the face of future threats, whether pandemic outbreak,
          economic collapse, or global environmental change.
              It is also important to note that health risks from climate change vary in both their nature as well
          as the type of climate risk that precipitates them. So far, there has been considerable discussion of the
          types of health impact: infectious disease, undernutrition, heat stress, and so on. The magnitude and
          pattern of risks from climate change, however, are also important and are due to: the characteristics
          of the hazards created by changing weather patterns; the extent of exposure of human and natural
          systems to the hazard; the susceptibility of those systems to harm; and their ability to cope with and
          recover from exposure. To establish truly resilient systems, each of these components should be consid-
          ered individually. In doing so, it should become clear that the starting point for efficient and effective
          resilience strategies and adaptation must encompass: the vulnerability of a community; the capacity
          of health systems to prepare for, cope with, respond to, and recover from exposure to a hazard; or the
          hazards created by a changing climate. Each of these categories highlights important areas for adapta-
          tion and resilience planning. Simply focusing only on climate change is too broad a frame, and makes
          assumptions about the roles of vulnerability and exposure that could prevent effective action.
              Improving understanding of the discrete and varied risks that climate change poses for health allow
          for concentration on the most vulnerable populations and the most susceptible regions. Development
          lending must target the correct geographies, populations, and causal factors. Awareness of potential
          climate-related risks is also important to ensure that a project is not derailed during implementation.
              As awareness of the linkages between climate and health has grown, so too has the number of
          information sources and diagnostic tools that quantify impacts to support improved decision making.
          Information sources and tools can be characterized in multiple ways but for the purposes of this exercise
          it will be most helpful to consider two: global and national.

 4        Policy and Partnership


          Development institutions can engage at the national level around climate change and health policy
          along two distinct paths: (i) the focused inclusion of a climate perspective in health dialogue between
          development actors and government counterparts, particularly ministries of health and of finance; and
          (ii) the participation of development staff in broader climate policy fora.


          The Climate Perspective in Ongoing Health Policy Dialogue
          Staff of the WBG, like many other development institutions, are constantly engaged in policy dialogue
          with client governments. Diving deeper into these interactions within the WBG may shed light on
          relevant processes at other development institutions and illuminate clearer paths forward for all. For
          example, the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) used within the WBG provides a framework by
          articulating how the WBG will support a country’s national development plan while advancing the
          WBG’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. Given its impact on
          the economic development prospects of many countries, climate change should increasingly feature in
          Country Partnership Frameworks (CPFs) and in the analytical work that precedes it (particularly the
          Systematic Country Diagnostic). The connection between climate change and health should emerge
          as part of this process. The WBG should be conducting focused analytical work into the ways climate
          change is affecting health (and the pathways through which this contributes to dampening economic
          development) and how the health sector can both mitigate and adapt to climate change to further
          emphasize the links between climate change and health.
              Analytical work in this area can also enrich policy dialogue with both ministries of health and of
          finance. While important for defining priorities for operational lending, it is an important means for
          the WBG and other development institutions to play a thought-leadership role, helping governments
          identify emerging issues for the health sector. There is considerable scope for increasing the extent
          to which the development community addresses climate change in this dialogue. A more systemic
          approach to commissioning analytical work on the links between climate change and health at the
          national level would be a first step, with the results of this work influencing the process of identifying
          key priorities in the health sector.
              A second key area in which the development institutions can play an important role in policy
          dialogue is around financing for climate and health work. Considerable investment in climate change
          is occurring; a partial estimate put total private and public international financing at US$391 billion in
          2014.173 The majority of finance is for mitigation (particularly renewable energy), while US$25 billion
          was provided from public sources174 for adaptation, particularly in East Asia and the Pacific (46 percent),
          Sub-Saharan Africa (13 percent), and Latin America and the Caribbean (12 percent). The health sector
          has been excluded from this financing despite the opportunities that abound for health sector mitigation
          via low-carbon healthcare strategies and the sector’s significant and rising costs related to adaptation.
              Accordingly, the costs associated with health sector adaptation to climate change or the implemen-
          tation of low-carbon strategies are borne almost exclusively by traditional sources of financing for the

 5        Conclusion


          The health sector contributes significant emissions worldwide through energy use, transport, and through
          products manufactured, used, and disposed of. It is also at the forefront of the response to climate
          impacts, preventing and diminishing human casualties. Climate mitigation, adaptation, and low-carbon
          and resilient health development strategies reduce emissions, build healthcare climate resilience, and
          yield significant health and economic co-benefits. Climate-smart healthcare will strengthen the health
          sector and communities by ensuring access to clean and independent energy, safe water, clean transport,
          and clean waste disposal mechanisms. It will also stimulate the development and supply of sustainable
          products, while preparing the sector for a future of known and unknown health-related climate hazards.
              Fundamentally, climate-smart solutions can be a cornerstone of universal healthcare and sustain-
          able development. By integrating climate-smart principles into health sector strategies, development
          institutions can establish low-carbon, resilient, and adaptive programs that set precedents for other
          sectors, while sharply responding to pressing climate needs.
              The authors of this document have drawn on the resources of many other institutions and experts,
          and hope that others will use this work in their own efforts to amplify and accelerate the rate of posi-
          tive change toward more sustainable climate and health futures.

 1         Climate Change Glossary


           CO2: Carbon dioxide is the most prevalent greenhouse gas. CO2 emissions result from the combustion of fuel, from
               land use changes and from some industrial processes.
           CO2e: Carbon Dioxide Equivalent. There are six main greenhouse gases, which cause climate change and are tar-
               geted by the Paris Agreement. Each gas has a different global warming potential. For simplicity of reporting,
               the amount of each gas emitted is commonly translated into a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) amount so that
               the total impact from all sources can be summed to one figure.
           GHG: Greenhouse gases (GHG) include carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydro fluorocarbons, per fluoro-
               carbons and sulphur hexafluoride. They trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere, such that a rise in levels of GHG
               increases temperature—the so-called greenhouse effect.
           GHG Categories include direct or Scope 1 emissions, which are emissions directly controlled by an organization
               (mostly through the burning of fossil fuels). Scope 2 relates to indirect emissions from electricity, heat and
               steam purchased elsewhere but consumed and managed on-site, and Scope 3, which forms the bulk of indirect
               emissions, relate to the extraction, production and transportation of purchased materials and services procured.
           GHG Protocol: The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) is the most widely used international accounting
               tool for government and business leaders to understand, quantify, and manage greenhouse gas emissions.193
           Direct Carbon Emissions: Emissions resulting from on-site combustion of fuels which produce CO2 emissions, for
               example, the fossil fuel burned to heat water for a hospital. In addition, some processes emit other greenhouse
               gases. For instance, the production of certain chemicals produces methane (CH4) and the use of anesthetic
               gasses leads to nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions.
           Indirect Carbon Emissions: Emissions that are a consequence of an organization’s activities but occur off-site. For
               example, a medication or appliance dispensed by a healthcare provider has emissions produced during its manu-
               facture, transportation, usage and disposal. These are counted as indirect emissions of the healthcare provider.

2       Community Health and Safety
        Safeguard


        In August, 2016, the World Bank Board of Directors approved a review and update of World Bank Safe-
        guard policies. These are salient in many ways to this work. Relevant excerpts that deal with health
        are listed below.

        Excerpts:

        ESS4: Community Health and Safety 101. ESS4 consolidates into one standard the existing practices
        related to the impacts of projects on communities. It incorporates OP/BP 4.37, Safety of Dams, and also
        captures many of the World Bank’s provisions regarding the design and safety aspects of infrastructure,
        equipment, products, services, traffic, and hazardous materials. It requires borrowers to develop and
        implement measures to address possible community exposure to disease as a consequence of project
        activities and to address emergencies through contingency planning. ESS4 includes requirements on
        security personnel (both government and private) that are similar to the provisions of some other MDBs.

        49. Many of the investment projects the World Bank supports advance the realization of human
        rights expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including through better healthcare,
        education, and social protection, and better access to such services.

        57. Climate change is among the most pressing development issues of this generation. The World Bank
        recognizes the fundamental importance of this issue and has developed an institution-wide strategy to
        address it. The proposed ESF includes a range of climate change considerations, including GHG emission
        estimation in the proposed ESS3: Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention and Management, and
        climate change adaptation in ESS4: Community Health and Safety.

        153. Additional resources would be needed for the new steady state to cover, in particular, the fixed
        costs associated with hiring additional staff for new areas covered by the ESF, as well as variable
        and overhead costs required to deliver project support across the Bank’s IPF pipeline and portfolio.
        Incremental costs would be associated with: a) Broader scope of practice due to new topic areas (labor,
        community health and safety, stakeholder engagement), new processes (ESCP, risk classification, social
        assessment), and the assessment of borrowers’ ES frameworks. . .
