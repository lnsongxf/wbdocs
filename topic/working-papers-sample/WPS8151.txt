1. Introduction
   The movement of labor between sectors is a core aspect of structural change in
economies throughout the world.1 The effects of changes in prices, technology, and
policies on production, trade and living standards are strongly influenced by the
extent to which labor is able to relocate. In a literature survey, Hertel and Reimer
(2005, p. 400) find that “the poverty impacts of trade reform often hinge crucially
on how well the increased demand for labour in one part of the economy is
transmitted to the rest of the economy.” Drawing on a global CGE analysis, van
der Mensbrugghe (2007) indicates that the treatment of labor market segmentation
and sectoral wage differences has a strong impact on simulated welfare impacts of
the Doha round of trade reform, especially for developing countries. The findings
reported in Porto and Hoekman (2010) indicate that labor market frictions in
developing countries are substantial, giving rise to costly labor market
adjustments and limiting labor reallocation. Similarly, even though the analysis
has typically been done from a firm (as opposed to sector) perspective, labor
adjustments costs are a major focus in the labor economics literature (for example,
see Hamermesh 1989, Cooper and Willis 2009, and Cooper et al. 2015).
   The Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) literature includes a variety of
approaches to mobility, the most common being to assume that mobility between
any pair of sectors is either impossible or unconstrained. In this paper, we present
and test an innovative approach that, in contrast with this dichotomy, views inter-
sectoral labor mobility as falling along a continuum. It offers a means of making
sure that simulations with CGE models more closely approximate empirical
patterns for labor movements and/or wage differences between workers of
different origins (including incumbent workers) that are employed in a sector. The
approach is inspired by the classic transportation model of the linear
programming literature (for references, see Gass and Assad 2005, pp. 51-52) and
the product-space (PS) literature due to Hausmann and coauthors (Hausmann and
Klinger 2006; Hausmann et al. 2011).
   The essence of our approach is that workers are viewed as having capabilities
that to varying degrees permit them to be efficient in different sectors. As a
consequence, reallocation of workers between sectors comes at a cost in the form
of lost efficiency: labor that comes from another sector is less efficient than the
labor that already works in the receiving sector. These efficiency losses are related
to proximity between pairs of sectors, a key concept in the PS literature. It is valued
between 0 and 1 and here used to measure the degree to which a worker in the

1 We use the two terms “sector” and “activity” interchangeably with the same definition
as “industry” in the System of National Accounts, i.e. a grouping of establishments (or
producers) engaged in the same or similar kinds of activities classified in the same
International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) code
(United Nations 2003, p. 74).

sector of origin possesses the capabilities that are required in the sector of
destination. In the PS literature, proximity is defined on the basis of revealed
comparative advantage (RCA). We also draw on RCA-related data in the
illustrative application in this paper even though we do not consider this approach
as ideal and, in the conclusions, discuss other options for future research.2
    The efficiency losses due to reallocation are related to a distinction between
labor quantities in physical and efficiency units. For labor that stays within its
sector of origin (or moves to a sector considered to be in the same location as it
requires the same worker capabilities), physical and efficient labor quantities are
identical and the proximity is equal to 1. If labor moves to a different location (i.e.,
its proximity is less than 1), the efficient labor quantity received in the sector of
destination falls short of the efficient (and physical) quantity of labor that departs
from the sector of origin – the lower the proximity, the larger this shortfall. Profit-
maximizing producers consider the gap between efficient and physical labor in
their hiring decisions. They equalize payments to labor measured in efficiency
units, as a result being willing to pay a higher wage (per physical unit) for a worker
who already is in the sector, due to his/her higher degree of efficiency compared
to a worker from a different location. This treatment of wages echoes the writings
of Alfred Marshall, who coined and used the efficiency wage term to refer to wages
that reflect the exertion of ability and efficiency in work. He argued that
competition tends to equalize efficiency wages as opposed to the wages per time
unit, which differ across workers with different levels of efficiency (Marshall 1920,
Book VI, Chapter III); this is the same outcome that prevails at equilibrium in our
labor mobility model.3
    Given that proximities between sectors fall along a continuum, labor
segmentation also appears along a continuum as opposed to the common
dichotomy of treating labor in different sectors as belonging either to the same
segment or to different, separate segments. However, the two extremes of this
common dichotomy can still be captured as the special cases with all sectors
having proximities of 1 or very low proximities for the cases of belonging to the
same and fully separate segments, respectively. In the latter case, migration would
not take place due to the fact that the (efficiency-based) wage offered in the
destination sector would fall short of the wage in the sector of origin. In other
respects, our approach is consistent with alternative, common treatments of other


2 Strict adherence to the PS approach to the calculation of proximities would have the

drawback of excluding values that differ across labor types (since PS proximities are single-
dimensional, defined by sector) or are asymmetric (since the PS proximity or distance from
activity a to activity a’ is the same as the one from a’ to a).
3 This usage deviates from that of modern efficiency-wage theories with links between

wages and worker productivity, which may give raise to wage setting above market
equilibrium. For a survey, see Weiss (1991).

(non-mobility) aspects of labor market functioning, including the determination of
total employment for each labor type (with or without unemployment or
labor/leisure decisions), and the treatment of substitutability between labor
categories within sectors.
   A sector-based labor classification is natural given our focus on developing an
approach that is applicable to multi-sector CGE models. However, data
permitting, it would be both easy and often desirable to extend the labor
classification in the model to additional dimensions, such as educational
attainment or achievement or what may be labeled as skill or occupation. If so,
proximities would be defined in terms of the different dimensions taken together.
To exemplify, if the two dimensions are sector and skill, the proximity between
two service sectors may be higher for IT staff (if they use and possess very similar
skills in different sectors) than for engineers (if their skills differ more depending
on the specific sector of employment).
   In this paper, we test our capability-based approach in simulations with a
simple CGE model applied to an illustrative database for a Sub-Saharan African
(SSA) economy. We selected a database for SSA since, compared to other regions,
CGE models for this region tend to treat labor markets as competitive; i.e. they do
not tend to consider non-competitive aspects like unionization and minimum-
wage legislation.4 Apart from the introduction of the proximity treatment, this is
also how we treat the labor market. However, we consider the core innovation of
our model as equally valid for other regions.
   We proceed as follows: after a brief discussion of alternative approaches to
labor mobility, Section 2 presents our approach. The approach is tested in Section
3 in a set of comparative-static CGE simulations of the effects of export price
shocks for processed food products with alternative parameterizations of the labor
market. Conclusions and a discussion of future research are presented in Section
4. A full mathematical statement of the CGE model is provided in an appendix and
the model code and data are available as supplementary materials.

2. Method and data
   After a brief review of alternative treatments of labor mobility in CGE models
and the broader labor economics literature in Section 2.1, Section 2.2 presents and
analyzes the producer profit maximization problem on which we base the
proximity-based formulation for labor mobility. It also includes a brief description
of the simple CGE model into which it is embedded. (A full mathematical

4 To exemplify, Boccanfuso and Savard (2007), Go et al. (2010), and Diao and Thurlow

(2012) all assume competitive (but in some cases segmented) labor markets. CGE
applications to Sub-Saharan Africa with non-competitive labor markets are very rare. Two
examples, both related to minimum wages in South Africa, are Pauw and Leibbrandt
(2012) and Erero (2016).

CGE application is presented in Section 2.3.




2.1 Alternative treatments of labor mobility in CGE models
   The CGE literature includes a large variety of treatments of the labor market,
including labor mobility, which is the focus of this paper.5 As a reference point, it
may be helpful to remind the reader of the relatively standard and simple CGE
treatment of labor that is found in Lofgren et al. (2002). In this model, for each
labor type (one or more, often categorized on the basis of education or “skill”), (a)
the demand side is represented by first-order conditions for producer profit-
maximization in the form of a value-added function and an equation that, for each
production sector, imposes equality between the wage and the marginal value
product of labor; (b) the quantity of labor supplied for employment is exogenous;
and (c) a labor market equilibrium condition imposes equality between quantities
demanded and supplied, an outcome that is realized via adjustments in an
economy-wide wage variable. Labor is measured in physical units (e.g., number
of full-time workers employed during one year). Base-year wages, which vary
across activities, are computed on the basis of data on labor incomes (from the
SAM) and employment quantities. For any labor type, this market-clearing
mechanism does not change base-year relative wages by sector; it merely imposes
a uniform scaling of the wages across all activities. Each labor type is perfectly
mobile across the activities in which it is employed; a worker that moves from one
sector to another earns the same wage and is as productive as those who already
work in the receiving sector.
   The CGE literature includes alternative approaches that deviate from this
simple formulation in various ways, including the treatment of labor supply
(which alternatively may be endogenous, as a point on a wage curve or driven by
utility-maximizing household decisions), and sectoral wage differences (which
vanish if in every employing sector, one unit of each labor type is defined as the
quantity that earns a wage of one). An additional dimension of variation lies in the
treatment of value-added, where different functional forms and nestings of labor
and other factors have been used.


5 Boeters and Savard (2013) review the literature on labor markets in CGE models; their
discussion of labor market coordination and heterogeneity (pp. 1679-1706) covers some of
the issues addressed here. Annabi (2003) reviews the endogenization of labor supply, and
the modeling of unions and efficiency wages. CGE analyses that present and apply
approaches that deviate from the standard competitive market model are found in
Thierfelder and Shiells (1997), and Maechler and Roland-Holst (1997).

   With regard to labor mobility, the focus of this paper, instead of perfect
mobility, different types of segmentation are common with each segment
including one or more activities. Segments may either be watertight compartments
or allow for imperfect mobility (migration) between segments. According to one
type of segmentation, labor-demanding activities are classified as rural or urban.
The treatment of migration between the two areas may be based on the Harris-
Todaro model with urban unemployment and migration ensuring equality
between the rural wage and the expected urban wage; in the presence of urban
unemployment, the wage in urban areas is fixed and therefore not free to clear the
urban labor market (Dervis et al., 1982, pp. 178-180).6 Apart from the assumption
of urban unemployment, the rural-urban migration model is in the same spirit as
the formulation in Lofgren et al. (2002; described above) in the sense that, in both
cases, in response to shocks, labor would be reallocated to maintain exogenous
relative wage differences. Under a related approach, proposed by Flaig (2014, pp.
119-121), labor migrates to pools linked to multiple segments (with perfect
mobility within each pool) or between pairs of segments, with each segment
representing labor employed in one or more sectors. In both cases, migration
depends on relative wage changes in different segments and response elasticities.
In the GTAP model, the allocation of labor and other factors with imperfect
mobility (which are “sluggish”) is determined by a constant-elasticity-of-
transformation (CET) function, with the allocations responding to changes in
relative wages across activities (Hertel and Tsigas, 1997, pp. 51-52). Like
formulations with labor units derived from normalization of wages to unity, the
units of labor employed in different sectors do not correspond to physical units.
   A review of the econometric labor economics literature indicates that, as
opposed to the CGE literature, it has paid little attention to sectors. Its canonical
model for wage (and inequality) analysis disaggregates labor on the basis ‘skills’
(in practice a small number, sometimes proxied by educational attainment)
without any explicit reference to the sector dimension (Acemoglu and Autor 2011,
pp. 1096-1118). As with CGE models, their model is in the neoclassical tradition.
Wage changes for different skills depend on changes in labor market supplies and
demands, the latter influenced by technological change. Implicitly (in the absence
of any reference to sectors), the canonical model views labor in each skill group as


6 Empirically, rural-urban segmentation is problematic: available data do not permit
sectors to be split into rural and urban as, to varying degrees, production in all sectors
takes place both in rural and urban areas. If this is linked to household disaggregation
(inside the model or in a microsimulation module), then a further complication is that
workers residing in rural (urban) areas may work in urban (rural) areas. The assumption
of the Harris-Todaro model that rural labor is fully employed is also problematic and in
sharp contrast with what is assumed in the Lewis model with unlimited supplies of labor
(Lewis 1954).

perfectly mobile across sectors, i.e. in line with the most common assumption in
CGE modeling.
2.2 A proximity-based approach to labor segmentation
    This section first presents the static producer profit maximization problem with
a proximity-based formulation for labor mobility. Subsequently, we also briefly
describe the simple CGE model that is used in Section 3 and incorporates this labor
formulation. (See the appendix for a full mathematical statement of the CGE
model.) The proposed treatment is inspired by the classical transportation model.7
In this model, the cost of transporting a set of items from supply to demand depots
is minimized subject to demand and supply constraints, with a transportation cost
of zero when the demand and supply depots are in the same location. In our
approach, the items are physical units of labor and the unit transportation costs
are replaced by efficient employment losses driven by distance (or proximity)
measures, inspired by the PS literature. In both settings, the extent to which a
demand location draws on different supplies depends on the market wage or price
in the supply location and the loss that is imposed when a good or a unit of labor
is relocated.
    In mathematical terms, the optimization problem of the producer in destination
activity a may be stated as:8
                      maximize ∙         −∑ ∑           , ∙       , ,
                                                                                (1)

transportation model and its optimality conditions. A comparison to the conditions of the
producer problem of this section highlights the parallels between, on one hand,
transportation costs and goods movement in the transportation model and, on the other
hand, efficiency losses and labor movements in our model.
8 To simplify, this mathematical statement suppresses domain controls, and the activity

subscript for the exponent ρ. This discussion also abstracts from two features of the CGE
model that is applied model in Section 3: intermediate inputs, and exogenous relative wage
differences between activities.

employed quantity of factor f in efficiency units in activity a;          , , proximity
between any source activity a’ and the current activity a with respect to factor f
(0 < , , ≤ 1). 9
In words, the objective function (1) defines profits as the difference between output
revenue and factor costs, the latter defined as the sum of employed physical factor
units from different source activities a’ multiplied by related wages. The
constraints, subject to which profits are maximized, consist of a CES function that
defines output as a function of efficient factor quantities (2); a linear equation that
defines efficient factor quantities as the sum of physical quantities multiplied by
proximities between source activities a’ and the destination activity a (3); and non-
negativity constraints on factor reallocation (4). Note that, for the proximity
parameters, a value of 1 is used for the special case where a = a’, i.e., the case where
labor stays in each original activity or where two activities, a and a’, are considered
identical in terms of required worker capabilities. For factors without this
reallocation mechanism (in our case non-labor factors), the proximity parameter is
1 for all relevant a-a’ mappings, putting them in the same, economy-wide pool.
   The Lagrangian of the optimization problem, L, may be expressed as:


      =     ∙    −                    ,           ∙               ,       ,       +                        ,   ∙   ,       −


                     +                        ,               ,       ,       ∙                ,   ,   −       ,

where is the shadow price of output and                , , the efficiency-unit shadow
wage (or rent) of factor f in (destination) activity a, henceforth referred to as the

   Equations 12-17 all appear in the CGE model, which is implemented as a mixed-
complementarity problem.11 Equation 12, a familiar condition for profit
maximization, states that, at optimum, the marginal value product of labor in
activity a equals the wage, in this case the efficiency wage (          , ) since the
production function uses efficiency units. Equation 13 imposes that, at optimum,
the physical wage in a’ (      , ) has to be larger than or equal to the proximity- 
adjusted efficiency wage (         , ∙   , , ). The labor quantities allocated from

                                                                         9
any a’ to a have to be non-negative (14). In equation 15, for any allocation that takes
place (is positive), the parenthesized expression with wage terms must be zero,
i.e., equation 13 must hold as an equality. The remaining two equations define the
value-added function (16) and the link between labor hiring in efficiency units (on
the left) to labor hiring in physical units (on the right) (17)
    In order to see the economic logic behind and implications of equations 13 and
15, it may help to restate equation 13 as:

                                                  ,
                                                       ≥   ,                             (13’)
                                          ,   ,


If labor in a’ is allocated to a (     , , > 0), then the equality between the left-
and right-hand sides of (13’) imposed by equation 15 means that the physical wage
in the location of origin a’, adjusted for the proximity parameter (the left side),
equals the efficiency wage of labor in a (the right side). This shows that activity a
allocates its hiring of labor from different sources so that the wage per efficiency
unit of labor is equal across all sources. It means that activities pay less efficient
workers a lower wage per physical unit. Drawing on equation 13’, if a employs
workers from two sources, a’ and a’’, and the proximity of a’ is higher ( , , >
   , , ),      then,      given             , =       , ⁄    , , =        , ⁄    , , ,
       , ⁄        ,   = , , ⁄ , , > 1.

On the other hand, for the case where workers from a’ are not hired in a
(        , , = 0), equation 15 permits the right-hand side of equation 13’ to be
strictly larger than the left-hand side. This means that, after corrected for low
efficiency (a low proximity), a worker from a’ requires a wage that is too high to
be competitive in activity a. The implication is that efficiency-based wage setting
stacks the cards against reallocation of labor from a’ to a if the proximity is low
(strong misfit between the capabilities of the worker associated with a’ and those
required in a).12,13
    The simulations in Section 3 use a simple static CGE model into which the
proximity-based labor treatment is embedded. Apart from the labor treatment

  With regard to optimal outcomes, they do not include the case where              , ⁄    , , <
12

        , since, if so, profits could be increased by hiring more labor from a’ in a; i.e. after
correction for efficiency losses, the wage paid for labor from a’ is below the labor efficiency
wage for a.
13 Similarly, willingness to pay a higher wage to workers already in their current

employment is also generated by labor market insider-outsider theories. However, as
opposed to our model, the focus is here on firms (not sectors) and the reasons are different:
labor turnover costs among which lower productivity due to absent skills is only one part
(cf. Lindbeck and Snower, 1988).

(which is based on equations 12-17), the CGE model is typical of models of small
open economies with optimizing behavior for households and producers,
domestic markets for commodities and factors cleared by flexible prices and
wages, respectively, and a government that consumes, saves, taxes, and both
receives and pays transfers. With regard to its treatment of factors, in distinction
from the producer maximization problem, the CGE model also requires
equilibrium conditions for factor markets, which are defined over f and a’ (one
condition for each factor stock and activity of origin). These conditions may be
stated as follows:
                                            ,   ,    =    ,

   where          ,  is the available physical quantity of factor f that has the
capabilities required in source activity a’. The condition imposes equality between
this quantity and the sum of the physical quantities of labor f from a’ that are
allocated to any activity a. It is cleared by the wage variable,       , , which is
exogenous in the producer model but endogenous (and in upper case) in the CGE
model.
2.3 Data
   The bulk of the dataset for our model consists of a social accounting matrix
(SAM) and sectoral employment quantities (both for the simulation base-year),
complemented by a set of elasticities (for production, consumption, and trade).
Due to our proximity-based treatment, additional data is needed for the proximity
parameter. We will here present the model database with special emphasis on the
construction of the data for the proximity parameter.
   In this application, the SAM is designed to capture the sectoral structure of an
SSA country that is not strongly reliant in natural resource exports.14 The SAM is
used to define base-year values for the bulk of the model parameters, including
production technologies, sources of commodity supplies (domestic output or
imports), demand patterns (for household and government consumption,
investment and exports), transfers between different institutions, and tax rates.
The disaggregation of our country SAM coincides with that of the rest of the model
database. As shown in Table 1, it is disaggregated into 23 sectors (activities and
commodities) – 3 in agriculture, 2 in mining, 13 in manufacturing, and 7 in services
– with each activity producing a single commodity for which it is the only
domestic producer. The factors are split into labor, private capital, and natural
resources (5 types: agricultural land, forestry land, fishing resources, and two
natural resources used in extractive industries). The institutions are split into
households, government, and the rest of world. A set of auxiliary accounts cover

    On the basis of the SAM data, Table 2 summarizes the sectoral structure of the
illustrative SSA economy: sectoral shares in value-added, production,
employment, exports and imports, as well as the split of domestic sectoral supplies
between exports and domestic sales, and domestic sectoral demands between
imports and domestic output. For instance, while (primary) agriculture represents
a significant share of employment (around 66 percent), its shares of value added
(VA), production, and exports are much smaller (in the range of 15-25 percent).
The share of its output that is exported is around 10 percent while only some 5
percent of domestic demands are met via imports.

   Table 3 shows the factor shares in total sectoral value added. For example, the
table shows that agriculture is relatively intensive in the use of labor; this
information will be useful to analyze the results from the CGE simulations.

   Compared to a standard CGE application, additional data is needed for the
proximity parameter. As indicated in the preceding section, the values for this
parameter should measure the extent to which a worker that belongs to activity a’
has the capabilities required from workers in a destination activity a; in other
words, it should measure the efficiency of workers from a’ in a compared to
workers that belong to a. Different approaches are possible and in the concluding
section we highlight this as an important area for future research.
   For the purposes of this paper, we found it convenient to draw on the PS
approach, computing proximities on the basis of revealed comparative advantage

(RCA) data computed from international trade data.15 In PS analysis, the proximity
of one sector to another is the core indicator of how close the two sectors are in
terms of the capabilities needed for competitive production. In this paper, we
apply it to labor as an indicator of the closeness of the capabilities required in
different sectors.
   RCA measures the degree of comparative advantage by country, commodity,
and time. A country has an RCA in commodity c if the following indicator has a
value above unity:

                                          , ,                , ,
                                    ∑    , ,              ∑     , ,
                            , , =   ∑
                                                   =
                                                          ∑
                                           , ,                 , ,
                                  ∑ ∑         , ,      ∑   ∑       , ,
where E stands for export value (in US$) while the indices r (or r’), c (or c’ or c’’),
and t stand for countries (“regions”), commodities (often referred to as products,
typically limited to goods), and years, respectively.16 We name the related binary
0-1 variable      01 , , 	( 01 , , = 0	if	        , , < 1;	     01 , , = 1	if	 , , ≥ 1).
The term in the middle defines RCA as the ratio between the shares of commodity
c in country and world exports while the term on the right equivalently defines it
as the ratio between the shares of the country in global exports of commodity c
and in total global exports.
    The proximity between two commodities, c and c’, in time t, , , 0 ≤ , , ≤
1 is derived from data on probabilities of simultaneously having                   , , ≥
1	and	      , , ≥  1 :
                , , = min         01 ,      01 , ,           01 ,      01 ,
where P (the conditional probability) is computed using all countries r in year t,
and where
                                        1	if	         , , >1
                                 01 , =
                                        0	if	         , , ≤1




15 PS analysis, which was pioneered in Hausmann and Klinger (2006) and Hidalgo et al.
(2007), offers a data-driven evaluation of the feasibility and desirability of alternative
sectoral transformation options for a country, considering its initial export structure and
the structure across a near complete set of country-level export data.
16 In PS analysis, the indices c and i are typically used for country and product; in our CGE

model and those of many others, c is used for commodities (goods or services). In order to
avoid confusion and to keep notation consistent throughout this study, we switch to r for
countries (or “regions”; this follows the example of GTAP) and use c for commodities. It
should also be noted that our CGE makes a distinction between commodities c (outputs)
and activities a (producing outputs); in this application, there is a one-to-one mapping
between the two.




                                                15
   In our application, the proximity indicator is used as a measure of how close
the capabilities of workers in a sector are from those required for full efficiency in
other sectors; in the PS literature, it is used as a measure of a country’s capabilities,
also considering other inputs. The proximity indicator follows the disaggregation
of the CGE database. For the commodities that it covers, we use the Comtrade
export database. However, proximity data are also needed for sectors not covered
by Comtrade. Non-Comtrade commodities are made up of services and a subset
of goods (the latter including utilities and construction); all tend to be relatively
non-traded. Given that, export data may not exist or be relevant to RCA
measurement, we instead use GTAP value-added data. Given that our dataset has
a one-to-one mapping between activities (production sectors) and commodities
(outputs), it is straightforward to define RCA and proximity indicators using
export data for one commodity subset and VA data for another commodity subset.
   The computed raw proximity data between all pairs of commodities are shown
in Table 4.17 Further, before the CGE implementation of these raw proximities,
scaling was needed to generate empirically valid representations of labor market
segmentation.18 This is part of the broader challenge of testing and improving the
validity of CGE models in manners that consider the context of different types of
applications.




17 A model with multiple labor categories would require multiple proximity matrices to
permit proximity data to differ by labor category (for example, classified by educational
attainment, skill, or occupation). For example, IT and human resources staff may have very
small distances between sectors; other skilled tasks may be highly specialized.
18 In our application in Section 3, the scaled proximity parameter,
                                                                             , , used in the model
is derived from the original raw proximity parameter using the following formula:               , =

    , +       ∙ 1−       , , where        is a factor-specific scaling parameter. The higher the
value of the latter, the higher the scaled proximity. To ensure that 0 ≤          , ≤ 1, the scaling
parameter should satisfy the following restriction: − ,             1−     ,     ≤        ≤ 1. Note
that   lim        ,   +     ∙ 1−       ,    = 1. If the non-scaled proximities are too low,
          →
simulated factor reallocation falls short of what is observed in practice; to make
reallocation easier, the value of the scaling parameter should be within the following range:
0<        ≤ 1. Given current uncertainty about its value, it may be seen as the exogenous
shift parameter that is used in the non-base simulations to explore the implications of
different degrees of sensitivity of efficiency for potentially relocated labor to proximity.

    In addition to the SAM and proximity data, our CGE model also requires (a)
base-year estimates for sectoral employment levels, and (b) a set of elasticities (for
production, consumption and trade). In order to estimate sectoral employment,
we combined population data with estimates for sectoral employment shares in
broad sectoral categories from World Bank (2016). In turn, elasticities were given
a value based on the available evidence for comparable countries. For elasticities,
the following values were used: (a) the elasticity of substitution among factors is
in the 0.2–1.15 range, relatively low for primary sectors and relatively high for
manufactures and services (see Narayanan et al. 2012); (b) the expenditure
elasticities for household consumption were obtained from Seale et al. (2003); and
(c) trade elasticities are 4 for both Armington and CET elasticities.19 Given the
uncertainty with respect to our elasticity values, we conducted a systematic
sensitivity analysis of our simulation results with respect to their values; it
indicated that the results presented here are robust.20


19 These CET and Armington elasticities may seem high. However, the size of responses to
trade-related shocks depend not only on these trade elasticities but also on other aspects
of the model, including the size of production responses which, in their turn, depend on
(a) the mobility of labor and other factors; and (b) elasticities of factor substitution. Thus, a
given trade-related shock may generate similar trade and production responses with a
combination of high factor mobility and low trade elasticities or, alternatively, low factor
mobility and high trade elasticities.

3. Simulations
3.1. Scenarios
   This section presents the simulations and analyzes their results. The
simulations consist of a base solution (which replicates the base-year economy)
and a set of non-base scenarios. All scenarios are run under the assumption of
fixed total employment. At the macro level, our CGE model – like others – requires
the specification of the equilibrating mechanisms (“closures”) for three
macroeconomic balances: government, savings-investment, and the balance of
payments. Unless specified otherwise, in all simulations the following
macroeconomic closure rules are applied: (a) in order to ensure that the
simulations are budget neutral, changes in income tax rates on households clear
the government budget (i.e., compared to base values, no other changes in taxes
or other revenue sources, domestic or foreign, are permitted); (b) in order to ensure
that the simulations are neutral in terms of changes in country net foreign assets,
foreign savings (the current account deficit) is fixed in foreign currency, an
outcome that is achieved through changes in the real exchange rate; and (c) in
order to ensure neutrality across the simulations in terms of investing for the
future, real investment is fixed; as a result of this and given the fact that real
government consumption also is fixed, change in real private consumption may
be used to measure changes in aggregate welfare. With regard to non-labor factors,
for all simulations we assume that they are sector-specific (no mobility between
sectors).
   The different non-base scenarios and their treatment of labor mobility are
shown in Table 5. The non-base simulations explore how the impact of a terms-of-
trade shock is influenced by alternative settings for labor proximities. Across all
scenarios, we impose a 35 percent increase in the food export price.21 Given the
sectoral structure described in Table 2 (e.g., the food industry has a relatively high
export-to-output ratio), this shock serves to illustrate the working of the proposed
approach to modeling labor mobility across sectors.




21 In addition, sensitivity tests indicated that our qualitative findings were robust to
alternative magnitudes for the shock: specifically, we tested the same five labor proximity
settings for increases in the food export price in a range from 10 to 50 percent. The results
from these additional scenarios are downloadable as supplementary material from
www.jgea.org/resources/jgea/ojs/index.php/jgea/article/view/39.

3.2. Results
   Tables 6-9 and Figures 1 and 2 summarize the results for the simulations,
covering both the macro and sector levels. Overall, the results are regular and as
expected. At the macro level (Table 6 and Figure 1), the higher the degree of
mobility, the stronger the gains. For the zero mobility scenario, the gain in the food
export price raises the value of exports, generating a balance of payments surplus
and an equilibrating appreciation of the real exchange rate, which reduces the
export volume, raises the import volume, and increases absorption, in this case
private consumption since the other parts of absorption (investment and
government consumption) are fixed in real terms. These changes take place
without any changes in employment or production, i.e., given the assumption that
non-labor factors are sector-specific, existing output is merely reallocated from
exports to domestic sales.
   Across all scenarios, the higher the degree of labor mobility, the stronger the
gains in absorption and private consumption, indicating that a more flexible
economy is better at reallocating resources to gain from (or mitigate losses due to)
international price changes.22 Since it is able to focus on higher-valued exports, a
flexible economy is able to maintain external balance with smaller export

22 A higher trade deficit is more favorable in the sense that, for any given level of real GDP,
it permits higher level of domestic final demands (absorption). In addition to the terms of
trade gain and labor reallocation, in this set of simulations, the measured welfare gain is
boosted because the favored sector (food) pays wages that are above the average. This is
due to the fact that the equilibrium solutions (reflecting real world observations) retain
observed wage gaps (in our model with fixed relative wage differences, a common
formulation). Higher than average wages in certain sectors may compensate for a relatively
high disutility from work in these sectors; however, this is not reflected in the model or in
the welfare measures (based on private consumption) that are presented.

quantities and higher import quantities. GDP at factor cost increases slightly for
the non-zero-mobility scenarios due to the fact that, in the food sector, which
accounts for almost all output and employment increases, marginal productivity
of labor (and wages) are above average.23
    For the real exchange rate, the expected result is that higher mobility would
reduce the appreciation needed to eliminate the surplus in the current account;
this is indeed the result across the simulations with non-zero labor mobility.
However, the lowest real appreciation is registered for the simulation with zero
mobility; this is due to the fact that, for this simulation, the absence of employment
changes prevents output and export increases for the food sector that drastically
increase the current account surplus and, given this, the need for real appreciation.
    Labor reallocation to the food sector is the reason behind the absorption gains
beyond what is achieved for the zero mobility scenario – the higher the proximity,
the stronger the mobility, the reallocation, and the ability of the economy to export
at more favorable terms with the benefits appearing in higher imports and
absorption. Table 7 shows the shares of the workers initially employed in different
sectors that, in response to the shock, move to the food sector. As expected, when
labor mobility increases (among other things meaning that other sectors are in
closer proximity to the food industry), we see labor moving into the food industry
from a larger number of sectors. For example, labor moves from four and ten
sectors in the medium and high scenarios, respectively.
    From a different angle, Figure 2 displays the percent changes for output,
efficient employment, and physical employment in the food sector for the different
scenarios.24 Except for the case with perfect mobility, the quantity of labor in
efficiency units that moves to the food sector is smaller than the physical quantity
due to the loss in efficiency. The fact that certain sectors are more prone to release
labor to food is in part determined by the proximity data – other manufacturing
sectors, such as beverages, are relatively close to food. In fact, Table 4 in Section
2.3 shows that beverages is a sector in close proximity to the food processing
industry. However, the pattern of labor reallocation is also influenced by other
factors, including the extent to which the output of the different sectors is tradable
– as a result of the real appreciation, non-food sectors that are relatively tradable
lose more than others in terms of relative profitability.
    Tables 8 and 9 show the changes in sectoral output and employment (both
physical and efficient), respectively. Not surprisingly, the major backward link of


23 Given the current set of assumptions, real GDP at factor cost changes due to (a) losses in
productivity when labor moves between sectors; and (b) exogenous wage differentials
across sectors. Labor movements between two sectors with a linking proximity of 1 (no
productivity loss) and identical wages, do not change GDP.
24 Under perfect mobility, we can compute employment changes but we cannot single out

the sectors of origin and destination for labor movements.

food is with agriculture. In the base-year dataset the food industry accounts for 27
percent of total demand for agricultural output.25 As the increase in food
production increases with increased mobility, the positive impact on intermediate
food demands for agricultural output comes to dominate the negative impact on
agricultural exports from appreciation. Interestingly, this input-output relation
between agriculture and food dominates the labor reallocation from agriculture to
food that would have been expected given the close proximity between them (see
Table 4 in Section 2.3).
   In Table 9, all contracting activities show the same negative changes in physical
and efficiency units since all of the departing workers were assigned to the
activities from they depart (their proximities were equal to one, i.e., a=a’). On the
other hand, given that the proximities for movements from contracting to
expanding activities here always are less than one, the positive employment
changes are always smaller in efficiency units than in physical units.

4. Conclusions
    In this paper, we present an intuitive entry point to the modeling of labor-
market mobility: labor movements and wage differentiation are driven by the
extent to which sectors are similar in terms of the capabilities that are required
from their workers. It fits naturally in economy-wide models where producer
decisions are driven by profit-maximization and labor may be reallocated across
sectors. The approach is flexible in that, subject to data constraints, it can replicate
any observed pattern of pair-wise sector segmentation, including asymmetric
patterns: for example, unskilled worker reallocation from agriculture to
construction may be easy whereas reallocation in the opposite direction may be
difficult due to the fact that construction workers lack many of the capabilities
required in agricultural work.
    A research agenda that draws on the proposed approach may address several
issues. The top priority may be to empirically estimate proximity parameters,
preferably with disaggregations that are closely aligned with the disaggregation
of the rest of the application database both with regard to sectors and labor types.
Given that mobility is likely to vary across labor types, the payoffs may be high
from further disaggregation (for example on the basis of educational attainment
or gender). Household and labor market surveys may provide (or be designed to
provide) needed data on worker movements and how the wages received by
workers employed in a sector differ depending on their sector of origin.
    A second direction of research is related to extensions of the approach, each of
which would come with its own additional data requirements. Here, top empirical
priorities may be to bring unemployment into the model, presumably with
sectoral capabilities assigned to the unemployed, and to make the analysis
dynamic. In a dynamic setting, it would be necessary to model the evolution of the
size of the labor pools, disaggregated by sector and perhaps according to other
criteria. In light of learning by doing, it would be natural to expect the labor stocks
(classified by assigned capabilities) to grow relatively fast for sectors with
increasing shares of employment. It would also be necessary to consider the
sectoral capabilities of those who enter to or exit from the labor force.26 When
addressing these issues, it would be crucial to draw on the labor economics
literature. The development of dynamic approaches to labor market modeling that




26Those who enter and leave the labor force may be split into different categories. For
example, entrants may be composed of people leaving school, immigrants, and youth
reaching labor force age) while those who exit may be made up of those who leave the
labor force due to emigration, retirement, and death. Movements into or out of the labor
force may also be due to other causes (such as changing gender roles or changing prospects
for landing a job).

ahead for CGE modeling.27

Appendix. Mathematical statement of CGE model




                                        29
   This appendix provides a detailed mathematical statement of the CGE model
used for this paper. The model equations are divided into four blocks: A.
Production activities and factor markets; B. Domestic and foreign trade; C.
Domestic institutions; and D. System constraints and price indices.
   Tables A.1-A.5 explain notational principles and define model sets, variables,
and parameters. Drawing on these tables and set of tables with the model
equations (Tables A.6-A.9), we subsequently provide a detailed presentation of the
model equations with one section for each block. In the mathematical presentation,
the settings for closure rules (for government budget, savings-investment
payments, and factor and commodity markets) and other assumptions match what
was used in the simulations of this paper.

Production activities and factor markets

are the first-order conditions for the optimization problem solved by the
representative firm in each industry or activity (i.e., cost minimization/profit

maximization).28 The value added production technology is CES (Constant
Elasticity of Substitution; equation PRD1). In the demand functions for factors f
without the proximity treatment (in FNPROX; PRD2), the (unit) wage in activity a
is computed as          ∙          , , where             , is a “distortion” factor that
allows modeling cases in which the factor remuneration differs across activities.29
As discussed in Lofgren et al.(2002), this formulation facilitates implementing
alternative closures (i.e., mechanisms to equalize quantities supplied and
demanded) in the factor markets.30 In this application, the factors in FNPROX are
all activity-specific and            , is the variable that clears these activity-specific
markets.  
    	For factors in FPROX; i.e., factors with proximity-based sectoral movements,
the treatment is based on the optimization problem that was presented in Section
2.2. Equation PRD3 provides the demand functions for this factor subset. Given
that factor supplies are exogenous by activity (as indicated by the bar on the factor
employment variable            , ), their wage variables,           , , clear the markets.
Equation PRD4 defines intermediate input demands using Leontief coefficients,
which represent exogenous quantities of intermediate input by commodity and
activity (    , ).
    Equation PRD5 computes the production of each commodity on the basis of the
  , parameter, which is a fixed output coefficient (the production of c per unit of
activity a). Thus, like the supply-and-use tables, our model differentiates between
activities and commodities (or products): an activity can produce more than
commodity and the same commodity may be produced by more than one activity.
    Equations PRD6 and PRD7 define prices related to each production activity. In
equation PRD6, the price of value added (the payment to value added per unit of
each activity) is defined as the difference between the activity price (the payment
received for outputs per unit of the activity net of the tax on activity revenue)
minus the cost of intermediate inputs per unit of the activity. The latter cost is the
product of the above-mentioned intermediate input coefficient (                , ) and the
price of each intermediate, summed over all intermediates. Equation PRD7 defines
the activity price as the product of output yields per unit of the activity, , , and
related producer output prices, summed over all outputs.
    The remaining equations of this block are factor-related, imposing equality
between quantities demanded and supplied. As noted, in the current application,
all factors in the set FNPROX are activity-specific with the variable clearing their

   In this presentation, its value is exogenous only for labor, the only factor in FPROX
(see below).

   Besides, for the factors considered as specific, equation (PRD3) is interpreted as an
equilibrium condition between factor supply and demand.

markets (cf. equation PRD2). Given this, the economy-wide market equilibrium
condition, PRD8, becomes superfluous; here it simply defines total factor supply
(which is endogenous) as the sum of the exogenous demands in the different
activities. To facilitate a switch to closures where this condition matters, this
equation is nevertheless retained.31
    On the other hand, drawing on the optimization analysis in Section 2.2., for a
factor f in the set FPROX, equation PRD9 constrains total employment from source
(or supply) activity a to the exogenous supply quantity. The related market-
clearing variable,            , , is the wage per physical unit of factor f from activity a.
Equation PRD10 defines the efficient quantity of each factor f employed in a
destination activity a’ as the sum of the efficiency-adjusted physical quantities of
factor f from different activities a; the related variable                , represents the
market-based wage per efficiency unit of factor f in destination activity a. Equation
PRD11 states that, for each factor f, the wage per physical unit in its source activity
a is at least as high as the wage per physical unit in destination activity a’, with the
latter defined as the proximity-scaled efficiency wage. Equation PRD12 imposes
that the quantity of factor f from source activity a employed in destination activity
a’ is non-negative. The two equations are linked via equation PRD13, a mixed-
complementarity relationship, which states that two regimes are possible. In the
first regime,          , , > 0 (i.e., a positive quantity of factor f moves from a to a’);
in the current simulations, this is invariably the case for a = a’ (at least part of the
supply of each factor stays employed in its activity of origin) but typically also for
some a-a’ mappings with ≠ ′. If                   , , > 0, then the parenthesized part of
equation PRD13 must equal zero. In effect,                   , =        , when a = a’ (i.e.,
for the part of the factor that stays in its activity of origin). If part of the supply in
a moves to another activity a’ for some f-a-a’ mappings with                        , , < 1,
then	          , >           , , (i.e., in order for a’ to pay the same wage per physical
unit of f as a while maximizing its profits, the scarcity value per efficiency unit of f
in a’ must exceed its value per physical and efficiency unit in a). The second regime
applies to the f-a-a’ mappings for which                 , , = 0; in our application, this is
the most common case when ≠ 	 ′. If so, the parenthesized part of PRD13 may
be a strict inequality, i.e. the efficiency wage of f in a’ is too low to make up for the
efficiency loss (due to that              , , < 1).
    In equations PRD14 and PRD15, the total income of each factor f,            , is defined
for factors without and with proximity-based sectoral allocation, respectively. In


31 Different treatments are possible. For example, total supply (employment) may be

exogenous while mobility may be free across all activities; for such factors,
      	and	          , 	would	be	exogenous	while	 , 		and	   would be endogenous,
leaving the total number of endogenous variables unchanged. In this case, equation PRD2
is an essential part of the model.

payments from activities while the second term defines transfers to factors from

Domestic and foreign trade
    Table A.7 shows the equations for the domestic and foreign trade block.
Equations TRD1-TRD3 are related to prices. In TRD1, the export price received by
producers,       , is defined as the world export price, transformed into domestic
currency via the exchange rate and adjusted for export taxes and the transactions
(trade and transport) cost per unit of exports; the unit transactions cost is defined
as the product of an input coefficient (      , ) and the input price, summed over all
inputs. In analogous fashion, equation TRD2 defines the domestic currency import
price for demanders,         , on the basis of the world import price, the exchange
rate, and import tariffs, in this case with the unit transactions cost added to the
price; note that this price does not ,include the sales tax (cf. equation TRD7).In both
equations, it is assumed that the modeled economy is small; thus, world prices for
exports and imports (          	and	      ) are exogenous. Equation TRD3 links the
demander and supplier prices for domestic output sold domestically,
      	and	      : the demander price is defined as the supplier price plus the
transactions cost per unit of domestically sold output; as will be discussed below,
either of these prices can be seen as the market-clearing price for this category of
outputs (cf. equation SYS2).
    Equations TRD4-TRD7 explain the allocation of domestic demands between
imports and domestic purchases and define the related demander price of
composite commodities, made up of imported and/or domestically produced
commodities. Following the Armington assumption, we assume that products are
differentiated on the basis of their origin (domestic or foreign). Consequently, it is
possible to account for two-way trade (i.e., the same product may be exported and
imported simultaneously; this is in distinction to merely accounting for net trade).
The composite commodities that are demanded domestically are a CES
aggregation of domestic and imported products (equation TRD4). For
commodities that lack either imports or domestic production, TRD4 is replaced by
TRD5: their composite quantities are simply identical to the quantity of imports or

the quantity of domestic sales of domestic output.33 For commodities with both
imports and domestic purchases of domestic output equation TRD6 is the
tangency condition that determines the domestic/imported mix; it is part of the
first-order conditions for demander cost minimization. Equation TRD7 implicitly
defines the price of the composite product,        , given	the	composite	quantity,  ,
and the sum of the values of imports and domestic purchases, adjusted upward
for the sales tax; notice that the tax base excludes the tax.
    Equations TRD8-TRD11 turn to the supply side, addressing the allocation of
domestic output between two destinations: exports and domestic markets: output
is viewed as imperfectly transformable between these two destinations. A CET
(Constant Elasticity of Transformation) function defines the allocation of output,
      , between exports and domestic sales (         and      ; equation TRD8).34 For
products that lack exports or domestic sales, equation TRD8 is replaced by
equation TRD9: output quantity equals the export quantity or the domestic sales
quantity. Equation TRD10 defines the ratio between exports and domestic sales
for commodities that have both; it is part of the first-order conditions for producer
profit maximization. Equation TRD11 implicitly defines the producer price for
commodity c,        , given the output quantity and, on the right-hand side, the sum
of the values of domestic sales and exports at producer prices.
    The last equation in this block, TRD12, defines the total transactions demand,
i.e., the demand for commodities (in practice trade and transportation services)
that are used in the distribution of commodities between (1) producers and the
border (for exports); (2) producers and domestic demanders (for domestic sales);
and (3) demanders and the border (for imports). For each category, the
transactions demand is defined as the quantity that is distributed (exported,
imported, or sold domestically) multiplied by exogenous unit input coefficients.

Domestic institutions
   The equations presented in Table A.8 define current incomes and their uses
(consumption, savings, and transfers) for domestic institutions (government and
non-government). The first equation, INS1, computes the factor income received
by each institution i as the total income of the factor (     ) net of direct taxes on
factor income multiplied the share of the institution in the total endowment of the
factor ( ℎ , ).
   Equations INS2-INS7 apply to domestic non-government institutions (in the set
INSDNG), invariably one or more households but, depending on the database,
potentially also including enterprises and other institutions like NGOs. This set of
equations defines their incomes, savings, and spending. As shown by equation
INS2, the income of institution i is the sum of four elements: (1) factor income; (2)
transfers from the government, indexed to the consumer price index (             ); (3)
transfers from rest of the world (i.e., remittances), exogenous in foreign currency
and transformed into domestic currency; and (4) transfers from other domestic
non-government institutions. Equation INS3 computes the marginal propensity to
save as the exogenous base rate,          , multiplied by a scaling factor,           ,
which here is endogenous; for the base solution, the scaling factor is equal to one
but otherwise it may take on other values and, under alternative treatments of the
savings-investment balance, it may be exogenous. Equation INS4 computes the
value of savings for each institution as its total income net of direct taxes
multiplied by its savings rate. Equation INS5 defines transfers from domestic non-
government institutions to any other institution (government, non-government,
or the rest of the world). These transfer flows are endogenous, defined as
exogenous shares of the incomes of domestic non-government institutions net of
direct taxes and savings. Equation INS6 computes the consumption spending by
domestic non-government institutions as their income net of transfers to other
institutions, savings, and direct taxes.35 Equation INS7 defines consumption
expenditure for the subset of consuming units in INSDNG, labeled as households
– INSDNG may also include institutions that do not consume, like enterprises.
Household consumption expenditure is distributed across commodities on the
basis of a Stone-Geary utility function from which linear expenditure system (LES)
demand functions are derived.
   A parallel set of equations, INS8-INS13, defines incomes, savings, and current
spending for the government. Equation INS8 computes government current
income as the sum of (1) revenues from direct taxes (on institutions and factors);

35Among the potential domestic non-government institutions, enterprises do not consume
by definition whereas households consume. If the database includes NPISHs (non-profit
institutions in the service of households, including NGOs), then these may also consume.

(2) revenues from indirect taxes (taxes on sales, imports, exports, imports, and
producer output value); (3) transfers from the rest of the world and domestic non-
government institutions; and (4) factor income. Note that transfers from the rest of
the world to the government, like private transfers, are exogenous in foreign
currency and transformed into domestic currency. As indicated by Equation INS9,
initial direct tax rates are scaled by the variable          , the variable that clears
the current government budget. Equation INS10 computes government
consumption of c as the product of (a)       , which is exogenous and initially holds
the base-year quantities; and (b) a scaling factor,              , which here also is
exogenous; for the base solution, this scaling factor is equal to one but otherwise it
may take on other values and, under alternative treatments of the government
budgetary balance, it may be endogenous. Government current spending
(equation INS11) is defined as the sum of government consumption and
government transfers (domestic and/or to the rest of the world). Nominal
government savings is the difference between current income and current
spending (equation INS12). Real government savings, the ratio between nominal
government savings and the          (the numéraire), is fixed (equation INS13). 36

36The model would not be homogeneous (of degree zero) if               were fixed; hence the
need to introduce real government savings. Note that, for domestic non-government
institutions, savings is expressed as a share of income net of direct taxes. By construction,
their income is equal to the sum of their spending (consumption, savings, direct tax
payments and transfers to other institutions). For the government, income and current
spending are specified independently with savings as the difference. Other government
closures are possible; for example, fixing               and flexing             would turn
government savings into the clearing variable for the government.

System constraints and price indices
   The last equation block, presented in Table A.9, defines system constraints (the
current account of the balance of payments, commodity markets, and the savings-
investment balance) and two aggregate price indices (the          and the producer
price index for domestic sales), either of which may be the numéraire of the model.
The constraints for factor markets were defined in the first equation block.
   The rest of the world is represented by the current account of the balance of
payments, expressed in foreign currency (equation SYS1). Except for the exchange
rate,      , which is used to convert terms in domestic currency into foreign
currency, the different terms in this balance were covered in the preceding blocks.
The left-hand side shows the inflows of foreign exchange: it is the sum of exports,
current transfers, factor payments, and foreign savings; the latter is an item that
corresponds to the current-account deficit and has as its counterpart a surplus in
the capital and financial account. On the right-hand side, foreign exchange
outflows out due to imports, current transfers from the government and non-
government institutions, and factor payments. It is assumed that foreign savings
are exogenous and that external balance is achieved via adjustments in the value
of      . To illustrate, elimination of a balance of payments deficit would be
achieved via depreciation (a higher value for            ), which adjusts the real
exchange rate, raising the         ⁄        ratios for suppliers and reducing the
      ⁄      ratios for demanders, in this way bringing about higher exports and
lower imports (cf. equations TRD1, TRD2, TRD6 and TRD10); through the same
mechanisms, appreciation would eliminate a surplus. Alternatively, the exchange
rate could be fixed (implicitly indexed to the model numéraire; see discussion
below); if so, adjustment in foreign savings would clear the external balance.
   Equation SYS2 is the condition for supply-demand equilibrium in commodity
markets. The composite supply, made up of domestic and imported varieties, is
used for household consumption, intermediate use, investment, government
consumption, and changes in inventories. For the domestic component of the
commodity market (where quantities demanded for and supplied of domestic
output meet – the variable           in equations TRD6 and TRD10, respectively),
demanders respond to changes in              and suppliers to changes in      , two




                                               44
variables that are linked (equation TRD3). To illustrate, if this market has excess
demand for a commodity c, an increase in               would increase quantities supplied
(by generating incentives for higher production of c and allocation of a larger share
of this output to domestic sales as opposed to exports), while the simultaneous
increase in         would reduce quantities demanded. As stated above, the small-
country assumption applies to the imported part of the commodity market: the
quantities supplied are infinitely elastic at exogenous international prices and
could be viewed as clearing this commodity market constraint.
   The only term in equation SYS2 that had not yet been covered, investment
demand (by origin),               , is defined in equation SYS3, which computes
investment demand for c as the product of (a)                    , which is exogenous and
initially holds the base-year quantities; and (b) a scaling factor,                     . Like
          ,             is exogenous and equal to one for the base solution. In other
simulations it may take on other values and, depending on the treatment of the
savings-investment balance, the next equation, it may be endogenous.
   In  the  savings‐investment  balance,  SYS4,  the  left‐hand  side  defines  available 
savings  as  the  sum  of  savings  from  domestic  non‐government  institutions,  the 
government,  and  the  rest  of  the  world;  the  right‐hand  side  defines  the  total 
investment  value.37  The  variable                  must  be  zero  in  equilibrium  (if  not, 
savings  and  investment  are  not  equal  and  the  model  did  not  solve  correctly).  In 
our  application,  this  balance  is  cleared  by  adjustments  in  the  variable             , 
which is endogenous (see equation INS4). In order to switch from savings‐driven 
investment  to  investment‐driven  savings,  the  analyst  may  exogenize                       
and endogenize                  (in equation SYS3). Finally, equation SYS5 defines the 
    ,  which  is  exogenous  and  the  model  numéraire,  as  a  weighted  average  of 
composite commodity prices (             ); the weights are the shares of each commodity 
in private (i.e., household) consumption.38 




37 Given that the model is static, there is no need to disaggregate investment into different
types (for example government and non-government) or to address how different types of
investment are financed.
38 Under alternative closures for the balance of payments, the analyst may wish to fix the

real exchange rate, which typically is defined as the ratio between the nominal exchange
rate and an index of domestic producer prices; if so, it would be necessary to augment the
model with this variable and an equation in which it is defined.
