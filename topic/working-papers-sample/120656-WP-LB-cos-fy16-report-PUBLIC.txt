I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Lebanon perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Lebanon
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Lebanon
    Citizen Voice: Government Accountability
    Citizen Voice: Service Delivery
    Private Sector
    Refugees
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From May to July 2016, 403 stakeholders of the WBG in Lebanon were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 254 stakeholders participated in
the survey (63% response rate).
Respondents received and returned the questionnaires via courier or email. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Lebanon; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Lebanon; citizen voice: government accountability; citizen voice:
service delivery; private sector; refugees, and the WBG’s communication and information
sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

II. Methodology (continued)
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate was 34%, N=196). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’13 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (page 113).

Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and the FY’13 Country
        Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the World Bank Group in
        Lebanon (weighted mean in FY’16 = 6.3; weighted mean in FY’13 = 6.3)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Lebanon and the extent to which
        the WBG plays a relevant role in development in Lebanon, and significantly, moderately
        correlated with the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s development
        results.

country’s population. Improvement in the Shared Prosperity Indicator requires growth and well-being of the less well-off. When thinking about the idea of “shared prosperity” in your
country, which of the following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Lebanon? (Choose no more than TWO)

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 170  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 215

By weighting, the FY 2013 and FY 2016 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

 I2. Which of the following statements best represents your views of energy subsidy reform in Lebanon?
 (Choose only ONE response)
      A reduction in energy subsidies ultimately will help the poor because it will lead to fiscal savings which would
  1
      generate resources for government social spending.
      A reduction in energy subsidies will ultimately hurt the poor because it will lead to higher consumer prices of
  2   energy, resulting in a larger portion of household income spent on energy and other necessary household
      expenditures avoided.


 I3. When thinking about energy subsidy reform in Lebanon, which TWO of the following statements are
 most convincing? (Choose no more than TWO)
  1   Energy subsidy reform could lead to lower traffic congestion and urban pollution (improving health of cities).
      Energy subsidy reform could lead to smarter agriculture practices (particularly as related to irrigation, water
  2
      use, etc.)
      Energy subsidy reform could lead to smarter practices in industry and manufacturing (i.e., moving away from
  3
      capital intensive industry to light manufacturing).
      Energy subsidy reform could lead to greater efficiency, conservation and therefore have a positive impact on
  4
      climate change.
      Energy subsidy reform could lead to fiscal savings and make funds available for more important social spending
  5
      (e.g., education, health, social protection).
