1     Introduction
In low-income, capital-scarce economies that face ﬁnancial and ﬁscal constraints, managing rev-
enues from newly found natural resources such as oil can be a daunting challenge. The policy
debate is how to scale up public investment to meet huge needs in public infrastructure with-
out generating a higher public sector deﬁcit, and avoid the Dutch disease, all in an uncertain
world characterized by high occurrence of shocks and price volatility. This less documented
cutting-edge issue − viewed as the optimal scaling-up of public investment in an uncertain pro-
duction environment − remains one of the key elements to accelerate structural transformation
and achieve developmental goals while maintaining the country’s macroeconomic stability and
global competitiveness.
    There is a huge literature that looks into the impact of oil windfalls on macroeconomic ag-
gregates and conventional wisdom suggests that natural resource revenues should be either saved
externally in a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) or invested in productive public infrastructures.
However, the ﬁrst option has a weak ability to avoid poor living conditions and limits sustain-
able investment, in particular in a credit-constrained environment. The second approach which
was promoted to signiﬁcantly reduce the public infrastructure gap in resource-rich low-income
countries has also become obsolete due to lack of sustainable public policies. (Davis et al. (2001),
Barnett and Ossowski (2003), Berms and Irineu (2011)). Then, the policy trade-oﬀs emanating
from saving ﬁscal revenue from oil resources to smooth consumption versus spending it upfront
to boost growth is considered as one of the most frequently-cited challenges to resource-rich
low-income countries.
    Given this unsolved natural resources management issue, one of the major tasks faced by
economic policymakers is how to reduce the eﬀects of volatile resource prices on the domestic
economy. For instance, if all of the windfall gains are passed through into the economy, this will
generally result in a high inﬂation and an overvalued real exchange rate. In addition, exports
of other products are unable to gain a foothold in the economy, leaving the economy vulner-
able when the resource wealth runs out and causing a Dutch disease. Thus, addressing these
challenges requires state-of-art macroeconomic models and reﬁned strategies for strengthening
institutional capacities for more eﬀective governance, especially in the area of strategic planning,

                                                 2
budgeting and public ﬁnance management.
   This paper contributes to the ongoing debate by developing an open-economy dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium model with a natural resource sector to study macroeconomic
impacts and ﬁscal policy responses to natural resource inﬂows. In low-income countries, given
tremendous infrastructure needs in public infrastructures and international borrowing con-
straints, resource revenues are valuable to ﬁnance public investment and can also serve as a
collateral for accessing international ﬁnancial markets, making it possible to build up a sovereign
capital. In this spirit, the investing-saving pattern becomes not obvious and requires an assess-
ment of several scenarios based on the country’s speciﬁc macroeconomic strengths and weak-
nesses. The focus of the analysis is to explore macroeconomic dynamics under three stylized
ﬁscal policy approaches for managing a resource windfall: (i) investing all in public capital (the
All-Investing Approach); (ii) saving all in a sovereign wealth fund (the All-Saving Approach);
and (iii) using a constant share of the oil revenues to ﬁnance public investment and saving the
remaining share in a sovereign wealth fund (the Sustainable-Investing Approach). The paper
also contributes to this literature by providing the optimal share of oil revenue to use in the the
Sustainable-Investing Approach.
   In the state-of-the-art macroeconomic modelling and ﬁscal policy assessments, this paper
contributes to two strands of literature. First, we provide a contribution to the literature
that looks the pattern of natural resources and macroeconomic stability in a developing country.
Sachs and Warner (1999) is considered as a reference paper in this strand of literature by showing
that investing resource windfalls does not necessarily promote sustained economic growth in
developing countries. Second, our paper complements the existing literature that analyzes the
optimal ﬁscal policy rule in managing of natural resources income by analyzing three innovative
ﬁscal policy approaches. The model includes key features of a small open economy model with
optimizing agents and nominal rigidities and several important features that are common in New
Keynesian models and developing countries, including Dutch disease, investment ineﬃciencies
and weak tax systems. In addition, we propose and test diverse approaches to analyze ﬁscal
policy responses in low-income countries.
   However, recent theoretical and empirical studies have looked at the impact of natural re-

source revenues on ﬁscal responses and among others, Devarajan et al. (2015) sheds light on this
issue by simulating the impact of resources windfalls on long-term economic growth and welfare
                                    enor (2014) provides a characterization of the optimal ﬁscal
under resource price uncertainty. Ag´
response in the presence of oil price shocks using a small open low-income country DSGE model.
While these papers focus on oil price shocks, we analyze the optimal ﬁscal response from a dif-
ferent perspective by focusing on oil production shocks only, because our paper’s objective is to
provide policy advice to countries that, like Uganda, have not yet started producing. Tilak et al.
(2015) uses the IMF DSGE model to assess some ﬁscal policy options: i) Household transfers, ii)
Front-load public investment and iii) Gradual public investment. Their ﬁscal policies are similar
to Berg et al. (2013) as well as Giovanni et al. (2014); but slightly diﬀerent from ours, because
we do not consider the front-loading option.
   Although we focus our impulse response analysis on oil production shocks as we aim to assess
how a sudden increase in public revenues due to oil production aﬀects macroeconomic dynamics,
in our investigations regarding the optimal share of oil windfalls to use for public investment,
we reckon that most of the volatility in oil revenue for a new oil producer comes from oil price
volatility instead of production volatility. For this reason, in these investigations, we use oil
price volatilities as the main source of uncertainty.
   We calibrate this model to reproduce key features of the Uganda economy, a Sub-Saharan
Africa low-income country that recently discovered signiﬁcant oil resources, with an estimated
2.5 billion barrels of reserves. This is a signiﬁcant development milestone, as it represents
great opportunities for the ﬁnancing of Uganda’s National Development Plan. According to
the World Bank’s economic projections, oil revenues in Uganda are expected to be relatively
important at an estimate around of 3 percent of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
over the next ﬁve years. These estimates, associated with large movements in commodity prices
in the world natural resources market over the past decade, have sparked renewed interest in a
better understanding of the impact of this natural windfall on the Ugandan economy.
   Our results show that a better ﬁscal management is to save the resource income in a sovereign
wealth fund for future generation when public capital is almost unproductive. We also ﬁnd that
the gradual scaling-up of public investment (The Sustainable-Investing Approach ) yields the


                                                 4
best outcomes as it minimizes macroeconomic volatility. For example, the real exchange rate
appreciation is 30 percent lower than in the all-investing approach, which might be viewed as an
attractive ﬁscal policy to accelerate economic development in public capital-scarce economies.
The trade balance improves substantially and impulse response functions suggest that output,
non-tradable and tradable goods production, employment and wages rebound faster. We then
investigate the optimal oil share to use for public investment; our optimization criterion is based
on a loss function that accounts for households’ welfare and macroeconomic/ﬁscal stability in an
environment featuring oil price volatility. Households’ welfare is captured by the volatilities of
consumption and employment along the simulated path of the model; the ﬁscal stability measure
is captured by the volatility of the non-oil ﬁscal balance whereas the macroeconomic stability
measure is captured by an equally weighted average of the volatility of the non-oil ﬁscal balance
and that of the real exchange rate. We ﬁnd that depending on the degree of the policy maker’s
preference for stability, 55 to 85 percent of oil windfalls should be used for public investment,
suggesting that 15 to 45 percent of the resource income should be saved in a sovereign wealth
fund. Our optimal share to invest domestically mainly depends on the persistence of oil shocks
and on the interest rate paid on savings. In comparison with the recent literature, the optimal
                                                                  enor (2014), which ranges
share to invest is slightly higher than the values estimated in Ag´
from 30 percent to 60 percent. Our ﬁgures are higher because we abstract from oil production
volatility in our simulations as we are dealing with a country that newly discovered oil; this
reduces the economic volatility and therefore the need for savings in a sovereign wealth fund.
Overall, the key recommendation of this paper is that unlike the all-investing approach which
seems to exacerbate Dutch disease eﬀects, the sustainable approach appears to dominate in
terms of wealth and resources stability with the optimal oil share to be saved in a sovereign fund
varying with the persistence of oil shocks.
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model, whereas section
3 presents a parametrization to mimic the key features of a small open economy such as Uganda.
Section 4 presents our main ﬁndings and Section 5 oﬀers a conclusion.

2     Model setup
The framework is a small open New Keynesian model adapted from Obstfeld and Rogoﬀ (2000)
and Christiano et al. (2005), in which we include three production sectors: non-traded goods,
traded goods, and a natural resource. The model includes the standard friction of investment
adjustment costs, which is standard in DSGE literature. We also include the friction `
                                                                                     a la Calvo
in the prices and wages setting as in Christiano et al. (2005) and Kopoin et al. (2013). The
model is calibrated from the Uganda data and includes various exogenous shocks as well as
various ﬁscal policy regimes.


2.1       Households
The economy is composed of a continuum of inﬁnitely-lived households of mass 1. Households
obtain utility from consumption ct , which is produced by domestic ﬁrms, and receive disutility
from labor supply lt . Accordingly, the preferences of the representative household are given by
the following lifetime utility function, which is separable with respect to consumption and hours
worked.

                                ∞
                           E0         β t (log (ct − γct−1 ) + ψ log (1 − lt ))              (2.1)
                                t=0

where β denotes the household’s discount factor and ψ is the inverse of Frisch elasticity of labor
supply, whereas γ ∈ (0, 1) is the parameter that controls the extent of habit. Finally, E0 denotes
the conditional expectation operator evaluated at time 0.
    Households are assumed to be able to borrow or lend freely in national ﬁnancial markets
by buying or issuing risk-free bonds denominated in units of consumptions goods, and those
in the non-tradable goods sector set nominal wage using Calvo’s partial indexation mechanism.
Finally, the representative household maximizes the aforementioned utility function subject to
budget constraint in units of domestic composite consumption:

                                                                                t + Ωt
                                                    πt                                       (2.2)

                                                 +   rt kt−1   +   rt kt−1   + zt ,

                                                     6
where τtc and τtl denote the tax rates on consumption and income from labor supply. Total
private investment − deﬁned as the sum of private investment in the tradable sector and that
in non-tradable sector − is given by: it = iT    N
                                            t + it . bt is the domestic government debt paying
                                   b ), π is the domestic inﬂation and w is the real wage index
a gross nominal rate of Rt = (1 + rt     t                              t

expressed in units of consumptions goods. zt denotes total government transfers to households,
whereas ΩN      T                                                           N N       T T
         t and Ωt are proﬁts from the non-traded and traded goods sectors. rt kt−1 + rt kt−1

is capital income. Throughout the analysis, we assume that households do not have access to
foreign loans.1 This assumption is consistent with the fact that in a typical low-income country,
households are generally hand-to-mouth households. So, they do not have access to assets and
capital markets and consume all their disposable income from labor supply (see Jihad et al.
(2012) and Cherif and Fuad (2012)). However, domestic bonds play an important role in our
setup, allowing households to smooth idiosyncratic shocks. Since these bonds are in zero net
supply, households are subject to the following no-Ponzi game constraint:

                                                       Et [bt+j ]
                                                 lim     j
                                                                    ≤ 0.                            (2.3)
                                                 t→∞    Rt+j


Finally, the consumption basket is a composite of traded goods and non-traded goods, aggregated
using a constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) technology.

sumption bias. Thus, if φ > 1/2, the representative household has a home bias in consumption.
In this framework, we assume that the composite consumption is the numeraire of the economy
and the law of one price holds for traded goods. Accordingly, the real exchange rate st is also
the relative price of traded goods to composite consumption. As consequence, the price of one

and oil prices are assumed to follow exogenous deterministic processes. These assumptions are
consistent and match clearly low-income and small-open economy frameworks since Uganda’s
oil production, as estimated, is relatively small in comparison to world’s oil supply.2 In the
following subsections, we describe the production chain in the tradable and non-tradable goods
sectors.

with an output elasticity of αG . This production technology is well received and documented
in neoclassical literature, featuring public capital as a key input. Following this literature,
Baxter and King (1993) and Kamps (2004) have considered a constant returns to scale function
associated with private inputs (private capital and labor) and an increasing returns to scale
technology, when considering all input factors including public capital. Relative to another

[2.15]. ι captures distortions in developing countries that discourage ﬁrms from investing and
hiring further. ι may be viewed as a distorting tax on ﬁrms, but revenue collected remains in
the private sector and is distributed to households and proﬁts. Additionally, this tax helps to
match the relatively low investment to GDP ratios observed in developing countries. However,
this implicit tax is rebated back to the ﬁrms as lump-sum transfers.

assume that in each period, a fraction φp of ﬁrms cannot change their prices. When allowed to
do so, ﬁrm in the non-tradable goods sector chooses the price of its output, pN

maximize its discounted real proﬁts. All other ﬁrms can only index their prices to past inﬂation
of the composite good price. Indexation is controlled by χp ∈ (0, 1) (χp = 0 refers to a no
indexation case while χp = 1 is a perfect indexation). Intermediate good producer j chooses
the optimal price pN

nominal rigidities on households’ wage setting. Thus, in each period, a fraction 1 − φw can
change their wages, i.e., households only reset optimally the wage contract in states of nature
with a constant probability 1 − φw . All others are not able to lay out the optimal wage contract.
In that case, they can only partially index their wages to the past inﬂation of the composite
domestic goods. The level of indexation is captured by χw ∈ (0, 1). This nominal rigidity implies
that if the household cannot change its wage for h periods, then, its normalized wage is given

Output in the natural resource sector is assumed to follow an exogenous process. This assump-

of resource investments in low-income countries is ﬁnanced by foreign direct investment (FDI)
that controls the level of oil exploitation. The production function is

rate of τto . Thus, the resource revenue collected from the natural resource sector is

2.3     Public Sector
The model allows for ﬂexible public policy speciﬁcations, and we assume that the public sector
consists of a government and a central bank. In each period, government receives taxes and
                                                                                 C ), public
contracts domestic debt bt . Total expenditures include government consumption (gt
             I ) and debt services. If capital letters denote the aggregate level of a variable, then
investment (gt
government budget constraint may be written as

                                           st (1 + r∗ ) ∗             Rt−1 Bt−1

                                                πt                       πt

where Ft∗ is the asset value of resource fund, which generates a constant interest rate r∗ . In
[2.36], Gt is government purchases with a relative price to composite consumption goods of pg
                                                                                            t.

The model allows external assets accumulation, while we abstracts from external commercial
borrowing. Despite taxing revenues from the non-tradable and tradable goods sectors (ιpN
                                                                                       t Yt

and ιst YtT ), the government is unable to use this as an additional source of ﬁscal revenue.
Consequently, this tax does not appear as revenue in the government’s budget constraint (2.36).
By assuming that they are rebated to the ﬁrms, the model captures the ineﬃciencies of revenue
mobilization in Uganda. Including this feature, our speciﬁcation makes explicit the challenges
that ﬁscal authorities in developing economies face regarding tax revenue mobilization. However,
the government collects taxes on revenues from the natural resource sector and they account as
a ﬁnancing source for public infrastructures.
   We deﬁne the non-oil ﬁscal balance that will be used for the ﬁscal stability measure in the
investigations about the optimal share of oil revenue to be used for public investment as follows:


                                                                           Rt−1 Bt−1
                          NO
                       F Bt  = τtC Ct + τtl Wt Lt + Bt − pg
                                                          t Gt −                     .        (2.36)
                                                                              πt

   Finally, government purchases consist of expenditures on government consumption GC
                                                                                    t and

public investment GI . As in the private consumption, we assume that government purchases
are a CES function of traded and non-traded goods.

2.3.1     Absorptive Capacity Constraints and Ineﬃciency of Public Investment

In our framework, we introduce the concept of ineﬃciency of public investment to capture the
stylized fact of eﬀective public investment in low-income countries by allowing the model to take
into account potential investment ineﬃciencies and absorptive capacity constraints. As a result,
public investment generates capital accumulation following this law of motion

                                     G           G G         G
                                    kt+1 = (1 − δ )kt +          GI
                                                                  t,                        (2.39)


where 0 < (1 −     G)   ≤ 1 governs the ineﬃciency of public investment and δ G is the constant
depreciation rate of public capital.


2.3.2     Fiscal Policy

In this framework, we introduce three approaches to analyze ﬁscal policy in Uganda, which are
diﬀerent from the use of the fund from the natural resource sector. This involves three regimes of
management of the ﬁscal policy: the all-investing, the all-saving and the sustainable approaches.

        Policy A: The All-Investing Approach.

Under this approach, the resource fund stays at its initial level, and all additional revenues from
the natural resources sector as well as wage and consumption taxes, and revenues from bonds
issuance are invested in public infrastructures and government consumption. Thus, Ft∗ = F ∗ ,
∀t, while public investment evolves as follows:

                                                    TtO  TO
                                       GI   I
                                        t =G +        g − g ,                               (2.40)
                                                    pt    p

                                        Gt = GC    I
                                              t + Gt , and                                  (2.41)


                                                  17
                                     Ft∗ = F ∗ ,    ∀t ∈ [0, ∞),                           (2.42)

                                                                                 g
where GI , T O and pg are, respectively, the steady state values of GI    O
                                                                     t , Tt and pt .


      Policy B: The Saving in a Sovereign Wealth Fund.

Under this ﬁscal policy, all the resource revenues are saved externally in a sovereign wealth fund
for the future generation. Thus, the resource fund evolves as follows:

                                                        TtO   TO
                                    Ft∗ = Ft∗
                                            −1 +            −                              (2.43)
                                                         st    s

                                      Gt = GC    I
                                            t + Gt , and                                   (2.44)

                                             GI   I
                                              t =G ,                                       (2.45)

where s is the steady state values of the real exchange rate.

      Policy C: The Sustainable Investing Approach.

This approach, which may be viewed as a combination of the ﬁrst two ﬁscal policies, allows
a constant share of the resource revenues to ﬁnance public investment and the remaining part
is saved in a sovereign wealth fund. Under this ﬁscal policy, the country’s foreign wealth and
public investment are deﬁned as follows:


                                                        TtO  TO
                                  GI   I
                                   t =G +φ
                                           oil
                                                          g − g ,                          (2.46)
                                                        pt    p

                                      Gt = GC    I
                                            t + Gt , and                                   (2.47)

                                                           TtO   TO
                              Ft∗ = Ft∗          oil
                                      −1 + (1 − φ )            −    ,                      (2.48)
                                                            st    s

where φoil is a ﬁscal policy parameter that satisﬁes 0 ≤ φoil ≤ 1. At this point, it’s worth
mentioning that the Sustainable Investing Approach and the all-investing approach produce the
same ﬁscal responses under φoil = 1, and the all-saving approach is obtained by setting φoil = 0.




                                                   18
2.3.3     Central Bank

Monetary policy is conducted by the central bank, which manages the short-term nominal
                         b ), in response to ﬂuctuations in domestic output gap and in consumer
interest rate Rt = (1 + rt
price inﬂation gap using a Taylor-type rule. This managing rule allows the central bank to
smooth nominal interest rates through open market operations.4


        log Rt /R = λr log Rt−1 /R + (1 − λr ) λπ log (πt /π ) + λy log Yt /Y      + ϕt ,      (2.49)


where Yt denotes the country’s growth domestic product (GDP) and ϕt are i.i.d. normal inno-
vations with a standard deviation of σr .


2.4      Rest of the World
Following the 2014 World Economic Outlook (WEO) released by the IMF, Uganda is considered
as a small open economy. Consequently, a plausible assumption is to assume that domestic
developments do not aﬀect the rest of the world economy. However, the foreign economy’s
dynamics (oil prices) have an impact on the domestic economy. For simplicity, we assume that
the foreign interest rate, foreign output and the world inﬂation rate are exogenous and follow
AR(1) processes.


2.5      Market Clearing and Competitive Equilibrium
In a competitive equilibrium, the markets for goods, labor and capital all clear. The goods
markets clears when the demand from the agents can be meet by the production of the ﬁnal
good. To do this, we deﬁne real aggregate GDP as the sum of value added in the three sectors,
measured by their steady state prices.


                                     Yt = p N   N      T    O
                                            t Yt + st Y + Yt .                                 (2.50)
   4
     The use of the previous period interest rate allows us to match the smooth proﬁle of the observed
interest rate in the data.




                                                 19
Then, the general equilibrium in the goods markets involves:

                                                       ∗    ∗              ∗ ∗
           (Ct + It + pG          x Tx
                       t Gt ) + (pt Yt − pM   M
                                          t Yt ) + st Ft − Ft−1 = Yt + st r Ft−1 ,                  (2.51)


            N + I T is the private investment, and C = C N + C T is the total consumption.
where It = It    t                                  t   t     t

Recall that government purchases consist of expenditures on government consumption GC
                                                                                    t and

public investment GI , therefore Gt = GC    I
                                       t + Gt . Let denote by CAt the current account, then

the balance of payment condition is given by


                           CAt = px
                                  t Yt
                                      Tx
                                         − pM   M
                                            t Yt + s t                           Ft∗ − Ft∗
                                                                                         −1   .     (2.52)


Then, labor market clearing requires demand for labor by ﬁrms in both sectors to equal the
sector speciﬁc supply of labor. This implies that:

                                   1                         1

where Ld
       t denotes total demand for labor by ﬁrms in both sectors.

   Finally, capital market clearing conditions imply that:

2.6    Driving Forces
There are seven sources of uncertainty in our framework: One productivity shock in each of the
two sectors (tradable and non-tradable), an oil price shock that aims to capture the volatility
in the oil price markets, an oil production shock, a foreign demand shock, a foreign price shock


                                                                    20
captured by foreign inﬂation and a domestic monetary policy shock. We assume that all shocks
follow autoregressive processes of order one. This assumption gives rise to the following laws of
motion:

      ln(aN             N
          t ) = ρzN ln(at−1 ) +
                                    N

2.7       Competitive equilibrium
A competitive equilibrium is deﬁned as a set of sequences of functions for (i) households’ policies
Ct (i), Lt (i), Bt (i) and It (i) that solve the maximization problem of the household; (ii) ﬁrms’
policies Kt (j ), Ld
                   t (j ) and Wt (i) that solves ﬁrms maximization problem; (iii) aggregate prices

PtN , Ptx , St and Pt∗ ; (iv) saving and consumption decision rules for government; and (v) all
markets clear. The equilibrium system of the model consists of the private agents optimal-
ity conditions, the government budget constraint, ﬁscal policy, market clearing conditions, the
balance of payment condition, and the exogenous processes of the shocks.



3     Model Calibration
To evaluate the impact of ﬁscal responses to resource revenue on macroeconomic stability in
Uganda, we set the parameters of our model to reﬂect most of key features of a small-open
economy with abundant natural resources. The model is at the quarterly frequency, and Tables

   In the representative household’s utility function, the weight on leisure ψ is set to 3, which
leads to the steady-state value of household work eﬀort to be 40 percent of available time. The
household’s discount factor, β , is set 0.93, implying a long-run real interest rate of 9.68 percent
annually. This assumption is fairly reasonable and consistent regarding banks’ interest rates in
most of low-income countries (see African Development Indicators (ADI)). In addition, the share
of capital in the production function for intermediate goods in the non-traded goods sector, αN ,
is set to 0.45, while it is set to 0.3 in the traded goods sector. These values indicate that the
informal (non-tradable goods sector) sector is more intensive in labor than the tradable goods
sector. The depreciation rates of capital are ﬁxed to 0.1 in the informal sector and 0.075 in
the tradable goods sector. All these values are consistent with studies on Sub-Saharan African
                                                                            enor (2014).

   In our paper, we use the empirical evidence based on Mexican data from 1980 to 1994 by
Arestoﬀ and Hurlin (2006) to pin-down the parameter that governs the eﬃciency of public invest-
ment   G.   This paper shows that the coeﬃcient of regressing public capital produced (eﬀective
investment in our model) on investment expenditures falls between 0.4 and 0.65. This range of
investment eﬃciency is in line with the estimates in Pritchett (2000) for Sub-Saharan African
countries with a linear speciﬁcation between eﬀective investment and investment expenditures.
Based on these empirical papers and the macroeconomic eﬀorts undertaken by the government
to sustain public investment, we set   G   to 0.6.
   The nominal price rigidity parameter in the non-traded goods sector, as well as the nominal
wage-setting parameter are set following Calvo’s model of staggered price and wage adjustment.
As in Christiano et al. (2005), the probability of not reoptimizing for price and wage setters in
the domestic country, φp and φw , are ﬁxed to 0.75 and 0.64, respectively. The degree of home
bias in private consumption, φ, and the elasticity of substitution between domestic labor types,
ξ , are set to 0.4 and 1, respectively. These values are estimated in Christiano et al. (2010) for

tively. These values satisfy the Taylor principle and are consistent to those estimated in Ag´
(2014) and Kopoin et al. (2013). The standard deviation of both domestic and foreign mone-
tary policy shocks is ﬁxed to 0.0016, ρmp = ρRf = 0.0016, which ensures that a one-standard
deviation shock moves the interest rate by 0.6 percentage points. This value is consistent to the
empirical estimates reported in Christiano et al. (2005).
    The model is solved using a second-order perturbation method around its deterministic
steady state.




4     Findings
The patterns of investment and saving out of income from the oil windfall in managing of the
optimal ﬁscal policy remain ambiguous for policymakers. In practice, the key issue for the
spending of oil revenue by the government, viewed as a Ramsey problem, is to scale up public
investment to meet huge needs in public infrastructure without generating higher public sector
deﬁcits and a Dutch disease in an uncertain oil production world, characterized by unexpected
shocks and prices volatility. To address this issue with our baseline DSGE model, we simulate
the eﬀects of oil production shocks and interpret it as a boom in the oil sector. Using the
parameters calibrated to reﬂect the key features of a small open economy such as Uganda, we
focus on the impulse response functions of some key variables. Throughout, we simulate and
compare the impulse responses to a one standard-deviation shock to the oil production.
    Figures 1, 2 and 3 show impulse responses by illustrating macroeconomic dynamics under
three stylized ﬁscal policy approaches for managing a resource windfall: investing in public
capital, saving in a sovereign wealth and sustainable investing in public capital. In Table 1, the
solid lines present the responses under the ﬁscal policy A (investing in public capital), and the
dashed lines are under the ﬁscal policy B (saving in a sovereign wealth fund). Solid lines in
Figure 3 remain the responses under the ﬁscal policy A, while dashed lines present responses

4.1    All-investing and saving in a sovereign wealth fund
In response to an increase in the oil production, oil output and total output rise gradually,
and this drives up the oil revenue. Under the saving in a sovereign wealth fund policy, foreign
reserves increase permanently, reaching around 10 percent of GDP after 10 years (Figure 1,
panel A and C). As higher output means more income to households, under the all-investing
approach, this exogenous shock leads to an increase in the private consumption to reach about
0.25 percent after 5 years (Figure 1, panel A). On the other hand, since the government budget
constraint includes interest earnings from foreign reserves, private consumption also rises under
the saving in a sovereign wealth fund policy, reaching around 0.17 percent after 6 years. Higher
private consumption, in turn, leads households to reduce labor supply by about 0.25 percent and
lower the marginal product of private investment. Consequently, wages increase sharply in both
the tradable and the non-tradable goods sectors. Lower labor supply and private investment
lead to a decline of non-oil GDP (Figure 1, panel A and B). Public capital also rises sharply by
around 0.35 percent after 3 years and half under the all-investing approach, and remains at the
pre-windfall level under the all-saving approach because none of the resource income is allocated
for public investment (Figure 1, panel B).

   A boom in the oil sector makes the country a net exporter. Then, the wealth and income
accumulated from the resource windfall increase, generating more revenue for government. As
a result, demand in the non-tradable goods sector increases, leading to a substantial rise in
the prices of non-tradable goods. Since Uganda is considered as a small open economy and
a price taker in the international tradable goods market, the real exchange rate, deﬁned as
the relative price of non-tradable to tradable, appreciates consequently. This appreciation,
which is more pronounced under the all-investing approach, reduces the competitiveness of
the country’s exports and domestic imports-competing products. Therefore, imports become
relatively cheaper, leading to a rise in the total imports by about 1.2 percent and a fall of non-
oil exports by around 1.3 percent (Figure 1, panel C). Finally, under the all-saving approach,
the economy experiences smaller movements because resource income is directly saved into
a foreign account. In contrast, under the all-investing approach, the oil production shock is
more persistent and the return to the pre-windfall equilibrium is done more slowly. Comparing
these two stylized ﬁscal policies, simulations show that the boom in the oil production sector
generates sizeable macroeconomic activity under the all-investing approach. However, the all-
saving approach is much less susceptible to generate Dutch disease eﬀects.


4.2     The sustainable investing approach
In this subsection, we compare the ﬁrst two ﬁscal approaches to the sustainable investing ap-
proach. This latter ﬁscal policy, which may be viewed as a mixed policy, can conciliate public
investment and saving approach by proposing a new investment with external saving approach.
We allow the government to use half of the oil revenue for public investment (φoil = 0.5) and to
save the remaining half; Section 4.4 investigates the optimal value of φoil . As described in 2.48,
this new approach allows policymakers to choose an optimal scaling up magnitude given the size
of the oil production and economic characteristics. Figures 2 and 3 show impulse responses of
the main macroeconomic aggregates in comparison with the ﬁrst two ﬁscal policy approaches.
   Under the three stylized ﬁscal policies, simulations show that the boom in the oil sector leads
to deteriorate employment in both the tradable and non-tradable goods sectors. This result,
which might be surprising, is resulting from two macroeconomic eﬀects: substitution and wealth

eﬀects. Indeed, higher public capital increases the marginal product of labor in both sectors,
leading households to increase their labor supply. Then, oil revenue yields a wealth eﬀect on the
other hand. Consequently, households reduce labor supply and substitute their working hours
for leisure. As the income eﬀect outperforms that of substitution, the net eﬀect on labor supply
is negative. Nevertheless, this negative eﬀect is stronger under the all-investing approach. The
sustainable investing approach, in turn, yields a mixed result.
    Compared to the all-investing approach, the sustainable-investing approach provides a lower
and a smoother path of scaling-up by generating less volatile eﬀect. Panel C of Figure 3 shows
that the real exchange rate appreciates in both cases but the magnitude is less pronounced
under the sustainable approach. The real exchange rate appreciates by 2.2 percent under the
all-investing approach and only by 1.6 percent under the sustainable approach. However, output,
non-tradable and tradable goods production, employment and wages rebound faster under the
sustainable approach.
    Next, compared to the all-saving approach, the sustainable approach produces higher con-
sumption and public investment in the long run. Consumption increases by 0.22 percent un-
der the sustainable approach, 0.05 percentage point larger than the peak under the all-saving
approach (Figure 2, Panel A). Public capital is also 0.17 percentage point higher than the pre-
windfall level. Imports and exports display almost similar paths under these two stylized ﬁscal
policies.
    Finally, the responses of the model economy under policy C, in which a constant share of the
resource income is allocated to a sustainable public investment and the rest saved in a sovereign
wealth fund, are less volatile. When the government saves a fraction of the oil revenue in a
sovereign wealth fund and invests each period the return of the fund plus a small additional
fraction, the economy displays a much milder and more prolonged expansion. Because a sus-
tainable share of the revenue from oil exports is saved, the trade balance improves substantially,
which displays an eﬃcient oil resource management. Overall, the sustainable approach proposes
a gradual scaling-up and a smooth investment path by minimizing macroeconomic volatility.
Our results is in line with Devarajan et al. (2015), which shows that the sustainable investment
approach is the less volatile and it engenders higher welfare, in an environment with positive

4.3        Sensitivity Analysis
In this section, we consider changes in some key policy parameters to assess the robustness of the
simulated results under the sustainable investing approach − which is taken as benchmark. We
focus on the ﬁscal responses following these changes under an oil production shock. Specially,
we look at the ﬁscal responses by considering diﬀerent values of the parameter governing the
eﬃciency of public investment and diﬀerent values of the parameter capturing productivity of
public capital.


4.3.1       Absorption capacity constraints

The parameter capturing the eﬃciency of public investment is a fundamental factor in our frame-
work. In practice, this policy parameter captures all the weaknesses in public-sector management
and administration responsible for the failure to translate available resources into eﬀective public
investment. Figure 4 presents the macroeconomic responses given an oil production shock for
two values of      G   (   G   = 0.25 and   G   = 0.95) around our benchmark value set to 0.6. Figure
4 shows that with much more public investment, households enjoy more consumption under
the sustainable investing approach. An interesting result is that without absorption constraints
(   G   → 1), tradable and non-tradable sector outputs decline less under an oil production shock,
mitigating the negative impact of a potential Dutch disease eﬀect.


4.3.2       Productivity of public capital

In addition to the absorptive capacity, another important policy parameter for savings and
investment decisions is the productivity of public capital − also viewed as the return to public
capital. In this subsection, we consider the impact of a higher and a lower return to public
capital (αG = 0.05 and αG = 0.5) around the baseline value set to 0.2. The results illustrated
in Figure 5 show that the supply-side responses of capital and labor are key determinants of
the output response to public investment. Panel A of Figure 5 shows that under a higher
return to public capital, households enjoy much more consumption, public sector records higher

public investment and output in tradable and non-tradable sectors declines less compared to the
scenario where public is almost unproductive αG = 0.05. Panel B of Figure 5 shows that when
investment projects are almost unproductive (αG = 0.05), households are better oﬀ saving in a
sovereign wealth fund and consuming the interest income. Although investing natural resource
revenues in public infrastructures might be viewed as an attractive ﬁscal policy to accelerate
economic development in public capital-scarce economies, a better ﬁscal management is to save
the resource income in a sovereign fund for future generation when public capital is almost
unproductive.


4.4     Optimal allocation of natural resource revenues
The previous analysis has focused on the benchmark model in which the parameter governing
the share of resource windfalls allocated to public investment is exogenously set to 0.5. Under
this ﬁscal rule, half of the resource income is saved in a sovereign wealth fund and the remaining
half combined to the interest rate payments received are used to ﬁnance public infrastructure.
However, a key ﬁscal policy issue is the following: given the poor return to public capital and
signiﬁcant absorptive capacity constraints in the economy, what should be the optimal allocation
of resource revenues between public infrastructure ﬁnancing and saving in a sovereign wealth
fund? In other words what is the value of φoil that optimizes the objective function of the
policy maker? The answer to this question requires that the policy maker’s objective function
be deﬁned. To assess the optimal allocation of the resource income to public infrastructures
under the sustainable investing approach and come out with a well deﬁned loss function, we
focus on the volatility of four important macroeconomic variables: private consumption (σC ),
total employment (σL ), non-oil ﬁscal balance (σF B N O ) and real exchange rate (σs ).
   Conceptually, we propose a criterion consisting to determine the value of φoil that minimizes
                                                                           enor (2014); it is
a social loss function. Our loss function closely resembles that used by Ag´
indeed deﬁned as a weighted geometric average of a welfare measure and a ﬁscal/macroeconomic
stability measure. The welfare measure is either captured by the volatility of consumption or
by an equally weighted geometric average of the volatility of consumption and that of total
employment. In our model, households as risk averse agents dislike volatile private consumption


                                                41
and working hours since these adversely aﬀect their welfare. Similarly, the ﬁscal stability measure
is captured by the volatility of the non-oil ﬁscal balance whereas the macroeconomic stability
measure is captured by an equally weighted geometric average of the volatility of the non-oil
                                                                   enor (2014), movements
ﬁscal balance and that of the real exchange rate. As stressed by Ag´
in the real exchange rate capture the volatility of key relative prices which are important for
the competitiveness of the economy, and therefore for macroeconomic stability. In all cases
volatilities are computed along the simulated path of the model. We therefore consider the
following loss function:

   It is important to mention that this optimization criterion is an ad-hoc one, set by the
policy maker based on its priorities in terms of households’ welfare versus macroeconomic/ﬁscal
stability. Parameter µ controls the extent to which the policy maker cares about ﬂuctuations in

      As already mentioned above, social loss functions are computed using simulated data from
the model. In simulations, we have the choice between two diﬀerent sources of uncertainty for
oil revenues: the uncertainty stemming from the volatility of oil prices, and the one stemming
from the volatility of oil production. Note that unlike in Devarajan et al. (2015) where volatility
in the supply of resources mainly comes from oil price ﬂuctuations, our model considers that oil
production does not respond to ﬂuctuations in oil prices and sets the oil production function
exogenously. Oil production and oil price ﬂuctuations are therefore two separate and indepen-
dent sources of uncertainty in the model; This speciﬁcation allows us to put more emphasis on
oil price volatilities in our simulations as we are dealing with a developing countries who newly
discovered oil and may have a smooth production stream in the beginning of the production
process. Therefore, and for the sake of saving space, we show only the results obtained in the
case where oil price ﬂuctuations are the source of uncertainty in the model. However, we found
little diﬀerences between our baseline results and those based on simulations considering both
sources of uncertainty; these simulation results are available upon request.

weights on households’ welfare and on stability, and Figure 7 shows a 3-D plot of the social loss

their shapes for a given value of µ depend on the policymakers preference for macroeconomic

of µ higher than 0.3 − 0.39 (meaning a fair or low preference for stability), the loss functions
have convex shapes in φoil . Low values of φoil lead to high volatility in the economy due to
higher return on savings in the sovereign wealth which yield higher government consumption.
But as φoil increases, the volatility decreases gradually and eventually (for values of µ higher
that 0.3 − 0.39) reaches its minimum and starts increasing due to higher public investment that,
again, generates volatility in the economy (Figure 6).

   The shapes of the loss functions just discussed lead to the observation that when the policy
maker is too concerned about macro/ﬁscal stability and not much about households welfare, the
best option available to the policy maker is the very conservative ﬁscal strategy which consists
in saving the resource windfalls and spending only the interest income in order to prevent the
economy from the Dutch disease and from a boom-bust cycle due to ineﬃcient spending (see
Go et al. (2013) and Devarajan et al. (2015)). This clearly appears in Figures 8−11 which plot
the optimal allocation rule as functions of µ (blue solid lines); all four lost functions recommend
setting φoil = 0 for values of µ lower than 0.3 − 0.39. However, when the policy maker’s preference
for macro/ﬁscal stability is moderate or low, φoil varies between 0.55 and 0.85, meaning that 55

to 85 percent of oil windfalls should be used for public investment. This share increases with
µ and does not depend much on the loss function used. Although this range include values
that are very high compared to values generally found in the literature, we think that they are
reasonable for a country that newly discovered oil, and for which the oil production process is
not as volatile and uncertain as experienced oil producers. Being a new oil producer reduces
a the volatility stemming from oil production in the beginning of the extraction process and
therefore reduces the need for savings.
   A welfare comparison of alternative ﬁscal rules in an economy enduring volatile and uncertain
resource price leads Devarajan et al. (2015) to recommend a combination of savings and public
investment as the best way to cope with volatile oil revenues due to unpredictable shocks. Their
analysis is a special case of ours (when µ = 1) but we go beyond their recommendation by
stressing that if households’ welfare is the only concern of the policy maker, then 80 percent to
85 percent of resource windfalls should be allocated to public investment instead of assuming
50 percent for saving and 50 percent investment as a sustainable approach. Public investment
improves households’ welfare mainly through the positive eﬀect that public infrastructure has

                                                               47
on private capital and labor productivity.
    Robustness checks show that our ﬁndings do not on depend key parameters of the model
apart from those which directly aﬀect resource revenues such as the persistence of oil price
shocks (ρpo ) and the interest rate paid on sovereign funds (r∗ ). Indeed, the red dashed lines
and the green dotted lines in Figures 8−11 show the optimal allocation rule for two alternative
values of each of the parameters indicated. The middle right panels of these ﬁgures show that
the rules, under the alternative parameterizations of the persistence of the oil production shock,
are similar to the baseline as oil production is exogenously determined in our model. The top
panels and the middle left panel show that the eﬃciency of public investment,           G,   the output
elasticity of public capital, αG , as well as the depreciation rate of public capital, δ G , only play a
minor role in determining the optimal allocation of resource windfalls. However, the interest rate
paid on sovereign funds (bottom right panels) is an important driver of the resource allocation.
Our analysis suggests on the one hand that when funds saved abroad do not generate enough
income because of very low interest rates, then the policy maker should invest 20 percent of the
windfall if he is extremely worried about stability, but otherwise almost all (90 percent to 98
percent) the windfall should be used for public investment. On the other hand, if the interest
paid on sovereign funds are very high, the best strategy is to invest only if households’ welfare is
of very high concern; in this case, only up to 40 percent of the windfall should be invested, and
the remaining share saved. Additional robustness checks show that more windfalls should be
saved in the sovereign wealth fund when oil price shocks are very persistent (green dotted lines
in bottom left panels of Figures 8−11), or invested when oil price shocks are less persistent.



5     Concluding Remarks
In this paper we studied diﬀerent ﬁscal policy approaches of investing a resource windfall through
a small open economy DSGE model applied to Uganda. Speciﬁcally, we study macroeconomic
dynamics following three stylized ﬁscal policy approaches: the all-investing approach, the all-
saving approach and the sustainable-investing approach in which a constant share of the resource
income is allocated to public investment. The model accounts for several important features that


                                                  48
are common in the New Keynesian model literature applied to developing countries, including
Dutch disease eﬀects, investment ineﬃciencies and weak tax systems. The model is parameter-
ized following various empirical works and data from Uganda, and is used to simulate the eﬀects
of a one standard deviation oil production shock, interpreted as a boom in the energy sector.
   Our results show that: (i) a better ﬁscal management is to save the resource income in a
sovereign wealth fund for future generation when public capital is almost unproductive; (ii) a
gradual scaling-up of public investment (The Sustainable-Investing Approach ) yields the best
outcomes as it minimizes macroeconomic volatility; e.g. the real exchange rate appreciation is
30 percent lower than in the all-investing approach, which might be viewed as an attractive ﬁscal
policy to accelerate economic development in public capital-scarce economies; the trade balance
improves substantially and impulse response functions suggest that output, non-tradable and
tradable goods production, employment and wages rebound faster.
   We also deﬁne criteria to determine the optimal value of the oil share to invest in public
infrastructures by minimizing a social loss function; we use four loss functions that include a
households’ welfare indicator and a macroeconomic/ﬁscal stabilization indicator. We ﬁnd that
the loss functions have convex shapes with optimal values of φoil varying between 0.55 and
0.85, depending on the policy maker’s preference for macroeconomic stability. Furthermore,
our results show that the optimal share of oil revenues to be used for public investment is very
robust to the various parameter calibrations; only parameters that directly aﬀect these revenues
(such as interest rates on savings and the persistence of oil price shocks) play an important
role. In comparison with the recent literature, our optimal share to invest domestically in public
                                                             enor (2014), which ranges from 30
infrastructures is slightly higher than those estimated in Ag´
percent to 60 percent using oil price shocks.
   A number of extensions could usefully be considered. First, the paper assumes an exogenous
oil sector, and the analysis can be extended to explore labor movements between non-oil and
oil sectors. In practice, oil sectors in developing countries use domestic labor and Dutch disease
eﬀects can be optimally analyzed using an endogenous oil production sector. Second, the paper
does not consider the eﬀect of foreign direct investments (FDI). Indeed, it’s well-known that
in low-income countries, FDI account substantially and may aﬀect macroeconomic dynamics.


                                                49
Third, the model focuses on some standard government rules and our sustainable approach can
be improved to take into account a sovereign wealth fund that can serve as a stabilization buﬀer,
enabling households and government to smooth consumption and public investment paths over
negative economic shocks. Finally, our analysis suggests that a high proportion of oil revenues
should be invested, but does not specify which type of investment should be prioritized. The
analysis could be deepened so as to determine how much of the resources should be used to
increase soft/hard infrastructure.

                                             C T = (1 − φ)C                                (6.42)
   The steady state value of government spending is given by

                                      G = (1/η )(Y N − φ(C + I ))                          (6.43)
   By setting Y O = θo Y , the equilibrium value of the sovereign wealth fund is

                                  F ∗ = (1/r∗ )(−Y + C + I + G).                           (6.44)
Now, using (6.20), the steady state value of government debt is given by:

                           T O + τ C C + τ l W L − G + ((1 + r∗ )/π ∗ − 1) F ∗
                     B=                                                                    (6.45)
                                                (1/β − 1)
