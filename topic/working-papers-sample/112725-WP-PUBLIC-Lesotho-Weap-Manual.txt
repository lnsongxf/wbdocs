The Water Evaluation and Planning
(WEAP) System Basics
WEAP System Capabilities
Water management and allocation models are often used to help water managers make
informed decisions. To support the robust decision making (RDM) process in Lesotho, this
project used the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model to examine hydrologic
dynamics in the Orange-Senqu river basin. This section describes the WEAP model’s broad
capabilities and the process for implementing the model in Lesotho.

The WEAP system provides an integrated approach to water resources planning by linking
hydrologic processes, system operations and end-use within a single analytical platform
(Huber-Lee et al. 2003).1

The RDM process depends upon stakeholders engaging with the development and analysis of
results. In additional to its complex operation capabilities, WEAP provides a comprehensive,
flexible and user-friendly tool for water resources planning and policy analysis. As part of the
Lesotho Project, team members lead capacity building trainings in WEAP both to provide
Lesotho planners with the tool and to include them in the project’s processes and results inter-
pretations. WEAP’s transparent structure facilitates the engagement of stakeholders in an
open process to evaluate water development and management options, and consider the mul-
tiple and competing uses of water systems.

To model a water system’s operation, WEAP integrates both water demand and supply by
placing demand-side issues on an equal footing with supply-side dynamics. Demand esti-
mates emerge from data regarding water use patterns, equipment efficiencies, re-use strategies,
costs, and water allocation schemes, among others. WEAP models supply by reproducing
both its managed components (streamflow diversions, groundwater pumping, reservoirs, and
water transfers) and its natural components (e.g., evapotranspiration demands, runoff, base-
flow) and its managed components. WEAP operates on the basic principle of a water balance
and can be applied to a single watershed or complex trans-boundary river basin systems.

At the most basic level, WEAP’s integrated hydrology/water allocation framework (Yates et al.
2005a, 2005b), recognizes that water supply is defined by the amount of precipitation that falls
on a watershed (see figure 1.1). Further, this basic supply is depleted through natural water-
shed processes, where the watershed itself is the first significant point of depletion through
evapotranspiration (Mahmood and Hubbard 2002). The water remaining in excess of evapo-
rative demands throughout the watershed is the supply available to the water management
system. Thus, as in the physical realm, there is a seamless link in the WEAP framework
between climate, land use/land cover conditions, and the management of the water system
(Purkey et al. 2007).

General Modeling Approach
WEAP is an integrated water resources planning tool that is used to represent current
water conditions in a given area and to explore a wide range of demand and supply options
for balancing environment and development objectives. WEAP is widely used to support
collaborative water resources planning by providing a common analytical and data man-
agement framework to engage stakeholders and decision-makers in an open planning pro-
cess. Within this setting, WEAP is used to develop and assess a variety of scenarios that
explore physical changes to the system, such as new reservoirs or pipelines, as well as social
changes, such as policies affecting population growth or the patterns of water use. Finally
the implications of these various policies can be evaluated with WEAP’s graphical display
of results.

Steps in Developing a WEAP Model
The development of the WEAP application in this study followed a standard modeling
approach (see figure 1.2). The first step in this approach is the study definition, wherein the
spatial extent and system components of the area of interest are defined and the time horizon
of the analysis is set. Following this initial assessment, the “current accounts” is defined, which
is a baseline representation of the system—including the existing operating rules for both sup-
plies and demands. The current accounts serves as the point of departure for scenarios that
characterize alternative sets of future assumptions pertaining to policies, costs, and factors
that affect demands, pollution loads, and supplies. Finally, the scenarios are evaluated with
regard to water sufficiency, costs and benefits, compatibility with environmental targets and
sensitivity to uncertainty in key variables. The steps in the analytical sequence are described in
greater detail in the following sections.

Study Definition
Evaluating the implications of managing diversions and impoundments along a river
requires the consideration of the entire land area that contributes to the flow within the
river—the river basin. Within WEAP, it is necessary to set the spatial scope of the analysis
by defining the boundaries of the river basin. Within these boundaries there are smaller
rivers and streams (or tributaries) that flow into the main river of interest. Because these
tributaries determine the distribution of water throughout the whole basin, it is also neces-
sary to divide the study area into sub-basins such that we can characterize this spatial vari-
ability of river flows.

Current Accounts
The current accounts represent the basic definition of the water system as it currently
exists. Establishing current accounts requires the user to “calibrate” the system data and
assumptions to a point that accurately reflects the observed operation of the system. The
current accounts include the specification of supply and demand data (including defini-
tions of reservoirs, pipelines, treatment plants, pollution generation, etc.). This calibra-
tion process also includes setting the parameters for WEAP’s rainfall-runoff module such
that WEAP can use climatic data (i.e., temperature and precipitation) to estimate water
supply (i.e., river flows, aquifer recharge) and demand (evaporative water demand) in the
delineated basins.

Scenarios
At the heart of WEAP is the concept of scenario analysis. Scenarios are self-consistent
story-lines of how a future system might evolve over time. The scenarios can address a broad
­
range of “what if ” questions. This allows users to identify unintended changes in the system
and evaluate how these changes may be mitigated by policy and/or technical interventions.
The result of these analyses guide the development of response packages, which are combina-
tions of management and/or infrastructural changes that enhance the productivity of the
system.

Evaluation
Once the performance of a set of response packages has been simulated within the context of
future scenarios, the packages can be compared relative to key metrics identified by stakehold-
ers in the XLRM activity of the RDM process. Often these relate to water supply reliability,
water allocation equity, ecosystem sustainability, and cost, but any number of performance
metrics and be defined and quantified within WEAP.



WEAP Calculations
At each time step, WEAP first computes the hydrologic flux, which it passes to each river. The
water allocation is then made for the given time step, where constraints related to the charac-
teristics of reservoirs and the distribution network, environmental regulations, and the prior-
ities and preferences assigned to points of demands are used to condition a linear programming
optimization routine that maximizes the demand “satisfaction” to the greatest extent possible
(see Yates et al. 2005a for details). All flows are assumed to occur instantaneously; thus a
demand site can withdraw water from the river, consume some, and optionally return the
remainder to a receiving water body in the same time step. As constrained by the network
topology, the model can also allocate water to meet any specific demand in the system, without
regard to travel time. Thus, the model time step should be at least as long as the residence time
of the study area. For this reason, the Lesotho project adopted a monthly time step for our
study.

Rainfall-Runoff (aka Streamflow Generation)
WEAP offers three methods to simulate watershed hydrological processes such as evapotran-
spiration, runoff, and infiltration. These methods are (1) the Rainfall Runoff and (2) the
Simplified Coefficient Approach, and (3) the Soil Moisture Method. This study used WEAP’s
Soil Moisture Method to estimate the rainfall-runoff processes at the sub-basin level through-
out Lesotho.

The Soil Moisture module in WEAP is spatially continuous, with a study area configured as a
contiguous set of sub-catchments that cover the entire extent of the river basin under exami-
nation. This continuous representation of the river basin is overlaid with a water management
network topology of rivers, canals, reservoirs, demand centers, aquifers and other features (see
Yates et al. 2005a, 2005b for details). Each sub-catchment (SC) is fractionally subdivided into
a unique set of independent land use/land cover classes that lack detail regarding their exact

location within the SC, but which sum to 100% of the SC’s area. A unique climate-forcing data
set of precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed is uniformly prescribed
across each SC.

A one-dimensional, quasi-physical water balance model depicts the hydrologic response
of  each fractional area within a SC and partitions water into surface runoff, infiltration,
evapotranspiration, interflow, percolation, and baseflow components (see equation 1.1 and
­
figure 1.3). Values from each fractional area within the SC are then summed to represent the
­
lumped hydrologic response, with the surface runoff, interflow and baseflow being linked to a
river element and evapotranspiration being lost from the system.

WEAP offers a default method for calculating the potential evapotranspiration that uses a
modified Penman-Montieth equation or an alternate method that allows the user to define
his/her own equation(s). Because the Penman-Montieth relies on variables that were not easily
obtained for the suite of climate futures used in our analysis (i.e., wind speed and relative
humidity), we chose to use a modified Hargreaves equation developed by Droogers and Allen
(2002) that required only estimates of temperature and precipitation.

Water Allocation
Two user-defined priority systems are implemented to determine allocations of water
supplies  to demands (i.e., urban and agricultural), for instream flow requirements, and for
­
        reservoirs—demand priorities and supply preferences.
filling ­

Demand priorities allocate water among competing demand sites and catchments, flow
requirements, and reservoir storages. The demand priority is specified for every demand site,
catchment, reservoir, or flow requirement. Priority numbers in WEAP range from 1 to 99,
with 1 being the highest priority and 99 the lowest. Many demand sites can share the same
priority, which is useful in representing a system of water rights, where water users are defined
by their water usage and/or seniority. In cases of water shortage, higher priority users are sat-
isfied as fully as possible before lower priority users are considered. If priorities are the same,
shortage will be shared equally (as a percentage of their demands).

When demands sites or catchments are connected to more than one supply source, the order
of withdrawal is determined by supply preferences. Similar to demand priorities, supply pref-
erences are assigned a value between 1 and 99, with lower numbers indicating preferred water
sources. The assignment of these preferences usually reflects some economic, environmental,
historic, legal and/or political realities. In general, multiple water sources are present when the
preferred water source is insufficient to satisfy all of an area’s water demands. WEAP treats the
additional sources as supplemental supplies and will draw from these sources only after it
encounters a capacity constraint (expressed as either a maximum flow volume or a maximum
percent of the demand) associated with the preferred water source.

WEAP’s allocation routine uses demand priorities and supply preferences to balance water
supplies and demands. To do this, WEAP must assess the available water supplies at any given
time step. While total supplies may be sufficient to meet all of the demands within the system,
it is often the case that operational considerations prevent the release of water to do so. These
regulations are usually intended to hold water back in times of shortage so that delivery reli-
ability is maximized for the highest priority water users (often urban indoor demands). WEAP
can represent this controlled release of stored water using its built-in reservoir object.

WEAP uses generic reservoir objects that divide storage into four zones, or pools (figure 1.4).
These include, from top to bottom, the flood-control zone, conservation zone, buffer zone and
inactive zone. The conservation and buffer pools together constitute the reservoir’s active stor-
age. WEAP will ensure that the flood-control zone is always vacant—i.e., the volume of water
in the reservoir cannot exceed the top of the conservation pool. The size of each of these pools
can change throughout the year according to regulatory guidelines, such as flood control rule
curves.

WEAP allows the reservoir to freely release water from the conservation pool to fully meet
withdrawal and other downstream requirements. Once the storage level drops into the buffer
pool, the release will be restricted according to the buffer coefficient, to conserve the reser-
voir’s dwindling supplies. The buffer coefficient is the fraction of the water in the buffer zone
available each month for release. Thus, a coefficient close to 1.0 will cause demands to be met
more fully while rapidly emptying the buffer zone, while a coefficient close to 0 will leave

Lesotho Application of WEAP
This project developed a WEAP model to represent the main water supply and demand fea-
tures for the Kingdom of Lesotho. The model was developed at a spatial scale appropriate to
simulate major hydrologic flows; to represent major demographic trends; and to evaluate the
effects of water management responses. Monthly observations between 1950 and 2005 were
used to calibrate WEAP (See Annex A) to enable it to consider future climate and water man-
agement scenarios from 2010 to 2050.

The model is designed to evaluate the performance of water supply reliability for different
water use sectors across a range of future climate conditions. These water use sectors
include domestic and industrial water users, rainfed and irrigated agriculture, hydro-
power, instream flow requirements and water transfers to South Africa. For purposes of
water allocation, the model assigns transfers to South Africa the highest priority. After
that, the domestic water users have the highest priority for water deliveries; industrial
water users the second highest priority; irrigation the third highest priority; instream flow
requirements the fourth highest priority; and surface water storage behind dams holds the
lowest priority for water. In the model, the current water supply system disconnects the
demands in the Lesotho lowlands from the water supply system of the Lesotho Highlands
Water Project (LHWP). Thus, under current operations, the deliveries to South Africa
from the LHWP and the associated hydropower production are independent of water allo-
cation in the lowlands.

The Lesotho WEAP model was developed using a two-step process (outlined in figure 2.1).
The first step of this process focused on developing the rainfall/runoff routines and calibrating

these to observed historical streamflow timeseries. The second step focused on adding repre-
sentations of the existing and planned water management infrastructure to the model. These
steps are explained further in the following two sub-sections.



Hydrology of Lesotho
In general, we used quaternary catchments from the South African Department of Water and
Sanitation1 as the basic unit used to define the spatial resolution of the hydrologic simulation.
These catchments were often combined to form larger areas in cases where multiple catch-
ments lay upstream of control points. For example, we combined quaternary catchments
D11A through D11F, because they all lie upstream of Katse dam, which is the first control
point that this study considered on the Malibamatso River (figure 2.2). This approach resulted
in 34 catchments used in the WEAP model to represent hydrological processes within Lesotho.
An additional 12 catchments were used to represent the hydrology of areas within South
Africa that discharge into the Caledon River.

Each of the catchments shown in figure 2.2 contain climate data that are used as drivers
for the routines that estimate the hydrological response (i.e., rainfall-runoff and baseflow)
and the potential evapotranspiration for rainfed and irrigated agriculture. These data

include time series of historical and projected monthly precipitation (mm), average
­temperature (deg C), minimum temperature (deg C), and maximum temperature (deg C).
 To construct these timeseries, we used historical climate data from 1948 to 2008, devel-
 oped by the Terrestrial Hydrology Research Group at Princeton University (Sheffield
 et al. 2006). These data include climate sequences of monthly temperature and precipita-
 tion, spatially averaged for each hydrologically connected catchment. This dataset was
 developed at the 0.5 degree scale, resulting in 20 grid cells that overlay the Kingdom of
 Lesotho (figure 2.3). To calculate climate inputs for each catchment, we used weighted
 averages based on percentage of catchment polygons within each climate grid cells. This
 involved using GIS to intersect the grid cells with the catchment polygons.



Key Water Management Features of Lesotho
The model includes representations of the major water use sectors within Lesotho and the
existing and planned infrastructure that serves them. The linkage of these supplies and
demands is show in figure 2.4.

hydropower for Lesotho. According to the treaty between Lesotho and South Africa, water
transfers to South Africa from the LHWP increase with subsequent phases of the project.
Currently, the project supplies 27.5 m3s−1 (867 MCM/year) to South Africa and is expected to
supply 40 m3s−1 (1,261 MCM/year) once Phase 2 is fully operational. Transfers are expected to
be capped at 70 m3s−1 (2,207 MCM/year) once the project is fully developed. The project was
originally envisioned in four phases that are described in the left of map 2.1 and shown in red

The first phase of the project (including Phase Ia and Ib) has been completed and includes
Katse and Mohale dams as well as diversion structures to divert water into Katse from the
Matsoku River and Mohale dam and a transfer tunnel to send water from Katse dam to
Muela dam and subsequently South Africa. Phase II of the project, which is now under
implementation, has been reconfigured to include a dam, Polihali, which was not part of
the original design. It is expected to be complete by 2020. Further phases of the project face
greater uncertainty and presently there are no reliable estimates for completion dates. For
the purposes of the current study, we consider that the next phases will include the three
dams planned for the main stem of the Senqu River downstream of the current facilities
and they will be commissioned at regular intervals after the completion of Phase II. These
are summarized in table 2.1.

For the purposes of this project, we assumed that these “transfer targets” to South Africa would
be adjusted following the construction of each new facility and that they would increase over
a five year period during the filling period of the new facility. Figure 2.5 shows the demand
curve for South Africa water transfer targets.

  Largely disconnected from the LHWP, most of the water usage within Lesotho is in the low-
  lands and is served by local surface water supply sources. Currently, there is another large
  water project in Lesotho—the Lesotho Lowlands Water Supply Scheme—that aims to enhance
  water supply reliability for the domestic, industrial, and agricultural water needs of the low-
  land districts. To define the location and pattern of water demands in the lowlands, we used
  data from the feasibility report for this project (2004), which organized demands in the low-
  lands into eight zones.

  Figure 2.6 shows the configuration of the lowlands water demands within the WEAP
  schematic. Essentially, each zone consists of a pair of demand nodes (red circles)—domestic
  ­
  and ­industrial, which allows for WEAP to assign a higher priority to domestic users than to
  industrial/institutional users in each zone. Transmission links (green lines) connect demands
  to various water sources.

  The Lowlands Water Supply Scheme feasibility study identified eight zones and five intakes
  from which water will be abstracted. These are summarized in table 2.2 and shown graphi-
  cally  in map 2.2. These abstraction points correspond to the diversion locations shown
  in figure 2.6.

Building the Model for the Orange-Senqu River
The WEAP model used in this study is a modified version of a tool developed for a p   ­ revious
World Bank project that examined the resilience of infrastructure throughout Africa in the face
of climate change (Cervigni et al. 2015). A complete description of the development of this
model, including descriptions of the spatial disaggregation of the basin and the main water
management features, can be found in a forthcoming World Bank Report: Enhancing the
Climate Resilience of Africa’s Infrastructure: The Power and Water Sectors. This Annex pro-
vides a description of the enhancements made to the WEAP model under the current project
to better represent water management in the Kingdom of Lesotho.

Lowland Demands
As part of the feasibility study of the Lesotho lowlands water supply scheme (2004), water
demands were estimated for eight demand zones out to the year 2035. The location of these
zones is shown in figure 2.7. The data are summarized in tables 2.3 and 2.4.

These data were reformatted to provide input to the WEAP model for Lesotho. Specifically, we
calculated per capita water use by dividing the total domestic water demand by the popula-
tion.  Per capita waster use is then combined with population in WEAP to estimate total

domestic demands. This formulation was used so that we can explore different scenarios that
adjust population and per capita water usage independently. Additionally, we applied a popu-
lation growth rate of 1.5 percent after the year 2035, which generally continues the trend in the
data between 2005 and 2035.

Industrial demands were estimated by taking the sum of industrial and institutional
demands from table 2.3. Percent losses were estimated by dividing the total losses by the
sum of domestic, industrial, and institutional demand. This resulted in a consistent estimate
of 25 percent loss.

Metolong Dam Project
Metolong dam is represented in the WEAP model as a reservoir on the Phuthiatsana South
River. It receives inflow from a catchment that is 348 km2 large. The dam was commissioned
in 2015 and came online in 2016. It has a storage capacity of 36.5 MCM (i.e., storage at 1,671 m
elevation) and a dead (or inactive) storage level of 7.275 MC (i.e., storage at 1,635 m eleva-
tion). Its volume-to-elevation relationship is presented  in ­ figure  2.9. It is configured in the
WEAP model to supply water to zones 4 and 5 (see figure 2.8). It is configured in the WEAP
model to supply water to zones 4 and 5. In WEAP, the priority to store water in Metolong dam
(priority 13) is set up such that it releases water only to meet domestic (priority 3) and indus-
trial (priority 4) demands in zones 3, 4, and 5 and instream flow requirements (priority 5) on
the Phuthitsana South river below the reservoir.

Metolong Instream Flow Requirement
An instream flow requirement exists below Metolong dam that is designed to provide low-
flows and floods as specified in tables 2.5 and 2.6.

Irrigated Agriculture
Unfortunately, little data exist to describe the farming practices within existing irrigation
schemes. It is known that farmers generally use sprinklers as a means of irrigation. However,
no data were available to identify what crops are grown. Fortunately, ORASECOM maintains
a water information system for the Orange-Senqu basin2 that contains some general infor-
mation on irrigated crops within twelve agro-economic regions throughout the basin
(ORASECOM 2013). A screen capture of the tool is shown in figure 2.10.

The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) publishes information
on many crop types that describe their crop water requirements, yield response to water,
and crop water productivity information.3 We used these data to describe the maximum
potential yield and yield factors for each irrigated crop type. These are summarized
in table 2.7.

Rainfed Agriculture
The African Development Bank publishes data on crop production in Lesotho.4 These data
were obtained for five primary crop types (maize, sorghum, wheat, beans, and peas) and are
summarized in the table 2.8.

These data are generally consistent with FAO estimates of cultivated land,5 which was
209,000 ha in 1994. FAO data also suggest that the vast majority of these lands are rainfed.
For this reason, we used the data in table 2.9 to estimate areas for rainfed agriculture
throughout Lesotho.

However, the data in tables 2.8 and 2.9 are reported for the ten districts within Lesotho,
whereas WEAP ­ represents rainfed agriculture at the scale of quaternary hydrologic catch-
                map 2.3.
ments, shown in ­

The simplest approach to allocating the areas from map 2.3 would be to assume that the
crops are uniformly distributed within each district. However, given the topography of
the  country and the concentration of people within the lowlands, it is more likely that
cropped areas are positively correlated to population density. For this reason, we used

2010  population density maps from Columbia University (CIESIN 2011) to estimate the
distribution of crops within each district (map 2.4). We then intersected these estimates
with quaternary catchments to estimate the total cropped area for each crop within each
catchment.

The African Development Bank also provides data on total crop production for a few recent
years (table 2.10). These data were used to calibrate the agricultural yield routine within
WEAP (figure 2.10).



Re-Calibration of Hydrology
The WEAP models are often calibrated to historical streamflows using a combination of manual
methods and computer algorithms, such as the PEST software (Doherty 2002). In general, eight
land use parameters are adjusted to achieve calibration to streamflow. These parameters are the
evapotranspiration coefficient (Kc), soil water capacity (SWC), deep water capacity (DWC), runoff
resistance factor (RRF), root zone conductivity (RZC), deep conductivity (DC), and preferred flow
direction (PFD). Model simulations are most sensitive to SWC, RZC, RRF, and PFD. Thus, initial

calibrations should focus on these four parameters. Further refinements to the shape and timing
of the resulting hydrographs may be accomplished by adjusting the remaining parameters.

The Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient is commonly used in hydrologic modeling to
evaluate how well modeled stream flow matches observed data. The NSE indicates how well
a plot of observed versus simulated data fits to a 1:1 line. NSE ranges from −∞ to 1.0. If NSE = 1,

there is a perfect match between the observed and modeled, if NSE = 0, the modeled is only as
good as the observed mean of the data, and NSE <0 indicates the model performs worse than
the mean. Generally in hydrologic modeling, NSE > 0.6 is desired, while NSE > 0.8 is good.
The mathematical form of NSE is:

Where Yiobs is the ith observation, Yi sim is the ith simulated value, Y obs is the mean of the
observed data, and n is the total number of observations.

While NSE is a useful one-value indicator of model performance, it is biased by high flows.
Additionally, it only captures certain aspects of the model flow deviations from observed.
To fully understand and evaluate model performance, NSE must be used in conjunction
with other metrics that consider seasonal variation, flow duration curves, and annual totals
of the modeled and observed flows. To this end, we often consider the ratio of the root
mean squared error to the standard deviation (RSR) as a measure of how much the
simulated flows deviated from the observed hydrographs. We consider the ratio of simu-
­
lated versus observed flow standard deviation (SDR) as a measure of how well the simu-
lated flows match the flow variability within the historical record. Lastly, we consider
the  percent bias (PBIAS) as a measure of the model’s ability to match the total volume
of flow. In general, the model can be judged as satisfactory if the NSE ≥ 0.5, PBIAS ±25%,
RSR ≤ 0.7, and 0.9 ≤ SDR ≤ 1.1 (Moriasi et al. 2007). The equations for PBIAS, RSR, and
SDR are as follows:

There are a number of stream flow-gauging stations within the basin that are operated by
either DWA or the Lesotho Ministry of Water (see figure 2.11). The data from these stations
