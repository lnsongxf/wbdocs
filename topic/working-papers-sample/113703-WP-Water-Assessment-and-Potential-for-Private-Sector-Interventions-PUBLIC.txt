                            Water is an essential natural resource; a key building block of life. However, water
                            use has grown at over twice the population growth rate in the last century. As a
result, an increasing number of regions are now chronically short of water. Over 1.4 billion people currently
live in river basins where use of water exceeds minimum recharge levels.

If current water practices continue unchecked, future projections indicate that, by 2025, two-thirds of the
world population could be living under severe water stress conditions. Managing and ensuring sustainable
use of scarce water resources is one of the main development challenges facing countries, states, and
corporations around the world. IFC is committed to working in the water sector, as water has become an
increasing business risk for our clients.

In India, Rajasthan is one of the most water deprived states with respect to rainfall and per capita water
availability. The state faces acute water scarcity challenges as rainfall patterns are impacted by climate
change. Increasing agricultural and industrial demand is placing additional pressure on the state’s dwindling
water resources. Rajasthan has some of the lowest supplies of drinking water in India with only 162 of
222 towns in the state receiving regular supply of drinking water with the poor being the most affected.

Rajasthan needs more holistic and integrated management of its water resources. Collective action is
necessary to bring together the public sector, the private sector, civil society, and other stakeholders to work
together towards integrated and participatory solutions for water resources planning and management.

This report provides an in-depth and comprehensive overview of the challenges of drinking water supply,
water quality, and agriculture-water in Rajasthan with a focus on potential private sector engagements. The
report offers solutions such as improved technologies and practices for optimal farm productivity, awareness
building and infrastructure development through community engagement.

IFC is committed to assisting the government of Rajasthan in developing a multi-stakeholder, integrated
approach to address the state’s water challenges. As a knowledge partner to the government of Rajasthan,
IFC is already working with the state to promote the state as a preferred investment destination for sustainable
private sector led growth. Leveraging upon this, IFC seeks to utilize its convening ability to mobilize key
stakeholders among private sector, government, civil society, and academia through collective action to
design and implement a Rajasthan Water Initiative.

The water initiative aims to make a profound difference to farmers’ lives by improving water and agriculture
management practices, thereby providing extra income and sustaining rural livelihoods. This report
provides a sound base for developing a framework for effective public-private partnership that is necessary
to transform Rajasthan into a water secure state.

Author's note
Water is essential to life. Access to clean water is considered to be part of the Right to Life under Article 21 of the Indian
Constitution.[1] Ultimately, the water we consume comes from rainfall, which is vulnerable to climate change. Rajasthan,
with its semi-arid and arid conditions, is particularly at risk from decreasing water resources.[2] Studies have shown
that Rajasthan is among regions with greatest sensitivity to climate and lowest capability to adapt to its vagaries.[3] The
mindless overexploitation of groundwater[4] in the state has led to aquifers no longer being able to naturally replenish
themselves. This has led to serious consequences that already threaten the dignity of life.[5]

In the absence of surface water resources in some areas of the state, drinking water is often physically transported
over long distances, an unsustainable practice even in the short term. Ironically, while this practice establishes that
water is not free, and may be even more precious than fuel, it is still a challenge to communicate to citizens the
precious nature of this limited resource, and the associated costs of developing and supplying water for public use.
The ‘water is free’ mindset poses a serious bottleneck to reform in the sector.

Rajasthan is in the grip of severe food insecurity with 22 of its districts labeled as most food insecure.[6] Its population
growth is among the highest in the country.[7] At the same time, it is at highest risk from drought and famine in India.[8]
The state’s water landscape has myriad challenges, and time is running out. Success will depend on setting priorities
to achieve highest positive impact.

This report analyzes the water crisis in Rajasthan and suggests how the private sector can participate by offering
sustainable and scalable solutions. Hopefully, it will provide momentum to address this critical issue.

    Executive Summary
    1	       Introduction to the State
    The northwestern state of Rajasthan, with a land area of 34.3 million hectares or 10.4 percent of India’s total area,
    is the largest Indian state. 5.6 percent of the country’s total population or 68.6 million live in the state, of which over
    75 percent live in rural areas. The state has experienced a decadal population growth rate of 21.44 percent, which
    is among the highest in the country. An estimated 24.8 percent of the population lives below poverty line (BPL).
    The gross state domestic product (GSDP) in 2011-12 was $76.8 billion. Current per capita income is $1,122. Tertiary
    sector contributes 44.6 percent to GSDP, followed by primary sector at 29.2 and secondary sector at 26.2 percent.
    Agriculture/allied employ two-thirds of the state labor force and contribute roughly 26 percent of the GSDP.


    2	       Water Resource Scenario
    Studies have shown Rajasthan is among regions with greatest climate sensitivity and lowest adaptive capability.
    Rajasthan has only 1.16 percent of the country’s total surface water resources or 21.71 billion cubic meters (BCM),
    however 16.05 BCM of this is economically usable. The state has created capacity to harness and store 11.29 BCM,
    or around 70 percent of available water. The state has 1.72 percent of the country’s groundwater, translating into
    11.36 BCM. Dependent on inflows into the rivers, 17.88 BCM is allocated through inter-state agreements, although
    not dependable due to political compulsions of the upper riparian states. On paper, water use can be expanded
    by a further 30 percent. However more realistic assessment of additional availability is economically usable water
    or 21 percent. This is broken down in figure below, which accounts for the use of 79 percent of the 45.09 BCM of
    economically available water.

          2.1 	     Rainfall
          The state has the highest incidence of drought in the country. Between 1901 and 2002 there have been
          48 drought years of varied intensity, which means that the chance of occurrence of a meteorological
          drought in the state is 47 percent.


          2.2 	 Groundwater
          In Rajasthan, the annual water table loss is 1 to 3 meters. The gross annual draft of groundwater in
          the state is 13 BCM against a recharge of only 10.4 BCM. Around 90 percent of drinking water and
          73 percent of water for irrigation is met by groundwater. Underground exploitation of water has shot up
          from 35 percent in 1984 to 138 percent in 2008, and is likely to reach 189.1, 221.4 and 259.1 percent in
          2015, 2020 and 2025 respectively. To quantify the dismal situation, of the 249 blocks in the state about
          80 percent are either over-exploited or critical.

             2.3 	 Surface Water Resources and River Basins
             Rajasthan is divided into fourteen river basins and an outside basin. The surface water available
             in all basins is 25,931 million cubic meters (MCM), of this only 60 percent or 16,054 MCM is
             considered economically usable. Surface water resources are scarce and confined to the south and
             southeast of the state. Almost all river basins are over exploited, with no groundwater available for
             further irrigation projects.


    3	       Water Demand-Supply Gap
    Agricultural use of water accounts for the consumption of 83 percent of available water resources in the state,
    drinking water for 11 percent, and industry/other uses for 6 percent. The current demand-supply deficit is 8 BCM,
    and is expected to go up to 9 BCM by 2015. The average per capita water availability is expected to drop below
    450 cubic meters by 2050, which is below the international minimum of 500 cubic meters or absolute water
    scarcity. 88.5 percent of villages/habitations in the state receive less than 40 liters per capita per day (lpcd) of
    water. Rajasthan has the highest proportion of households reporting purchase of water. In the urban context, the
    demand for water (1,803.84 million liters per day or MLD) outstrips installed capacity (1,798.91 MLD) and supply of
    water (1,475.71 MLD).


             3.1 	    Industrial Water Demand
             Rajasthan is undergoing an industrial transformation. Industrial water demand in Rajasthan was around
             45.5 million cubic meters (MCM) per year in 1995, projected to grow to 138.44 MCM/year in 2045.


    4	       Drinking Water Supply
    70 percent of habitations in the state face problems getting potable drinking water. The available water has high
    total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity, fluoride, and nitrates. The canal systems are the only reliable drinking water
    sources in the region.


             4.1	     Rural Drinking Water Supply 85 percent of all rural water
                      supply schemes are dependent on groundwater.
             Water loss due to leakage is 40 to 50 percent. 30 percent or 34,880 rural habitations have problems with
             water quality. Of these more than half have multiple quality problems. Over half of rural habitations or
             65,415 are fully covered while 32 percent have no coverage.


             4.2	     Urban Drinking Water Supply
             Frequency of water supply in urban areas varies; once in 24 hours for 161 towns, once in 48 hours for
             49 towns, and once in 72 hours in 12 towns. During summer, when the crisis is at its height, water is often
             transported to towns in trains and tankers. Only 10 percent or 23 towns got more than 100 liters per capita
             per day (lpcd) water against the 135 lpcd standard.

                                                                                                       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




5	       Water Quality and Water Logging
In the national context, 74 percent of all habitations with multiple quality issues in the country are located in
Rajasthan, including 51 percent of all fluoride affected areas, and 42 percent of all saline affected areas. Water
logging is the other major threat to surface water quality as seen in the canal command areas (CCAs).


         5.1 	    Groundwater Quality
         The major problems associated with groundwater quality are fluoride, nitrate, and salinity. In addition, many
         parts of the state encounter TDS levels above 1,000 mg/liter against the WHO standard of 500 mg/liter.


         5.2 	 Surface Water Quality
         The two major causes of surface water pollution are sewage water and industrial effluent. None of the towns
         in the state, except Jaipur, have sewage collection, treatment, and disposal systems.


         5.3 	    Industrial Effluent
         Major water polluting industries in the state are dyeing and printing, smelters, thermal power plants, major
         brick/lime kilns, stone crushers, and mines. Effluents discharged from these industries mainly contain alkalis,
         residual dyes, starches and cellulose, soluble salts with mainly sodium and calcium, silicates, oils, and other
         impurities. The effluents are discharged untreated due to the lack of economically viable technologies.


         5.4 	    Water Logging
         Water logging is a severe problem in outside basin and Chambal basin. The causes are seepage from
         canals in the outside basin, and over irrigation in the Chambal basin. As a result of rise in water tables,
         145,600 hectares has turned critical (water table within six meters of land surface). A far more serious
         problem is anticipated in stage-II of IGNP. Experts believe thousands of hectares of land will be submerged
         in 25 to 30 years.


6	       Water Tariff
Revenue from drinking water supply schemes in the state is about 20 percent of the operating and maintenance
(O&M) costs. Power consumed alone costs three times revenue collection. The difference in per unit cost of water
compared to user charges has led to a cycle of higher subsidies (estimated at 74 percent) to consumers with higher
consumption (and likely higher wastage).


         6.1 	    Price Gap
         This study considers the difference between O&M costs and tariffs charged as the price gap for irrigation
         water supply. For drinking water supply and sanitation, costs include bulk production, treatment and
         distribution charges. Recoveries are less than 10 percent in the case of major and medium irrigation and
         rural water supply, while urban water supply and minor irrigation recoveries are higher, though still less than
         40 percent.

    7	       Agriculture-Water Nexus
    Around 70 percent of the state’s labour force is engaged in agriculture and allied activities. The sector contributes
    roughly 22 percent to the state domestic produce. Even though agriculture uses 83 per cent of total water
    resources of the state, only 36.3 percent or 6.66 million hectares net sown area (NSA) is irrigated. Of the irrigated
    land area, 73 percent is dependent on groundwater, while the remaining is almost entirely dependent on canal
    irrigation and vulnerable to ill-timed water supply.


             7.1	Irrigation
             Irrigated agriculture contributes more than 50 percent of agricultural output. In 2005, an expert committee
             made two important observations: population in the state was expected to almost double to 100 million
             by 2050, and, due to this population growth, water used for irrigation would need to be reduced from
             83 percent to 70 percent by 2050. The only solution is to regulate groundwater demand, especially for
             agriculture on a priority basis.


    8	       Policies and Private Sector in Water
    To facilitate the role of public private partnerships (PPP) in creating new infrastructure assets and managing
    existing assets, Government of Rajasthan issued guidelines in May 2012 and has taken several specific steps to
    set up a framework for private sector participation.


             8.1 	    Water Policy The National Water Policy (NWP) was most
                      recently revised and adopted in December 2012
             Section 12.3 of the NWP 2012 states, “Water resources projects and services should be managed with
             community participation. For improved service delivery on sustainable basis, the state governments/
             urban local bodies may associate private sector in public private partnership mode with penalties for
             failure, under regulatory control on prices charged and service standards with full accountability to
             democratically elected local bodies.”


             8.2 	 State Water Policy on Private Sector Role
             The State Water Policy (SWP) under its water resources development and management objectives
             mentions “facilitating private initiative in development, operation and management of water projects.”
             As part of institutional reforms, the SWP seeks to “encourage private initiative in water sector.” And finally,
             as part of legislative and regulatory reforms, the need to “establish rules/regulations for private sector
             involvement in development and operation of water related projects” finds mention in the SWP.


             8.3 	 Projects under PPP
             Contracting has been the main mode of privatization. Given that several water transmission and
             distribution projects are pending resource allocation and subsequent implementation, the Government of
             Rajasthan is inclined to explore annuity-based and other appropriate PPP models in the water sector.




WATER ASSESSMENT AND POTENTIAL
FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INTERVENTIONS                                   10
                                                                                                     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




         8.4 	    Externally Aided Projects
         The projects proposed to the Government of India for external assistance could involve opportunity for
         private sector participation: Nagaur Lift Project Phase II, Jodhpur Urban Water Supply Scheme, and
         Chambal-Bhilwara Project.


9	       Water Institutions
Rajasthan has its water problems, but it also has its fair share of water actors: non-governmental institutions (NGOs),
foundations, research institutions, business associations, international agencies, financial institutions, private
companies, and many others who have done, and continue to do phenomenal work in the water sector.


10	      Market Dynamics

         10.1 	 Market Failures
         Water is a common resource and hence subject to market failures. This leads to several market and system
         failures, both from the supply and user sides.


             10.1.1 	      Over-exploitation of Groundwater
             None of the acts, including the draft groundwater act, addresses the issue of equity. Although cost of
             water and power is subsidized, due to high capital expenditure only large and medium farmers can afford
             to extract water. Small and marginal farmers are left out. Ironically, groundwater extraction rights are
             given away to landowners by the Easement Act of 1882. At the same time, groundwater is also termed
             as a common pool resource in policy discourse. There are no concrete policies to address problems
             surrounding groundwater.


             10.1.2 	      The ‘Free’ Water Mentality
             Drinking water is subsidized up to 75 percent. In most towns, bills are raised on the basis of average
             consumption since 60 percent consumer meters are either not installed or are not working. Bulk metering
             at source of supply is not available. In this scenario, it is impossible to work out the true cost of water
             delivery so that appropriate tariff structures can be put in place. This has led to a free water mentality,
             leading to reckless misuse of water. When it comes to irrigation, current water and energy policies
             actually subsidize inefficient use of water, since there is no increased cost associated with more usage.


             10.1.3 	      Broken Water Delivery
             Leakages in drinking water distribution systems cause a loss of 50 to 60 percent, against a design norm
             of 15 percent. Tail end consumers are left with little water and low pressure. The gaps in supply are
             staggering, both in terms of frequency and volume. The same story is repeated in the irrigation system
             where unlined canals cause water losses and lead to water logging. In areas that are fully dependent on
             canal water, unscientific, erratic water delivery schedules and inadequate control over volumetric supplies
             lead to farmers resorting to flood irrigation and short duration varieties at the cost of crop yields.




                                                                                          WATER ASSESSMENT AND POTENTIAL
                                                         11                               FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INTERVENTIONS
                10.1.4 	     Lack of Institutional Capacity
                Currently, government departments managing water supply systems, such as the Public Health and
                Engineering Department (PHED) are more suited for creating distribution infrastructure rather than
                actually operating it. In several capital intensive drinking water schemes, demand outstrips installed
                capacity even before a project is finished. The traditional top down approach by water related
                departments has failed to mobilize community involvement in planning water projects.


            10.2 	 Market Needs
            While the most obvious market need is access to sustainable water supply, there are other very important
            between-the-lines issues.


                10.2.1 	     Equitable Water Distribution
                The World Bank found that up to 80 percent of subsidies in the country went to medium and large
                farmers. The first to be affected by falling water tables are the rural poor and marginal farmers who lack
                the means to deepen their wells and install more powerful pumps. Part of the solution clearly lies in tariff
                reform, while fixing water rights may be the other part. De linking water rights from land rights would
                make groundwater a genuinely common resource, and start the process of recharging overexploited
                aquifers through both natural processes and human effort. In absence of equity, as water resources
                become increasingly scarce, avoiding water conflicts of the kind already witnessed in the state will
                become more difficult.


                10.2.2 	     Demand Management and Tariff Reform
                Shift from merely meeting the supply-demand gap to managing demand itself is needed. This can be
                achieved through appropriate pricing of water and adopting technologies backed by legislation and
                institutional support to ensure adoption. Increased tariffs must go with a water delivery mechanism
                that consistently works and eliminates inefficiencies such as transmission losses and theft of water. For
                agriculture, the ideal policy is to promote water-saving crop and irrigation technologies in tube well-
                irrigated areas with pro-rata pricing of electricity. The price that truly works for domestic, agricultural,
                and industrial users needs to be discovered.


                10.2.3 	     Delivery Efficiency with Technology
                A fully functional and accurate consumer metering system can limit drinking water wastage and enforce
                a tariff regime. Bulk metering for all water sources should go with consumer metering for domestic,
                industrial, and agricultural use. In the absence of a well-planned and rigorous framework, despite
                government’s good intentions by way of policy documents, annual plans, and heavy central and state
                subsidies, (totaling up to 70 to 90 percent), adoption of relevant technologies by farmers will remain
                poor. Additionally legislation can help streamline equipment supply by discouraging production of
                inefficient conventional devices.




WATER ASSESSMENT AND POTENTIAL
FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INTERVENTIONS                                 12
                                                                                             EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




    10.2.4 	      Groundwater Management
    Groundwater mining in the state has surpassed recharge capabilities. In a state with 90 percent
    dependence on groundwater, this will soon lead to a desperate situation. In many parts of the state
    physical transportation of water is the only solution to meet drinking water needs, an unsustainable
    practice even in the medium term. Every effort to help recharge underground aquifers needs to be
    made, including micro watershed planning and restoration of traditional water bodies that lie scattered in
    disrepair across the state.


    10.2.5 	      Balancing Agri-Water Nexus
    Since 83 percent of water is diverted to agriculture, the need to balance the agri-water nexus cannot be
    overemphasized. Especially in the context of managing groundwater, which contributes 74 percent of
    water used in agriculture.


    10.2.6 	      Water Harvesting
    In several parts of Rajasthan, especially where rainfall is limited to a few showers during the short
    monsoon months, groundwater is not an option due to depletion or high total dissolved solids (TDS).
    With surface water also not available, rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the most viable solution to meet
    drinking water and household needs, at least for a period of six to eight months. Technical support such
    as remote sensing data and geographical information systems (GIS) can help. RWH must be a part of
    micro watershed planning and undertaken in all rural and urban settings to meet demand for drinking,
    domestic, agriculture, and industrial water.


    10.2.7 	      Industrial Wastewater Management
    According to estimates, water demand of industries is 1,000 gallons/acre/day. Overall industrial demand
    for water in the state currently accounts for the lowest share of 6 percent. But, as demand by this sector
    grows, it is critical to meet a portion of this with recycled wastewater while minimizing water loss due to
    industrial pollution.


10.3 	 Market Barriers
To that end, it is also important to understand limitations and challenges faced by the private sector in
delivering water related services.


    10.3.1 	      Water = Government
    Unlike all other sectors where the private sector has played a vital role, water as a social sector is
    unique. As custodian of water resources meant for the public at large, it is the duty and obligation
    of the state to protect these resources. Added to this is the socialist doctrine long followed by the
    country where it is understood that government will provide water to people. Further, the role of state
    governments in this task is well enforced by the Constitution. To conclude, water and government are
    inseparable. Thus, the role the private sector can play and the efficiency it can exhibit will be governed
    by the government. Without government blessing, it is likely that the private sector will be viewed
    with skepticism by user communities, given the widespread notion that private equals profit, which
    sometimes means exploitation.




                                                                                  WATER ASSESSMENT AND POTENTIAL

                10.3.2 	      Missing Private Eco-System
                While Rajasthan has made several attempts in recent times to become more investor friendly and
                attract business, there are several barriers for private sector participation in the water sector: capital,
                pricing, policy, institutional framework and awareness.


                10.3.3 	      The Water Business Model
                Water is a need, not a want. This need is to be ideally met by simultaneously compensating and
                conserving finite water resources for coming generations. Secondly, water is a social matter requiring
                continued community participation. Any water related business model needs to factor this in, which
                means long periods of handholding, not a standard private company trait.


                10.3.4 	      Uncharted Territory
                There are no relevant examples of public private partnership (PPP) or private sector partnerships
                in the true sense (risk sharing, transferability of assets, and financial structuring) in water related
                projects. This could change soon with the PPP projects under consideration, however it would be fair
                to say that water (non-contractual, non-construction projects) is an uncharted territory for the private
                sector in Rajasthan, as is the case in most of India and the developing world. This automatically leads
                to lack of trust, both within the government and user communities.


            10.4 	 Market Players
            The market players in the state deserve review, as they will be contributing partners in any private
            initiative in the state. Rajasthan with its arid and semi-arid climate has had an active water player roster-
            government; NGOs/foundations/volunteers; multilateral agencies/business associations/educational and
            research institutions; financial institutions including microfinance institutions and self-help groups; private
            companies; users; and knowledge providers.


    11 	 Potential Participation and Analysis

            11.1 	 Interventions
            There is a lot that needs to happen on the government’s end, mainly through action-oriented policy
            intervention, institutional reform, and political will. The private sector is most suited to address many
            deficiencies, and bring needed efficiencies, both technical and process oriented, while sharing
            resources and responsibility. It is important to specifically outline possibilities for private sector
            participation into the following:


                11.1.1 	      Rural Drinking Water – Off Grid
                The drinking water solution most applicable to rural areas, especially remote habitations, is off-the-
                grid water supply, both community and individually owned. Additionally, with no groundwater (due
                to quality issues or depletion) and limited feasibility to connect with surface schemes (due to low
                density of population in these areas to justify large infrastructure investment), the most viable source
                is rainwater harvesting.

                                                                                         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




11.1.2 	     Rural/Peri-urban Drinking Water – On Grid
On-grid supply in rural and peri-urban areas, that is in bulk to public stand posts (PSPs) or end users,
would present more viability for private involvement. A well-structured PPP model may be the best
alternative. The proposed externally funded projects discussed in section 8.5 of this report include
peri-urban areas and as such would be an ideal opportunity for private intervention. Additionally,
there already may be opportunities to set desalination plants and cater to surrounding communities
in an on-grid bulk to PSP or user mode.


11.1.3 	     Urban Drinking Water – On Grid
In the light of the severely compromised urban drinking water supply in the state the need for an
alternative is immediate. Private involvement in urban areas is very relevant as proven by select
initiatives within India and abroad. The most important policy thrust in making private sector viable in
on-grid schemes is the formal recognition of water pricing and tariff reform as important areas.


11.1.4 	     Agriculture – Canal Irrigated and 11.1.5 Agriculture
             – Non-Canal (Groundwater and Rain fed)
Agriculture, which consumes 83 percent of the state’s water resources, presents the single
biggest opportunity for water reform. A range of water saving interventions by the private sector
can be undertaken under an umbrella project in select geographies under canal command and
groundwater irrigation.


11.1.6 	     Industry – Wastewater Recycling (including
             municipal waste)
While industry is lower priority for government water supply schemes (after agriculture and domestic
consumption), the need for solutions is nevertheless significant, given the polluting industrial
composition in the state, and growing emphasis on wastewater treatment and recycling in latest plan
documents (including water harvesting being made mandatory for both industrial units and industrial
areas). In light of the stressed water situation, which threatens the viability of certain industries,
support from industry is easy to garner. The key for any private intervention would be to develop the
right working model with municipalities where domestic sewage is part of the project. Costs, risks,
cross-subsidies, and suitable uses for treated water would be the main areas to tackle.


11.1.7 	     Industry – Water Efficiency
Water foot printing studies of the kind already executed by IFC will be helpful in the context of
water intensive industries such as textile, cement, and marble. Findings could help establish much
needed industry best practices in water use, and help influence policy direction and eventually help
regulation of industrial water use. Other uses of such an exercise would be tariff reform to penalize
wasteful units.

              11.2 	 Analysis
              In order to help prioritize efforts, these interventions have been assessed on the basis of:

              Degree of positive impact, from high to low, in addressing Rajasthan’s overall water problem, compared
              to the level of effort required to execute each intervention, from easy to difficult (refer to figure below).

              The placement of each intervention in the various gradients is based on the facts and their critical
              analysis presented in this report. With this background, the top three most effective interventions,
              numbered in brackets, in order of positive impact are:

                                          1.	 Rural drinking water – off-grid (1)
                                          2.	 Tie between rural/peri-urban drinking water on-grid (2) and agriculture – non canal (groundwater
                                              and rain fed) (5)
                                          3.	 Agriculture – canal irrigated (4)

              Drinking water needs come before all else and, compared to urban areas, have been neglected in the
              rural and peri-urban context. On the other hand, the sheer magnitude of water being consumed by rain
              fed and groundwater-irrigated agriculture in the state and its correlation to food-security explains the tie
              above.

As explained in earlier sections, interventions (6) and (7) relating to industrial water are comparatively
lower on both the impact and effort scale, but still important in their own right, with efficiency of water
use being the most actionable. Intervention (3) relating to on-grid urban water supply, both in terms of
impact and effort, falls somewhat mid-way between industrial interventions as a group on one end, and
rural/peri-urban drinking water and agricultural interventions on the other.


11.3 	 Recommendations
The seven interventions and their analysis presented above, brings us to our concluding section on
recommendations, that is, specific answers to the “Where do we go from here?” question.

After detailed assessment of all relevant facts, IFC could take up at least one initiative in each of these three
sectors, namely, drinking water supply, agri-water nexus, and industrial water use.

Since water is a common resource, each sector is linked to the other. Water efficiency created in one
sector, can quickly dwindle if the misuse continues elsewhere. Having an integrated approach that
comprehensively addresses all water use in a watershed /geography is most desirable. With current annual
trends of deterioration, in a few decades water sustainability itself could become an unachievable goal in
Rajasthan. Hence there is a need to approach the problem from all angles while there is time. It is however
important to prioritize.

IFC can first take up rural water supply, agricultural water efficiency, and industrial water stewardship.
These areas stand to benefit from the right kind of private sector intervention. Further due diligence
and involvement of additional parties, both within and outside IFC, is required in order to crystallize
recommendations into feasible projects. However effort has been made by the author to influence rapid
action with four realistic project proposals for IFC to deliberate upon.

The northwestern state of Rajasthan, with a land area of 34.3 million hectares or 10.4 percent of India’s total area, is
the largest Indian state. The state has four main physiographical regions- the Western Desert, the Aravali hills (running
southwest to northeast), the Eastern Plain, and the Southeastern Plateau. It is divided into 33 districts, and further
sub-divided into 249 blocks[10] and 9,177 gram panchayats.[11]

According to the census of 2011, 5.6 percent of the country’s total population or 68.6 million live in the state, of which
over 75 percent live in rural areas. The state has experienced a decadal population growth rate of 21.44 percent, which
is higher than the 17.64 percent national average and is among the highest in the country. An estimated 24.8 percent of
the population lives below poverty line (BPL), compared to 29.8 percent nationally.[12]

The gross state domestic product (GSDP) in 2011-12 was $76.8 billion, with an average annual growth rate of
about 15.2 percent in recent times (since 2004-05). Current per capita income is $1,122, which has increased at
a compounded annual growth rate of 13.2 percent in the last six years. Tertiary sector contributes 44.6 percent
to GSDP, followed by primary sector with 29.2 percent that has been the fastest growing, and secondary sector
with 26.2 percent. Agriculture and allied sectors are important, employing two-thirds of the state labor force and
contributing roughly 26 percent of the GSDP.

       Samiti, and it is the link between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishad at the district level.

    Figure 2 maps Rajasthan’s arid to semi-arid ecosystem with varying degrees of water problems. Two-thirds of the
    state is the Great Thar Desert, which suffers from recurrent water scarcity. This represents 60 percent of the country’s
    142 desert blocks. The region is subjected to temperature extremes, from around 0°C during the brief winter to nearly
    50°C in summer.

    Climate change, and resulting increase in evapotranspiration,[13] has had a key impact on water resources in Rajasthan.[14]
    The normal average annual evapotranspiration in the state is estimated at 1,701 millimeter, which could increase by
    15 millimeter with a slight 1 percent increase in baseline temperature (42°C based on normal maximum temperature for
    the state). The result would be an additional water requirement of about 313 million cubic meters (MCM) for the entire arid
    zone of Rajasthan.[15]

    The state has just one perennial river, the Chambal, which means almost no dependable surface water. Famine conditions
    often prevail due to scanty rainfall. There are fourteen defined river basins and an outside basin in Rajasthan. Available

                                                                                                                                       SCENARIO




surface water is confined mainly to the south and southeastern parts of the state. A large area in the west does not
have a defined drainage basin. Thus, the state’s water resources are not only disproportionately low when compared
to its people, livestock and farmers, but is also distributed unevenly.

Rajasthan has only 1.16 percent of the country’s total surface water resources or 21.71 billion cubic meters (BCM).
On the basis of a more realistic indication of available surface water at 50 percent dependability (or how planning
department looks at this resource), the state has16.05 BCM of economically usable surface water. The state has
created capacity to harness and store 11.29 BCM, or around 70 percent of available water. Irrigation potential of
3.4 million hectares has been created, against a potential of 5.1 million hectares. Rajasthan has 1.72 percent of the
country’s groundwater, translating to around 11.36 BCM. Dependent on inflows into the rivers, 17.88 BCM is allocated
through inter-state agreements, although not dependable due to political compulsions of the upper riparian states.

On paper, water use can be expanded by a further 30 percent. However, given the capital-intensive nature of
construction projects and budget caps that prevent the irrigation department from sanctioning new projects, the more
realistic assessment of additional availability is economically usable water of around 21 percent. This is broken down
in figure 3, which accounts for the use of 79 percent of the 45.09 BCM of economically available water.

               Studies have shown Rajasthan is among regions with greatest climate sensitivity and lowest adaptive
               capability.[17] The state’s average annual rainfall is 531 mm, with pronounced spatial variations. Rainfall ranges
               from 100 mm in Jaisalmer in the west to 800 mm in Jhalawar in the east. The 22 eastern districts are better
               off with 688 mm of average rainfall, compared to the 318 mm average in the 11 western districts. Around 90
               percent of total rainfall occurs in the monsoon months of July to September. Most parts of the state receive
               just a few showers within a band of a few days. The average number of rainy days during southwest monsoon
               in Jaisalmer and Jhalawar is 10 and 40 days, respectively.

               Rajasthan’s rainfall pattern is characterized by late onset and early withdrawal of monsoon when compared
               to other states. Dry spells are common and the state has witnessed frequent drought and famine conditions.
               The state is hit by drought four out of every five years, the highest incidence in the country.[18] Within the state,
               the probability of occurrence of droughts is highest in the western parts.[19] Between 1901 and 2002 there have
               been 48 drought years of varied intensity, which means that the chance of occurrence of a meteorological
               drought in the state is 47 percent.[20] Further, only in nine out of these years, none of the districts in the state
               were affected by drought.

           There is a palpable shift in rainfall patterns [21]. The erratic behavior of rains is quite apparent on analysis
           of rainfall data from 1956 to 2010 (figure 5). Taking 1901 to1971 as baseline, 57.51 cm (575 mm) can be
           considered as normal rainfall for Rajasthan. However rainfall has remained below normal for about 60 percent
           of the time during this 55 year period. Data shows frequent periods of lower rainfall that last five or more
           consecutive years. Hence, uncertain seems to be the new normal for rainfall in the state.

           2.2	Groundwater
           At 210 BCM, the annual extraction of groundwater in India is by far the highest in the world[22]. Heavy and
           indiscriminate reliance on ground water extraction, possibly to compensate for the lack of surface water, has
           led to declining ground water availability. In Rajasthan, the annual water table loss is 1 to 3 meters. The gross
           annual draft of groundwater in the state is 13 BCM against a recharge of only 10.4 BCM.

           Around 90 percent of drinking water and 73 percent of water for irrigation is met by groundwater.
           Underground exploitation of water has shot up from 35 percent in 1984 to 138 percent in 2008, and is likely

                to reach 189.1, 221.4 and 259.1 percent in 2015, 2020 and 2025 respectively[23]. In 16 of the 33 districts,
                groundwater is over exploited (more than 100 percent), and the rates of exploitation are as high as
                165 percent in Jhunjhunu and 153 percent in Jodhpur.

                The depth at which wells now hit usable water, if they do, varies widely, but has substantially increased
                over the past two decades. For instance, in areas around Jaipur, water was found at less than 100 feet
                depth during the 1980s, now wells are dug to 250 feet and more. Moreover, even at that depth, wells
                yield less water and re-drilling is required frequently. In parts of central Rajasthan water is extracted from
                depths of 700 feet or more with submersible pumps. High incidence of salinity in these areas means
                the probability of finding usable water even at these depths is low, making large areas dependent on
                transported water for drinking and household use [24].

                The groundwater situation is no better even in areas where surface water is used for irrigation due to
                water logging which renders groundwater saline [25]. To quantify the dismal situation, of the 249 blocks
                in the state only 12 percent or 32 blocks are in the safe category, and about 80 percent are either over-
                exploited or critical (figure 6). Around the state capital of Jaipur, almost all blocks are overexploited (12 of
                the 13, remaining one block is critical).

                      2.2.1 Rajasthan Groundwater Bill
                      With the groundwater situation as critical as it is, it is important to understand the legislative
                      environment. In India, surface and groundwater regulation is the purview of individual states.
                      Rajasthan does not regulate groundwater, but in 2005 the government drafted the Rajasthan
                      Groundwater Rational Use and Management Act. The draft act was prepared by an appointed expert
                      committee constituted by the Rajasthan High Court Bar Association comprised of technical and
                      policy experts from the state, multiple development agencies such as the World Bank and European
                      Commission, and non-governmental organizations. Inspiration for the act in part came from a

    [25] Inland salinity is caused due to practice of surface water irrigation without consideration of ground water status. The
          gradual rise of ground water levels with time has resulted in water logging and heavy evaporation in semi-arid regions
          leading to salinity problems in command areas. In some areas of Rajasthan, ground water salinity is so high that the well
          water is directly used for salt manufacturing by solar evaporation.

                  World Bank study[26], and from the Government of India’s 2005 Model Bill to Regulate and Control the
                  Development and Management of Groundwater.

                  The objective of the draft bill is to promote conservation, augmentation, equitable distribution,
                  and sustainable use of groundwater resources in Rajasthan. In addition to proposing to regulate
                  future construction of groundwater extraction technologies such as tube wells and to monitor
                  groundwater withdrawal, the draft act attempts to decentralize management by enlisting farmers into
                  conservation monitoring.

                  The draft bill seeks to address the problem of unchecked water extraction by putting in place well-
                  defined duties and functions for a proposed Rajasthan Groundwater Authority at the state, district
                  and block (panchayat samiti or village body) levels, with specially appointed groundwater officers as
                  executive chairmen. An important function is the registration of existing and new wells, well-digging
                  agencies and rig-owners, and private water supply agencies. The block authority will have powers
                  to take over unregistered existing wells and refuse permission for new wells. Registered well-digging
                  agencies will be required to ensure that permission has been obtained by prospective well-owners and
                  submit completion reports to the block authority, who in turn will test the quality of water and provide an
                  official completion certificate. Electricity distribution companies will provide electricity connections for
                  new wells only on production of the completion certificate by the well owner.

                  While the draft act envisages different user charges for water based on the nature of commercial activity
                  and groundwater characteristics of the block, it does not provide any specific road map for allocating
                  water in situations of water distress. The draft act provides for the levy of groundwater user charges as
                  prescribed by the state authority. For urban domestic and rural agricultural use of groundwater, the state
                  authority will fix an electricity bill limit per household per month. The amount by which the monthly bill
                  exceeds the prescribed limit will be levied as groundwater user charge. The rationale for using electricity
                  tariffs for computing groundwater user charges is not explained in the draft act. Electricity tariffs are
                  based on the cost of production and distribution of electricity, which is unconnected with groundwater
                  usage. The cost of groundwater management, conservation, and augmentation does not find mention in
                  the draft act.

                  Groundwater user charges will be collected by electricity distribution companies (Rajasthan has
                  unbundled its power sector into separate generation, transmission and distribution companies), who
                  will hand over collected user charges to block groundwater authorities, who in turn will hand over the
                  charges to the local bodies to be exclusively used for groundwater replenishment.[27] Currently, the fate
                  of the draft act remains unclear.


            2.3	        Surface Water Resources and River Basins
            Rajasthan is divided into fourteen river basins and an outside basin. Surface water resources are scarce and
            confined to the south and southeast of the state. The central and western parts of the state are devoid of any
            drainage and have very limited surface water, which too is not replenished due to low and erratic rainfall.
            High temperatures and low humidity in these parts further add to rainwater loss due to evapotranspiration.

[27] The involvement of several agencies in collection and distribution of user charges could result in administrative inefficiencies
      and complexities.

                The River Chambal, and according to some sources River Mahi, are considered the perennial rivers of the
                state; although actual availability of water is questionable. These rivers receive almost all their flow during
                the short monsoon months (see figure 9[28] for river basin map; appendix A provides basin facts).

                The surface water available in all basins is 25,931 million cubic meters (MCM) as shown in
                figure 7. According to the planning department of this only 60 percent or 16,054 MCM is considered
                economically usable at 50 percent dependability. For the purpose of planning, an even smaller subset is
                taken into account.

                Similar to the troubling block-wise groundwater situation explained earlier in this report, almost
                all river basins are over exploited, except the Mahi, West Banas and Sabarmati basins that are
                critical / semi-critical (figure 8). Notably, this data also indicates no groundwater is available for
                further irrigation projects.

                   Studies[29] to monitor adverse effects of climate change show the River Luni, along with west-flowing rivers of
                   Kutch and Saurastra that occupy about 60 percent of the area in Rajasthan, face acute water scarcity. River
                   basins of Mahi and Sabarmati are likely to also experience constant water shortage. This scenario calls for
                   urgent efforts to mitigate diminishing water resources in these basins.

                  originates in the Vindhyan ranges near Mhow in Indore district of Madhya Pradesh (MP). The river flows
                  through the states of Madhya Pradesh (MP), Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh (UP). The basin is roughly
                  rectangular in shape, with a maximum length of 560 km in a northeast-southwest direction. The river flows for
                  some 320 km in a generally northerly direction before entering a deep gorge in Rajasthan at Chourasigarh,
                  about 96 km upstream of Kota. The deep gorge extends up to Kota and the river then flows for about 226 km

    3	         Water Demand-Supply Gap
    Agricultural use of water accounts for the consumption of 83 percent of available water resources in the state, drinking
    water for 11 percent, and industry/other uses for 6 percent. Fuelled by rising population and improved awareness of
    sanitation, non-agricultural demand for water is expected to go up to 8.07 billion cubic meters (BCM) in 2045 (against
    3.28 BCM in 1995). Figure 10 shows the rising gap between demand and supply in the state. The current deficit
    is 8 BCM, and is expected to go up to 9 BCM by 2015.

    The average per capita water availability in the state is said to be in the range of 640 to 780 cubic meters on the basis
    of projected population (as on July 2009). This is against the generally accepted requirement of 1000 cubic meters.
    The availability is expected to further drop below 450 cubic meters by 2050, which is below the international minimum
    of 500 cubic meters or absolute water scarcity

    In terms of supply, 88.5 percent of villages and habitations in the state receive less than 40 liters per capita per day
    (lpcd) of water. Of these, 8 percent receive less than 10 lpcd, 33 percent between 10 to 20 lpcd, and 41 percent
    between 20 to 30 lpcd. The supply-demand gap is also reflected in the proportion of households reporting purchase of
    water in rural Rajasthan, which is the highest in the country.[32]

In the urban context, at the aggregate state level, the demand for water (1,803.84 million liters per day or MLD)
outstrips installed capacity (1,798.91 MLD), and supply of water (1,475.71 MLD)[33]. The situation is more precarious in
towns where shortage could be higher. According to estimates,[34] in 2015 the demand for water in Rajasthan in various
sectors will be (in cubic millimeters/year): 3,176 domestic, 71.4 industrial, 1,089 livestock, and 715 for other uses. This
adds up to a total demand of 5,051.4 cubic millimeters per year, or a 54 percent jump in the two decades since 1995.


            3.1	        Industrial Water Demand
            Rajasthan is undergoing an industrial transformation. Two important projects, Dedicated Freight Corridor
            (DFC, being implemented by the Ministry of Railways) and Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC), could
            bring rapid industrial development to the state since about 58 percent of the state’s area across 22 districts
            lies in the area of influence of these corridors. Water availability is critical in developing infrastructure resulting
            from these projects, translating into further pressure on very limited resources.

            Industrial water demand in Rajasthan was around 45.5 million cubic meters (MCM) per year in 1995, projected
            to grow to 138.44 MCM/year in 2045.[35] According to the new industrial promotion policy, 10 percent water in
            new dams and projects will be reserved for industrial development[36].

            Industries that are being encouraged through government policy and present factor advantages include
            tourism, cement, mining and metals, auto components, information technology/information technology
            enabled services and electronics, and biotechnology. Other industries where the state enjoys an established
            reputation are textiles, gems and jewelry, marble, ceramics, and agro-based industries. Among these, water
            consumption in cement plants, textiles, and marble[37] is particularly high.

            The Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation Limited (RIICO) has developed
            257 industrial estates including six growth centers and ten industry development centers in the state
            to provide infrastructure including social and financial amenities to industrial units. RIICO has acquired
            20,089.7 hectares of land and has developed an area of 14,087.20 hectares. This boost to industry translates

4	         Drinking Water Supply
Rajasthan has severe drinking water supply problems. In the hilly southeastern region, groundwater is available
only in some parts of the valleys as the water table fluctuates rapidly due to the rocky geographical formations
in the area. Reservoirs in the area dry up and create severe water crisis during years of continuous drought. The
western desert area and Aravali region often face drought conditions due to scanty and erratic rainfall. There are
only a few reservoirs in these areas. The soil is basically alluvial with limestone and allied sedimentary rocks, which
are good aquifers. But increased demand for agriculture, industrial, and domestic use is fast depleting groundwater
reserves and affecting water quality. The available water has high total dissolved solids, salinity, fluoride, and
nitrates. The Gang-Bhakhra canal system, the Indira Gandhi Nahar Pariyojna (IGNP) in the northwest, and now
Narmada canal system in the south are the only reliable drinking water sources in the region.

In addition to geographical problems, the high population growth rate (one of the highest in the country at
21.44 percent decadal growth), and its distribution over sparsely populated pockets has aggravated the problem
of providing safe drinking water. The population density in the state has increased from 129 per square kilometer in
1991, to 165 in 2001 and 201 by 2011. Around 70 percent of habitations in the state face problems getting potable
drinking water.

During the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-12), 24 major projects amounting to $404.5 million have been completed
with an expenditure of $129.6 million and 14 towns, 1,755 villages and 235 hamlets have been covered.[38] Around
$2.67 billion has been allocated for water supply in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2012-17), of which an outlay of
$372.8 million is proposed for urban and rural water supply schemes in the current annual plan (2013-14).[39] These
schemes include 21 major water supply schemes and nine new projects to help meet the growing drinking water
needs of the state.


           4.1	       Rural Drinking Water Supply
           Currently, 85 percent of all rural water supply schemes are dependent on groundwater. Over the years,
           severe depletion in groundwater table due to over-extraction for agriculture has led to deterioration in water
           quality, making a large number of drinking water sources unsustainable. Additionally, large geographical
           areas have high concentrations of dissolved chemicals such as fluoride and chloride, making water unsafe
           for drinking.

           The poor condition of rural water assets and infrastructure is reflected in the extent of water loss due
           to leakage in the rural water supply schemes, which is estimated at 40 to 50 percent. Infrastructure, in
           terms of overhead tanks and distribution lines, was constructed in order to provide piped water supplies
           to rural areas. Almost all these schemes depend on groundwater. In a majority of the cases, these water
           supply schemes have become defunct due to depleted groundwater aquifers. Hence, the infrastructure
           and physical capital is lying unused and dilapidated. A negative effect associated with this is the neglect
           of traditional water bodies that had once sustained life in rural Rajasthan. In the hope of getting assured
           piped water, rural communities have neglected the management of these traditional systems, which have
           degenerated over time.

                have problems with water quality. Of these more than half have multiple quality problems. In terms of service,
                according to the Public Health and Engineering Department (PHED), a little over half of rural habitations or
                65,415 are fully covered[41] while 32 percent have no coverage. The coverage status of rural habitations is

                Another way of looking at drinking water coverage in rural Rajasthan is with data from the planning
                department as presented in figure 13. Around 14 percent of habitations have slipped out of coverage.
                Maintaining water supply coverage in rural areas is a constant challenge due to the type of coverage in these
                areas (see the hand-pump situation described next in this section).

           Families in rural areas including those living below the poverty line (BPL) have to pay regularly for water
           since government supply is limited to extremely dry months. Rajasthan has the highest incidence of rural
           households purchasing water. Water in rural areas is generally transported by camel carts or tractor tankers
           and costs about Indian rupees 400 ($8) per load, and this price can more than double in crucial months of
           water scarcity. This is significant cost for families living in worst affected areas, which earn daily wages of
           Indian rupees 100 ($2) and are sometimes unable to find employment on all days. Due to lack of resources,
           groups of families commonly share a storage tank, which needs refilling every two or three days.

           Over half the villages in the state are covered by hand-pumps (public stand post model). About 23 percent
           of these pumps are either unfit or unusable due to their location (areas where there is no water or water is of
           very poor quality), causing the areas covered under these water supply schemes to often slip out of coverage.
           Each hand pump (India Mark II) costs about Indian rupees 44,000 ($800), and more than half of them are
           under repair at any given time of the year. Figure 14 shows coverage in villages by scheme.

           Groundwater sources in Rajasthan are no longer dependable due to the limitations of quality and quantity. The
           state is therefore planning major coverage through surface water resource-based projects that are considered
           sustainable and reliable. The River Chambal and its tributaries, the IGNP, and Narmada canal are the only
           dependable perennial surface water sources in the state. These projects involve long transmission systems,
           making them highly capital and timeline intensive.

           The state government has taken up a number of drinking water supply projects based on surface water
           resources. Under the Bharat Nirman scheme, 77,052 habitations were identified as having drinking water
           issues as on April 2005. As of March 2012, of these, 50,323 habitations have been identified as problematic
           habitations; many of these have multiple quality problems. The surface water source-based projects have
           solved the drinking water problems in 14,314 of these habitations.[44] The remaining habitations are to be
           covered on completion of the major water supply projects that are currently underway.

               4.2	       Urban Drinking Water Supply
               Pressure on urban centers in the state is growing. Jaipur city, a metropolis with a population of 2.3 million,
               has grown by 59.37 percent over a decade, one of the highest among metropolitan cities in India. The
               supply of safe, hygienic drinking water to urban populations is undoubtedly a top priority for the state
               government. All 222 towns (183 municipal towns) are covered by piped water supply from 124 schemes.
               Of these schemes, 14 are based on surface water, 54 on both surface and groundwater, and the
               remaining 156 are entirely dependent on groundwater. However around 30 percent of the peripheral
               population in urban areas still remain uncovered.

               Uncertainty over the availability of groundwater, in terms of quality as well as quantity, makes urban water
               supply as precarious as supply to rural areas. The levels of service and quality of drinking water are far
               from satisfactory. Frequency of water supply in urban areas varies; once in 24 hours for 161 towns, once
               in 48 hours for 49 towns, and once in 72 hours in 12 towns.[45] During summer, when the crisis is at its
               height, water is often transported to towns in trains and tankers.

               According to the 2011 census, only 82.6 percent of urban households in the state had tap supply,
               and 78.2 percent households had the source of water located within their premises.[46] Forty-two
               municipal towns located in canal irrigated areas or near big reservoirs had surface water sources, while
               141 municipal towns depended on groundwater. Only 10 percent or 23 towns got more than 100 liters per
               capita per day (lpcd) water against the 135 lpcd standard (figure 15 shows supply for all urban areas).

           4.3	        The Role of Public Health and Engineering Department
           The Public Health and Engineering Department (PHED) is currently responsible for planning, designing,
           and building, operating and maintaining urban and rural drinking water supply. Institutional reforms
           have been proposed to improve delivery by separating roles and responsibilities and increasing
           accountability. This would also be guided by the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Act requiring
           delegation of power and authority relating to drinking water supply to the urban local bodies (ULBs) and
           panchayat raj institutions (PRIs), or village bodies, with government’s role restricted to policy planning,
           facilitating, and regulating.

           The following broad organizational reforms have been proposed to restructure the PHED:

                 1.	 Intra-village systems for distribution of drinking water supply to be handed over to PRIs.

                 2.	 Drinking water supply in urban towns to be handed over to ULBs. Since not enough capacities
                     exist with ULBs, autonomous companies will be created for the seven divisional headquarters
                     and regional utilities for other major towns. A report by the World Bank[47] has made
                     recommendations for the institutional sector as a medium term vision for 2017. These include:

                       ¬¬    Separate utilities companies, owned by ULBs/state level intermediaries/state government,
                             will be set up for large cities that will be responsible for operation and maintenance of
                             groundwater and sewerage assets, water distribution, and service provision

                       ¬¬    The restructured PHED will be the bulk water provider to corporatized city-based utilities/
                             regional utilities

                       ¬¬    A few regional utilities serving multiple towns as well as adjoining rural areas will be created

                       ¬¬    A regulatory commission for tariff setting and quality to be set up

                       ¬¬    Water and sewerage policy including financial framework to be prepared and implemented

                       ¬¬    Professional consultants will draft a detailed road map for the creation of companies and
                             modalities to transfer responsibilities to these companies.

                 3.	 Bulk transmission of water up to towns/villages to be handled by the Rajasthan Water Supply
                     and Sewage Corporation (RWSSC). In its new role, RWSSC will conduct operation and
                     maintenance of all major water supply projects, supply bulk water to ULBs, PRIs, PHED and
                     other consumers, and collect revenue from the sale of this bulk water. This will be a purely
                     commercial arrangement.

                 4.	 PHED in its new role will (a) regulate and allocate water to different utilities, (b) focus on overall
                     planning for the state and related policy matters, and (c) provide interface between Government
                     of India and external funding agencies, among others, on drinking water projects.

    5	         Water Quality and Water Logging
    In the national context, 74 percent of all habitations with multiple quality issues in the country are located in
    Rajasthan, including 51 percent of all fluoride affected areas, and 42 percent of all saline affected areas. Large
    areas of the state have such high salinity that the water is unfit for cattle and other domestic use such as washing
    or cooking. Despite this, people drink saline water during the summer in many parts of the state. Fluoride is the
    most widespread, while salinity and nitrates are other serious problems. The worst affected districts include Tonk,
    Churu, Barmer, Pali, Sirohi, Jalore, Rajasmand, Ajmer, Nagaur, Jhunjhunu, Barmer, Bharatpur, Bhilwara, Jodhpur,
    Baran, and Jaipur. Increasing pollution by industrial units and unregulated mining of water from deep wells is
    adding to the water quality problem in a number of districts.

    Intensive surface water irrigation often causes water logging and increased salinity, which are major environmental
    threats. In Rajasthan water logging is the other major threat to surface water quality as seen in the canal command
    areas (CCAs). The primary cause of water logging is an imbalance within the groundwater body underlying the
    affected area. This imbalance is a result of several factors, most important being more water being available than
    what can be used, leading to over irrigation in the command areas that were developed initially. Additionally the
    sandy soils found in more than 60 percent of these command areas have poor water holding capacity,[48] as a
    result as much as half of the water applied for irrigation percolates down into groundwater. Other contributors
    to water logging are seepage from canals and inefficient irrigation practices. As the water table rises, it prevents
    effective drainage due to capillary action. Water rises to the surface with dissolved salts and evaporates, leaving
    the salt to accumulate on the soil surface and causing secondary salinity in the soil and groundwater. The problem
    of water logging has become more evident in recent years.

           5.1	       Groundwater Quality
           Rajasthan is over-dependent on groundwater. The major problems associated with groundwater quality
           are fluoride, nitrate, and salinity. The worst affected districts with 50 percent or more concentrations are[49]:

                ¬¬    Fluoride > 1.5 mm: Tonk, Churu, Barmer, Pali, Sirohi, Jalore, Rajasmand

                ¬¬    Nitrate > 100 ppm: Churu, Nagaur, Jhunjhunu

                ¬¬    TDS > 2000 ppm: Churu, Barmer, Bharatpur

                ¬¬    Iron > 1ppm: Bhilwara, Jodhpur, Baran, Jaipur

           In addition, many parts of the state encounter high levels of total dissolved solids (TDS) in drinking water,
           well above 1,000 mg/liter against the WHO standard of 500 mg/liter. Figure 16 compares the magnitude of
           the problem with the rest of the country, and highlights the worst affected districts in the state.

                5.2	        Surface Water Quality
                The two major causes of surface water pollution are sewage water and industrial effluent. None of the
                towns in the state, except Jaipur, have sewage collection, treatment, and disposal systems. Phase-I
                of the Rajasthan Urban Infrastructure Development Project ( RUIDP) is constructing sewage systems
                with treatment plants in Jodhpur, Kota, Ajmer, Udaipur and Bikaner. Under Phase-II, RUIDP will cover
                fifteen towns: Alwar, Baran-Chhabra, Barmer, Bharatpur, Bundi, Churu, Chittorgarh, Dholpur, Jaisalmer,
                Jhalawar-Jhalarapatan, Karauli, Nagaur, Rajsamand, Sawai Madhopur, and Sikar.

                In uncovered towns, sewage and wastewater is carried through open drains running along the roads and
                is ultimately discharged into a water body (tank or river). The construction of septic tanks is a common
                practice in towns that do not have sewerage systems.

                The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has identified highly polluting industries in Rajasthan: textiles,
                cement, distilleries, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and thermal power plants. Industrial water pollution in
                the state is mainly confined to Kota, Alwar, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Pali, Balotra, Sanganer, Bhilwara, Jhotwara,
                and Bagru areas. Large industries have their own effluent treatment plants. Small-scale industries located
                in and around urban areas do not have treatment facilities. The government has planned common
                effluent treatment plants (CEPTs) in the following industrial areas: three in in Pali, and one each in Balotra,
                Jodhpur, Bhiwadi, and Manpura Machhedi in Jaipur.


                5.3	        Industrial Effluent
                In arid western Rajasthan, scarcity of raw material and skilled labor, combined with difficult physiographic
                conditions, had meant very limited industrial development until the 1970s. Since then, many industries
                based on local raw materials have sprung up. Many of these discharge high amounts of effluent, adding
                to the state’s water woes. Jodhpur, Pali, and Barmer (Balotra) have numerous dyeing and printing works.
                Other major water polluting industries are smelters, thermal power plants, major brick/lime kilns, stone
                crushers, and mines. Industrial water pollution is a problem in several parts of the state such as Bhilwara,
                Udaipur, Jaipur (Sanganer), Kota, Pali, Barmer (Balotra), Jodhpur, Pali, Kishangarh, Makrana and others.
                Listed here are some facts that give an idea of the magnitude of the problem:[50]

                      ¬¬    In Pali district, 916 textile units have been identified as polluting units, daily discharging more than
                            36,000 cubic meters high pH domestic and industrial effluents containing high levels of chemical
                            oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total dissolved solids (TDS), total
                            suspended solids (TSS), chlorides, sulfate, and sodium into the River Bandi.

                      ¬¬    In Jodhpur, 632 industries, including 183 dyeing and printing works and 65 steel rolling units daily
                            discharge about 15,000 to 17,000 cubic meters of polluted wastewater into the River Jojri along
                            with municipal sewage.

                      ¬¬    Balotra in Barmer district has 222 water polluting textile units. In Balotra and Jasol, the wastewater
                            from textile units is about 11,000 cubic meters daily, mainly discharged into the River Luni.




    [50] 	 Data on number of units, and eff luent discharge can be somewhat dated but provides a sense of the issue at hand. If
           anything, one would expect the numbers to have risen, further intensifying the problem.

                 ¬¬    In Sanganer and Bagru districts of Jaipur district, 400 small, medium, and large-scale textile units,
                       blue pottery units, paper and pulp units, and domestic sewage have been identified as responsible
                       for water pollution.

                 ¬¬    In Kota, chemicals, alkali, and rayon industries, a thermal power project, 212 textile units, and 101
                       rolling mills have been identified as polluting industries.

                 ¬¬    Pollution in Udaipur is mainly because of the 200 small and large-scale zinc smelters and fertilizer,
                       chemical and pesticide units.

                 ¬¬    In Alwar, 400 units such as breweries, chemical factories, and distilleries are polluting the water.

                 ¬¬    Bhilwara is famous for its large scale printing, weaving, and dyeing houses, and also has its ground
                       water polluted to a large extent.

                 ¬¬    The mining units at Makrana (Nagaur), Rajsamand, Modak, Aandhi (Jaipur), and Dholpur are also
                       responsible for water pollution due to discharge of marble and stone slurry.

           Industrial effluents discharged from these industries contain alkalis, residual dyes, starches and cellulose,
           soluble salts with mainly sodium and calcium, silicates, oils, and other impurities. The effluents are
           discharged untreated due to the lack of economically viable technologies. As a result, groundwater quality
           and biophysical resources in several areas such as along the Jojri, Bandi, and Luni rivers are rapidly
           deteriorating. The continuous use of polluted groundwater for irrigation has sharply reduced cropping
           intensity, crop production and density, and biomass in terms of trees, shrubs, and grasses. The soils have
           become compact, impervious and hard, resulting in the formation of a surface crust. Due to the increasing
           impact of industrial effluents, a large numbers of wells have now been abandoned and a large area of
           cultivated land has been degraded and turned into wasteland. The use of polluted water for growing food
           and fodder, and for drinking, has created health hazards for humans and livestock.

           As mitigating measures, some units have installed their own treatment plants and recycle water for non-
           essential purposes such as gardening. The government has set up CETPs at certain industrial locations.
           In Pali, for example, the Rajasthan high court has ordered the installation of flow meters in April 2008 to
           check industrial effluents from entering the River Bandi. The court said the effluents should not exceed
           the capacity of the three CETPs (upgraded at a cost of $2 million in 2008) in the textile town. The industrial
           units together had spent over $4 million installing 330 meters till May 2009 but the industries claim no one
           is monitoring them, and that many of the flow meters are non-functional. Some media reports[51] quote
           officials from RPCB saying there is no court mandate on monitoring the meters and that the trust managing
           CETPs should monitor them (whereas the trust lays the responsibility with the pollution control board).
           Separately, the Center for Science and Environment (CSE) has launched a program in Pali to enable the
           community to monitor water pollution in the local area. About 60 farmers were trained to use testing kits,
           which test for arsenic, chromium, lead, nickel and zinc.

                5.4	        Water Logging
                Water logging is a severe problem in outside basin and Chambal basin. The causes are seepage from canals
                in the outside basin, and over irrigation in Chambal basin. The mean rate of water table rise is 1.1 meter per
                year in stage-I of IGNP, 0.81 meters per year in Ghaggar plain, 0.85 meters per year in Bhakra command, and
                0.64 meters per year in Gang CCAs.[52] As a result of rise in water tables, 145,600 hectares has turned critical
                (water table within six meters of land surface). A far more serious problem is anticipated in stage-II of IGNP
                due to an underground hard substratum of gypsum within 10 meters of the surface, making about 34 percent
                of the gross command area or 120,500 hectares vulnerable to water logging.[53] Experts believe thousands of
                hectares of land will be submerged in 25 to 30 years.[54]

                Waterlogged areas suffer from drastic reduction in crop yields. Farmers temporarily shift to crops such
                as paddy; however abandon their lands after a year or two when even these crops are unable to sustain
                increasing water logging and salinity. The resulting employment loss is a serious socioeconomic challenge,
                while the degradation of limited water and land resources is an environmental threat.

                The problem has been addressed in parts of Chambal CCA by introducing subsurface drainage systems.
                However the problem still persists in the IGNP areas. Some mitigating efforts are underway, as in the IGNP
                area, by extending area under irrigation command and reducing quantity of water used, large-scale plantation
                and conjunctive use of surface and groundwater. These problems have also been observed in some of the
                medium and minor irrigation projects. As state surface water resources become scarcer due to rising demand
                and impact of climate change, there is a need to manage these resources more effectively, rather than losing
                them to water logging.

6	         Water Tariff
During 1991 to 2000, the Public Health and Engineering Department (PHED) spent three times its revenue to
meet the rising demand for drinking water. The revenue-expenditure gap has risen over the years. This has
been the story in most Indian cities, and some have taken steps to counter it. The Bangalore Water Supply and
Sewage Board (BWSSB) has revised rates by almost 20 percent every year since 1991 to enable operations on a
no loss no profit basis. Service agencies that have taken loans from financial institutions like the Housing Urban
Development Corporation (HUDCO) have also revised their rates. The Confederation of Indian Industries (CII)
has called for rate increases to meet operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses. Several urban infrastructure
projects have inbuilt conditions regarding commercialization of urban infrastructure projects to ensure no losses.
Rajasthan has also demonstrated some willingness to do this for projects under implementation. Tariff reform is
highlighted as an important goal in various planning and policy documents released by the state.

Water distribution today is an open system with no checks in place on withdrawals. Consumers at the tail end
of the network are often left with little or no water due to poor pressure, defeating the objective of equitable
distribution of water. Metering to discourage excessive consumption of water is a must. This would go hand-
in-hand with a tariff structure that covers O&M costs. Figure 17 shows the existing water tariff for domestic
consumers. This structure has been in place since 1998, which is not only outdated, but was inadequate even at
the time it was first introduced.[55] The result has been that consumers have developed a water is free mindset,
resulting in unscrupulous use of drinking water, resulting in water scarcity for populations in low-pressure areas.

    The recoveries have been far from adequate. Currently O&M costs of drinking water supply schemes are more
    than $185 million while revenue is about 20 percent of this. The power consumed alone costs three times revenue
    collection. The difference in per unit cost of water compared to user charges has led to a cycle of higher subsidies
    (estimated at 74 percent)[57] to consumers with higher consumption (and likely higher wastage).

    Lack of proper consumer metering means there is no basis for proper tariff.[58] This fact is clearly highlighted in
    appendix B which shows the tariff structure for all urban areas of Rajasthan, along with the basis for charges (metered
    or unmetered), across domestic, non-domestic and industrial use. While the data is dated, it is representative of
    the tariff structure in place currently. The urban centers of Rajasthan have a block tariff structure for domestic and
    non-domestic[59] connections.

    As part of PHED’s reform agenda, the minimum quantity of water required per person per day to meet basic needs,
    also called lifeline consumption, is being determined to arrive at tariff rationalization. Water will be treated as a social
    good up to lifeline consumption, and an economic good beyond this. Accordingly, tariffs will vary from affordable
    tariff up to lifeline (data from other states will be studied to establish this), full O&M costs recovery from this level to
    the next, recovery of O&M costs plus financing cost for higher consumption, and full cost with different premium rates
    as consumption increases. Minimum efficiencies will be factored in to determine tariffs under this model, and non-
    domestic and industrial users will pay a premium. The status of these proposed reforms remains unclear.

    [59] 	 Non-domestic tariffs are of two types: in some cities all non-domestic uses are combined together under one head “non-
           domestic”, while in other cities non-domestic uses are broken up into industrial, commercial and institutional uses. In yet other
           cities, industrial tariff has been separated while tariff for all the other non-domestic uses have been combined together.

         6.1	     Price Gap
         The price gap is the difference between supply costs and actual price charged. The difference between the
         O&M costs and the revenue from user charges is also used, since recovering O&M charges alone constitutes
         an efficiency indicator in most developing countries. This study considers the difference between O&M costs
         and tariffs charged as the price gap for irrigation water supply. For drinking water supply and sanitation, costs
         include bulk production, treatment and distribution charges.

         The O&M costs for surface irrigation are about Indian rupees 642 per hectare ($12) while irrigation tariffs
         range between Indian rupees 75 and 290 per hectare ($1.4 and $5.35) depending on the crop and its
         water requirement (last revised in 1999). The price gap is more than Indian rupees 400 per hectare ($7.4),
         considering an average price of Indian rupees 200 per hectare ($3.7).

         In the case of drinking water and sanitation, the gap ranges between 55 percent in Kota and 89 percent in
         Udaipur (see figure 18). Supply costs depend mainly on the source of water supply. Recoveries are less than
         10 percent in the case of major and medium irrigation and rural water supply, while urban water supply and
         minor irrigation recoveries are higher, though still less than 40 percent (figure 19).

         Only 1.5 to 2 percent budget is available for O&M costs of water supply schemes, against 6 percent
         capital costs. Present allocations within O&M are also inadequate, since a substantial share goes towards
         establishment and power charges. For instance, in the case of irrigation systems only 20 percent of O&M
         costs are allocated towards maintaining distribution, and another 15 percent towards managing drainage
         systems in the case of large schemes. In the case of urban water supply, more than 90 percent of O&M goes
         towards power charges and salaries. Such depressed recoveries are unable to sustain service to users, nor
         can water assets be maintained to ensure efficient use of the limited water resources.

7	         Agriculture-Water Nexus
Rajasthan is a predominantly agrarian state. Around 70 percent of the state’s labor force is engaged
in agriculture and allied activities, including 13.17 million cultivators, 2.53 million agricultural laborers,
and 0.6 million workforce.[60] In economic terms, the sector contributes roughly 22 percent to the state
domestic product. According to the land use figures of 2010-11,[61] of the 34.3 million hectares total
land area in the state, 53.54 percent was the net sown area (NSA) or cultivable land, 12.35 percent
was cultivable waste, 8.65 percent fallow, 8 percent forest, 4.95 percent pastures/grazing, 6.94 percent
barren/uncultivable land, 5.51 percent was put to non-agricultural use, and 0.06 percent was land
under miscellaneous crops/trees not included in the NSA. The average land holding size in the state is
3.96 hectares, compared to 1.41 hectares nationally.

Even though agriculture currently uses 83 per cent of total water resources of the state, in 2010-11 only
36.3 percent or 6.66 million hectares was irrigated of the 18.34 million hectares of NSA. Thus, around
70 percent of agriculture in the state is primarily rain-fed. Of the irrigated land area, a massive 73 percent
is dependent on groundwater (wells and tube-wells), while the remaining is almost entirely dependent
on canal irrigation (about 25 percent of all sources), vulnerable to ill-timed water supply based on
inflow in rivers, dams and reservoirs, that causes critical gaps in irrigating crop growth stages. Due to
rising demand for water for both agriculture and non-agriculture purposes, share of water available for
agriculture is set to reduce to 70 percent by 2050[62]. This will have serious implications for agriculture in
the state.

With 18.7 percent of the country’s livestock population, the state contributes 11 percent of the national
milk production, 40 percent of meat, and 42 percent of wool. After agriculture, animal husbandry is the
next most important rural activity, contributing 11 percent to the state net gross domestic product. It
is noteworthy that small/marginal farmers, agricultural laborers and families living below the poverty
line mainly carry out animal husbandry. In western Rajasthan, nearly two-thirds of the population is
engaged in livestock rearing and allied activities. In rural areas, income from livestock ranges from
30 to 50 percent of household income.

               There are ten agro-climatic zones in the state (figure 20). The gross sown area (GSA) in 2010-11 was
               26 million hectares. NSA was 18.34 million hectares. This means 7.65 million hectares or 31.7 percent of
               NSA was cultivated more than once. Cropping pattern refers to the proportionate area under different
               crops during an agricultural year. Mono cropping is predominant in almost all zones. About 63 percent of
               total cultivation is taken up during the kharif season[63]. Cereals and pulses constitute food grain crops.
               Millet (bajra) during kharif and wheat during the rabi[64] are the major food grain crops grown in the state.
               Rajasthan produces 5.49 percent of the nation’s food grain and 21.31 percent of its oil seeds. Non-food
               crops constitute oilseeds, fibers, tobacco, dyes, and fodder.

               Of the total irrigated area, 35.79 percent is under wheat, 23.65 percent under rape seed and mustard, and
               5.8 percent under grams. Rajasthan practices legume-wheat based cropping system. Soybean-wheat
               cropping pattern is dominant in the southeastern region (Kota, Bundi, Baran, Jhalawar, Chittorgarh,
               Banswara and others). Other cropping patterns are pearl millet-wheat (Tonk, Banswara), pearl millet-
               mustard, and maize-wheat (eastern Rajasthan). Yields tend to be low in the state. The average production
               of wheat in the state (2010-11) is 3,433 kg/hectare, sorghum (jowar) is 700 kg/hectare, and gram is
               898 kg/hectare. Figure 21 is a map of the crops grown in various regions of Rajasthan. It is interesting to
               compare this to appendix C that shows the state’s agro climatic zones.

         The mapping of most suitable crops for an agro climatic zone, compared to current cropping patterns
         would be an important exercise to work out the ‘best crop per drop’ and help bridge the supply-demand
         gap for water in the state. Appendix C charts the climatic, rainfall, and soil conditions in the state prevalent
         in each of the ten agro climate zones, vis-à-vis the primary kharif and rabi cropping pattern currently
         followed by the districts that fall under these zones.

         Several factors influence a farmer’s decision on what to grow. One of the important factors is the
         availability of irrigation. Non-optimal crops such as sugarcane, which require three times more water than
         wheat and rice put together, and cotton are grown in areas where there is a sense of water abundance
         (canal command areas). Other farmers grow crops like sorghum (also fed to livestock) since this is the
         staple diet in some arid and semi-arid regions. Additional factors include power tariffs, which greatly
         influences irrigation levels; the guaranteed purchasing scheme through government support prices,
         which keeps pricing for certain crops artificially high; and agricultural subsidies and protection. Any
         attempt to change crop patterns will have to consider all these factors to ensure farmer buy in.

               In addition to the main crops being grown in various parts of Rajasthan, it is important to understand the
               overall cropping pattern in the state. Comparing the GSA to the irrigated area is also interesting (figures 22
               and 23). Pulses seem to be particularly good ‘crop per drop’ candidates, supporting a school of thought put
               forward by some that Rajasthan could become the pulse bowl of the country[65].

           The story of irrigation in India began after independence, from ambitious projects to bring Himalayan
           waters hundreds of kilometers down to desert plains. Irrigated agriculture contributes more than 50
           percent of agricultural output. Understanding where the 83 percent water being used for agriculture in
           the state is coming from is the beginning of the solution finding process. Unscrupulous over pumping
           of groundwater for agriculture, faster than it can be replenished, has led to unsustainable irrigation
           practices. With recurrent droughts on one hand, and current rates of groundwater exploitation on the
           other, the chances of naturally replenishing the water table are very grim. In 2005, an expert committee[66]
           made two important observations: population in the state was expected to almost double to 100 million
           by 2050, and, due to this population growth, water used for irrigation would need to be reduced from
           83 percent to 70 percent by 2050. The only solution is to regulate groundwater demand, especially for
           agriculture on a priority basis[67].

           In 1956-57, net irrigated area (NIA) was 1.4 million hectares, with canals providing 20 percent and tube-
           wells and wells providing 65 percent of water. In 2010-11, NIA had jumped to 6.66 million hectares. The
           broad breakdown of the four major sources of irrigation in Rajasthan today – canals, tube-wells, open
           wells and tanks – is given in figure 24. Today, 73 percent of irrigation is through tube-wells and wells
           placing enormous stress on groundwater. It is particularly alarming that share of tube-wells over the
           last four decades has shot up from 1 percent in 1967-68 to 39 percent! Although tube wells were first
           introduced by the British in the late 1800s[68], they did not dominate groundwater supply until after they
           were promoted in the 1960s-70s green revolution development programs. The numbers of private wells
           with their owners’ ‘right’ to pump groundwater is significant and continuing to rise. Only 3.3 percent of
           the 1.4 million irrigation wells accounted for today are government owned. As wells run dry in some parts,
           new ones are dug elsewhere. In 2010-11, 12,480 irrigation wells went dry, 7,609 were added while 22,889
           were repaired. Figure 25 provides additional details of NIA by source, while figure 26 shows irrigation
           sources in absolute number terms.

              Canals provide around 25 percent of irrigation in the state. Rajasthan’s canal systems, their distribution
              network, history, ongoing irrigation projects, maintenance of existing assets, and programs to bring more
              areas under canal command areas (CCA) is detailed in the section 7.2.1 of this report. Canals are being used
              for drinking water supply, and in some cases are the only perennial sources of water. Canal irrigation divides
              the state into pockets of relatively higher agricultural viability compared to groundwater-irrigated areas, which
              face rapid depletion of water tables and water quality issues. Water-surplus command areas with unregulated
              water supply leads to a commonly seen phenomenon where farmers generally grow water-intensive crops
              such as sugarcane. Sriganganagar district, which is at the top of the NIA list with 0.57 million hectares, is a
              good example. A general analysis of crop-area based irrigation water prices prevailing in other parts of the
              country (pricing in various parts of Rajasthan needs to be evaluated further), showed that the area-based
              prices do not reflect the irrigation water requirement of the crop. This could mean that the irrigation water
              charge per unit volume of water is lowest for water-intensive crops[69].

               Irrigation in Rajasthan is plagued by quality problems, not only because of greater dependence on
               groundwater but also due to improper maintenance of surface systems. In most regions, groundwater is
               saline and farmers use it for irrigation. This practice can sometime lead to long-term damage to cultivable
               land and reversing this is tedious and time consuming. Large tracts of land under surface irrigation are
               water logged and saline. This is mainly because flood irrigation is not suitable for sandy and sandy-loam
               soils. Another reason is seepage from the canal systems. The quality of irrigation infrastructure, especially
               the distribution system, is poor and losses are in the range of 60 percent. Often these canals are either
               not fully lined or have poor quality lining. Systems are not maintained resulting in wastage and water
               logging in head reach areas and water scarcity at the tail ends.

               There is growing concern about conflicts between upstream and downstream water users, or between
               users of existing irrigation systems and new water harvesting structures in upstream catchment areas.
               This is resulting in downstream regions receiving lower flows and well recharge due to the construction of
               water harvesting structures in the upstream regions[70]. There is concern that these structures may reduce
               the reservoir inflows of large irrigation systems. There are no institutional mechanisms in place to address
               or resolve these conflicts.

               The most important canal system, Indira Gandhi Nehar Pariyojna (IGNP), has had its share of issues due
               to water shortages. According to the 1981 agreement signed between Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana,
               Rajasthan is supposed to receive about 10.61 BCM (the state receives its water from the Pong Dam in
               Punjab), but receives only about 9.87 BCM. Rajasthan irrigation officials argue[71] that farmers in phase
               I region (Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh, and Bikaner) are accustomed to a constant supply of water.
               Now, with phase II in place, they get comparatively less. Additionally, Punjab is releasing less water. The
               farmers in phase I claim that they need 5.23 cusecs of water for around 400 hectares (about 12,795 cubic
               meters per day). However, meeting these demands would mean that the phase II area (Jaisalmer and
               Barmer districts) is left out. The state government has decreased water release from the Indira Gandhi
               Canal to 3.25 cusecs (7,951 cubic meters per 400 hectares), which has not been well received by farmers
               in phase I. This has caused repeated agitations by farmers.

               The state’s estimated irrigation potential is 5.1 million hectares, of which 3.1 million hectares is already
               achieved. This gap of two million hectares cannot be further addressed by groundwater, which is fully
               exploited. Most canal water is available only for drinking water use. Hence it is clear the key to feeding an
               ever increasing population is to adopt better cropping practices and increase irrigation efficiency.

           While specific data for Rajasthan needs to be collected, institutions that have evolved elsewhere in
           the country around the use of groundwater, such as tube well companies and groundwater irrigation
           cooperatives, provide significant future opportunities for large-scale adoption of new water-saving
           technologies (WSTs) through joint ventures. This is due to the socioeconomic benefits found in such shared
           situations[72]. Costs could be significantly brought down as additional cost of new equipment can be shared
           among the large number of farmers who will benefit from it.

           The factors that increase the socioeconomic feasibility of new WSTs in these joint ventures are:[73]

           ¬¬      The operational rules of these irrigation organizations are based on principles of equity, and all farmer
                   members strictly follow these rules.




[72]	 Although the technical feasibility of conventional WSTs is very low in such situations because, as members of the venture that
      jointly owns the water source, or as individual farmers who purchase water from these joint ventures, members are supplied
      water through underground pipes with very low pressure (head). This poses a limitation since conventional drip and sprinkler
      systems require considerable pressure to run.

                                                                            57                                          FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INTERVENTIONS
               ¬¬    There is a great deal of transparency and accountability in the transactions, including water allocation,
                     payment and collection of water charges, operation and maintenance works, and account keeping.

               ¬¬    The groups are already conversant with the operation of well systems, so the confidence to run advanced
                     water saving irrigation systems is likely to be very high.

               ¬¬    These groups can invest in overhead tanks and distribution systems, from which water can be directly
                     taken to the irrigation devices. Such interventions could also help expand area under irrigation, even under
                     restricted power supply.

               According to some national surveys[74], the basins where water-saving technologies (WSTs) could result
               in enhanced basin level water productivity include west flowing rivers north of Tapi (the river basins of
               Saurashtra, Kutch and Luni in Rajasthan). The enhancement in water productivity due to use of WSTs would
               come from two factors: one, reduction in the amount of water depletion (since these regions have many
               crops with high non-beneficial evaporation and also face deep percolation), and, two, rising yield of crops
               grown in these basins. The semi-arid, hard rock areas provide a favorable environment for adoption of micro
               irrigation systems owing to limited groundwater potential, the dominance of well irrigation, and dominance of
               responsive crops. At the same time, there would be real saving in water due to depleting groundwater tables.

7.2.1.1	     Indira Gandhi Canal Project

The Indira Gandhi Canal Project (IGNP) is one of the biggest canal projects in India. It is also
regarded as one of the world’s biggest projects of its kind in a desert ecosystem. This herculean
task of bringing water from the Himalayas to the Thar Desert aims at transforming vast stretches
of the western desert terrain into cropland, and was originally conceived in 1948. The project
started a decade later in 1958 but irrigation in part of the area was initiated only in October 1961.
Earlier known as Rajasthan Canal, the name was changed in 1984.

IGNP was designed to use 9,367 MCM/year of the total 10,608 MCM/year allocated to Rajasthan
from the surplus waters of the Ravi and Beas rivers. The canal starts from the Harike Barrage at
Sultanpur, a few kilometers below the confluence of the Sutlej and Beas rivers in Punjab state.
The canal runs south by southwest in Punjab and Haryana but mainly in Rajasthan for a total of
650 km and ends at Ramgarh near Jaisalmer in Rajasthan (see figure 27). It uses water released
from the Pong dam (located at Pong across the River Beas in Kangra district of Himachal
Pradesh) and provides irrigation to the northwestern region of Rajasthan. The IGNP traverses
seven districts of Rajasthan: Barmer, Bikaner, Churu, Hanumangarh, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, and
Sriganganagar.

For administrative construction convenience, the project was taken up in two stages:

Stage I: The entire system in this stage consists of the 204 km long Rajasthan feeder canal, 189
km long main canal and distribution system, it is concrete lined, and serves 553,000 hectares
command area through four pumping stations. The feeder canal has a head works discharge
capacity of 460 cubic meters per second. The first 167 km of the feeder canal lies in Punjab and
Haryana, and the remaining 37 km in Rajasthan.

Stage II: This consists of the downstream part of the main canal from the 189th kilometer till the
tail, and distribution systems. Work on lift schemes of Bikaner zone and flow area of Jaisalmer
zone is in progress.

According to the original plans, about 11 percent of the Thar Desert was to be irrigated after
completion of IGNP. Total CCA of the project as per estimates approved by the central water
commission (CWC) in 1996 was 1.96 million hectares; 0.55 million hectares under stage I, and
1.4 million under stage II. The Eleventh Five-Year Plan targeted 1.96 million hectares of CCA
for IGNP, but this was later reduced to 1.6 million hectares as less water was available. Canal
construction works were completed for 1.59 million hectares up to March 2012. An outlay of
$42.5 million is proposed for the current plan period of 2013-14, and 9,000 hectares of CCA will
be added by completing work on pumping stations of lift schemes.

                 7.2.1.2	      Bhakra Nangal System

                 According to the Indus Water Treaty concluded between India and Pakistan in 1960, three eastern
                 rivers namely Sutlej, Beas and Ravi came to the exclusive share of India. The Bhakra Nangal and
                 Beas projects were originally the joint ventures of the erstwhile states of Punjab and Rajasthan.
                 Project construction was taken up in 1948 for uplifting the northern region, and was completed
                 in 1963. Sutlej waters were distributed between Punjab and Rajasthan as per the Bhakra Nangal
                 Agreement 1959 with Rajasthan’s entitlement at 15.22 percent.

                 The Bhakra Nangal system is a complex system of several dams, reservoirs, inter-basin transfer
                 linkages, powerhouses and a vast canal network. The Bhakra Dam is a majestic achievement
                 constructed across the Sutlej and controls its water for irrigation and power. It is 740 feet high, the
                 highest concrete gravity dam in Asia and second highest in the world. Forty-nine percent of the
                 project’s canal command area (CCA) is in Haryana, 35 percent in Punjab, and 16 percent Rajasthan.

             In Rajasthan, this translates to 372,000 hectares or 1.45 percent of state’s cultivable area, served
             by the 1,219 km long Bhakra-Sirhind canal distribution system. Only two districts of Sriganganagar
             and Hanumangar are covered by the project (figures 27 and 28). The Bhakra channels of Rajasthan
             are perennial and are supplied 2,562 cusecs water through five contact points (the flows vary every
             year and so does the actual irrigated area). Of these points, one contact point is via Punjab, while all
             others are via Haryana (together contributing a discharge of 950 cusecs).


             7.2.1.3	      Bikaner / Gang Canal

             The 114 km-long Gang Canal was the first to come into existence and became fully operational
             in 1928, with a 1,251 km long distribution system to serve Sri Ganganagar district. Along with the
             Bikaner feeder, it provides water to a command area of 300,000 hectares with 65 percent intensity
             (figure 29).

                     The Gang Canal was constructed as a part of the Sutlej Valley Project that was undertaken
                     jointly by the Government of Punjab, the State of Bhawalpur and the State of Bikaner. The
                     authorized full supply discharge of the Gang Canal was kept to 2,144 cusecs. Soon after
                     construction of the canal was started, it was felt that additional water would be available during
                     the kharif season and so two non-perennial channels were added. The authorized full supply
                     discharge of the canal was increased to 2,720 cusecs. In 1960, the Indo-Pakistan treaty came
                     into force according to which, Pakistan’s share to be delivered below Ferozepur included the
                     Sutlej component. The Gang Canal was therefore reduced to its pre-partition allocation.

                     The canal’s pre-partition share is 1.11 million acre-feet (MAF) annually. As per the 1981
                     agreement, Rajasthan is entitled to use 8.0 MAF of surplus Ravi-Beas waters, against its full
                     share of 8.60 MAF. Now Rajasthan is in a position to use its full share, the matter has been
                     taken up with the authorities[75].

                     The canal system has deteriorated over the years. A modernization project was started in
                     2011-12 for the lining of the Bikaner Canal in Punjab and the portion of the canal system
                     running in Rajasthan. The current annual plan (2013-14) has allocated $9.5 million for the
                     construction of lined water courses in 35,000 hectares.




    [75]	 In 1966, state of Haryana was formed out of Punjab. To redistribute the share of Ravi-Beas waters allocated to
          erstwhile state of Punjab (originally shared under the 1955 agreement), an agreement was signed by the states of
          Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana on 31 December 1981. Accordingly Rajasthan's share was fixed as 8.6 MAF or
          52.7 percent of the surplus f lows. However at the time, IGNP was in its initial stages and Rajasthan was not in
          a position to use more than 8 MAF. It was agreed for Punjab to use the surplus until such time when Rajasthan
          could use its full share. Rajasthan is in a position since past many years to utilize its entire share due to
          extensive development of IGNP. Despite this, Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) is still giving Rajasthan
          an allocation of 8 MAF or 49 percent. Rajasthan has repeatedly submitted its representation to the central
          government, and BBMB and Punjab to restore its remaining share of 0.60 MAF. Source - Compendium of Issues

                The Chambal Valley Development Scheme is a joint venture between the governments of Madhya Pradesh
                and Rajasthan. The purpose of the scheme was to generate hydroelectric power and to supply water for
                irrigation. Project construction began in 1953 and water for irrigation by canals was made available in
                1960, although the construction of stage III was completed in 1971.

                Waters of the River Chambal has been harnessed in three phases:

                ¬¬   Gandhi Sagar Dam, Kota Barrage, Chambal right main canal (RMC) and Chambal left main canal (LMC)

                ¬¬   Rana Pratap Sagar Dam between Gandhi Sagar and Kota Barrage

                ¬¬   Jawahar Sagar Dam

                Chambal command area in Rajasthan is spread over six panchayat samitis (groups of villages) in Kota,
                Bundi and Baran districts, and is centered at Kota city (figure 30). The net command area in the state is
                230,000 hectares. There are two main canals starting from the Kota Barrage:

                ¬¬   The RMC is 372 km long, with 124 km in Rajasthan (Kota and Baran districts). The water carrying
                     capacity of the RMC is 6,656 cusecs, and the distribution system covers 1,376 km. The RMC consists of
                     seven branches, 27 distributaries and minors.

                ¬¬   The LMC is 2.59 km before dividing into the Bundi and Kapren Branch Canals. Three branches,
                     27 distributaries and 180 minors of the LMC irrigate 102,000 hectares in Kota and Bundi districts. LMC
                     is designed to carry water at the rate of 1,500 cusecs.

                A project costing $235 million to renovate the entire irrigation system for the benefit of tail users is
                underway. The current annual plan (2013-14) has an outlay of $22 million for this.

8	        Policies and Private Sector in Water
In the decade starting 1990, India witnessed significant economic policy reform – liberalization. The states as
administrative entities need to develop a competitive edge to attract investments for sustainable development, and
reduce dependence on the national exchequer. Apart from key focus areas such as roads, power, tourism, and
infrastructure, Rajasthan has also opened social sectors such as health, education, drinking water, and housing for
private sector investment.

A number of initiatives have been taken up in India to accelerate the pace of investment in infrastructure, including
inviting investment through public-private partnerships (PPP). The investment sought from the private sector has
steadily increased from 21.76 percent during the Tenth Five-Year Plan, to 37.20 percent during the Eleventh Plan,
to 48.19 percent or $498.69 billion in the Twelfth Plan. The Government of India has started a viability gap funding
(VGF) scheme that enables PPP projects in the states to get central assistance of up to 20 percent of project
costs. The India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) was set up to provide these long-term loans. The
IIFCL raises funds against sovereign guarantees. The India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) has
been created to support the development of bankable PPP projects. The Government of India has also issued
model request for proposal documents for the selection of technical consultants, financial consultants, legal and
transaction advisers.

To facilitate the role of PPP in creating new infrastructure assets and managing existing assets, Government of
Rajasthan issued guidelines for PPPs in May 2012. The guidelines define PPP as an “arrangement between a
government or statutory entity or government owned entity on one side and a private sector entity on the other, for
the provision of public assets and/or related services for public benefit, through investments being made by and/ or
management undertaken by the private sector entity for a specified period of time, where there is a substantial risk
sharing with the private sector and the private sector receives performance linked payments that conform (or are
benchmarked) to specified, pre-determined and measurable performance standards.”[76]

The state government has taken several specific steps to set up a framework for private sector participation, the
most important steps, and other enabling developments are:

          ¬¬    Three-tier institutional arrangement comprising empowered committee on infrastructure development
                (ECID) as the approving committee; PPP cell as the nodal agency; and the concerned administrative
                department/agency as the implementing agency. All PPP projects require approval of the ECID,
                constituted under the chairmanship of the chief secretary. The PPP cell, with principal secretary
                (planning) as its nodal officer, coordinates efforts of the government in pursuing PPPs, and it is supported
                by technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

          ¬¬    The Rajasthan Infrastructure Project Development Fund (RIPDF), with a corpus of $4.59 million managed
                by the planning department, is set up to meet expenses related to feasibility studies for developing
                identified projects. This is interest free financial assistance, to be recovered along with a success fee of
                up to 40 percent of funding. In case of revenue generating PPP projects, the advance plus 40 percent of
                advance is to be recovered from the successful private partner on award of the project.

                     administrative departments and autonomous organizations under the state government and local
                     bodies are eligible for social sector infrastructure and services supported under the scheme.

               ¬¬    A dedicated project development company, PDCOR Limited, has been set up as an equally
                     owned joint venture between Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited (IL&FS) and
                     the Government of Rajasthan. PDCOR’s primary mandate is to structure and attract private sector
                     investment to various infrastructure projects in the state.

               ¬¬    Rajasthan is one of the states selected under the National PPP Capacity Building Program
                     (NPCBP) launched by Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) in 2010 with support of KfW (German
                     Development Bank) and World Bank. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) has been signed with
                     the India PPP Capacity Building Trust (I-Cap), appointed by the DEA as the project executing agency
                     for the program. Eight officers from the state have completed the training of trainers (ToT) under the
                     program to help government staff at various levels conceptualize, structure, award, implement, and
                     monitor PPP projects.

               ¬¬    An Infrastructure Development Act has been drafted. The draft act provides a legislative framework
                     for private participation in the state’s infrastructure development by defining the legal basis for grant
                     of concessions to private parties. The draft is under consideration and subsequently will be placed
                     before the state assembly for approval[77]. Meanwhile, draft public-private partnership guidelines have
                     also been prepared.

               8.1	        Water Policy
               The National Water Policy (NWP) was first adopted in September 1987, then revised in April 2002,
               and most recently revised and adopted in December 2012 at the sixth meeting of the National Water
               Resources Council. Recently the NWP 2012 document was formally released at the India Water Week[78].

               Section 12.3 of the NWP 2012 states, “Water resources projects and services should be managed with
               community participation. For improved service delivery on sustainable basis, the state governments/
               urban local bodies may associate private sector in public private partnership mode with penalties for
               failure, under regulatory control on prices charged and service standards with full accountability to
               democratically elected local bodies.”

               More directly encouraging language on private sector participation in the water sector from section 13
               of the previous (2002) version of the draft states, “Private sector participation should be encouraged
               in planning, development, and management of water resources projects for diverse uses, wherever
               feasible. Private sector participation may help in introducing innovative ideas, generating financial

                                                                                                                          SECTOR IN WATER




           While the policy is a set of guidelines that the states are not obligated to follow, many states have
           expressed concern over the overarching nature of the proposed National Water Framework Law, and the
           law on river basin management as drafted in the policy. Other reservations on the policy include water
           tariff system, statutory empowerment of water users associations, pricing of electricity, and establishment
           of a water regulatory authority.

           In the past, Rajasthan has brought out water policy documents after NWP documents were released,
           and most of these simply mirrored the NWP. This started to change in 2003 when the state made an
           effort to include state specific issues. The current state water policy (SWP) draft issued in February 2009
           goes further in outlining policy direction on the basis of integrated water resource management (IWRM)
           principles to address mounting pressure on the state’s rapidly deteriorating water resources. This draft
           was subsequently adopted by the government as the SWP in February 2010.


           8.2	        State Water Policy on Private Sector Role
           The SWP[79] under its water resources development and management objectives speaks of “facilitating
           private initiative in development, operation and management of water projects.” As part of institutional
           reforms, the SWP seeks to “encourage private initiative in water sector.” And finally, as part of legislative
           and regulatory reforms, the need to “establish rules/regulations for private sector involvement in
           development and operation of water related projects” finds mention in the SWP.

           Separately, there is a proposal under review by PHED for introduction of PPP in the drinking water sector.
           This is in conjunction with a reform agenda for PHED itself (section 4.3). In introducing this proposal,
           PHED acknowledges the current inefficiencies in the construction and management of water supply
           schemes, and highlights potential benefits from private sector involvement especially in distribution
           systems to end users in urban areas.


           8.3	        PHED Proposal for PPP in Water Sector
           As part of its reform agenda, the state government intends to involve private sector through PPP. The
           PHED website states the reason for this as, “To utilize new technology, professionalism, share risks and
           gain, access to private capital, to improve operating efficiency, and, ultimately, make the sector more
           responsive to consumer needs[80].” The proposal has been under consideration, although latest status is
           unclear. A sample performance parameter sheet, put together by PHED that could be adopted for PPP
           projects for urban distribution systems can be viewed in appendix D of this report.


           8.4	        Projects under PPP
           Involvement of the private sector in water supply is not very common across India. The private sector
           has been involved mainly in the operation and maintenance of pipelines, treatment plants, tube-wells,
           and pumping stations. In certain cases, the sector is also involved in billing and revenue collection.

                                                                         67                                      FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INTERVENTIONS
               Contracting has been the main mode of privatization. According to one national study[81], most cities in India
               have been able to compute the cost of an outsourced activity only after privatization, which is the actual
               payment made to the contractor. Very few have calculated the cost of an activity before that activity was
               privatized. This could indicate that privatization in these cities was undertaken, not as a measure of economy
               and efficiency, but for other reasons. In the study, covering 300 metropolitan and class I cities across India,
               only 24 urban centers had used the private sector for activities related to water supply. One-third, that is, eight
               of these urban centers were in Rajasthan. The report found that private sector participation in the water supply
               sector had been going on since 1989, although most cities introduced it in 1992 or later.

               Given that several water transmission and distribution projects are pending resource allocation and
               subsequent implementation, the Government of Rajasthan is inclined to explore annuity-based and other
               appropriate PPP models in the water sector. No live examples of water supply projects involving true PPP
               in Rajasthan were found in the course of research and interviews for this report. The only project in the
               water sector said to be operational under PPP[82] in the state is a desalination plant of 20 million liters per
               day capacity commissioned at Nagaur on DBOOT (design, build, own, operate and transfer) basis with an
               investment of $55 million to supply 14 million liters of potable water per day to the state. The plant processes
               water with high TDS content coming out of a brackish aquifer at the lignite mines of Kasau and Matasukh in
               Nagaur district. The Bhavnagar-based Central Salt and Marine Chemical Research Institute (CSMCRI) has
               used membrane technology in this reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant.

               While improving efficiencies are sometimes stated as reasons, most discussions to involve private players
               currently stem from a need to augment government funding. Given that these are only early stages, we
               can expect such ambiguity. Pilot projects/studies are being undertaken to justify private participation and
               investment in the water sector[83]. Project development and structuring for certain water supply projects have
               been initiated: water supply to the towns of Ajmer and Udaipur at the cost of $275 million and $145 million,
               respectively; and two pilot projects with focus on reducing non-revenue water supply in Jaipur (Mansarovar)
               and Kota at the cost of $4.6 million and $2.75 million, respectively. These four projects seek assistance under
               the India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) scheme of the Government of India. Partial cost
               of project development is proposed to be met by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Technical consultants
               have already been engaged to prepare feasibility reports for the Ajmer and Udaipur projects.

           Apart from the above, the following projects[84] that have been proposed for external assistance to the
           Government of India could involve the private sector (although there is no official indication that any of
           these will involve PPP):

           ¬¬   Nagaur Lift Project, Phase II: A loan agreement has been signed with Japan International
                Cooperation Agency (JICA) on September 28, 2012 to provide a loan for Nagaur Lift Project Phase II
                costing $540 million.

           ¬¬   Jodhpur Urban Water Supply Scheme: Jodhpur town receives water from the Rajeev Gandhi
                Lift Canal. Raw water to meet demand till 2016 is available. A project is planned to augment and
                reorganize water supply. The estimated cost of the project is $101 million. A loan agreement for the
                project has been signed in February 2012 with a French funding agency.

           ¬¬   Chambal-Bhilwara Project: A $187 million proposal has been forwarded for assistance to the World
                Bank. The state government has approved design of system components that will supply 55 lpcd to
                rural areas, and plans to submit the revised proposal, incorporating cluster/village distribution work
                and sewerage system work for Bhilwara town.

Two other projects have also been proposed to the Government of India for external assistance: the Aapni
Yojana Phase II to cover 6 towns and 444 villages of Churu and Jhunjhunu districts, and the Barmer Lift Project
Phase II to cover 691 villages of Barmer District.

    9	          Water Institutions
    Rajasthan has its water problems, but it also has its fair share of water actors: non-governmental institutions
    (NGOs), foundations, research institutions, business associations, international agencies, financial institutions,
    private companies, and many others who have done, and continue to do phenomenal work in the water sector.
    While this list is by no means exhaustive, this chapter introduces readers to some of the most active and impact
    oriented water players and their work in Rajasthan. The listed stakeholders may or may not be based in the state,
    but the idea is to include those who contribute positively to the water crisis here[85]. Care has been taken to highlight
    players who could be potential partners for private sector driven initiatives in the state’s water sector.


                9.1	        NGOs, Foundations, Organizations and Institutions
                The NGOs listed below have water as their primary focus. The trend is to focus on traditional rainwater
                harvesting (RWH) techniques and structures as a sustainable solution in rural areas of Rajasthan. The
                challenge in adopting these solutions is the fractured nature of communities, a result of decades of
                overdependence on government promises of water. The work that is being done involves re-imparting
                best practices to the current generation, and building capacities so it can once again manage these off-
                grid drinking water and irrigation methods. The other highlight is the NGOs’ roles in renewing community
                interest in water policies, so that advocacy can help bring much needed water sector reform.


                      9.1.1	             Jal Bhagirathi Foundation
                      The Jal Bhagirathi Foundation (JBF) works in more than 200 villages, in the Marwar region (Thar
                      Desert) of western Rajasthan. Its focus is on construction and restoration of traditional water
                      harvesting structures and capacity building with ‘jal sabhas’ or water committees. It has initiated an
                      advocacy campaign to reform water sector policies. JBF regularly works with United Nations bodies
                      and other international agencies as partners.

                      Among other key initiatives[86], JBF is implementing a project named ‘Poverty Reduction of Desert
                      Communities in the Dry Lands of Western Rajasthan through Integrated Community-based Water
                      Resource Management’. This will focus on reducing vulnerability of the poor in water-scarce Marwar
                      region. The initiative is co-financed by the European Union (EU). It will benefit 80 villages of Barmer,
                      Jalore and Jaisalmer districts in the Marwar region, reaching a population of 100,000. Its overall
                      budget is $1.4 million, 90 percent is EU’s contribution.

                      JBF helped implement an important public private community partnership (PPCP) project, named
                      Paniharan Pariyojna, to provide safe drinking water to a community suffering from high incidence
                      of water-borne diseases in Pachpadra in Barmer district and, as part of the project, also provided
                      livelihood in water-scarce desert communities. A private company, M/s Environze Global Ltd, helped




    [85]	 It must be noted, while many international/multilateral agencies are very active in the water space in Rajasthan (as also
          evident by the various references to these as partners in following sections of this chapter, and throughout this report), all
          these have not been separately outlined in this chapter. This is because the list would not only be too long to serve much
          purpose in the context of this report, but also because it is assumed their work is generally known by IFC (due to their
          association with the World Bank, and others worldwide). If not, information on these can be easily looked up.

set up a community-owned reverse osmosis (RO) plant to filter raw water of 4,500 ppm TDS to less
than 300 ppm. Other partners were the local gram panchayat (village body) and Government of
Rajasthan. UNDP, Italian Development Cooperation, Acumen Fund and IDEO supported the program.
Household outlets were owned/managed by women from self-help groups (SHG). Four women
entrepreneurs earn up to Indian rupees 4,000 per month ($75), spending three to four hours a day
working, translating into a potential of generating annual income of $147,000 for women in the poor
region of Marwar (extrapolated for 10 percent of villages in the region).


9.1.2	       Tarun Bharat Sangh
Tarun Bharat Sangh (TBS) is a voluntary organization based in Alwar District in Rajasthan. Established
in Jaipur in 1975 by a group of professors and students from the University of Rajasthan, it works
in villages of the semi-arid region along the foothills and main ranges of the Aravalis, including the
Sariska National Park. TBS has built 4,500 johads (earthen check dams) in 1,050 villages, regenerating
6,500 square kilometers of land. It has restored over 10,000 rainwater harvesting structures in 25
years, recharging wells/aquifers and revived five rivulets (Ruparel, Aravari, Sarsa, Bhagani and
Jhajwali) in Alwar, Dosa and Jaipur districts that had been dry for years. The benefits to communities
are increased agriculture production, reversal of migration, reduction in women’s drudgery, and high
fodder availability, which has helped milk production/sale through informal cooperative arrangements.
TBS has formed Rashtriya Jal Biradari (National Water Community), a network of farmer groups,
NGOs, research institutions, and water experts. Other activities include the National Water Awareness
Campaign (Rashtriya Jal Chetna Yatra) to help reform NWP and Tarun Jal Vidyapeeth (Water School)
to build capacities within organizations and individuals in the field of water conservation. TBS is
supported by the United Nations, USAID, and the World Bank.

                for Rural Development, was created in 1983 by a group of social activists. It works in six districts
                with over 50,000 desert families across 850 villages, reaching a population of over 1 million. It has
                established over 1,100 community-based organizations (CBOs) and focuses on community-based
                interventions to restore traditional water harvesting structures. GRAVIS is an implementation partner
                for an important poverty mitigation project of the Government of Rajasthan, funded by International
                Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and Sir Ratan Tata Trust (SRTT), named Mitigating Poverty
                in Western Rajasthan (MPOWER) for Jodhpur and Jaisalmer districts. GRAVIS has worked with a long
                list of national and international agencies including UNDP, and WHO.

                Financial institutions - non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), microfinance institutions (MFIs), and
                banks[92] - that support sustainable development activities in the water and/or agriculture sectors are the
                subject of this section. Self-help groups (SHGs) are effective vehicles for microfinance. In Rajasthan,
                there are an estimated 280,000 SHGs with an average membership of twelve, translating into 3.4 million
                members, or 40 percent rural families in the state, in effect representing 75 percent of total rural
                population living below the poverty line here[93]. NGOs too have supported a substantial number of SHG
                groups in the state and some of these have large microfinance programs.

                      MFIs started operating in the state around 2007 and by March 2010 MFIs had reached 800,000
                      clients with an outstanding credit of $97 million. The most noteworthy MFIs in the state are:

                      ¬¬    SKS Microfinance: Launched in 1998, SKS Microfinance is one of the fastest growing MFIs with
                            2,379 branches. In Rajasthan, it serves about 231,401 clients with a loan portfolio of $18 million
                            making it the biggest in the state. It operates at a 24.55 percent reducing rate of interest per
                            annum.

                      ¬¬    Pustikar: This is the second largest MFI in Rajasthan with a loan outstanding of $16.4 million.
                            Interest rate per annum is 15 percent for SHG loans and 17 percent for individuals, both on
                            reducing basis.

    10	        Market Dynamics

               10.1	 Market Failures
               Water is a common resource and hence subject to market failures. Except groundwater, all other water
               resources are developed and provided by the state. Even then, groundwater is still a state subject. This
               is because harnessing this resource for public consumption is the state’s responsibility, since around
               90 percent of drinking water is from groundwater. This leads to several market and system failures, both
               from the supply and user sides as elaborated below.


                     10.1.1	           Overexploitation of Groundwater
                     The draft act for groundwater legislation is in circulation (see section 2.2.1) and has been referred to
                     a legislative committee. While this seeks to regulate use of groundwater, the ability of the executive
                     and judicial system to actually enforce it remains to be seen. Other states - such as West Bengal,
                     Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh - that have sought to regulate groundwater have not met with
                     much success[95].

                     None of the acts, including the draft act in Rajasthan, address the issue of equity. Although cost of
                     water and power is subsidized, due to high capital expenditure only large and medium farmers can
                     afford to extract water. Small and marginal farmers are left out. Ironically, groundwater extraction
                     rights are given away to landowners by the Easement Act of 1882. At the same time, groundwater
                     is also termed as a common pool resource in policy discourse. The indiscriminate extraction of
                     groundwater has resulted in degradation of a resource beyond its regeneration capacity. If not
                     addressed, the looming water crisis can easily translate into a food crisis.

                  Except for certain regulations linked to institutional credit and groundwater, there are no concrete
                  policies to address problems surrounding groundwater, which supplies 90 percent of the state’s
                  drinking water and 74 percent of its irrigation water. Interestingly, the state seems willing to regulate
                  groundwater use by large private developers in peri-urban areas. Section 9.1.3 of the state water
                  policy (SWP)[96] says, “A legal framework will be developed for the regulation and management
                  of groundwater extraction in general and in ‘critical and overexploited’ zones in particular. Such
                  legislation will also address the need for compensatory water conservation and recharge measures
                  to be taken by bulk water consumers.” The actual implementation of the policy and its effectiveness
                  needs to be watched closely with current average groundwater utilization rates already over 100
                  percent, in other words beyond recharge capacity.


                  10.1.2	           The ‘Free’ Water Mentality
                  The present tariff structure needs to be looked at. Drinking water is subsidized up to 75 percent.
                  This barely covers 20 percent of operating and maintenance costs. This has led to a price gap of
                  90 percent in rural drinking water and medium/major irrigation, and 60 percent in urban drinking
                  water and minor irrigation. In most towns, bills are raised on the basis of average consumption since
                  an estimated 60 percent consumer meters are either not installed or are not working. This leads to
                  the ironic situation where the consumer who uses the most water receives maximum subsidy. Bulk
                  metering at source of supply is not available, so there is no foolproof method to trace the supply
                  channel from production to end-user. In this scenario, it is impossible to work out the true cost of
                  water delivery so that appropriate tariff structures can be put in place. Meanwhile, paying for water, in
                  the true sense, is a foreign idea for most[97]. This has led to a free water mentality, leading to reckless
                  misuse of water.

                  When it comes to irrigation, current water and energy policies actually subsidize inefficient use of
                  water, since there is no increased cost associated with more usage. This hinders adoption of water
                  saving technologies (WST). Pricing that is based on cropping area and not on type of crop planted
                  or volume of water consumed, does not provide incentive to adopt crop varieties that require less
                  water and give higher yield. Additionally, the flat rate system of pricing of electricity or actually giving
                  it away free for the farm sector does not provide incentive to use energy and water-efficient irrigation
                  technologies. Further, power supply restrictions for the farm sector limit expansion of area under
                  pressurized, energy-intensive micro irrigation (MI) systems.

                     10.1.3	          Broken Water Delivery
                     The inability to recover even operating and maintenance costs has placed a lot of pressure on the state’s
                     water infrastructure. Leakages in drinking water distribution systems cause a loss of 50 to 60 percent,
                     against a design norm of 15 percent. Tail end consumers are left with little water and low pressure.
                     Consumers use online boosters to draw more water, which does not improve the situation. The gaps
                     in supply are staggering, both in terms of frequency and volume. The same story is repeated in the
                     irrigation system where unlined canals cause water losses and lead to water logging, which further
                     aggravates the state’s salinity problem. In areas that are fully dependent on canal water, unscientific,
                     erratic water delivery schedules and inadequate control over volumetric supplies lead to farmers
                     resorting to flood irrigation and short duration varieties at the cost of crop yields.


                     10.1.4	          Lack of Institutional Capacity
                     Currently, government departments managing water supply systems, such as the PHED, are more suited
                     for creating distribution infrastructure rather than actually operating it. The State Water Policy (SWP)
                     acknowledges this limitation by proposing a shift away from an engineering-driven approach in favor
                     of a service-driven approach. Most water supply schemes are understaffed, sometimes by as much as
                     50 percent, and many do not have required skillsets. In several capital intensive drinking water schemes,
                     demand outstrips installed capacity even before a project is finished. The traditional top down approach
                     by water related departments has failed to mobilize community involvement in planning water projects.
                     Hence poor public buy-in, especially in rural drinking water schemes, results in lack of cooperation by
                     the public in helping to maintain water assets or pay for services. Policies around constructing rainwater
                     and storm water harvesting structures in certain types of building and road projects have largely
                     remained on paper. There is evidence of intent. The Twelfth Plan document, for instance, does talk about
                     measures such as better cropping practices in CCAs and adoption of micro irrigation. But, without the
                     institutional capability to enforce these measures, there is little chance they will be adopted. The overall
                     scenario has led to misuse of the state’s very limited water resources, lack of trust, and little credibility
                     for government run water supply schemes.


               10.2	 Market Needs
               While the most obvious market need is access to sustainable water supply, there are other very important
               between-the-lines issues that need urgent attention to make this possible while keeping in mind long-term
               sustainability of water resources and the communities impacted.


                     10.2.1	          Equitable Water Distribution
                     Subsidies towards irrigated water in India are not well targeted to the rural poor. The World Bank found
                     that up to 80 percent of subsidies in the country went to medium and large farmers[98]. Electric supply is
                     not metered and a flat tariff is charged, depending on the horsepower of the pump. This means farmers
                     can use as much power as they like with zero incremental costs, giving them little incentive to use power
                     or water more efficiently. The first to be affected by falling water tables are the rural poor and marginal

          Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh.

                  farmers who lack the means to deepen their wells and install more powerful pumps. A report[99] by the
                  planning commission suggests that it will be difficult for states to raise power tariffs for agricultural
                  users due to political reasons. While withdrawing subsidized power altogether may be politically
                  untenable, a potential compromise could see farmers receive an up front entitlement to a fixed
                  amount of power at an administered price, from which consumption charges would be deducted. The
                  report also points out that government support for micro irrigation techniques will help make water
                  use more sustainable. The situation with unjustified subsidies in drinking water has already been
                  discussed in various sections of this report. Part of the solution clearly lies in tariff reform, while fixing
                  water rights may be the other part.

                  Water resources - surface, groundwater, river basin or sub-surface aquifer- need to be treated as a
                  common pool resource, meaning effective abolition of riparian rights. Delinking water rights from land
                  rights would make groundwater a genuinely common resource, and start the process of recharging
                  overexploited aquifers through both natural processes and human effort. Institutional arrangements
                  need to be evolved to reduce conflicts in resource sharing. Regulation is not always the best answer
                  to ensure equity in distribution, or the cheapest. Communities need to be mobilized, awareness
                  needs to be created, and efforts made towards equitable distribution of water resources. This is a
                  long process and time is of essence, hence the need for a start from the policy end. As daunting
                  as the task seems, there have been examples within India (Pani Panchayat[100] in Maharashtra)
                  and abroad (South Africa and Mexico). In absence of equity, sooner or later, as water resources
                  become increasingly scarce, avoiding water conflicts of the kind already witnessed in the state[101]
                  will become more difficult. Left unchecked, such a situation can reach critical magnitude, surpassing
                  communities and spiral into regional and national chaos.


                  10.2.2	            Demand Management and Tariff Reform
                  Users just need access to safe, dependable water supply. To achieve this, our approach needs
                  to shift from merely meeting the supply-demand gap to managing demand itself. This should be
                  reflected in planning for all water related projects by the government. This can be achieved through
                  appropriate pricing of water and adopting technologies backed by legislation and institutional
                  support to ensure adoption. Often pricing policies are thwarted by lack of willingness to pay for basic
                  amenities. Contrary to general belief, there is evidence from Rajasthan that domestic and irrigation
                  water consumers are willing to pay substantially higher prices (double the present price) for improved

       cultivation, typically at the rate of half an acre per head, subject to a maximum of 2.5 acres per family. This translates

       to that effect was signed between the government and the Kisan Sangharsh Samiti (KSS). The farmers allege that the
       government has not kept its word.

                                                                              83                                             FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INTERVENTIONS
                      water supplies[102]. This is also highlighted by a World Bank survey[103], undertaken as part of the
                      Karnataka 24x7 Water Supply Project appraisal process, which indicated that people were willing
                      to pay more for a more dependable supply. However, there are bottlenecks to charging higher
                      prices. The government’s unwillingness to raise tariffs due to fear of a public backlash and due
                      to lack of confidence in being able to consistently deliver quality service is clearly an obstacle.
                      Currently, due to inadequate metering, consumers are not even aware of their consumption
                      levels. Therefore public resistance could be a temporary reaction while consumers first adjust
                      to their usage and start adopting better water conservation practices. However, increased tariffs
                      must go with a water delivery mechanism that consistently works and eliminates inefficiencies
                      such as transmission losses and theft of water, one of the main reasons for higher provision
                      costs. In order to be viable and long term, efficiency of any service needs to be supported by an
                      adequate and just pricing mechanism.

                      For agriculture, the ideal policy is to promote water-saving crop and irrigation technologies in
                      tube well-irrigated areas with pro-rata pricing of electricity. Many states face serious problems
                      in introducing consumption-based charges for power use. The government needs to start with
                      metering agricultural consumption. Cash incentives or subsidies can be given to farmers who
                      adopt water saving technologies and reduce electricity consumption. Subsidies can be linked to
                      connected electricity load or average energy consumed and area under water-saving irrigation
                      technology so that farmers who save more water and power per unit of area will get higher
                      subsidies. The price that truly works for domestic, agricultural, and industrial users needs to be
                      discovered. Till now, there has been no credible effort towards setting of tariffs, although it finds
                      increasing mention in various policy and other documents.


                      10.2.3	           Delivery Efficiency with Technology
                      Technology needs to be injected into the water supply systems. A fully functional and accurate
                      consumer metering system can limit drinking water wastage and enforce a tariff regime. Bulk
                      metering for all water sources such as reservoirs, canals, tube wells, and pumping stations
                      should go with consumer metering for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use. There is
                      willingness in the government to outsource supply, installation, and operation and maintenance
                      of consumer meters to achieve near complete coverage. Cost of meters and their maintenance
                      can be recovered by increasing meter rents, which are too is low and unsustainable at present.
                      PHED has proposed to outsource bulk metering project to an experienced firm with in-built
                      operation and maintenance, data capturing, storage, and reporting capabilities. An example
                      of technological revamp undertaken by the PHED is outsourcing of its project to phase out old
                      submersible pumps used in tube wells in favor of energy efficient new models.

                 On the irrigation front, the use of micro irrigation needs to be supported with capacity building to include:

                 ¬¬   Spreading awareness about the scope of micro irrigation since currently its role is misunderstood
                      to be limited to growing vegetables.
                 ¬¬   Financial support to help farmers buy equipment.
                 ¬¬   Power tariff reforms to incentivize farmers to use less water by using water saving technologies.
                 ¬¬   Timely and adequate surface water delivery in canal irrigated areas to make micro irrigation
                      devices effective.
                 ¬¬   Manufacturing best practices so that only equipment suited for a given land holding size is sold
                      at a fair price.
                 ¬¬   Efficient subsidy payouts by building capacity within relevant state departments.

                 In the absence of a well-planned and rigorous framework, despite government’s good intentions by way
                 of policy documents, annual plans, and heavy central and state subsidies (totaling to 70 to 90 percent),
                 adoption of relevant technologies by farmers will remain poor. Additionally legislation can help streamline
                 equipment supply by discouraging production of inefficient conventional devices.


                 10.2.4	          Groundwater Management
                 Groundwater mining in the state has surpassed recharge capabilities. In a state with 90 percent
                 dependence on groundwater, this will soon lead to a desperate situation. In many parts of the state
                 physical transportation of water is the only solution to meet drinking water needs, an unsustainable
                 practice even in the medium term. While there may be a gradual shift towards surface resources such
                 as canal systems to make drinking water schemes more dependable, this alone cannot be a solution.
                 Just the capital outlay and timelines required to execute surface water projects could mean continued
                 dependence on groundwater, at least in the medium term. Every effort to help recharge underground
                 aquifers needs to be made, including micro watershed planning and restoration of traditional water
                 bodies that lie scattered in disrepair all around the state. These bodies once sustained life in this harsh
                 terrain, but over-dependence on state-supported water schemes and the gradual decay of communities
                 that once supported these structures has created a desperate water situation in areas such as most of
                 western Rajasthan.

                 Analyzing the factors behind the exponential increase in groundwater use, a World Bank report[104] points
                 out that groundwater allows users more control over quantity and timing of supply. Thus, it is linked to
                 higher productivity. The crop to water productivity of groundwater-irrigated farms is almost twice that
                 of surface-water irrigated farms. Also, use of groundwater is a response to poor service delivery of

                                                                        85                                         FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INTERVENTIONS
                      surface water systems, as in urban water supply. The need to promote surface water schemes
                      to help groundwater conservation is clear. The need to educate farmers to voluntarily reduce
                      groundwater use and still safeguard their drinking water supply and crops is also clear. This is being
                      done in Andhra Pradesh where people who never went to school are today successful barefoot
                      hydro-geologists[105].

                      To restrict use of groundwater for irrigation, electricity to farmers should be metered and charged
                      appropriately instead of the heavily subsidized power tariff regime currently in place. Other
                      suggestions include giving upfront entitlements to farmers and allowing them to cash in unused
                      electricity[106], rationing electricity through separate lines for agricultural pumps, and restricting
                      supply to specific hours as is being done in Gujarat.


                      10.2.5	           Balancing Agri-Water Nexus
                      Since 83 percent of water is diverted to agriculture, the need to balance the agri-water nexus cannot
                      be overemphasized. Especially in the context of managing groundwater, which contributes 74
                      percent of water used in agriculture. While sustenance agriculture is a fact of life in many parts of
                      the state, and a necessity in the absence of economic alternatives, efforts to ensure that scarce
                      groundwater is not wasted are needed. Several initiatives such as farm plans, contract farming,
                      installation of micro irrigation equipment per well/tube well, and crop diversification under the
                      Eleventh Plan[107] can help address this. Current cropping patterns just do not suit this arid/semi-
                      arid state. With surface irrigation schemes not meeting demand, enormous pressure is put on
                      groundwater resources.


                      10.2.6	           Water Harvesting
                      In several parts of Rajasthan, especially where rainfall is limited to a few showers during the short
                      monsoon months, groundwater is not an option due to depletion or high total dissolved solids (TDS).
                      With surface water also not available, rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the most viable solution to meet
                      drinking water and household needs, at least for a period of six to eight months. Rajasthan has a
                      tradition of building, and maintaining RWH structures such as johad, kuis, and kunds. Traditionally,
                      these structures supported life in this water stressed region, and were well supported in turn by
                      a system of community ownership. Excessive reliance on government run systems has led to the
                      gradual neglect of these structures and disintegration of the entire support mechanism. Attempts are
                      being made by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as the Jal Bhagirathi Foundation in




    [105]	 Droughts are common in the western arid parts of the state of Andhra Pradesh. Here a group of NGOs have come together
           to run a first of its kind project in India to monitor, decode and thus manage groundwater. This is done by first mapping
           the locality to define its hydrological units and drainage; each unit is drained by a single stream with one inlet and one
           outlet (region consists of 11 hydrological units, one containing 41 villages while others are much smaller). Subsequently
           farmers voluntarily collaborate in projects to measure/record rainfall, water table, withdrawals and other data for their
           land. They calculate water availability if water tables remain steady, decide which crops to grow and estimate how much
           water they will use given that about half will go in evapo-transpiration. They then form groups within each hydrological
           unit, and each group draws up a water budget, details of which (showing who should grow what/how) are displayed on a
           wall in the village and updated over the year with information about rain, harvests and even revenues. As a result a large
           number of farmers (more than 650 villages or 1 million people) are starting to reduce their demand for water. Local diet
           has become more varied, chemical fertilizers have been replaced by compost, and relentless drilling of wells has abated.
           The state water department has been trained in the basic principles, and other states have adopted the project.

                 the western Marwar region, Tarun Bharat Sangh and others to repair these RWH structures and
                 re-engage communities in their preservation. Attempts to encourage individual household RWH
                 tanks are being made by agencies (such as Safe Water Networks), social enterprises (such
                 as Aakash Ganga), NGOs such as (Bhoruka Charitable Trust), foundations, governments and
                 others. The relevance of RWH in addressing today’s water crisis is unquestionable; however
                 implementation models, design norms, and funding vary. The lack of financial models and
                 capital limitations at the user end pose challenges in the rural individual context. In the urban
                 setting, enforcement of RWH norms for large buildings has been a challenge.

                 Technical support such as remote sensing data and geographical information systems (GIS)
                 can help as in Madhya Pradesh which has outsourced this function to experts. In Chennai,
                 RWH has been made a requirement for support by the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban
                 Renewal Mission (JNNURM) for water supply schemes. RWH must be a part of micro watershed
                 planning and undertaken in all rural and urban settings to meet demand for drinking, domestic,
                 agriculture, and industrial water.


                 10.2.7	          Industrial Wastewater Management
                 As highlighted in section 5.3 of this report, contamination of water due to industrial effluents
                 is a significant problem in many parts of the state. According to estimates, water demand
                 of industries is 1,000 gallons/acre/day[108]. Overall industrial demand for water in the state
                 currently accounts for the lowest share of 6 percent. But, as demand by this sector grows, it
                 is critical to meet a portion of this with recycled wastewater while minimizing water loss due to
                 industrial pollution.

                 Groundwater extraction for industrial use has to be especially regulated through increased
                 charges and by providing alternative and reliable supply. Groundwater for industry should
                 be limited to sustainable use and should attract a cess to finance measures such as
                 groundwater recharging.

                 Industry associations should be encouraged to regulate themselves to keep pollution under
                 control. While there are individual examples of water stewardship initiatives by socially
                 responsible companies, what is really needed to make a quantifiable difference is industry-wide
                 involvement through water foot printing studies and follow up dialogue. Industries can be made
                 to publish their effluent quality data regularly, which will help empower affected communities
                 and citizens at large.

               10.3	 Market Barriers
               The question is who will help make things right and deliver what is needed? While it is clear that a
               consistent, constructive, and collective effort by several entities, supported by an overall enabling
               environment, is required, the purpose of this report is to specifically explore the contribution that the
               private sector can make in the water endeavor. To that end, it is also important to understand limitations
               and challenges faced by the private sector in delivering water related services. This section highlights the
               key market barriers to private sector involvement.


                     10.3.1	          Water = Government
                     Unlike all other sectors where the private sector has played a vital role, water as a social sector is
                     unique. As also acknowledged by various legal verdicts[109], access to clean water constitutes the
                     Right to Life under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. As the custodian of water resources meant for
                     the public at large, it is the duty and obligation of the state to protect these resources. Added to this is
                     the socialist doctrine long followed by the country where it is understood that government will provide
                     water to people. Further, the role of state governments in this task is well enforced by the Constitution
                     in which water is included in Entry 17 of List II in the Seventh Schedule, which is the State List,
                     however subject to Entry 56 of List I in the Seventh Schedule, which is the Central List. To conclude,
                     water and government are inseparable.

                     People have come to expect government’s role in providing water for all purposes. However, many
                     governments provide inefficient and inadequate services at highly subsidized rates. Attempts by
                     the private sector to engage in water, will at a minimum, involve interaction with the government,
                     and more likely, involve dialogue with, buy in from, and partnership with the government. Thus, the
                     role the private sector can play and the efficiency it can exhibit will be governed by the government.
                     Without government blessing, it is likely that the private sector will be viewed with skepticism
                     by user communities, given the widespread notion that private equals profit, which sometimes
                     means exploitation.


                     10.3.2	          Missing Private Eco-System
                     While Rajasthan has made several attempts in recent times to become more investor friendly and
                     attract business, several barriers prevail for private sector participation in the water sector. Broadly,
                     these are:

                     ¬¬    Capital: In Rajasthan, the communities that are most vulnerable to absent or inadequate water
                           supply are marginal farmers, landless laborers, the rural poor, and inhabitants of remote/tribal

                           precedent in the minds of the users that water is free. This an unsustainable practice, but
                           corrective measures can lead to resistance and mistrust.

FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INTERVENTIONS                                                    88

¬¬   Policy: While the private sector is increasingly being viewed as an option for the water sector, the
     policy framework to safeguard private interests and regulate private performance is missing.

¬¬   Institutional Framework: The institutional framework to support private participation in the
     water sector is limited, from both financial and legislative sides. While many banks and financial
     institutions support infrastructure projects for water and provide agriculture finance, their role
     in supporting projects for drinking water supply, efficient water use in agriculture and similar
     interventions has been limited.

¬¬   Awareness: Knowledge of the wide range of efficiencies that the private sector can bring into the
     water space is limited. This is true not only at user level, but also at government and institutional
     levels. In part, this may be attributed to limited exposure to technological solutions that the
     private sector can provide. There is lack of information sharing between various states working
     on various water related projects, not to mention limited exposure to private sector achievement
     in water sectors outside India. Also, employees of water related government departments are not
     involved in exploring and understanding solutions. The private sector is mostly seen as a means to
     augment funding and as an outsourced service provider.

10.3.3	       The Water Business Model
Focus on the development/inclusive index, does not always translate into viable business models for
the private sector. Water is a need, not a want, this fact supersedes all else. This need is to be ideally
met by simultaneously compensating and conserving finite water resources for coming generations.

Secondly, water is a social matter requiring continued community participation. Any water related
business model needs to factor this in, which means long periods of hand-holding, not a standard
private company trait, although a given with NGO and volunteer work. More business models need to
evolve for the private sector to fine-tune its water value proposition.


10.3.4	       Uncharted Territory
As seen in chapter eight, the role of the private sector in water in Rajasthan has been limited to
standard contractual work. There are no relevant examples of public private partnership (PPP) or
private sector partnerships in the true sense (risk sharing, transferability of assets, and financial
structuring) in water related projects. This could change soon with the PPP projects under
consideration, however it would be fair to say that water (non-contractual, non-construction projects)
is an uncharted territory for the private sector in Rajasthan, as is the case in most of India and the
developing world. This automatically leads to lack of trust, both within the government and user
communities. While better awareness and stakeholder dialogue can gradually help create trust, the
ultimate solution will be successful delivery by the private sector. However, this may be somewhat
of a chicken and egg situation. For now, there seems to be a mindset within the state government
that may on occasion act as a block, discouraging private role. The need for professional guidance,
expert transaction structuring, and transparent processes to unleash the true potential of private
sector in water is the need of the hour.

    Baoris or bers are community wells found in Rajasthan used mainly for drinking. Most are very old and were built by banjaras
    (mobile trading communities) for their drinking water needs. They can hold water for a long time because of almost negligible
    water evaporation.


                      Rajasthan as a state has a long, proud history of water stewardship and an entire tradition[110] around it
                      where water was a community resource, used and managed as such. Though neglected, the superior
                      examples of different types of water structures all across the state bear testimony to this. These
                      structures are of various types and different names: kunds/kundis, kuis/beris, baoris/bers, jhalaras, nadi,
                      tobas, tankas, khadins, vav/vavdi/baoli/bavadi, virdas, and paar (see figure 31). The Paliwal Brahmins
                      discovered the relevance of gypsum in preventing water seepage in parts of western Rajasthan some
                      five hundred years ago, where they built kuis[111] (shallow wells) to access water. Private companies need
                      to understand and support traditional wisdom to be most effective.




    [110]	 Johad (a crescent-shaped earthen check-dam) found in many parts of the state, was a place of special significance. Villagers
           would engage in community work like building a temple or start work on a new johad. The practice is being revived again,
           as in Bhaonta-Kolyala village in Alwar district of Rajasthan that also walked away with the Down To Earth - Joseph C John
           Award, for its work on RWH.
    [111]	 Found in western Rajasthan, these are 10 to12 meter deep pits dug near tanks to collect the seepage. Kuis can also be used to
           harvest rainwater in areas with meager rainfall. The mouth of the pit is usually made very narrow. This prevents the collected
           water from evaporating. The pit gets wider as it goes deeper into the ground, so that water can seep in into a large surface
           area. The openings of these entirely earthen structures are generally covered with planks of wood, or put under lock and key.
           The water is used sparingly, as a last resource in crisis situations.

10.4	 Market Players
The market players in the state deserve review, as they will be contributing partners in any private
initiative in the state. Rajasthan with its arid and semi-arid climate has had an active water player roster.
Chapter nine of this report provides insight into the most active members specific to Rajasthan. They fall
into the following groups:

¬¬   Government: Ministry of Water Resources, PHED, agricultural and horticulture directorates, Planning
     and Irrigation Department, and others such as urban local bodies (ULBs) and panchayat raj (elected
     village bodies) institutions (PRIs)

¬¬   NGOs/foundations/volunteers: They play a significant role in community mobilization and
     rejuvenation of traditional water structures

¬¬   Multilateral agencies/business associations/educational and research institutions

¬¬   Financial institutions: Including micro finance institutions and self-help groups that give loans

¬¬   Private companies: Technology providers, water related services/products, water infrastructure
     and service delivery

¬¬   Users: Domestic, non-domestic, agricultural, and industrial

¬¬   Knowledge providers: professional consultants and research houses.

            11.1	Interventions
            The perspective on what has gone most wrong, and what is needed most urgently, offered in chapter
            10, helps establish an important fact – that there is a lot that needs to happen on the government’s
            end, mainly through action-oriented policy intervention, institutional reform, and political will. What also
            emerges is that the private sector is most suited to address many deficiencies, and that it must play its
            part in bringing needed efficiencies, both technical and process oriented, while sharing resources and
            responsibility. Given the barriers to private sector participation as discussed in section 10.3, it is important
            to specifically outline possibilities for private sector intervention, and further, narrow these interventions
            down to those that the IFC can or will support, depending on resource availability and internal priorities.

            This chapter specifically explores how private sector can contribute to Rajasthan’s water sector. In the
            context of our goal, and on the basis of Rajasthan specific facts presented thus far in this document, it
            makes most sense to assign the state’s water sector into the following seven intervention possibilities.


                11.1.1	       Rural Drinking Water – Off Grid
                Around 75 percent of Rajasthan’s population, more than 51 million people, live in rural areas. Add
                to this the large livestock population, animal husbandry being the second most important livelihood
                activity in this agrarian state. The state has experienced more than 40 droughts in the past 52 years.
                Nearly 75 percent of its villages have had a 50 percent deficit in crop yield, jeopardizing the lives
                of nearly 32 million people. This recurring situation is especially hard on women, who often must
                walk for miles to collect water. In the dry regions of Rajasthan for example, women spend as much

                                                                                                           AND ANALYSIS




                 as four hours a day and walk an average six kilometers for water[112]. By some estimates, the Rajasthan
                 government spends millions of dollars in transporting water to rural villages[113]. The state government has
                 made rainwater harvesting (RWH) mandatory for all public establishments and for properties on plots
                 measuring more than 500 square meters in urban areas. If an RWH completion certificate is not submitted
                 to the Public Health and Engineering Department (PHED), water supply connection can be terminated,
                 although this hardly happens in reality.

                 There are roughly 122,000 rural habitations in Rajasthan. These areas are to be covered under the
                 Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Mission (RGDWM). The definition of drinking water related coverage
                 (including number of villages or habitations) and corresponding statistics tend to vary within government
                 departments. The accuracy of some of this data is questionable for a variety of reasons. Based on
                 Planning Commission estimates, roughly 30 percent of habitations are covered and have access to
                 40 liters per capita per day (lpcd) of water. The remaining 70 percent are not covered for various reasons:
                 the quality of water is not good, they are located too far away from the nearest water source (beyond the
                 government’s definition of feasible distance to supply), or have slipped back to pre-coverage levels of
                 less than the minimum targeted water supply. Even by PHED estimates that are more optimistic, about
                 30 percent of the habitations have no coverage at all, little over 50 percent are covered fully, and the rest
                 are partially covered, the definition of coverage being ambiguous.

                 The vulnerability of source of coverage (based on reliability of supply) and the burden associated with
                 the source (such as using hand pumps in sweltering temperatures and long lines) are other dimensions.
                 These are significant when one considers that women and, sometimes, children are entrusted with the
                 task of fetching water for the household. Only 5 percent of rural village drinking water supply is covered
                 by piped schemes (deemed most reliable), while more than 50 percent of villages are covered under
                 hand-pump schemes, which are wide open to failures due to maintenance issues and falling water tables.

                 Despite being a low-income state, Rajasthan has the highest percentage of rural households where water
                 is purchased. Options for potable water are limited, while water quality issues are numerous and very
                 common. Conveying water over vast distances and difficult terrain compounds this problem. In many
                 severely affected parts, there are negligible employment alternatives to agriculture and animal husbandry.
                 It is normal for people in Rajasthan to consume water with twice the level of acceptable total dissolved
                 solids (TDS) for the country (refer to chapter 5 of this report on water quality).

                 The drinking water solution most applicable to rural areas, especially remote habitations, is off-the-
                 grid water supply, both community and individually owned. Additionally, with no groundwater (due
                 to quality issues or depletion) and limited feasibility to connect with surface schemes (due to low
                 density of population in these areas to justify large infrastructure investment), the most viable source is
                 rainwater harvesting.

                 RWH as a concept has been around in the state for hundreds of years, and traditional structures such as
                 community tanks, reservoirs, and step wells can be seen all over Rajasthan. Several non-governmental
                 organizations (NGOs) have taken on the task of repairing such structures, and rejuvenating the concept

                      of community managed water supply. More recently, newer structures have been built with philanthropic,
                      government, and institutional support, testimony to the continued faith in traditional practices in the
                      absence of alternative means. Innovative solutions built on traditional methods are being promoted
                      by institutions such as the National Geophysical Research Institute and Indian Institute of Chemical
                      Technology. For instance, efforts to enhance runoff in kundis by 60 to70 percent depending on intensity
                      of rainfall rely on new techniques involving polymers. Formal policy recognition is evident in section
                      5.1.3 of the state water policy (SWP)[114], which specifically states that roof top rainwater harvesting will be
                      promoted both in rural and urban areas.

                      Several institutions have promoted individual, household RWH tanks with typical capacities of 15,000
                      to 25,000 liters at an average cost of Indian rupees22,000 ($450), where the material to labor cost ratio
                      tends to be about 60:40. The catchment area comprises of rooftops where available, or specially built
                      concrete structures around these tanks. The designs of tanks vary, in some cases these are connected
                      to larger community tanks to collect overflows, although not successful given the limited amount of
                      rainfall received in these areas. The funding models for such household tanks vary as well, but the user
                      component is generally found to be less than 30 percent, which is typically contributed in kind; that is
                      labor (basic training is given) and material (mostly bricks, since these are locally available). The ability to
                      contribute even this much varies from one household to another.

                      In parts of western Rajasthan personally surveyed by the author, households are unable to contribute
                      at all. Here, families earn as little as Indian rupees100 or less than $2 a day as daily laborers manually
                      breaking stones; an opportunity they claim is limited to 15 to 20 days a month. These areas, however,
                      also happen to be the most needy (hence highest on the developmental impact scale). Unlike household
                      RWH structures surveyed by the author in northern and eastern parts of the state (where groundwater
                      is still available, there are canals within a few kilometers of the villages, and marginal farming is being
                      done), in central and western Rajasthan none of these apply. In these areas, hamlets consisting of a few
                      households lie scattered in the desert, collectively paying about Indian rupees 400 ($8) for a camel cart to
                      supply water that lasts about two days. In addition to being a financial burden, there are associated health
                      risks to this practice since supplied water is saline and has dissolved solids beyond levels considered
                      safe for human consumption[115]. Households do not have the means to build larger tanks; they store
                      water in a community tank built by the government, if any, or in small tanks in their home.

                      While the above scenario of limited or no user capital poses a challenge for private involvement, it is
                      worth exploring possibilities with the right private partners such as microfinance institutions (MFIs) in
                      cases where the user is able to contribute and the government, which should ideally support very poor
                      users, is unable to. As an example of professional institutions involved in the RWH space, Safe Water
                      Networks (SWN) has been active with BASIX Social Enterprise Group as its MFI partner, along with local
                      NGOs to support the initiative on the ground.

                      The argument for the state to subsidize would be that these areas are likely to remain uncovered while
                      the state machinery is occupied with other priorities relating to urban water supply. These areas also fall
                      outside the prescribed distance (between source of water and end user) for coverage under the RGDWM,

                  and it is highly probable that they will slip back from coverage, as is the case for areas dependent on
                  hand pump schemes. Additionally, around 66 percent of the state is desert (Jodhpur, Barmer, Jaisalmer,
                  Pali, Jalore, Churu and Nagaur districts) with a lower density of population. The costs of government
                  schemes increase substantially, a disincentive for the fund strapped state. The hidden costs of not
                  providing access to water in these areas are high for the state. Therefore, money can be channeled by
                  the state towards private initiatives to subsidize very poor users. RWH will help reduce dependence on
                  unreliable groundwater sources, something the government is struggling with. In areas where part of the
                  cost can be borne by the user, the private model can anyway be explored through microfinance.

                  In addition to better planning and execution, the value add that private intervention will bring over a PHED

                  groups (WUGs) or existing government projects such as Village Water Security Planning), and health
                  (WHO and other UN agencies).

                  In areas of really high TDS, off-grid filtered water supply through kiosks or other distribution channels
                  could be explored. However field visits by the author[116] to survey one such initiative by Sarvajal, a private
                  water filtering company based in Gujarat, that uses reverse osmosis (RO) technology in the villages of
                  Sikar and Jhunjhunu districts in Rajasthan, showed mixed results. The bulk water being treated was
                  typically in the TDS range of 400 to 800 ppm[117], and filtration brought it down to 100 ppm (WHO generally
                  recommends 500 ppm for India). Interestingly, even pre-filtration levels of TDS in these locations were
                  already lower than TDS levels of filtered water supplied by PHED run piped schemes in some of the worst
                  quality affected areas in Rajasthan. One such location surveyed during the field visit was Nagaur district,
                  where PHED supplies water at 1,000 TDS.

                  In certain parts of Barmer district, TDS as high as 4,500 has been recorded, while it is common to find
                  2,000 TDS in the other affected areas of the state. Sarvajal franchisees reported that customers who did
                  not always buy filtered water did not report major health problems due to poor water quality when they
                  switched to other cheaper sources. This is not the case in the worst affected parts of the state where
                  incidence of fluorosis and associated diseases is high. Additionally, certain areas where the company
                  operates are facing acute groundwater depletion. Some franchises even reported having dug new tube
                  wells (Samota Ka Baas, near Palsana village), or deepened existing tube wells (Rolsabsar village) to
                  qualify for business with the company. In the absence of clear health benefits, the need to put additional
                  pressure on an already critical groundwater situation is debatable[118].

                  In contrast, in western Rajasthan where people suffer from serious health issues due to water quality, a
                  public private community partnership (PPCP) with the private company Environze has demonstrated the
                  benefits of off-grid solutions where communities own/manage operations and generate income through
                  self-help groups (SHGs). These would be good examples for IFC to study (refer to Jal Panihari program
                  under 9.1 of this report). Bulk desalination plants are also worth looking at in these areas with very high
                  TDS (see section 11.1.2 next).

[118]	 Further due diligence on companies such as Sarvajal is needed with a larger sample size of their operations to draw final
       conclusions on their true relevance as social enterprises that promote better health where it is needed the most, especially in the
       context of groundwater stressed areas such as Rajasthan.

                       11.1.2	            Rural/Peri-urban Drinking Water – On Grid
                       On-grid supply in rural and peri-urban areas, that is in bulk to public stand posts (PSPs) or end users, would
                       present more viability for private involvement. At present, about 27 percent of village drinking water supply
                       is supported by regional schemes. However with the PHED looking to move away from groundwater to
                       surface schemes linked to IGNP, rural and peri-urban areas in the canal distribution network can benefit.
                       For reasons discussed at length in chapter 10 of this report around market failures and market needs, these
                       schemes would be best implemented under private partnerships, ably supported with metering, pricing,
                       system efficiencies, community involvement, and sustainable operations and maintenance (O&M).

                       In the state draft annual plan document for 2013-14, section 19.5 says, “State’s medium term plan is to shift
                       toward surface water sources through building an extensive network of multi-town and multi-habitation
                       schemes, each with long distance conveyance systems simultaneously supplying bulk water to a large
                       number of villages, towns and cities, for maximizing benefits. The main surface sources are Indira Gandhi
                       Main Canal, Banas, Chambal and Narmada rivers based dams. Yamuna water shall also be utilized for
                       nearby rural areas.”

                       As detailed in chapter 8, a number of such surface based regional schemes are in the project planning
                       stage. The failure of government run schemes, where demand has outstripped supply even before
                       completion of projects, or where distribution has serious lags with no community buy in (hence no cost
                       recovery), would suggest that without major institutional reform, future schemes could meet similar fates.
                       Besides, priority on urban schemes combined with paucity of state funds, by the government’s own
                       admission[119] could mean delayed launch and implementation of these rural and peri-urban projects, if at all
                       these are sanctioned in the near term.

                       A well-structured PPP transaction may be the best alternative. The proposed externally funded projects
                       discussed in section 8.5 of this report include peri-urban areas and as such would be an ideal opportunity
                       for private intervention.

                       Additionally, there already may be opportunities to set desalination plants and cater to surrounding
                       communities in an on-grid bulk to PSP or user mode. An example is the Kasnau-Matasukh Desalination
                       Project in the Nagaur lignite belt (refer to chapter 8 of this report), which is a unique project. The accidental
                       discovery of a vast brackish water aquifer in a lignite-mining zone is being used to the advantage of thirsty
                       habitations in the area. Rajasthan has more than 4,000 million tons of lignite reserves in the districts of
                       Barmer, Bikaner, and Nagaur and, in recent years, some lignite blocks in three districts have been allotted
                       to thermal power plant projects. With such vast lignite deposits in the state, the possibility of additional
                       aquifers could be proactively explored. Along with community buy in, a private partnership model in such
                       a case could work well. IFC could explore desalination projects under various proposals (see details in
                       illustration IV under 11.3.1, and appendix F[120] of this report).




    [119]	 Section 19.13 of the draft annual plan 2013-14 states “Due to the limitations of quality and quantity, the ground water sources
           can no longer be considered dependable in Rajasthan. Major coverage, therefore, shall be from surface water source-based projects.
           River Chambal and its tributaries, Indira Gandhi Canal System and Narmada Canal are the only dependable perennial surface
           water sources in the state. Due to a limited number of reliable surface sources, these projects involve long transmission systems that
           are highly capital intensive, require substantial funds and long time for completion. Surface sources are being adopted as the most
           sustainable and reliable source to avoid slipping back after achieving coverage.”
    [120]	 While current status of these projects is unclear, the list demonstrates the kind of projects that are feasible in the state. Last

                  11.1.3	           Urban Drinking Water – On Grid
                  In the light of the severely compromised urban drinking water supply in the state (refer to section 4.2 of
                  this report), the need for an alternative is immediate. Private involvement in urban areas is very relevant
                  as proven by select initiatives within India and abroad.

                  The government’s intent to involve the private sector is known. PHED, under its reform agenda (refer
                  to section 10.2.3 of this report), talks of the likelihood of outsourcing implementation and O&M for
                  several technical upgrades, including bulk and consumer metering. This would be relevant especially
                  in the urban context. Such opportunities can be explored further by the private sector by taking a
                  holistic view and addressing the overall supply system under a partnership, rather than the traditional
                  contractual model.

                  The most important policy thrust in making private sector viable in on-grid schemes is the formal
                  recognition of water pricing and tariff reform as important areas. Section 8 of the SWP[121] reflects
                  on this. With the broad objective of conveying the scarcity value of water through water pricing,
                  the draft states, “Water tariffs will be set for progressively moving towards full cost of operation
                  and maintenance...this will be matched by a rigorous program of improvement in the efficiency
                  of operation and maintenance...for all water supplies a three or four stepped water tariff will be
                  charged…a program of water metering for water management purposes will apply to all significant
                  water users irrespective of source and water ownership.”


                  11.1.4	           Agriculture: Canal Irrigated and 11.1.5 Agriculture –
                                    Non-Canal (Groundwater and Rain fed)[122]
                  Agriculture, which consumes 83 percent of the state’s water resources, presents the single biggest
                  opportunity for water reform. Importantly, due to rising demand for water for non-agricultural use,
                  experts predict serious implications for agriculture in the state as the share of water available to
                  the sector reduces to 70 percent by 2050[123]. There is almost no alternative, but to switch from the
                  inefficient practices currently in use towards more water efficient irrigation and cropping practices.

                  While one would ideally like long-term food security to result from better water management, this
                  arguably also cannot be expected from present day cropping and irrigation practices in the state.
                  Despite agriculture being the most important sector in the state, Rajasthan is not a significant
                  contributor to the food bowl, for itself or the nation.

                  Rajasthan is under the grip of severe food insecurity with 22 of its 32 districts[124] being labeled as
                  ‘most food insecure’ in a study.

                      Food security situation of the state was arrived at based on the three axes of availability, access,
                      and absorption. A food security index (FSI) was calculated with agricultural production, irrigation,
                      agricultural laborers, and access to safe drinking water among other indicators. Districts were ranked
                      on the basis of performance in food security outcome (FSO), which included under-five mortality
                      and number of underweight children. Improving irrigation and agricultural productivity were among
                      the five areas highlighted by the study that could positively impact the current situation[125]. Among
                      newer areas of policy focus, the study also identified agricultural diversification and development of
                      non-farm enterprises.

                      It is important to examine the current cropping pattern. Cereals and pulses constitute food grain
                      crops. The state produces 5.49 percent of the nation’s food grain. Millet (bajra) in the kharif season
                      and wheat in the rabi season are the major food grains grown here. In 2010-11, 42 percent of
                      Rajasthan’s gross sown area (GSA) was under cereals, 21 percent under oilseeds, and 18.2 percent
                      under pulses. In contrast, in terms of irrigated area, 42 percent was under cereals, 7 percent under
                      pulses and 29 percent under oilseeds. Wheat alone typically accounts for about 29 percent of total
                      irrigated area, rapeseed and mustard together are about the same, and grams 6 percent. The top
                      wheat producers in India are Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana; for coarse cereals Rajasthan,
                      Karnataka, and Maharashtra; and for pulses Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. If we
                      compare average yield for food grains across two five-year periods (1999-2004 and 2004-09), we
                      find yields dropped in Punjab (the food bowl of India along with Haryana) by close to 400 kg/hectare,
                      while the state with the highest improvement of more than 600 kg/hectare was Rajasthan[126].

                      The point established is that despite mismatched cropping practices, Rajasthan still figures well in
                      the national scene for coarse cereals and pulses. These are good examples of hardy crops suited to
                      semi-arid soil and climatic conditions requiring little water.

                      With focus on weaning away from crops unsuited to the state’s agri-zones, and adoption of micro
                      irrigation technologies to increase irrigation productivity of water efficient crops such as millets and
                      pulses, the yield of these crops could improve, while water use would further reduce (depending
                      on the crop, drip is shown to reduce water requirement by up to one-third per acre compared to
                      conventional irrigation, and energy consumption to almost half).

                      Rajasthan could become an important agricultural contributor. The state may have the potential to
                      become the pulse bowl for the country and further enhance India’s position in the world. In 2008,
                      India ranked first in pulses production, while in cereals it was third after China and the US. India has
                      a need for pulses as well. Despite imports, growing demand from a burgeoning population has led
                      to per capita net availability of pulses to steadily decline since the 1950s and prices to skyrocket.
                      Increasing food grain yield is key to ensuring food sufficiency in the long term.

                      Misconceptions and lack of awareness about emerging micro irrigation (MI) possibilities are rampant.
                      Drip is mostly thought to be limited to vegetables and fruit, and is stated thus in policy documents.
                      Failure to promote better water use in agriculture has resulted in crops like sugarcane and cotton to

                  be grown in the state. Sugarcane needs three times the amount of water required by wheat and rice
                  put together. To highlight some of the lesser-known developments around MI, Jain Irrigation (JISL),
                  the largest player in the Indian market, is working with scientists to determine optimal irrigation and
                  fertigation systems for irrigated rice and wheat[127]. The company is propagating use of drip irrigation
                  in pulses and oilseeds – both important crops for Rajasthan. Traditionally, pulses are a rain fed crop
                  and most farmers use minimal irrigation. Trials on pulses conducted in Maharashtra have shown
                  water saving through drip irrigation, and substantial increase in yields with limited use of fertilizers
                  and other nutrients[128]. The normal yield for pigeon pea or tur in Maharashtra under standard
                  conditions of sowing is four quintals an acre, but went up to ten quintals an acre with drip irrigation.
                  Tests on oilseeds using drip are also being conducted.

                  In addition to technology and cropping practices, there is a need to concurrently work with the
                  government on overall policy direction. An example is support prices for crops. Mustard is one of the
                  most suitable crops for Rajasthan’s environmental conditions. However, prices can go very low due
                  to palm oil imports (a substitute for mustard oil). Enhanced marketing opportunities for millet, another
                  important kharif crop, are required since it is sometimes difficult to even cover costs of cultivation at
                  prevailing prices. Power tariff practices in case of groundwater irrigation and unsuitable distribution
                  systems in case of surface irrigation create an adverse environment for adopting water saving
                  technologies (WSTs) and changing cropping patterns to water efficient crops.

                  Studies indicate that the most scope for water saving exists in those areas where groundwater levels
                  are deep, as in Rajasthan. Low groundwater tables, and arid/semi-arid climatic conditions reduce
                  non-beneficial evaporation from soils, hence actual water saving could be high through MI devices.
                  Many crops grown in the state are conducive to MI devices: mustard, rapeseed, wheat, oil seeds, and
                  chilies. Limited areas under cotton and sugarcane are also good candidates for MI. In areas with very
                  poor yields, such as rocky land, well owners leave a part of their land fallow due to shortage of water
                  or discontinue pumping after some time to allow wells to recuperate. Farmers in these areas will have
                  strong incentive to adopt pressurized irrigation systems. When pressurized irrigation systems are
                  used, the rate at which water is pumped will reduce, giving enough time for pumps to recuperate.
                  Since pumps will eventually run for more hours while pumping out the same quantity of water,
                  command areas can be expanded.

                  The above facts clearly indicate the need and scope for private intervention in the sector. There
                  are two distinct areas of intervention: groundwater irrigated areas and surface irrigated areas or
                  cultivable command areas (CCAs).

                  Roughly 36 percent of agriculture in the state or 6.6 million hectares is irrigated, and accounts for
                  little over half the agricultural output from the state. Around 25 percent of this area is under canal
                  command and is plagued with distribution mismanagement, ill-timed supply at critical crop growth
                  stages, and unfit cropping practices (refer to sections 7.2 and 7.2.1 of this report). This presents a real
                  opportunity for water management.

                                                                              99                                            FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INTERVENTIONS
                      A range of water saving interventions by the private sector can be undertaken under an umbrella project
                      in select geographies under canal command and groundwater irrigation.

                      The state aims to encourage optimum use of water through installation of sprinklers on every operational
                      well/tube well. Large subsidies on MI equipment are supposed to help achieve this objective. Currently,
                      combined central and state subsidies are about 70 percent[129]. However actual adoption of these
                      technologies has remained low so far due to several reasons: inefficiencies in subsidy payout, MI
                      equipment ill-suited for sizes of land holdings (hence high per acre costs), lack of institutional framework
                      for gap funding, lack of awareness about MI, and current farm sector power tariffs.

                      The mid-term review document of the Eleventh Plan, under sections 7.5 (Harnessing the Potentials of
                      Crop Productivity), and 7.7 (Enhance Water Use Efficiency) contains several important references to
                      private intervention. Select examples are[130]:

                ¬¬    Sprinklers, drip and pipelines along with efficient water management practices for crop production to be
                      emphasized with adequate financial support during the plan...area specific/crop specific models of micro-
                      irrigation (MI) systems including sprinkler/drip be developed and popularized...popularization of irrigation
                      on volumetric basis and use of water saving devices.

                ¬¬    Pressurized irrigation systems to be promoted for rational use of irrigation water particularly in
                      orchards and vegetables...promote drip irrigation in vegetables and fruit plants for higher yields and
                      quality produce.

                ¬¬    PPP Model: Looking to the high cost of investment and technical specialization in laying out of water
                      saving devices particularly drip systems, there is need to involve manufacturers/companies of drips in
                      lay out of systems on farmers field...such private participation may also be in popularizing water saving
                      devices and imparting training on efficient water management issues.

                ¬¬    Crop and plant varieties to be developed that have higher water use efficiency...diversification from cereals
                      crops to high value crops like pulses/oilseeds/vegetables/fruits/ spices...promote short duration and less
                      water consuming crops especially in rain fed areas...marketing support for introduction of new crops –
                      declaration of minimum support price and ensuring buy-back guarantee

                ¬¬    Take up programs on rainwater harvesting and other water harvesting systems for recharging
                      of groundwater...construction of diggis[131] and storage tanks to enable operation of MIS in
                      CCAs...construction of water storage tanks/farm pond to be encouraged in rain fed areas with
                      adequate financial support.

                ¬¬    Need to develop appropriate technologies for treatment of brackish water, treatment of sewage water, and
                      recycling of sewage water for irrigation purpose.

                ¬¬    Policy Issues: Incentive/disincentive for efficient cropping pattern in the CCAs to be given to WUGs/
                      farmers’ organizations.

WATER ASSESSMENT AND POTENTIAL
FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INTERVENTIONS                                                       100
                                                                                                                                  POTENTIAL PARTICIPATION
                                                                                                                                  AND ANALYSIS




            ¬¬    There is a need to promote contract farming - large area (1,000 acre) in each agro climatic zone/agro
                  ecological zone with monetary incentives and buy back guarantee. Contract farming model to be
                  encouraged with government as facilitator.

                  The state’s depleting groundwater tables are now finding mention in policy documents. Section 3.1.1
                  of the SWP[132] states, “In the case of irrigation with groundwater the primary objective will be to farm
                  as much land as can be irrigated without a long-term decline in the water table...the current ethos of
                  uncontrolled groundwater extraction as an ‘individual right’, will be discouraged...it will be replaced
                  by an ethos of community responsibility for the long-term sustainability of the aquifer as a community
                  resource.” Further, section 1.3.12 of the SWP promotes pressure irrigation methods including MI to
                  help achieve groundwater management.

                  More than 70 percent of irrigation is dependent on rapidly deteriorating groundwater resources. Wells
                  and tube wells are preferred sources over canals, given these are deemed more reliable and under
                  direct individual control. Once thought to be the key to unlock the green revolution, the very same
                  resource is now near exhaustion, and has pushed the state to the brink of a crisis. Outside of canals
                  and ground water, the remaining 70 percent of agriculture in the state is rain fed. While significant, this
                  sector is most difficult to influence.

                  Among measures being discussed to reduce inequality between irrigated and rain fed areas, are
                  in-situ moisture conservation to ensure availability of water, watershed approach, water harvesting,
                  use of short duration varieties to overcome biotic/abiotic stresses, research support for development
                  of drought resistant/photo sensitive varieties, promotion of agro forestry particularly silvi-pastoral
                  models in low rainfall areas, and adoption of soil moisture conservation practices. Among the state
                  government’s successful innovations in rain fed agriculture is the concept of elected user committees
                  to manage common property resources and inform the government about farmers’ needs. Around
                  15,000 such committees are functioning in Rajasthan with bank accounts to handle community funds.

                  Groundwater is the biggest area of concern in the state and cries out for intervention. Private
                  intervention around MI and cropping reform is needed to optimize output from wells and tube wells. In
                  rain fed areas, promoting pulses could be an intervention.

                  Model private intervention could take the following shape: IFC initiates dialogue with the state
                  government for the selected CCA and groundwater irrigated geography. As broad deliverables,
                  the project can seek to achieve certain MI implementation targets (with one or more MI providers
                  as partners) with a scientifically planned cropping plan, with agriculture universities or research
                  institutions as partners. The intervention will seek community participation, as well as from NGOs
                  to support involvement with water user groups. Features will include an efficient subsidy payout
                  mechanism, minimum support pricing and irrigation tariff reform, and gap funding for technology
                  implementation and irrigation tank/reservoir construction. Other value additions could be post-harvest
                  marketing and warehousing support and agri-based livelihood generation with self-help groups.
                  Please refer to illustration I under section 11.3.1 for a detailed program proposal.

                      11.1.6	           Industry – Wastewater Recycling (including
                                        municipal waste)
                      Industry in Rajasthan consumes 6 percent of water in the state. According to estimates[133], annual
                      industrial demand for water is expected to grow to 139 MCM/year by 2045. The actual acceleration
                      in demand from industry could be much more rapid given the development of Dedicated Freight
                      Corridor (DFC) and Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) that are underway, and requirements
                      of the new industrial promotion policy which sets aside 10 percent water in new dams/projects for
                      industrial development[134]. Industrial water demand and industrial effluent treatment in the state has
                      already been broadly discussed (refer to sections 3.1 and 5.3).

                      While industry is a lower priority for government water supply schemes (after agriculture and
                      domestic consumption), the need for solutions is nevertheless significant, given the polluting
                      industrial composition in the state, and growing emphasis on wastewater treatment and recycling in
                      latest plan documents (including water harvesting being made mandatory for both industrial units
                      and industrial areas).

                      Rajasthan produces 91 percent of the total marble in India, an industry that consumes up
                      2.75 million liters of water per hour. Textile units on an average require 17 liters of water per meter
                      of fabric produced. In Bhilwara town, the average fabric processing capacity for 22 units at the time
                      of data collection was one million meters per day, which translated into 17 million liters per day
                      (MLD) water requirement for one town. Textile is a flourishing industry in several parts of the state,
                      importantly Jodhpur, Pali, Barmer (Balotra), and Jaipur (Sanganer) where numerous dyeing and
                      printing works are located.

                      Rajasthan has vast reserves of cement grade and steel melting shop (SMS) grade limestone. At least
                      14 major, and two medium cement plants, with a total installed capacity of about 20.3 million tons per
                      annum (MTPA), are operational in the state. Cement is a water intensive industry; among other uses,
                      water is used for cooling. A 1.4 MTPA plant can consume more than 300 cubic meters of water per
                      hour. Thus, more than 4,350 cubic meters of water is consumed by the cement industry every hour in
                      Rajasthan. A portion of this may be recycled depending on individual plant practices.

                      In terms of water polluting industries, textiles, smelters, thermal power plants, major brick/lime
                      kilns, stone crushers, and mines are the biggest culprits in the state. Industrial water pollution is a
                      problem in Bhilwara, Udaipur, Jaipur (Sanganer), Kota, Pali, Barmer (Balotra), Jodhpur, Kishangarh,
                      and Makrana. Industrial effluent discharged from textile industries contains alkalis, residual dyes,
                      starches and cellulose, soluble salts (mainly sodium and calcium), silicate, oils, and other impurities.

           provides a good reference point.

                                                                                                                            AND ANALYSIS




                 In the absence of economically viable technologies for treatment, mindless dumping of these
                 pollutants into open drains and catchment areas of river basins has had serious repercussions on
                 ground and surface water used for irrigation. Wells have been abandoned and cultivable land has
                 turned into wasteland. Soil productivity has suffered due to crust formation.

                 Compared to domestic and agricultural water supply, interventions in industrial water supply will
                 involve a lesser degree of interaction with the government. Faster action will result by working directly
                 with industrial units and industry associations. The objectives should be to promote water reuse and
                 efficiency, augment industrial water supply, improve service delivery, and achieve cleaner affluent
                 footprint. Government involvement will be required through policy reform (as well as legislative
                 reform in some cases) in order to achieve these objectives on a larger sector-wide scale. Any project
                 involving municipal waste will have a government component built into it. To summarize, there is clear
                 scope for private intervention, both with and around the state government.

                 The existing policy framework both assists and deters private involvement in the sector. The SWP[135],
                 under section 5.3, which is dedicated to municipal and industrial water conservation, lists the
                 following: reuse of treated sewage effluent treated at different levels according to use (municipal,
                 industrial, horticultural, beneficial surface discharge, and groundwater recharge); water intensive
                 industries required to recycle water; beneficial use of groundwater extracted in mining operations
                 (with remediation of chemical pollution where appropriate); and water auditing for all industries
                 (which covers quantified usage, potential for recycling and conservation, and actual/potential
                 pollution associated with each site).

                 To appreciate the acute water shortage faced by industrial units in Rajasthan, take a look at two key
                 industrial clusters in the state. Jaipur industrial region has been divided into four broad areas by the
                 Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation Limited (RIICO): South, North,
                 Rural, and Sitapura. Each in turn consists of several industrial areas with over 50 medium and large
                 scale units, and 20,000 small-scale units involved in textiles and related products, gems and jewelry,
                 agro-based industries, handicrafts, and basic metals and related products. With all 13 blocks in
                 Jaipur falling under exploited or over exploited categories, and groundwater development rates of
                 270 percent or more (groundwater recharge versus draft), certain areas have reported a drop of more
                 than 22 meters in water levels in recent years. The total water demand of the city was estimated at
                 319 MLD (as of 2001), projected to increase to 598 MLD in 2011, and 897 MLD in 2021[136]. Industrial
                 demand-supply gap in Jaipur was already 55 percent at the time of data compilation. The total
                 industrial demand for water was estimated at 26.85 MLD, against supply of 12.07 MLD.

                     accounts for 47 percent of the total value addition by textiles and related products, and about
                     25 percent of net value addition of registered manufacturing in Rajasthan. Water is critical for textile
                     processing, but currently there is no organized mechanism to meet demand. The water requirement in
                     Bhilwara is estimated at 18 MLD, and the new growth center in Hamirgarh requires 4 MLD. The average
                     discharge from the units is 9,000 to 11,000 kl/day and is very high in TDS, and requires expensive
                     treatment methods. Industries here meet their water requirements from the following sources: 4.7 MLD
                     from industry owned tube wells, 3 MLD from rented sources, 2 MLD from private tankers, and 8.2 MLD
                     by recycling through effluent treatment plants (ETPs). It is becoming increasingly difficult to meet
                     demand through these sources.

                     Industry needs to augment supply. Recycling treated water from domestic sewage treatment plants
                     (STPs) for industrial purposes - boilers, gardening, floor washing and other similar uses - will not only
                     reduce demand for fresh water, but will help conserve fresh water for potable use. Depending on end
                     use of recycled water, various levels of tertiary treatment by common effluent treatment plants (CETPs)
                     will be required. In addition to recycled water, CETPs will also address water pollution.

                     However, the handling of domestic waste itself is likely to pose a serious challenge. According to
                     data for 2008[137], 11.2 million people lived in the 45 class I and II cities in Rajasthan. Water supply into
                     these towns was 1,912.72 MLD, while 1,530.16 MLD of sewage was generated. The sewage treatment
                     capacity was only 54 MLD in class I cities, while it was likely that class II cities had no capacity at all.

                     The wastewater treatment situation is quite alarming throughout India. Wastewater generation is
                     calculated at a minimum of 80 per cent of water supplied. However, since people use their own sources
                     of water, additional amounts of waste may be generated. Wastewater collection in most urban centers
                     with sewerage systems usually does not exceed about two-thirds of that generated[138]. While smaller
                     sized urban centers with sewerage systems treat less than one-fourth of the wastewater generated,
                     even the metropolitan cities treat only about two-fifths. Wastewater disposal is done both on land and in
                     water bodies by most urban centers. Proximity to water body, local conditions and financial constraints
                     determine the place and method of disposal. Recycling and reuse of wastewater is practiced in very few
                     urban centers and wherever it is done, it is mostly used for agriculture or horticulture.

                     There is no fixed mechanism to charge for wastewater collection and disposal, and cost recovery is
                     generally very low from this service. Even metros show very small recovery rate, and the situation is
                     worse in smaller urban centers. In cities where recovery is good, it is either due to collection of new
                     connection charges or due to levying of sewerage/drainage tax. Further investigation and expert advice
                     is required, but it seems any attempt to set up CETPs for industrial use would first require a mechanism
                     to handle domestic sewage. This means increased costs and direct involvement with municipalities,
                     adding to complexities.

                  Research for this report revealed that the Government of Rajasthan had, through PDCOR, a joint
                  venture between Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited and the state government,
                  commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to undertake an infrastructure mapping exercise
                  for the state in 2003. As part of the mandate, PwC had conducted initial screening for certain key
                  industrial clusters to help set up CETPs and augment industrial water supply by diverting a portion of
                  water meant for domestic use towards industrial supply. The final outcome of the exercise is however
                  unclear. A few STP projects have been proposed under the Indian Business Alliance on Water
                  (IBAW)[139] (refer to appendix F of this report and illustration IV under 11.3.1).

                  In light of the stressful water situation, which threatens the viability of certain industries, support from
                  industry is easy to garner. The key for any private intervention would be to develop the right working
                  model with municipalities where domestic sewage is part of the project. Costs, risks, cross-subsidies,
                  and suitable uses for treated water would be the main areas to tackle[140].


                  11.1.7	           Industry – Water Efficiency
                  Water foot printing studies of the kind already executed by IFC will be helpful in the context of
                  water intensive industries such as textile, cement and marble. Findings could help establish much
                  needed industry best practices in water use, and help influence policy direction and eventually help
                  regulation of industrial water use. Other uses of such an exercise would be tariff reform to penalize
                  wasteful units (refer to mention of water audits in SWP[141] in section 11.6 above). The CII-Triveni Water
                  Institute based in Jaipur could be a relevant partner with IFC on this intervention (see details in
                  illustration IV under 11.3.1) in this chapter.

               Figure 32 details how the state government prioritizes water use, although, sadly, this is not always followed. For
               the best outcome, it is critical that IFC similarly set its own priorities before intervening in this stark water situation.

               Now that the background and purpose, of each of the seven potential private sector interventions has been
               presented in sections 11.1 through 11.7 of this chapter, it is time to prioritize by assessing these interventions on
               the basis of:

               Degree of positive impact in addressing Rajasthan’s overall water problem, compared to the level of effort
               required to execute each intervention (refer to figure 33).

               Figure 33 maps each of the seven interventions in terms of their impact on Rajasthan’s water situation from high
               to low, and the corresponding effort needed for each intervention from easy to difficult. The placing of each
               intervention in the various gradients is based on the facts and their critical analysis presented in this report. With
               this background, the top three most effective interventions, numbered in brackets, in order of positive impact are:

               1.	 Rural drinking water – off-grid (1)

               2.	 Tie between rural/peri-urban drinking water on-grid (2) and agriculture – non canal
                   (groundwater and rain fed) (5)

       Drinking water needs come before all else and, compared to urban areas, have been neglected in the rural
       and peri-urban context. On the other hand, the sheer magnitude of water being consumed by rain fed and
       groundwater-irrigated agriculture in the state and its correlation to food-security explains the tie above.

       The three most difficult interventions in terms of time, resource, and effort are:

       1.	 Agriculture – non canal (groundwater and rain fed) (5)

       2.	 Rural drinking water – off-grid (1)

       3.	 Agriculture – canal irrigated (4)

       As explained in earlier sections, interventions (6) and (7) relating to industrial water are comparatively lower
       on both the impact and effort scale, but still important in their own right, with efficiency of water use being the
       most actionable. Intervention (3) relating to on-grid urban water supply, both in terms of impact and effort,
       falls somewhat mid-way between industrial interventions as a group on one end, and rural/peri-urban drinking
       water and agricultural interventions at the other end.

               11.3	Recommendations
               The seven interventions and their analysis presented above, brings us to our concluding section on
               recommendations, that is, specific answers to the ‘Where do we go from here?’ question.

               After detailed assessment of all relevant facts, IFC could take up at least one initiative in each of these three
               sectors, namely, drinking water supply, agri-water nexus, and industrial water use.

               Having a multi-pronged approach will allow IFC to deeply engage with the Rajasthan water sector as a
               recognized solutions provider. Since water is a common resource, each sector is linked to the other. Water
               efficiency created in one sector, can quickly dwindle if the misuse continues elsewhere. Having an integrated
               approach that comprehensively addresses all water use in a watershed/geography is most desirable.
               With current annual trends of deterioration, in a few decades, water sustainability itself could become an
               unachievable goal in Rajasthan. Hence there is a need approach the problem from all angles while there is
               time. It is however important to prioritize.

               IFC can first take up rural water supply, agricultural water efficiency, and industrial water stewardship. These
               areas stand to benefit from the right kind of private sector intervention. Further due diligence and involvement
               of additional parties, both within and outside IFC, is required in order to crystallize recommendations into
               feasible projects. However effort has been made by the author to influence rapid action with four realistic
               project proposals for IFC to deliberate upon (see illustrations in section 11.3.1). Please note that certain
               proposals are presented in greater detail while a few are just ideas needing further diligence.

               	           Sustainable Agriculture with Water Efficiency in Rajasthan–
                           SAWER[143] (pronounced ‘saver’)
                     Improving productivity of water use, or simply put - more crop per drop, in agriculture is an important
                     part of the bigger goal of managing agricultural demand for water. The idea is to free up and transfer
                     this saved water to higher priority areas such as drinking water, to use water more efficiently, and
                     reduce groundwater draft while promoting recharge.

                     The author hereby proposes the Sustainable Agriculture with Water Efficiency in Rajasthan, or
                     SAWER program. This will be an IFC supported program to address water use in agriculture for the
                     state. Under a pilot program, specific geographies in the state will be shortlisted from both canal and
                     groundwater irrigated areas. The overall program objective will be to achieve water saving, balance
                     water use between agriculture and domestic sectors, and increase food security with enhanced crop
                     yield in the project areas.




    [143]	 Author’s recommended name to convey the essence of the program - Sustainable Agriculture with Water Efficiency in
           Rajasthan, or ‘SAWER’ where the emphasis is on “W” for water. Should the program, under this name, be adopted by IFC,
           further due diligence is recommended to ensure there are no copyright and other violations. Preliminary Internet search on
           “SAWER” reveals no meaningful results.

                                                                                                                                            AND ANALYSIS




                  This would be achieved with an umbrella effort to bring together the following key interventions:
                  (a) partner with manufacturers to bring suitable water saving technologies (WSTs) to farmers
                  to increase irrigation productivity and reduce pressure on demand for water from the sector;
                  (b) influence a shift towards cropping patterns suited to the agro-climatic conditions prevalent in the
                  state, increase crop yields, and create market linkages for these crops geared to maximize economic
                  benefits to farmers; (c) initiate public private dialogue (PPD) with the state government to address
                  agricultural pricing and water delivery in a manner that ensures farmer acceptance for reform;
                  (d) partner with the government to influence institutional reform for efficient subsidy payout designed
                  to promote adoption of micro irrigation (MI) technologies, unlike the trend so far where subsidies have
                  largely remained ineffective; (e) partner with appropriate microfinance institutions (MFIs)/financial
                  partners to bridge subsidy gaps in purchase of MI equipment and aid construction of infrastructure
                  needed to support MI devices; and (f) partner with local non-governmental organizations (NGOs)/
                  communities to mobilize farmer participation, create awareness for WSTs aimed at expanding reach to
                  all economic sections of farmers and increase probability of long term use.

                  Based on response, the scope can be expanded to include additional agendas such as water security
                  and sanitation in the pilot geography, watershed management, and economic inclusion through self-
                  help groups (SHGs).

                  SAWER would fall under interventions 11.1.4 and 11.1.5 described in this chapter. It is
                  described in greater detail in the pages that follow. Since effective implementation of MI technologies
                  is crucial to the program’s success, that too is discussed in the following pages[144]. These findings
                  have been researched and presented as market needs, failures, and barriers. As for market players,
                  these are addressed in the concluding paragraph of this illustration. Further, in the conclusion to this
                  section the author has recommended an action plan to help IFC initiate SAWER.

            The effectiveness of WSTs in achieving water productivity varies between crops and technologies. Available
            data on MI and its impact on water usage, crop yield, water productivity, and economics of adoption, is heavily
            skewed towards drip systems, with little or no information on sprinklers and plastic mulching. There are several
            physical, socio-economic, and institutional/policy constraints limiting large-scale adoption of WSTs. This is
            despite heavy central and state sponsored government subsidies that have been around for several years now.
            Creating institutional capacity for technology extension, designing water/electricity pricing and supply policies,
            and building proper irrigation and power supply infrastructure will play a crucial role in facilitating large-scale
            adoption of MI systems.

       Rajasthan, a separate, similar study for the state is required to confirm several findings. Efforts have been made to specifically

    Market Needs
                1.	 Awareness/Accessibility: Successful adoption of MI technologies requires technical and economically
                    efficient models, awareness among target beneficiaries about the technical/economic superiority of
                    these technologies, and accessibility of technologies to potential users.

                2.	 Cultivable Command Area (CCA) Infrastructure: Intermediate storage systems are essential for farmers
                    to use water from surface schemes for MI irrigation systems, and pumps are required to lift water from
                    storage. These needs can be addressed with suitable private and government interventions.

                3.	 Pricing and Supply Reform for CCA: In addition to measures suggested for groundwater irrigated
                    areas relating to administration of subsidies and extension activities, the way to bring CCAs under
                    micro-irrigation is to either change delivery practices or increase economic incentives. The practice of
                    delivering water through gravity can be changed to accommodate MI systems. The delivery systems
                    need to be designed in such a way that farmers can directly connect the source to their distribution
                    system. This means that the irrigation agency would have to work out new schedules in such a way
                    that the duration between two turns becomes much shorter than the present 2 to 3 weeks[145]. The cost
                    of irrigation needs to be effectively increased (from the current free water), so that cost savings offered
                    by MI act as an incentive, and justify heavy investment in storage tanks and extra pumping devices.
                    Power tariffs for surface irrigation schemes will be important in achieving this, although this is difficult
                    to implement. While pricing slowly catches up to reflect the true cost of irrigation water through power
                    tariff reforms, a more acceptable solution in the near to medium term will be to incentivize farmers
                    through subsidies for adopting these technologies. This could offset the cost of building intermediate
                    storage systems. The increased returns from lift irrigation over canal irrigation and from drip-irrigated
                    crops will be the strongest incentive for farmers to adopt intermediate storage systems[146]. The
                    increased returns could be due to the better control over water delivery with lift or due to the increased
                    ability to grow more profitable crops in the command areas.

                4.	 Pricing and Power Reform for Groundwater Irrigation: Improving power supply, both quality of power
                    and hours of supply, is needed to boost adoption of pressurized WSTs in areas where sufficient
                    groundwater is available for irrigation. But power supply regulation restricts pumping, at least in the
                    case of poorer farmers. The ideal policy environment for promotion of water-saving crop and irrigation
                    technologies in well/tube well-irrigated areas will be pro-rata pricing of electricity. While this will
                    create direct incentive for efficient water use, the extent to which efficient irrigation technologies will
                    reduce energy use will depend on crop type and the type of MI technology, pressurized system or
                    gravity drip system. This is because not all WSTs technologies are energy efficient. Hence, bringing
                    non-conventional or non-pressurized drip systems under the ambit of subsidies is important once
                    consumption-based pricing of electricity is introduced. It will also force farmers in areas irrigated by
                    diesel engines to adopt WSTs as it could save precious diesel and reduce input costs. Introducing
                    metering of agricultural pumps and recovering consumption-based charges for power use will not be
                    easy. While in the long term, total metering and consumption-based pricing would be the most desired
                    scenario, the government can start with metering of agricultural consumption. Cash incentives or heavy

                                                                                                                               AND ANALYSIS




                 subsidies for WSTs could be provided to farmers who are willing to use them, subject to reducing their
                 electricity consumption. It could be an inverse function of the connected load or the average energy
                 consumed and the area under WSTs for irrigation.

           5.	 Mitigating Technologies for Groundwater Irrigation: Some new irrigation technologies such as sub-
               surface irrigation systems and micro-tube drips do not require pressure heads. Farmers who get
               water through underground pipelines can lift it to small heights to generate the required head to
               run sub-surface drip systems. Thus, the technical feasibility of using new non-conventional water
               saving technologies would be high among farmers who are either water buyers or share wells with
               other farmers. In the case of large well/tube well commands, if a low height overhead tank can be
               constructed in the middle of the command, the hours of water delivery can be increased from 10 hours
               to 24 hours for the entire command. This will ensure that the entire command is covered with enough
               water left over to irrigate additional areas as well. This is because discharge from the tube well remains
               unaffected while water requirement reduces significantly. Instead of applying water at weekly intervals,
               the fields can be irrigated daily or on every alternate day. This is important from the point of view of
               increasing the physical efficiency of the system. The storage efficiency, for instance, will increase when
               the amount of water applied is less than or equal to the field capacity of the soil. Different holdings can
               be covered in rotations over a day.

           6.	 Subsidy and Payout Reform: Improving the administration of subsidies is important. Though subsidies
               have been in existence for the past several years, the benefits have been negligible. Farmers should
               be made to pay the full cost of the system initially, and subsidies could be released in installments
               based on periodic review of performance of the system in the farm. This will drive away farmers who
               are not motivated to use the system. Manufacturers should sell the systems at market prices instead
               of subsidized prices, which will compel them to improve the competitiveness of their products in
               the market. This will also compel them to provide good technical input services to sustain demand.
               On the other hand, there is a need to create a separate agency to promote MI, which will expedite
               processing of applications from farmers. The agency can work in tandem with the manufacturers and
               farmers to enable timely technical inputs to farmers. In areas where agricultural processing units are
               concentrated, providing all critical inputs including subsidies will not be a problem. But, this will be an
               issue in areas where demand for drip irrigation is scattered vis-à-vis crops and geographical spread.
               This underlines the need for a separate agency. The agency should facilitate the survey of farmers’
               fields by the manufacturer, and get designs and estimates prepared along with the most desirable
               cropping system. This will also help farmers procure the system well in advance of the crop season to
               make full use of it[147].

    Market Barriers
               1.	 Poor Outreach: A majority of low-cost MI technology adopters are farmers in the middle, rich, and
                   richest groups. Reducing cost alone is not enough to improve reach of these technologies to the poor
                   where, in addition to water saving, the socio-economic impact would be the highest. Available low-cost
                   systems are suited to crops that are not popular among poor farmers who tend to allot a significant
                   proportion of their land to staples such as cereals and pulses. Their socioeconomic attributes limit
                   their access to information. Limited access to resources, specifically to groundwater, quantitatively and
                   qualitatively, hinders poor farmers from successfully adopting low-cost MI technologies.

               2.	 Inappropriate Cropping Pattern: Another major socioeconomic constraint to adoption of conventional
                   WSTs is the existing cropping patterns in water-scarce regions. MI adoption may warrant shift to
                   economically high yielding varieties to generate suitable returns and help pay back investment. Among
                   easily available WSTs for irrigation, conventional drip irrigation systems are best to achieve highest
                   efficiency. These systems are most suitable for horticultural crops from an economic point of view[148].
                   This is because the additional investment for drip irrigation has to be offset mainly by the better yield
                   and returns to the farmer, since input costs savings are not very significant[149]. Low cost drip irrigation
                   systems have low physical efficiency when used for crops in which the plant spacing is small[150]. The
                   system can be used for some row crops which are common in the region, provided fixed spacing
                   between rows and plants is maintained, and this is an issue. Due to un-even field conditions, designing
                   and installing drippers become difficult. However, socio-economic viability of changing crops increases
                   with the size of the farmer’s holding. Since small and marginal farmers account for a large percentage
                   of holdings, the adoption of horticultural crops by farmers in these regions will not be high without
                   interventions, given horticulture crops need at least 3 to 4 years to start yielding returns (except for
                   pomegranate). Therefore, farmers’ agricultural practices need major changes for adoption of WSTs.

               3.	 CCA Delivery Systems: Drips, including non-pressurized and sprinklers, are not conducive to flow
                   irrigation due to two reasons. First, there is a mismatch between water delivery schedules followed in
                   surface irrigation from canals and minor irrigation tanks and that to be followed when MI systems are to
                   be used. Normally, in surface command areas farmers get their turn once in 10 to15 days at flow rates
                   ranging from 0.5 to 1 cusecs. With sprinklers and drip, water should be applied to the crop either daily
                   or once in two days with lower flow rates equal to the evapo-transpiration.

               4.	 Co-owned Wells and Water Purchase Practices: The generally accepted belief is that adoption of
                   drip irrigation will be more enthusiastic in areas irrigated by well water. But, there are two factors that
                   that can negate this. In groundwater over-exploited areas ownership of wells does not always lie with
                   individual farmers, but groups[151] who get water through underground pipelines at almost negligible
                   water pressure (head). In order to use the conventional sprinkler and drip systems, greater water
                   pressure (1-1.2 kg/cm2) is required. This is not possible unless the systems are directly connected
                   to the tube well. If the systems are not connected to the delivery pipe of the tube wells, a static head
                   of nearly 12 m is required to run the sprinklers, in turn consuming high energy which is a constraint.

                                                                                                                               AND ANALYSIS




                  Second, there is a practice of purchasing water by farmers in some groundwater irrigated areas[152] making
                  them insensitive to the use of water saving devices. In both these situations, adoption of MI systems will
                  be technically infeasible. Further studies validating these or similar situations are required for Rajasthan.

            5.	 Groundwater Quality: Another important constraint is the high TDS of groundwater pumped from deep
                aquifers in Rajasthan. If this water is used for irrigation, the conventional drippers that are exposed to
                sunlight get choked due to salt deposition in the dripper perforations, needing regular cleaning (using
                mild acids like the hydrochloric acid). Farmers generally are not willing to bear the burden of this regular
                maintenance.

Negative Externalities in Groundwater Pumping: Presence of negative externalities in groundwater pumping poses
an important constraint for those who would like to adopt any WST. Most often, farmers tap groundwater from the
same aquifer, and well interference is very common not only in hard rock areas, but also shallow alluvial areas.
Under such conditions, pumping by one farmer will have an effect on pumping by another farmer. Due to this reason,
cutting down pumping rates by a farmer may not result in increased future availability of groundwater for him/her.
The efforts to save water from the system by an individual farmer might mean increased availability of groundwater to
his/her neighbors. However, farmers who pump water from open wells have greater incentive to invest in water saving
technologies. This is owing to the fact that the open wells act as groundwater storage systems as well as recovery
systems and adoption of WST will mean greater water availability in the coming days. The most impact among MI
adopters noted in study locations was changes in cropping pattern, cropping intensity and/or crop diversity, all of
them significant factors that influence sustainable use of groundwater resources. MI adoption has further improved
cropping intensity by enabling production of crops in the summer or rabi. In the long run, water sustainability
objectives may conflict with poverty reduction and food security objectives unless a proper regulatory mechanism
is instituted. This is because farmers previously suffering from frequent crop failure or yield losses due to water
shortage will now use saved water to obtain a normal harvest or minimize yield losses. Secondly, those previously
irrigating only part of their potentially irrigable fields due to the inadequacy of water will use saved water to increase
the irrigated area; and third, the high marginal productivity of water may spark the demand for more groundwater
resources. The second and the third scenarios could lead to groundwater overdraft, a fact reported by farmers
in Maharashtra who claim that despite 15 years of using MI, groundwater levels have substantially declined and
concentrations of wells have increased.


Market Failures
            1.	 Limited Power Supply for Groundwater Irrigation: Power supply regulation is a major constraint in the
                adoption of pressurized irrigation systems. Under MI devices, well discharge will decline sharply when
                sprinkler and drip systems start running due to increase in pressure, though the water requirement for
                unit area of irrigated land will reduce. Since available power supply is fully utilized during important
                cropping seasons, the amount of time for which the well will be operational will be just sufficient to irrigate
                the existing command. Hence, farmers cannot expand the area under irrigation and increase irrigation
                intensity, or go in for high water-consuming cash crops, although debatable in the context of Rajasthan.
                Creating overhead storage for pumped water or installing an additional pump to generate adequate
                pressure will not be an economically viable proposition.

                                                                            113                                       FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INTERVENTIONS
               2.	 Agricultural Power Tariff: For well owners under zero power tariff or flat rate system of pricing, marginal
                   cost of pumping and using groundwater is zero. It is only the limited hours of power supply that
                   acts as a constraint for farmers from using more water or expanding area under irrigation. Hence,
                   the direct additional financial returns farmers can get by introducing water saving technologies are
                   from increased crop yield and not cost savings. This will not happen unless the farmer adopts new
                   agronomic practices. Hence in some areas, farmers would rather pump extra hours to sell water to the
                   other farmers than use the water more efficiently in their own fields which would involve substantial
                   financial investments. Conventional WSTs are physically and economically less feasible for smaller
                   plots due to fixed overhead costs of energy and the various components of these irrigation systems
                   such as filters and overhead tanks[153]. Farmers using diesel engines for pumping groundwater will
                   have little incentive to adopt, as with farmers in areas with poor electrification or power supply.

               3.	 Administration of Subsidies and Manufacturer Slack: The administration of subsidies for MI systems
                   has also worked against the interest of their promotion. Many farmers purchase sprinkler systems
                   just to avail of the benefits of government subsidy, which is up to 50 to 70 percent. Since in many
                   cases, the government pays the subsidy directly to the manufacturer, the farmer gets the system at
                   discounted prices. The company carries out the entire documentation for obtaining the subsidy and
                   absorbs delays in getting the subsidy from the government. Due to this, manufacturers price high to
                   recover their interest on capital and transaction costs. The companies which supply the systems are
                   not interested in after-sales service or ensuring quality control while farmers themselves do not realize
                   the full value of the asset, and do not maintain them. Moreover, since funds available for subsidies are
                   limited, the smartest of farmers get the benefit. The government officials, who come and inspect the
                   systems installed, only check the materials supplied and work out the subsidy that has to be paid.

FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INTERVENTIONS                                                    114
                                                                                                                             POLICY BACKGROUND




Policy Background
In addition to the policy thrust supporting agricultural interventions described in section 11.1.4 and 5 in this chapter,
the Government of India issued updated guidelines under its National Mission in Micro Irrigation (NMMI)[154] scheme.
These form the foundation for the proposed MI initiatives under the IFC supported SAWER program, hence the need to
highlight its key points:

           ¬¬   Subsidy: Under the centrally sponsored scheme, 40 percent of the cost of the MI system will be borne by
                the center, 10 percent by the state government, and the remaining by the beneficiary either through his/her
                own resources or loans from financial institutions. Additional assistance of 10 percent of the cost of the MI
                system will be borne by the center for small and marginal farmers.

           ¬¬   Eligibility: All categories of farmers are eligible to avail assistance under this scheme. Assistance to
                farmers will be limited to a maximum area of five hectares per beneficiary. Seventy-five percent of the
                cost of drip and sprinkler demonstration, for a maximum area of 0.5 hectares per demonstration, will be
                borne by the central government. Assistance will be available for both drip and sprinkler irrigation for wide
                spaced, as well as close spaced crops. However, assistance for sprinkler irrigation systems will be available
                only for those crops where drip irrigation is uneconomical. Assistance will be available for irrigation
                systems for protected cultivation including greenhouses, polyhouses and shadenet houses. Assistance will
                be available for implementation of advanced technology like fertigation with fertilizer tank/venturi systems,
                sand filters/media filters, hydro cyclone filters/sand separators and other different type of filters, and valves
                required for MI system.

           ¬¬   Planning/Monitoring: Panchayat Raj institutions (PRIs), or rural local bodies, will be involved in promoting
                the scheme and identification of priority areas. At the national level, the executive committee of NMMI
                will review the progress of NMMI and approve the annual action plans of states. At the state level, the
                state micro-irrigation committee will oversee the implementation of the mission program in districts. The
                district micro-irrigation committee will coordinate the implementation of NMMI program at the district level.
                National Commission on Plasticulture Application in Horticulture (NCPAH) will coordinate and monitor the
                program of NMMI in different States.

           ¬¬   Implementation: The scheme will be implemented by an implementing agency (IA) at the state level duly
                appointed by the state government. Funds will be released directly to the IA on the basis of approved plans
                for each year. It shall prepare the annual action plan for the state on the basis of the district plans and get
                it forwarded by state MI committee for approval of the executive committee of NMMI. State agency shall
                forward copies of the consolidated proposal to Ministry of Agriculture. Payment will be made through wire
                to the IA, which will transfer funds to the identified districts. District committees will provide funds to the
                system suppliers through the farmers/beneficiaries.

           ¬¬   Manufacturers: Registration of system manufacturers will be done by the MI committee at state level for
                use in the districts. Supply of good quality system, both for drip and sprinkler irrigation, having Bureau of
                Indian Standards marking and proper after sales service to the satisfaction of the farmers, is paramount.

                                                                      115                                       FOR PRIVATE SECTOR INTERVENTIONS
             ¬¬   Technical Support: Technical support at the national and state levels will be provided by NCPAH, which will
                  be suitably strengthened by deploying experts in various related fields of agriculture, water management,
                  and information technology in the form of a technical support group, which at the national level will be
                  housed in the NCPAH secretariat. NCPAH will recruit professionals, as required on contract basis. The
                  honorarium will be fixed by the executive committee depending on qualifications, experience, and expertise
                  of the experts in accordance with the norms being followed in other schemes like National Horticulture
                  Mission and National Food Security Mission (NFSM).

                                              SAWER - Action Plan
                  In light of the above information presented under market needs, failures, and barriers, there is a need
                  to verify some of the concerns regarding limitations of MI technologies under certain conditions.
                  Positive feedback from this due diligence should ideally be a pre-requisite to invest in the promise
                  of these technologies. IFC could commission an independent Rajasthan-specific study on factors
                  influencing MI technology promotion and adoption. The study should aim to clearly highlight the
                  physical, socio-economic, and institutional/policy factors at play in various parts of the state. On the
                  basis of research for this report, the recommended partner for such a study is the IWMI-TATA Water
                  Policy Program. If findings are encouraging, as a first step it would be advisable to identify potential
                  program partners, see initial input below. However once program objectives and format are made
                  more clear, collective thought is required to include most suitable partners. Next, a two to three day
                  workshop (format to be brainstormed) could be organized by IFC. Goal of the workshop will be to
                  initiate idea exchange, and narrow down final program objectives, project geography, and partners.
                  With this information in place, program structuring, timelines, and formal signing of memoranda
                  of understanding with partners would be the next logical step before implementation. One-on-one
                  meetings with government and potential partners during the event planning process for the workshop
                  will provide IFC with the opportunity to introduce itself and provide context before the group event.
                  Additionally, a formal kick-off event of this nature will provide a launch platform for IFC in the
                  Rajasthan water sector and help generate needed media/public awareness of its efforts.


    Potential Partners
    In order to identify potential partners, additional investigation and discussions are required. However the following
    information provides a starting point:

             1.	 MI Technology Players - Top three players in Indian market to be invited for discussion: Jain Irrigation
                 (JISL), Netafim, and Finolex Plasson. One mid-tier representative, Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals or
                 Premier Irrigation Adritec (these, along with the top three account for 85 percent of the market in India),
                 can also be involved. Smaller/newer firms to be included for their unique perspective could be Driptech
                 (US-based, selling through dealer network of Godrej Agrovet), and Mahindra and Mahindra (largest tractor
                 manufacturer in India, which recently entered the market through an acquisition).

             2.	 NGOs - Two of the most experienced in MI area - Aga Khan Rural Support Program (recruits and trains
                 assemblers and village extension volunteers, mainly in Gujarat), and International Development Enterprises,
                 which focuses on designing/redesigning MI technologies, to make them more poor-friendly, and creating
                 awareness. While it does not subsidize financial investment, it may connect farmers to financial institutions.
                 Rajasthan based NGOs, with focus on agriculture as part of their work, include GRAVIS (specifically
                 focused on desert area), and CECOEDECON (focused in and around Jaipur). Soft support with community
                 mobilization would be an important aspect. Here, most active NGOs in Rajasthan are Jal Bhagirathi
                 Foundation, Bhoruka Charitable Trust, Sambhav Trust, and Tarun Bharat Sangh.

           3.	 Agri Research - IWMI-Tata Water Policy Research Program was established under a financial partnership
               between IWMI and Sir Ratan Tata Trust, Mumbai with the idea of promoting practical, policy research in
               water resources management. The program has been in operation since March 2000; since then it has
               worked with some 40 partners and completed over 70, usually small, research projects. IWMI is a Sri-Lanka
               based non-profit scientific organization funded by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural
               Research. Swami Keshwanand Rajasthan Agricultural University and Precision Farming Development
               Centre (PFDC) at Bikaner, Rajasthan can help form the technical support group according to guidelines
               from National Mission in Micro Irrigation (NMMI).

           4.	 Government - Agriculture Production Commissioner (APC)/Principal Secretary (Horticulture/Agriculture).
               According to NMMI guidelines, the State Micro Irrigation Committee (SMIC) will be under the chairmanship
               of the APC/Secretary (Horticulture/Agriculture). Principal Secretary, Water Resources (also a member
               SMIC). Other central and state bodies could be considered such as Ministry of Rural Development and
               National Commission on Plasticulture Application in Horticulture (NCPAH).

           5.	 Finance - Center For Microfinance (CMF), which is actively involved in Rajasthan (example, the state
               government has launched a project[155] in western Rajasthan for which technical assistance will be
               provided by CMF, expected to impact 87,000 households across 1,040 villages in Western Rajasthan).
               MFIs to be considered are SKS Microfinance, BASIX Social Enterprise Group, Share MicroFin (sister
               concern of Asmitha), and Pustikar. These are active MFIs in Rajasthan with maximum loan outstanding
               and/or client reach as of March 2011. Efforts are needed to locate additional agriculture-specific MFIs, and
               CMF would be the potential link. Other institutions for consideration would be National Bank for Agriculture
               and Rural Development (NABARD) and non-banking finance institutions (NBFCs)/banks with special focus
               on agriculture.

           6.	 Program Sponsors - IFC would itself be a sponsor; additional recommendations include Sir Ratan Tata
               Trust. Under its Water Sector Research Program, the trust is involved in several relevant topics that
               are common to SAWER objectives, many of these are directly focused on agricultural water use and
               Rajasthan among other similar arid/semi-arid geographies; and CII-Water Institute, a joint initiative of the
               Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) and the state government, meant to focus on all issues related to
               water management including detailed water audits for industry, facilitating zero water discharge, rainwater
               harvesting, wastewater treatment, and desalination. The state government has formed the Rajasthan
               Business Community Alliance on Water, an alliance with the World Economic Forum, CII and UNDP to
               implement statewide water, and water shed management programs incorporating PPCP models.

           7.	 Agencies/Consortiums - Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture (CA) is a
               multi-institute process aimed at identifying existing knowledge on ways to manage water resources. Its
               main output is the assessment synthesis report along the lines of the millennium ecosystem assessment
               and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment reports, and has formal linkages with the
               International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development. It provides in-depth
               analysis of water and food issues that are inadequately addressed in other global exercises. IFC could
               identify other international agencies as well as most relevant groups within the UN and the World Bank.
               Possibilities include WWF, UNDP   , and IMI.

                             Rainwater Harvesting Program - Harvest to Drink[156]
                     Rural/peri-urban drinking water supply could be a high priority area for IFC intervention in the
                     Rajasthan water sector for reasons discussed in detail throughout this report. The over dependence
                     on groundwater resources (85 percent) for current rural drinking water needs is on very shaky
                     ground. While promised in the Public Health and Engineering Department reform agenda, the wait for
                     surface resource-based schemes can be excruciatingly long for low priority rural areas. Besides, the
                     capital-intensive nature of surface schemes and physical limitations imposed by locations, far flung
                     as these are, raise serious doubts about the viability of these schemes.

                     Additionally, given the fact that more than half of rural habitations in the state remain either partially
                     or fully uncovered by drinking water, combined with the state government’s public acknowledgement
                     of lack of funds and failure to meet goals under the National Rural Drinking Water Mission (NRDWM)
                     mission, the need for intervention is clear. While NGOs, voluntary organizations, and international
                     agencies among others continue to work in this area, there is potential to cover more ground under a
                     professionally managed private effort. Part of the solution in rural areas clearly has to be RWH.

                     Harvest to Drink Program is recommended to be an IFC supported RWH program. The primary
                     program objective will be to provide sustainable drinking water to rural communities in Rajasthan. For
                     the pilot, the focus can be on rooftop RWH. These are individual assets, hence more dependable.
                     Since they are insulated from complexities of community management they have better chances
                     of being maintained. In exceptional cases where rooftop harvesting option is not viable due to any
                     reason, and there are reasons to support an anomaly, alternate water harvesting options could be
                     taken up under the pilot.

                     Under the program model, the cost of construction of structures will be broken into three parts –
                     user funded down payment in cash or kind (mostly kind in terms of portion of the material and labor
                     cost), user financed (with MF assistance), and government borne subsidy (assuming government
                     cooperates). Based on user affordability, the model will further take two forms - a heavily subsidized
                     model for below poverty line (BPL) (or alternate definition that accurately reflects the user’s economic
                     status), and another non-subsidized (or marginally subsidized) model for users who can afford with
                     financing help.

                                                                                                                                     POLICY BACKGROUND




                 In order to make this a robust proposition for the government, the following can be considered:
                 (a) The possibility to integrate the program with the village water security plan (VWSP) exercise
                 being conducted by the state government can be explored. During the author’s meeting[157] with the
                 Jaipur-based Indian Institute of Health Management Research which is engaged in this planning, it
                 was revealed that, post planning, PHED will take over implementation. Lack of institutional capacity
                 with the department to undertake such a project needing community engagement among other
                 measures, is good reason to offer an intervention. (b) Under VWSP or separately, the potential to
                 include a sanitation dimension to the program must be evaluated with the Water and Sanitation
                 Program (WSP) of the World Bank as potential partner[158]. (c) Finally, given the glaring lack of
                 livelihood options witnessed in some of these areas with acute drinking water crisis, possibilities to
                 engage program beneficiaries in productive livelihood activities must be evaluated (potential for self-
                 help groups).


                                              Harvest to Drink - Action Plan
                 As a first step, in order to ascertain the feasibility of the program, IFC can engage in informal
                 discussions with experienced participants in the water harvesting space in the state such as: IIHMR
                 since they are in direct contact with the state government and have implemented several RWH
                 structures with the help of their sister entity Bhoruka Charitable Trust; BASIX Social Enterprise
                 Group, given its work with Safe Water Networks (SWN), and Center for Microfinance (CMF) given its
                 insight into financial players active throughout the state; Ministry of Water Resources, Government
                 of Rajasthan to evaluate its interest and explore possibilities to integrate the program with ongoing
                 efforts under the ministry.

                 Based on responses, a brief evaluation must be commissioned to study the statewide landscape,
                 especially to ascertain user affordability aspects. Based on the author’s assessment so far, potential
                 study partners could be one or more of the following - CMF, IIHMR, and IWMI-TATA. The study should
                 highlight key geographic pockets for intervention, both from an impact and viability standpoint (ability
                 of beneficiaries to pay), complete with supporting demographic, economic, and physical facts.

                IFC supported Drinking Water Intervention under the PURA Scheme
                Provision of Urban Amenities in Rural Areas or PURA, is a central government sponsored scheme
                under the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) to provide various infrastructure and related
                services under a PPP format, including drinking water supply, to a cluster of villages in about ten
                locations nationwide. With primary focus on rural areas, this is a unique scheme to bring private
                sector intervention through a risk, resource, and asset sharing partnership (touted to be one of its
                kind in the world). Here is a brief scheme description:

                MoRD has re-launched the PURA scheme as a central sector scheme. MoRD with support from DEA,
                and the technical assistance of ADB, intends to implement the PURA scheme under a PPP framework
                between gram panchayats (elected local village bodies), and private sector partners. The scheme
                envisages twinning of rural infrastructure development with economic regeneration activities and is
                the first attempt at delivering a basket of infrastructure and amenities through PPP in the rural areas.
                The scope of the scheme is to select private partners to develop livelihood opportunities, urban
                amenities, and infrastructure facilities under prescribed service levels, and to be responsible for its
                maintenance for a period of ten years in select panchayats or cluster of panchayats. Private sector
                entities having experience in development and management of community-oriented infrastructure
                projects were selected through an open competitive bidding process based on rigorous qualifications
                and evaluation criteria. The selected private partners are required to provide amenities like water
                supply and sewerage, roads, drainage, solid waste management, street lighting and power
                distribution, and undertake certain economic and skill development activities as part of the PURA
                project. Private partners may also provide add-on revenue-earning facilities such as village-linked
                tourism, integrated rural hub, rural market, agri-common services center, and warehousing. In
                addition to the amenities mentioned above, where the PURA project spans several panchayats in a
                cluster, the private partner will propose sub-projects with PURA elements for each of the panchayats.

                Informal discussions with concerned individuals were undertaken by the author to investigate
                potential IFC role in PURA for Jaipur and Rajsamand in Rajasthan. If there is broad internal interest in
                the scheme, IFC can specifically evaluate scope for participation around drinking water supply, either
                alone or including sanitation with WSP as potential partner.

                This opportunity will allow IFC to engage in high priority areas of rural/peri urban drinking water,
                see sections 11.1.1 and 11.1.2. Depending on findings, there could be additional potential for IFC
                supported private sector interventions in PURA, especially agricultural.

                                                                   ILLUSTRATION IV


                       IFC supported Industrial Water Stewardship Program
                  Recognizing IFC’s prior experience with a water foot-printing project, a water foot printing/
                  stewardship program could likely be the most actionable project for IFC in Rajasthan water sector
                  in the near term. An important partner could be the CII-Triveni Water Institute a joint initiative of the
                  Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the government of Rajasthan. CII-TWI has conducted
                  water management studies and water audits in different sectors in Rajasthan[159]. IFC can initiate
                  dialogue with CII around water intensive industries described in earlier sections of this report with
                  the aim of helping establish sector best practices.

                  Additionally, IFC can consider the following specific developments and explore partnering
                  possibilities. While the latest status and specifics of these proposals are unknown, the examples
                  below serve as a broad idea of possible collaboration. In addition to industry, certain proposals
                  relate to drinking water and agriculture related interventions recommended in this report. For ease
                  of reference these are together presented here:

                  CII-Godrej GBC (division of CII) has formed the India Business Alliance on Water (IBAW)[160] with
                  USAID support, managed by UNDP. Separately, the state government has formed an alliance
                  called Rajasthan Community Business Alliance on Water (RBCAW), with the World Economic
                  Forum, CII and UNDP to implement statewide water and watershed management programs
                  incorporating PPCP models. IBAW is promoting RCBAW. RCBAW had short listed eight proposals
                  in first round under PPCP:

                  Industrial - Shree Cements-Municipal Wastewater Recycling at Beawer town, Ajmer district to
                  reuse 1,000 cubic meters of municipal wastewater for industrial purposes; and Doshion Municipal
                  Sewage Treatment and Recycling Plant at Ajmer, Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Kota (treated water
                  will be used for gardening, toilet flushing and industrial use, proposed under BOOT).

                  Drinking Water - Doshion desalination plants at Barmer, Jaisalmer, Bharatpur, Jaipur, Jalore and
                  Sirohi (to provide potable water and improved health, and reduction in morbidity/mortality rates,
                  proposed under BOOT); Jal Bhagirathi Foundation Desalination in Godawas, Barmer district to set
                  up community level desalination plants offering water at 10 paise per liter (or about $0.18 for 100
                  liters), compared to the current 25 paise per liter (about $0.45 for 100 liters) from private vendors;
                  and IIHMR water harvesting structures, Jhunjhunu district (multi-tier architecture rooftop RWH
                  consisting of home tanks, collective tanks and village tanks each of 20,000 liters, 100,000 liters
                  and 300,000 liters respectively, for availability of water, and reduction in pumping ground water)

                Irrigation - NM Sadguru Foundation water harvesting structures in Banswara and Jhalawar district
                (construction of five water harvesting structures and five community lift irrigation schemes at an
                estimated cost of $890,000, to benefit 5,875 households or 35,250 people, and arrest distressed
                migration, recharging of ground water and ensuring food security in the project area); IIHMR water
                harvesting structures for irrigation, Churu and Banswara districts (to engage 90 percent farmers with
                active involvement of NGOs, construct 100 tanks of 30,000 liters each using local knowhow to meet
                irrigation water demand by way of integrated water resource management); and Sewa Mandir water
                harvesting structures at Patarpadi village, Udaipur district (detailed project report submitted to the
                government of Rajasthan by Sewa Mandir, water harvesting through gravitational flow for irrigation in
                the tribal dominated project area).

                The water stewardship program will apply to the recommended intervention discussed under section
                11.1.7 of this chapter.

                Given the nature of certain industries in Rajasthan, that is high water consumption and high
                associated effluent discharge, any program to address water usage and wastewater discharge
                from these units will be an added effort in the sector equation. Importantly, the exercise could open
                PPD opportunities for IFC around industrial sector reforms, especially given CII’s memorandum
                of understanding with the state government. This could further lead to an industrial wastewater
                recycling intervention (11.1.6), which otherwise could be challenging to break into.

                                      Sample Performance Parameters for PPP operator


    Various sample performance parameters, that could be adopted for PPP projects, are listed below-

             1.	 Coverage of Connections with 24x7: The PPP Operator shall cover all the water connections with 24x7
                 water supply progressively within a specified time period. Continuous pressured water supply shall
                 mean that potable, safe quality water delivered continuously at 7m pressure at customer tap. Emergency
                 stoppages of not exceeding twelve hours and no more than an average of three emergency stoppages of
                 less than 12 hours each shall occur in any continuous period of six months.
             2.	 Assessment and Billing improvement: There shall be absolute increase in revenues other than arrears
                 collected by the PPP OPERATOR due to all his management efforts measured as percentage revenue
                 increase during every six months duration under review when compared to the revenue collected
                 during the preceding six months duration. The increase in revenue due to improved billing, collection,
                 new connections and reduction of illegal connections shall be attributed to the performance of the PPP
                 OPERATOR. Any increase in revenue due to increase in tariffs occurring due to change of law or change of
                 policies shall not be attributable to the performance of PPP OPERATOR. Revenue shall include all income
                 from water consumption including interest on outstanding payments, connection charges and pro-rata
                 charges if any but exclude any deposits remitted by customers.
             3.	 Revenue Water in 24x7 Area: The revenue water shall be progressively increased by PPP operator up to 85
                 percent within a specified time limit. This quantity shall mean the proportion measured in percentage terms
                 of total volume of water billed to customers in a designated supply area to that of the total system input
                 volume in that designated supply area in the Distribution Operating Zones to which the PPP OPERATOR is
                 supplying continuous pressurized water supply to the customer properties.
             4.	 Resolution of Complaints on Services in 24x7 Area: The operator shall resolve progressively 98 percent
                 of consumer complaints pertaining to water supply service issues including poor quality of water, low
                 pressure, no water, leakage, poor quality road restoration and any such service issues within 24 hours
             5.	 Resolutions of Complaints in the Entire Zones: The operator shall resolve progressively 98 percent
                 of consumer complaints pertaining to water supply service issues including poor quality of water, low
                 pressure, no water, leakage, poor quality road restoration and any such service issues within 24 hours.
             6.	 Leakage levels in 24x7 Area: The PPP operator shall reduce leakage level in the designated area
                 progressively to the level of 25 liter per connection per day per meter of pressure head.
             7.	 Quality Compliance in 24x7 Area: The water quality in the entire designated area shall be maintained
                 in terms of residual chlorine content, chemical quality and bacteriological quality. The exclusion is the
                 situations where the bulk water quality is tested for non-compliance of the specified water quality standards.
             8.	 Pressure Compliance in 24x7 Area: The PP operator shall maintain 7 m residual pressure at customer tap
                 or 10m residual pressure at the critical measurement point for 95 percent of water connections and critical
                 points in the designated area.
             9.	 The timeline for achievement for these parameters could, typically, be as follows for a project period of 84
                 months (can be viewed on Public Health and Engineering Department Website)
