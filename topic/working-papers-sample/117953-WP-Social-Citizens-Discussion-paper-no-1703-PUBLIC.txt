Abstract

Social pensions—non-contributory provisions for old age, mostly means-tested—have mushroomed
in the global South since the 1990s, and have also been advocated by international organizations.
Using the data base FLOORCASH constructed by the authors and their research team, we cover all
countries of the global South, to go beyond existing case studies and selective comparisons. We
investigate the contribution of social pensions to rights-based social protection and seek to explain
their spread across the global South.

While in Northern welfare states universal social services and social insurance are seen as the
hallmarks of social citizenship as conceived by T.H. Marshall, measured by indices such as Esping-
Andersen’s decommodification index, this paper advances a conceptualization of social rights that
includes means-tested benefits, in order to recognize the bigger role of non-contributory transfers in
developing countries. Applying a new measure of the social quality of social pensions, we detect
considerable differences between countries, which are not reducible to the common distinction
universal vs. means-tested benefits. Combing the social quality measure with the dimension of scale
(population covered), we identify four normative models of old-age security. One of these models
might herald a new social model for the South. Finally the paper applies event history analysis to
explain the spread of social pensions across the global South, finding that standard domestic variables,
subscription to international norms, and pension reform events were central drivers of social pension
expansion.

The rise of social cash transfers—means tested benefits for the poor and, less frequently,
universal benefits—in countries of the global South since the 1990s has been seen as a
‘development revolution’ (Hanlon et al. 2010). Social cash transfers in countries of the global
South are mostly categorical, in the sense of focusing on selected groups or categories
deemed to be deserving. In most countries, the biggest target groups are life course groups,
above all older persons and children. Schemes for older persons and children are the most
widespread varieties of social cash transfers. While ageing haunts Northern societies, in most
Southern countries children outnumber older persons. Still, when investigating the changing
nature of social protection in Southern countries, pensions are a crucial area, for two reasons.
First, social pensions often aim at providing subsistence for the beneficiaries, unlike family
allowances or child benefits which normally are designed to serve as income supplements,
also in countries of the North. Second, old age security is a traditional core area of the
Northern welfare state, and old-age pension insurance is part of the standard repertoire of
the International Labour Organization (ILO) in the field of social protection. Family
allowances, by contrast, have a much weaker tradition both in the North and South.

       Most studies of social pensions are case studies or address general issues like
financing or social impacts on households by exemplary recourse to selected countries. Very
few studies compare all social pensions across the global South or even worldwide, based on
quantitative data (Palacios and Sluchynskyy 2006, Böger 2013, Palacios and Knox-Vydmanov
2014; s.a. Knox-Vydmanov 2011). In this paper, we use the database FLOORCASH, which has
been constructed by the authors and their research group and covers all countries of the
global South. This data set has more differentiated variables than other data sets and was
created by the FLOOR team (see endnote 1) in an extremely time-demanding process,
drawing on a range of sources including national and international databases, national laws
and documents, and documents produced by international governmental as well as non-
governmental institutions. Social citizenship is normally analysed by qualitative methods in
case studies of single (or few) countries because social citizenship is more complex than
income poverty for which comparative quantitative data are available. However, our large



                                               1
database FLOORCASH has complex quantitative data that allow us to analyse social
citizenship to a degree, including detailed institutional data on benefit levels, conditions of
access as well as expenditure and beneficiaries.

       We inquire if and in what ways the spread of social pensions in the global South
indicates a major change in social protection in the South. More specifically, we hypothesize
that social pensions may enhance social citizenship for the poor. T.H. Marshall (1950) has
defined social rights and social citizenship as the evolutionary core of Northern welfare states.
In Northern welfare states, social citizenship has been associated with universal social
services (and with social insurance, as industrial citizenship) while means-tested benefits are
seen to fall short of social rights. Therefore, quantitative measures of social citizenship, like
Esping-Andersen’s decommodification index, have only been developed for non-means-
tested benefits. Considering that social pensions in the South cover much broader sections of
the population than in the North, the paper develops a social citizenship index for social
pensions in order to compare the social quality of social pensions in Southern countries. If we
find evidence of a substantial contribution of social pensions to social citizenship, this might
indicate a new social model in the South that realizes social citizenship, but in different ways
than Northern welfare states.

       In the first section we depict the worldwide spread of social pensions. In sections 2
and 3, we analyse the social quality of social pensions, first by reconstructing the structure of
entitlements under social pension programs (who gets what and how?), and second, building
on that, by creating a social citizenship index for social pensions and comparing all countries
in the global South using this index. In section 4, we distinguish four normative models of
social pensions, in view of two dimensions, social quality and scale (population covered) of
social pensions. In section 5, we do an event history analysis to explain the spread of social
pensions across the global South.

1. The Global Rise of Social Pensions

The term ‘social insurance’ mostly implies that employees and/or employers pay
contributions to finance the scheme, often supplemented (but not mainly financed) by state
subsidies. Social pensions differ from social insurance pensions by being financed by taxes
rather than contributions. The name ‘social pensions’ has become common currency in the
development community since the early 2000s (von Gliszczynski 2015). An earlier name was
‘non-contributory pensions’. Non-contributory pensions can also be found in countries of the
global North, but in the North social pensions mostly remain residual (exceptions include
Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and some Nordic countries).

       Remarkably, the ILO, which is the champion of social insurance, has accepted non-
contributory pensions as ‘pensions’. Referring to its definition of ‘pensions (or life annuities)’
as ‘periodic payments awarded upon reaching a specified age (and also often meeting other
prescribed entitlement conditions) which are then paid throughout the remainder of the
beneficiary’s life’, the ILO asserts: “Means-tested pensions are not, strictly speaking, life
annuities. However, if designed and implemented in a way which includes all in need and at
a level ‘sufficient to maintain the family of the beneficiary in health and decency’ such
pensions comply with the requirements of ILO standards.” (ILO 2014, 4). To make things more
complicated, many social pensions do not meet the standards of coverage and benefit level
described in this quotation but still are treated as pensions by the ILO.

       Social insurance in view of old age reflects the recognition of security in old age as an
issue, social insurance only covers workers in the formal sector of the economy, and formal
workers are a minority in most developing countries. The majority who live in the informal
sector or in rural settings are excluded. In high income countries, 90.8 percent of the labour
force contribute to a pension scheme but in upper middle income countries, it is only 50.7
percent; in lower middle income countries, 15.2 percent and in low income countries only 5.7
percent (ILO 2014, 16; for coverage by world regions see ILO 2014, 13, Figure 8). This coverage
gap left by social insurance has been a key driver of the recent move towards social cash




                                                3
transfers. For a long time, however, the coverage gap had not been seen as a social problem,
and social insurance remained the main model. Modernisation theory had suggested that the
coverage gap will progressively shrink, following the expansion of formal labour markets. But
the informal sector still dominates the economy in most Southern countries.

       The history of social pensions started in the global North, not in the South, even if the
term ‘social pension’ is not normally applied to the North. The rise of modern public pensions
is usually traced to Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who introduced a contribution-based
statutory old-age pension, a social insurance scheme, in 1889 in Imperial Germany. It is less
known that at the same time, non-contributory pensions made their appearance, namely
between 1890 and 1913 (Palacios and Knox-Vydmanov 2014, 253; Bahle et al. 2011, 36). The
pioneers included Iceland in 1890, Denmark in 1891, New Zealand in 1898, Australia in
1909/1910, United Kingdom in 1909, and Sweden in 1913. These were means-tested benefits
with a flat rate covering all citizens, normally coupled to diverse restrictions. But these
schemes were moving away from the earlier tradition of the poor laws, and some of them
relaxed the means test to become almost universal schemes.

       Among Northern welfare states, there are currently four main types of pensions that
address the problem of poverty in old age by securing a minimum, two of which count as
social pensions (derived from Bahle et al. 2011, 38-41; see Goedemé 2013 for a more
differentiated classification). The first type of Northern minimum pensions are universal or
pension tested pensions. These are clearly social pensions. The second type are minimum
provisions built into social insurance. According to common usage, these are not social
pensions proper, since claimants of minimum provisions need to have some contribution
record to be entitled to a minimum benefit. Some of the built-in minimum provisions are
means-tested, which brings them closer to social pensions. The same applies if the minimum
provisions are financed out of taxes. The third type of minimum provision for older persons
is social assistance for older persons. If these social assistance schemes cater for older persons
only, they are social pensions. But older persons may also be covered by general schemes of
social assistance (the fourth type of minimum provision) that also cover other beneficiaries,



                                                4
such as German social assistance till 2003. The difference between social assistance for older
persons and general social assistance may be slim. In Germany, for example, the special
assistance for older persons introduced in 2003 is largely modelled on the earlier general
social assistance scheme, with slightly relaxed conditions of entitlement. But the separation
of social assistance for older persons from general schemes may have a symbolic significance.
Most Northern countries have a (general or elderly-focused) last safety net, which coexists
with a prior social pension or a minimum provision built into social insurance.

       In the global South, social insurance is weak. Chile in 1924 was the first country in the
Americas to mandate contributory social insurance (Palacios and Knox 2014, 254). South
Africa was the Southern pioneer of social pensions (introduced in 1928), various small states
followed (Barbados 1937, Namibia 1939, Guyana 1944, Mauritius 1950; Palacios and Knox
2014, 255). Other countries came later (Costa Rica 1974, urban Brazil 1974, India 1957/1980;
see Leisering et al. 2006, 104 f.). But the big wave of erecting social pension schemes in the
South started in the 1990s. Since then, roughly half of all social pensions in the South have
been introduced. Currently 101 countries in the North and South have social pensions
(Palacios and Knox 2014, 255), 66 of these in independent countries in the South. Figures 1-
3 depict this quiet revolution.i

         The figures convey a clear picture. The spread of social pensions in the South
accelerated from the early 1990s, to become massive during the 2000s. There are regional
emphases, with Latin America showing the strongest growth, but social pensions also spread
in other regions. When interpreting the figures one has to keep in mind that some of the



                                              6
states are very small but are counted as one state just as very large states. Regions which
have many states like Latin America score lower in Figure 2, which depicts the percentage of
countries with social pensions in the region, while regions with fewer countries like South
Asia catch up. The figures also suggest that there is only a weak correlation between the
introduction of a social pension and the economic status of a country. Also poor countries
have installed social pensions. This hints at the influence of diffusion processes from other
countries and/or from international organisations (see section 5). The quiet revolution in
social pension provision becomes especially apparent when looking not at the cumulative
number of social pensions (Figures 1 and 2) but at new and newly reformed pension schemes
(Figure 3). In the latter figure we have included all reforms which reflect a second order
change according to Hall’s (1993, 278) classification of policy change, that is changes, which
amount to the introduction of a new policy instrument and go beyond parametric changes
such as modifications of benefit levels or qualifying age. For example, the replacement of the
old PASIS pension scheme in Chile with the Pensión Básica Solidaria in 2008 amounts to such
a reform, while the parametric changes in the South African Old Age Grant since the
beginning of the 1990s, which equalized conditions of access for black and coloured citizens,
even though significant, did not alter the policy instrument, which had existed since 1928,
and therefore was no second order change.

2. The Social Quality of Social Pensions (I): Who Gets What and How?

The global spread of social pensions is remarkable but the design and the implementation of
pension schemes as well as their function in the overall system of social security vary
considerably between countries. In this and the following section, we look into the ‘social
quality’ of social pensions, measured by the structure of entitlements under social pension
programs (this section) and by a social citizenship index which builds on these measures (next
section). The key question regarding entitlements is: Who gets what? Answers to this
question vary widely between countries. ‘Who’ refers to issues of coverage of older persons
by pension schemes, and ‘what’ refers to the level of benefits, sometimes referred to as
‘adequacy’. These are relatively independent dimensions. The dimensions of coverage and


                                              7
benefit level reflect the scope and the fabric of redistribution in a country. But both
dimensions also reflect social recognition: Who is considered to ‘deserve’ benefits and at
what level? In view of recognition, a third dimension is important, namely, how benefits are
provided. This hints at the institutional design of a scheme, for example the type of means
test applied, and at issues of administration and implementation and, rarely mentioned, at
the legal and constitutional base of the scheme.

       Measuring the three dimensions—who, what, how—is not straightforward. There are
different ways of operationalizing the dimensions, and normative choices have to be made.
Moreover, the availability of data largely determines to what extent we can analyse the three
dimensions in cross-national perspective. In the following we discuss the three dimensions
one after another.

Coverage – the ‘who’ question

       We have to distinguish between legal coverage—who is entitled to benefits, also
referred to as ‘eligibility’—and who actually gets benefits. In the development community,
the discrepancy between legal entitlement and actual receipt of benefits is addressed by the
terms exclusion and inclusion errors.

       To assess and compare eligibility and coverage between countries, we need to relate
the absolute number of beneficiaries in a country to some reference figure. Three references
are important, but only the two first are common in the literature (see, e.g., ILO 2014, 105
ff.). The first measure of coverage is the number of beneficiaries as percent of the population
60 years old and above. Regarding data, this is the easiest measure. The measure is critical
since in many countries the qualifying age for pensions is well above 60. The age of 60 may
be chosen as a normative criterion of retirement, but it does not reflect the diversity of
qualifying ages among countries. Therefore, the second measure of coverage is the number
of beneficiaries as percent of persons beyond the qualifying age. Differences in qualifying
age cannot easily be accounted for by domestic factors. It has been observed that ‘counting
by fives’ is wide-spread, that is, in most countries the qualifying age ends with a zero or a five




                                                8
(for an empirical analysis of qualifying age in Southern countries see Böger 2013, 36 f. and
Table 2, p. 36). What qualifying age a country chooses also shows regional patterns. This
hints at diffusion effects, just as for the general pattern ‘counting by five’. We can also
observe a global tendency towards equalising qualifying ages between men and women. A
third indicator relevant to assessing and comparing the numbers of beneficiaries among
countries is the life expectancy at age 60. Obviously, if people on average do not live much
longer than the qualifying age, then a social pension does not add much to the welfare of the
aged. The difference between qualifying age and life expectancy also matters massively for
social spending. This difference varies considerably between countries (Table 1).

       An extreme case were the Philippines. When the social pension was first implemented
in 2011 its qualifying age was very high (77 years) so that women on average can only expect
one and a half years of receiving a pension, whereas men on average will have died before
they have reached the qualifying age. From 2016 it has been lowered to cover destitute
elderly aged 60 and above. In Vietnam, the main social pension, which is pensions-tested,
begins at age 80+. What a difference to Thailand where women can expect almost 23 years
living on a social pension and men a little above 20 years. Bolivia is similar to Thailand,
whereas the old Dominican Republic pension (fittingly named “Programa Nonagenarios”) is
even more extreme than the Philippines, with a qualifying age of 90 years – both men and
women on average die many years before reaching that age. We may conclude that without
knowing the life expectancy at 60, the first two measures of coverage (beneficiaries as
percent of 60+, beneficiaries as percent of persons beyond qualifying age) cannot be
adequately interpreted.

          But we need even more information to interpret these figures adequately. For non-
means-tested welfare schemes, a higher coverage normally can be interpreted as bringing
about more welfare, for example the coverage of medical services or the coverage of social
insurance. But the number of recipients of means-tested social pensions also depends on the
number of people that fall through prior welfare schemes (protectiveness of prior schemes).
If social insurance covers only a small proportion of the population then ceteris paribus it is
more likely that people fall onto social pensions in old age. Therefore, a low figure of
recipients of social pensions may indicate that prior social security systems are strong enough
to prevent people from falling onto social pensions. In Germany, for example, only 3.1
percent (2015) of persons above 65 years of age receive social assistance for older persons,
while in Switzerland the figure is around 12 percent, indicating deficiencies of prior pension
schemes. But in Eastern Europe the low figure of recipients of social pensions also indicates
deficiencies in terms of the gaps in coverage and low benefit levels. In the global South, a
small number of beneficiaries of social pensions may indicate a low incidence of poverty

among older persons or a relatively broad coverage of social insurance (indicating success),
but it may also be a result of poor implementation and low benefit level of the social pension
scheme (indicating failure).

              The ‘who’ question and the ‘what’ question overlap: If the means-test of social
pensions is very strict, few people will fall beneath the line and be eligible to benefits. If social
pensions work well, that is, if few exclusion errors occur and the level of benefits is
reasonable, then a high figure of beneficiaries of social pensions might be seen as a success.
This would apply to countries in which social pensions are designed to take a large share of
social security in old age in the face of a large coverage gap of social insurance. By contrast,
in Northern countries, with residual social pensions, high numbers of beneficiaries are mostly
taken to indicate a failure of prior systems.

Benefit levels – the ‘what’ question

              Since social pensions aim at reducing poverty, a crucial criterion is if pensions lift
beneficiaries above the poverty line. We inquire if the statutory or official benefit level of
social pensions exceeds the poverty line, rather than ascertaining if and how many older
persons actually exit poverty through pensions. We use national poverty lines as well as the
international line of extreme poverty, $1.25 and $2 per day in purchasing power parities or
international dollars.

        Figure 4 shows that in more than half of the countries, social pensions lift older
persons beyond the international poverty line. So extreme poverty can be reduced. But
beneficiaries mostly stay below national poverty lines. Remarkably, small states like Bolivia
score high. Two regional patterns are striking: South Asian states—Bangladesh, India, and
Nepal—provide benefits below the international poverty line, whereas Latin American social
pensions, with the exception of Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, do lift individual
beneficiaries above the international poverty line.

        For poor countries it is more difficult to secure high benefit levels. Therefore, it makes
sense to relate benefit levels to national economic capacities, measured by gross national
income per capita and, alternatively, by average wage (Figure 5).

        Figure 5 shows a similar picture as Figure 4. Differences are especially striking in
countries that are either low-income or high-income economies according to the World Bank
classification. The programs in Kenya and Uganda, both of which are low-income countries,
fall short of providing benefits above the international poverty line, but are generous if
related to domestic economic performance. The same holds true for some slightly more
developed countries in central Asia, Uzbekistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic. While benefits are



                                                      13
meagre in absolute terms, relative levels are above global as well as regional averages. For
two high-income countries—South Korea and Oman—it is the other way round: the South
Korean social pension scheme provides the lowest benefits measured against national
income or average wage levels but benefits well exceed the international poverty line.
However, older persons in South Korea also have access to a general social assistance scheme,
and these benefits are not included in the calculations. In most countries, benefit levels are
below 15 percent of GNI per capita. Some advanced countries stand out, like Brazil (32
percent), due to the indexation of benefits with the minimum wage, which was increased
substantially under the PT government; South Africa (24 percent); and Trinidad and Tobago
(34 percent).

       In summary, social pensions in countries of the global South often lift people out of
extreme poverty—measured by statutory or official benefit levels. This translates into actual
reductions of poverty to the extent that benefits reach those older persons who are entitled
to benefits. Compared to other social cash transfers, social pensions tend to be higher; that
is, they provide a ‘modicum of economic welfare and security’ (Marshall 1950, 11). But in a
number of countries, benefit levels are too low to lift people out of poverty, and coverage is
wanting. We also found that the bare number of older persons receiving a social pension is
difficult to interpret in view of poverty reduction since the protectiveness of prior social
security schemes as well as the social quality of the social pension influence that number.

Varieties of targeting – the ‘how’ question

       The question ‘means-tested or universal?’ has been subject to heated debates both in
Northern welfare states and in the global South. The debate is about targeting benefits, about
administering welfare schemes and about reaching out to the poor. More fundamentally, the
debate is about normative models of welfare, closely linked to political ideologies and strong
convictions. In most Northern welfare states (excluding corporatist welfare regimes like
Germany), social democrats tend to favour universal benefits and services because they see
means-tested benefits as reminiscent of the old stigmatising poor laws. By contrast, universal
benefits are associated with ideas of equality, solidarity, and citizenship. Liberals, on the other


                                                14
hand, are concerned about a possible erosion of work incentives through universal benefits,
and about social spending for persons who are not needy. From this point of view,
concentrating benefits on the ‘truly needy’, targeted through means testing, is the way to go,
even though a means-test may also act as a disincentive to work and save.

       The debate on means testing versus universalism in view of the global South differs
from debates in the global North. Empirically, universal pensions are rare in the South. Only
few and mostly small or very small countries have introduced universal pensions (see Table 3
below). Therefore, it makes sense that Armando Barrientos, in his authoritative study of
social cash transfers (2013), refers to social cash transfers as ‘social assistance’ (similarly
Leisering 2008). There are pros and cons both for means testing and universalism. Universal
benefits, ceteris paribus, reach a larger number of older persons, reducing exclusion errors.
Universal benefits are also less likely to entail stigma and they avoid a means test which is
difficult to carry out in countries with low administrative capacities and a low degree of
monetarization of life. Doing without a means test also checks the influence of local
clientelism, since it is often local groups that decide about eligibility to benefits. However, the
right to social security, as laid down in article 9 of the Social Covenant, does not require
benefits to be universal, according to the interpretation by the Committee on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights (2007: 4 (b)).

       By contrast, means-tested benefits are more specifically need-oriented than universal
ones. Theoretically, with a given budget (i.e. disregarding politics, see below), means-tested
schemes can serve more beneficiaries or provide higher benefits than universal schemes.
Means-tested benefits can also meet with wider acceptance in the public, depending on the
views on welfare held in a country. Disincentives can also be avoided. The ‘pension test’,
which only tests for other pension income, has been devised as an in-between solution, both
in the North and the South. It is easy to administer, is not liable to fraud or misuse and it
avoids the difficulties of testing for resources in the households applicants live in. In the
literature, pension testing is sometimes valued positively as a ‘mild means test’ and often
grouped together with universal benefits (for the South, see Palacios and Knox-Vydmanov



                                                15
2014, who group universal and pension-tested pensions as ‘citizenship pensions’; for the
North, see Bahle et al. 2011, 38). In the last resort, this is a normative or ideological debate
and cannot be settled on empirical grounds.

        But some qualifications of the debate can be made. First, other aspects of social
pensions than targeting (means test or universal access) can be more important for the aim
of reducing poverty, such as the level of benefits, actual coverage (extent of exclusion errors),
implementation and, in the case of pensions, other conditions of eligibility (qualifying age)
and life expectancy.

        Second, the question means-tested versus universal benefits cannot be settled à
priori, but depends on the circumstances in a country. For example, when poverty is
widespread among older persons or in certain areas, a universal pension is a much more
obvious and probably less costly choice, even if this is not always acknowledged by policy-
makers. The effects of both methods must be empirically measured and compared to make
a well-reasoned choice.

        Third, as in Northern welfare states, universalism is a self-description used by national
and international experts and advocacy organizations. The term has many meanings, and the
actual design and implementation of ‘universal’ benefits may include diverse restrictions and
conditions of eligibility.

        Fourth, other conditions than a means test can be thought of, as demonstrated
recently by China in its pension reform of 2009-2011: in an integrated pension arrangement
which includes a social insurance scheme and a social pension, older persons are eligible to a
social pension only when their children pay into the social insurance scheme. Another
creative alternative can be found in Chile, which combines a general means test (with a high
income line) to crowd out the wealthy with a pension test to limit benefits to those not
receiving a social insurance pension or some other prior benefit (a tiered means test). This
has been termed ‘basic universalism’ (Huber and Stephens 2012, 180) because it guarantees
a minimum income to those in the bottom 60 percent of the income distribution.




                                               16
       Fifth, politics matters. Korpi and Palme (1998) argue for Northern welfare states that
welfare provisions beyond basic security, which benefit the better-off, integrate the better-
off into the welfare state and secure their political support for the welfare state. As a
consequence, the poor would also profit, because the government would invest more in the
level and quality of basic provisions. The argument is that in actual politics, the size of social
budgets is not fixed, but depends on the institutional design of pensions. Research is needed
to investigate if and how Korpi and Palme’s argument could be applied to countries in the
South (see Huber and Stephens 2012, 53-72, who discuss Korpi and Palme’s argument in view
of the global South). The benefit level of universal pensions is probably too low to be
attractive to the middle classes (which are small in the South), but might be attractive to older
pensioners who are not poor but still vulnerable, and their support for social spending might
be enhanced. In fact, in the South, higher spending is more common amongst more universal
schemes. But Korpi and Palme’s argument is about means-testing vs. universalism only by
implication; rather, their reasoning is about including the middle classes by prior, higher tier
pension schemes, distinct from basic pensions.

       Sixth, the argument in favour of universal benefits—that universalism supports the
integration of society—could also be served by alternative solutions. Welfare services for the
poor and the non-poor could also be integrated in other ways; for example, through built-in
minima in social insurance schemes, with means testing and/or high state subsidies for these
minima, as recently introduced in China (Liu and Sun 2016).

3. The Social Quality of Social Pensions (II): An Integrated Index of
Social Citizenship

To break the deadlock of the debate universalism versus means-testing, we propose a new
approach. We construct an integrated index of social citizenship to measure the social quality
of social pensions. The index includes the methods of targeting but only as one of three
components of social citizenship; and we turn the dichotomy means testing versus
universalism into a more differentiated distinction of five types of conditions of entitlement



                                               17
to social pensions, including a differentiation of the ways of means testing. We start by
modelling the conditions of entitlement.

Conditions of entitlement (targeting)

        In the global North and even more so in the South, there is a variety of methods of
means testing. We can make two distinctions that lead to a broader range of ways of targeting
than universalism and pension testing. First, a general means test with a higher income
threshold versus a poverty test (see Gough et al. 1997, 19). Second, poverty testing can be
further differentiated into minimum standard testing versus ascribed poverty targeting. The
idea of differentiating poverty testing is that in Southern countries the criterion of eligibility
need not coincide with the benefit level to be provided by the pension scheme, unlike the
North where a poverty line usually determines both eligibility and benefit level. In the South,
benefits can be (un)related to means in different ways. Table 2 shows the variants of means
testing that become visible when making the two distinctions. Table 3 depicts the whole
range of conditions of entitlement to social pensions, with countries classified in the
appropriate categories.

developing and middle-income countries. Apart from a number of very small countries that
have installed universal pensions, two types of means testing prevail: pension testing and
what we call ascribed or attributed poverty targeting; that is, targeting households that local
elites and administrators designate as poor when applying given broad selection criteria.
Pension-tested social pensions are more often found in better-off countries while ascribed
poverty targeting is more frequent in poorer countries. Pension testing is easy to administer
and leaves little room for patronage and fraud. Pension testing has spread also to Northern

countries, especially to the Nordic welfare states. What we call minimum standard poverty
testing is rarely found in the South, mainly in Latin America, but prevails in the North. The
notion of a minimum standard is the Northern ideal type of modern social assistance; that is,
society decides about a socio-cultural minimum or floor to be provided as a national standard
for all citizens of a country, operationalized through a monetarized ‘poverty line’. The idea of
a poverty line had come up in the late 19th century in Britain, popularized by Charles Booth.
People who fall below the line are considered poor, and benefits are designed to fill up the
gap between the income of a claimant and the poverty line—the monetary eligibility
threshold equals the standardized benefit level. Minimum standard poverty testing is difficult
to implement in poor countries due to a low degree of monetarization of livelihoods and to
low administrative capacities for identifying need by formal procedures. Therefore, many
poor states resort to ascribed poverty targeting which does not rely on a poverty line. In
conjunction, the benefit level is not linked to the criterion of eligibility.

       There are two main ways of poverty targeting. In the face of difficulties in ascertaining
income, many countries use so-called proxy means tests which identify the poor by applying
a measure of poverty which does not directly refer to income. An example is India’s social
pension, the Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme, which determines eligibility
according to the national ‘Below Poverty Line’ (BPL), which also regulates access to other
transfers and services. Since 2002, households are classified as BPL or not BPL according to a
questionnaire of 13 questions that represent 13 dimensions of welfare or deprivation,
including food, housing, land ownership, assets, education etc. The answers are assigned
scores from zero to four which are aggregated to an overall welfare score ranging from zero
to 52. A poverty cut-off point is then set at the state or union level. A less formal way of
identifying the poor is through decisions by community committees. Local community leaders
use undocumented criteria to select the neediest in their community.

       Besides or in combination with proxy means testing, fixing quota is another strategy
of identifying the poor, that is, setting the number of beneficiaries in advance and then using
a means test to assign who is eligible. For example, Bangladesh’s old-age allowance



                                                 20
programme assigns a certain number of beneficiaries to each ward according to population
size, and beneficiaries then are selected from the pool of applications by two committees
who assess need. Only one selection criterion is imposed by official regulation, namely, that
at least half of the beneficiaries must be women. So in the case of quotas, there are two
selection mechanisms: the quota itself, and the targeting method used to assign eligibility
within the quota, both of which bear no relationship to the benefits. In Guatemala the
selection of the poor can also be done by social workers, without a quota. Ascribed poverty
targeting is particularly liable to clientelism and patronage both at the state and community
levels. Moreover, unlike minimum standard testing, benefits will not normally precisely meet
the needs of the claimants since benefits are decoupled from the living situation of the
claimant. Poverty targeted benefits are only weakly need-related at both stages (identifying
the poor, fixing benefits) and leave more leeway for budgetary concerns. Benefits tend to be
relatively arbitrary lump sums.

       Another form of means testing, the general means test, is very rare in Southern
countries, and is only found in four advanced countries (Table 3). As for ascribed poverty
targeting, the criterion of eligibility is decoupled from the benefit level, but in a different way.
Both levels are measured in monetary terms but the income threshold that determines
eligibility is set at a higher level than poverty, to exclude only the wealthy. The level of
benefits, then, is normally far below the income threshold, and may be further reduced for
beneficiaries closer to the income threshold (for South Korea and South Africa see the Figure
by Böger 2013, 46). In the theoretical case that the benefit level is close to the income
threshold, the benefit scheme is semi-universal. Among Northern countries, the general
means test is found in Australia.

       Based on the distinction of five conditions of entitlement to social pensions, we can
assess some of the points raised in the debate about universal versus means tested benefits.
Table 4 provides data on the average benefit level for each mode of targeting. The
assumption that with a given budget, means testing allows for a higher level of benefits than
universal schemes is confirmed. Schemes using minimum standard poverty testing have by



                                                21
far the highest benefit level, even if adjusted for gross national income per capita. The level
of universal and pension-tested pensions is comparatively low. Benefits under ascribed
poverty targeting are the lowest. The latter finding seems to reflect the fact that this kind of
targeting is mostly used in poor countries. But even if adjusted for national gross income,
benefit levels under this type of targeting remain the lowest compared to the other four.

Towards ‘citizenship pensions’? An integrated index of social citizenship

Based on the analysis of who gets what and how in the previous sections, we now seek to
define a measure of the social quality of social pensions, conceptualised as social citizenship.
In the North, social assistance is normally seen as bad social security, carrying stigma and
prone to create dependency, rather than contributing to social citizenship. But we maintain
that social pensions can contribute to social citizenship, and we inquire what characteristics
of a social pension are needed to turn a social pension into an instrument of social citizenship.
This has not been done before ii simply because means-tested benefits are usually not seen
as reflecting social citizenship, and because social citizenship is normally analysed by
qualitative methods in case studies of single (or few) countries.

       Measures of social rights have been developed in Northern welfare state research (for
other welfare programs than social pensions and for welfare states at large) to refine the
comparative and historical analysis of social policy. In the early comparative or historical
studies of welfare state development, gross variables had dominated, and they still are used
in recent studies of Southern countries for lack of more refined data. These gross variables,
which include the enactment of social statutes, measured by the year of introduction of a
scheme (Collier and Messick 1975, Hort and Kuhnle 2000), social spending (e.g. Wilensky


                                               22
1975) and sometimes coverage (Alber 1982), do not say anything about the social quality of
welfare programs. Esping-Andersen’s (1990) decommodification index is the most widely
received measure of social rights. Scruggs’s Generosity Index (Scruggs/Allan 2006) is a similar
measure. These measures cannot simply be transferred to social pensions or to social cash
transfers general since they are not tailored to means-tested schemes. Since social pensions
seem to play a bigger role in the architecture of social security in the South, as compared to
the North where social insurance prevails, it makes sense to inquire whether social cash
transfers herald a new social model, a new source of social citizenship.

        We define social citizenship as encompassing three dimensions (Leisering and
Barrientos 2013: S52): resources; recognition (of social problems and persons affected by
them); and participation in society. Social citizenship rests on the assumption by the state of
an explicit social responsibility for its citizens.

        Earlier studies, normally with small n or even n=1, found substantial impacts of social
cash transfers related to the three dimensions of social citizenship. Considering the broad
range of models and practices of social cash transfers, the effects very much depend on the
design and the implementation of a scheme and the circumstances in a given country.
Potential effects of social pensions pertain to all three dimensions of social citizenship:
poverty in old age has been reduced; the social status of older persons, especially of women,
in family, kin, and community has been enhanced; and social pensions have facilitated the
activity of older persons and their family members, especially of children. These wider
repercussions of social pensions have been crucial in promoting social pensions on global and
national political agendas. Above all, pensions are not only about older persons but, more
broadly, about development: “Pension policy is also development policy.” (Barrientos/Lloyd-
Sherlock 2002, 7; see also Howell 2001). Early empirical studies have corroborated the
positive effects: Pensions restore “the elderly to the status of assets, instead of the liabilities
they had come to be in their families in the past” (Saboia 2003, 51). “Rural households form
around pensions.” (Barrientos/Lloyd-Sherlock 2002, 30; see also Møller/Ferreira 2003, xxxiv;
and Lloyd-Sherlock 2002, 710). “Pensions do pay for the education of children in the

household” (Møller/Ferreira 2003, xxxiv). During the 2000s, the wider social significance of
social pensions became an almost universally shared point of view: “Pensions are essential to
ensuring rights, dignity and income security for older persons” (ILO 2014, ix), and this
explicitly included social pensions.

        Table 5 presents a measure of social citizenship, by operationalizing the three
dimensions of social citizenship in view of social pensions. In each dimension, we define an
ideal type. The social quality or social citizenship characteristic of a social pension in a country
is then measured as the minimum of the three indicators (Goertz 2006, 42), that is, a low
score on one indicator cannot be made up by a high score on another indicator. This is a fuzzy
set measure with three dimensions. Those social pensions achieve a maximum of social
citizenship that meet the ideal type in each of the three dimensions. Regarding resources as
the basic dimension of social citizenship, our ideal type requires benefits to exceed


                                                         24
international poverty lines. Benefits above the extreme poverty line ($1.25 per day) are
categorized as crossover according to the fuzzy set methodology while benefits above the
higher poverty line of $2 per day are marked ‘in’. Recognition refers to the recognition of
need and needy individuals, measured by the conditions of entitlement and the relationship
between means and benefits. Identifying need is a basic quality of social welfare benefits.
The ideal type is what we call ‘need universalism’; that is, pensions that respond to all
instances of need. Need-universal pensions need not be ‘universal’ in the conventional sense
of non-means tested benefits but can also be means-tested. The type ‘minimum standard
poverty testing’ identifies and recognizes need most precisely, but other types of targeting
may also guarantee benefits to the needy: universal programs by targeting every old person
above the qualifying age; pension-testing by responding to deficiencies in prior welfare
schemes; and general means-testing by providing benefits to a wider section of the
population. Regarding the participation dimension of social citizenship, qualifying age and
the country-specific life expectancy at age 60 matter, as discussed above, simply because if
pensioners have few years left on pensions, either due to a high qualifying age or a low life
expectancy at age 60, the scope for participation is restricted. We use 15 years of coverage
as the ideal type, because this corresponds to the average years of coverage reached by the
German old age insurance, as an example of a pension generally thought of to provide
generous social rights and enabling participation of older persons.

       A note on method: All dimensions of the citizenship index are construed as membership
scores in fuzzy sets (Ragin 2008, Goertz 2006). Fuzzy set methodology was originally
developed to facilitate the analysis of different causal pathways in the social sciences (Ragin
2000), but may also be used in a descriptive manner to assess the conformity of cases to an
ideal type. Conceptually, each score represents the membership of a case in the set of
countries with a certain feature, and should thus be thought of as a qualitative assessment
whether a case (here: a social pension) meets a criterion derived ‘by theoretical and
substantive knowledge’ (Kvist 1999, 234). To transform quantitative indicators into fuzzy set
membership scores we apply the ‘direct method of calibration’ proposed by Ragin (2008, ch.



                                              25
5), which demands the specification of three qualitative anchors: a case qualifying for being
fully in the set (value 1.0), being fully out (0), or being neither/nor (0.5). As opposed to purely
quantitative methods, the transformation of quantitative indicators into fuzzy set
membership scores is not a simple standardization procedure, but has to confront the
question what values of the indicators mean in term of set membership. Our selection of
anchors, as shown above, relied on (a) substantive knowledge about the mechanisms of
means testing and targeting; (b) the selection of internationally recognized poverty lines; and
(c) knowledge of cases which were deemed to fulfil the ideal type. Because we deem all three
dimensions of citizenship necessary and together sufficient to realize social citizenship as
conceived by TH Marshall, the social quality of a social pension corresponds to joint
membership in all three sets. Using fuzzy sets, the membership in a combination of sets can
be evaluated using the minimum principle, which corresponds to the logical ‘and’ (Ragin 2000,
173; Goertz 2006, 43). The aggregate maximum score represents the membership of a country
in the set of countries which guarantee benefits to the needy elderly (need universalism) that
lie above the international poverty line of $2 a day and last for fifteen years (on average). This
measure of social citizenship refers to the legal design of a social pension. The substance of
social citizenship, of course, also depends on how a pension is institutionalised or
implemented.

         Figure 6 displays the membership scores in each dimension’s set (shaded bars) and
the membership in the combined concept (black bar). It is visible that the minimum score is
used as the aggregate value (the black bar being equal to the smallest dimension’s bar),
reflecting our conceptualization of the dimensions as necessary and non-substitutable
elements of social citizenship (in contrast to the social pension wealth indicator employed in
Palacios/Knox 2014, 260). The figure shows that more than half (34) of the 64 analyzed social
pensions meet or are close to meeting our ideal-type. Twenty four social pensions fall short
of reaching the threshold, either because they provide only meagre benefits—India,
Bangladesh, China and Vietnam are among this group—or because their period of coverage
is too short to enable the participation dimension of citizenship—the Philippines and Nepal
are prominent cases. Thailand and Lesotho provide another compelling example of this
contrast, because they score high in the other dimensions, but fall short in one respect. In
Thailand, benefits are too low, while in Lesotho, the qualifying age is too high. Nine countries
with social pensions are classified as being neither in nor out of the set of countries which
meet the ideal type. This is solely due to the fact that they employ ascribed poverty targeting


                                                            27
and thus are assigned the score 0.5 because we assume these programs are not able to
guarantee a minimum income in old age (no identification of need, no need universalism).
More knowledge about the targeting mechanisms; that is, an even more differentiated
typology of means tests; and an accompanying recalibration of the dimension ‘need
identification/need universalism’ would probably lift some of these countries into the set of
social rights provision. Most of them fulfill the criteria of the other two dimensions.

       As mentioned earlier, universal and pension-tested pensions are sometimes called
‘citizenship pensions’. But ‘universal’ and ‘pension-tested’ are crude measures of social
citizenship. Our citizenship index, which distinguishes five conditions of entitlement to social
pensions (targeting) and adds further dimensions, captures social citizenship in a more
complex and differentiated way. For example, a means-tested pension to which all older
persons are entitled in case of need (e.g. the Brazilian BPC) would also be seen as contributing
to social citizenship. If we define as ‘citizenship pension’ a pension which scores high on the
social citizenship index (more than 0.5), we find that the task of designing a citizenship
pension is more demanding than simply opting for a certain type of targeting.

4. Normative Models of Social Citizenship in Old Age

In the preceding section, we have conceptualized the social citizenship characteristics of
social pensions by a social citizenship index. The social citizenship index refers to the social
quality of a pension but disregards the wider arrangement of old-age security in a country. In
this section, we take a broader view, investigating the social citizenship characteristics of the
wider pension arrangement, including social insurance and public sector pensions, from the
point of view of the role of social pensions. Social pensions can serve as the mainstay or only
as a supplementary scheme in the overall arrangement of old-age security in a country.

       In the North, social pensions are mostly supplementary or ‘residual’ (Bahle et al.
2011); that is, they have a small share in old-age security. Despite being residual, social
pensions (or other minimum provisions for older persons) in Western and Northern European
countries are fundamental because they provide basic citizenship for the poor, as the



                                               28
foundation of social security. Hence, social pensions in Western and Northern European
countries are ‘both residual and fundamental’ (Bahle et al. 2011, 2). iii By contrast, social
pensions in Eastern and Southern Europe tend to be less inclusive and do not provide basic
citizenship. What about the South? In the preceding section, we found that some social
pensions show citizenship characteristics, thus they are ‘fundamental’. But what about their
share in old-age security?

       We speak of the scale of a social pension to denote its share in the overall
arrangement of old-age security in a country. The scale of a social pension is relatively
independent from the social citizenship character. In operational terms, we define scale as
proportion of beneficiaries (in percent) of the persons with 65 years of age or more in a
country. The scale of a social pension is not easy to interpret (see the discussion on measuring
coverage above) because it is determined by several heterogeneous factors, such as the
‘protectiveness’ of prior benefit schemes (Bahle et al. 2011, 50) (which depends on the
coverage and the benefit level of prior schemes), the extent of poverty in old age, and
implementation. Moreover, if the social pension scores low on social citizenship—with a
short period of coverage, with low responsiveness to need, and with a low benefit level—
then this would ceteris paribus reduce the scale of the social pension.iv Therefore, the two
dimensions—social citizenship character and scale of a social pension—are related to a
degree.

       The social citizenship quality of old-age security of course also, and often primarily,
depends on other components of the pension system than the social pension, but there are
different roles a social pension can play in contributing to overall social citizenship. To capture
this role, we first plot the relationship between the social citizenship character of social
pensions and their scale on a continuous spectrum, to find out how these two dimensions
are related. In a second step, we dichotomize the dimension of scale into ‘marginal’ (small)
versus ‘central’ (large), v and cross-tabulate the scale of social pensions with their equally
dichotomized citizenship scores (high/low). Cross-tabulation produces different models of
social citizenship in the field of old-age security with regard to the role of social pensions. We



                                                29
define social citizenship as high if a pension scheme (or a country respectively) scores higher
than 0.5, and as low if the score is 0.5 or below. We define the scale of a social pension as
large or ‘central’ if more than 40 percent of the population of 65+ years of age receive a
pension, and as small or ‘marginal’ if the recipients make up 40 percent or less. vi

       Figure 7 confirms the relative independence of the two dimensions, social citizenship
score and scale, since the dots do not cluster around the diagonal line (the diagonal line would
represent a perfect correlation).vii The figure also shows that the social pensions in the global
South exhibit a broad range of degrees of social citizenship, interestingly with some
concentration at the high and low ends. There is a clear finding regarding the scale of social
pensions in the South, namely that in most countries, the social pension is marginal; that is,
social pensions have a limited share in the social protection arrangement of southern
countries. This could partially explain the low visibility and presence in the political public, as
compared to allowances aimed at families, including CCTs. We can also see that many

marginal social pensions (low scale) have a strong social citizenship character, that is, they
are ‘fundamental’. Surprisingly, most central social pensions (high scale) have a high social
citizenship character. A hypothesis would be that the electoral weight of these pensions
makes for a high social quality of the pensions. Countries that run such pensions, such as
Namibia and Swaziland, could be considered as vanguards of a hypothetical new social model
of old-age security or even social protection at large in the global South, a model that relies
on need-based income programs (means-tested social cash transfers) rather than
achievement-based programs (social insurance) as the mainstay of monetary social security.
Compared to northern states, social cash transfers then act as social insurance substitute.
The number of such southern states, however, is limited.

       For Table 6 we have dichotomised both variables, to obtain simple types of models of
social citizenship in old-age security that take account of the scale and the social quality of
social pensions. We find four main variants of social citizenship (Table 6): layered citizenship,
basic citizenship, precarious citizenship and deficient citizenship. First, in some countries of
the global South, especially in Latin America, we find layered social citizenship: Basic
citizenship is provided for by strong, inclusive minimum provisions (high social citizenship
score), which are taken up by a small section of the population (marginal scale); on top, there
are more extensive prior schemes as second layer, including social insurance, which reflects
industrial or corporate citizenship, and pensions for public sector employees. In these
countries, social pensions or other minimum provisions are small and do not dominate the
picture of old-age security, but still are fundamental to securing social citizenship at the lower
end of the structure of inequality. The normative foundation of entitlement is equally layered
or composite: While entitlement to minimum provisions is mostly based on need, social
insurance provisions are based on achievement, and public sector pensions are based on
merit. Even in countries with strong, protective prior systems, provisions for basic citizenship
are needed. In many European countries, there are even two layers of basic citizenship, like
Sweden which has strong social insurance and occupational pensions but still needs a basic
pension (guarantee pension) and a small system of social assistance underneath. The type
‘layered citizenship’ has an affinity to countries in Continental Western and Northern Europe.

       The second variant of social citizenship is basic social citizenship. In these countries,
social pensions or other minimum provisions are the mainstay of formal old-age security,
reaching out to significant sections of the population (’central’ scale) and securing basic
citizenship for these sections (high social citizenship score). Prior schemes are more limited.
In this variant, minimum provisions constitute a much larger component of social citizenship
and dominate the picture of formal old-age security in that country. Many social pensions in
this model of social citizenship are not universal in the conventional sense of entitling every
old person, but are highly responsive to need by relying on a ‘need universal’ means test (a
pension test, a general means test or a minimum standard poverty test) rather than less need-



                                               32
oriented ways of ascribed poverty targeting. In the South these countries are found in
different regions, including Africa. Social insurance has a low degree of protectiveness in
these countries. The type ‘basic citizenship’ could herald the new social model of the global
South. The model has an affinity to a small group of Northern countries (e.g. UK, Ireland, and
Australia).

       In a third variant, precarious citizenship, social pensions have such a low social quality
that they do not even provide basic social citizenship. In addition, the social pensions are
marginal in scale, not least because many persons in need slip through these pensions. While
prior schemes in those countries vary, with weak social insurance in many cases, the overall
social citizenship of old-age security is weak. This group of countries is mixed bag, including
former republics of the Soviet Union like Armenia, the two big south Asian countries,
Bangladesh and India, and the countries in the Middle East and North Africa, if they provide
a social pension at all.

       A fourth variant, the bottom right quadrant in Table 6, is characterized best as
providing deficient citizenship. Here we find countries that provide social pensions to a large
share of the population, that is, social pensions are at the centre of national old-age security,
but the social quality of the pensions is impaired by low benefits, as in China, or by short time
spans of coverage, as in Lesotho. While social pensions in the third variant are lacking in terms
of both breadth (scale) and depth (social quality), leaving many needy wanting, the fourth
variant includes pensions that lack primarily in depth and thus provide an deficient
implementation of citizenship, as measured by our ideal type, albeit for a large part of their
population.

       The typology of four models of social citizenship in old age reveals the diversity of
global old-age security. The distinction of four types simplifies the broad range of variations
and special cases. The typology provides a number of insights:

       First, the typology does not simply reflect a North-South divide. Although constructed
in view of the global South, each of the four types has some affinity to certain Northern




                                               33
countries, as noted in Table 6. That is, the social quality of social pensions varies widely within
both the North and the South. The kind of social citizenship which we are tempted to consider
as Northern (social pension with high social citizenship score, hence fundamental, but with a
marginal position in the overall system of social security) is only found in countries in
Northern and Continental Western Europe. Likewise, what we hypothesise as a potential new
social model in the South (social pensions with high social citizenship score and a central
position in old-age security, reaching out to sizable sections in the population) can currently
only be found in a small number of vanguard countries, many of which are small. It is an open
question whether other Southern countries will follow that model or remain stuck in deficient
or precarious citizenship—or, less likely, will develop into layered citizenship.

       Second, the four variants cut across the distinction universal/means-tested benefits,
again qualifying the widely held view that universality of benefits means social citizenship.
The distinction universal/means-tested alone does not tell us whether the social citizenship
score of a social pension is high or low (as found in the preceding section), nor can the
distinction layered/basic citizenship be related to the categories universal/means-tested. In
some contexts means-tested pensions achieve high coverage and become the mainstay of
old age security. Applying the concept of universalism to the overall system of social security
(here: of old-age security) (‘system universalism’) allows for a broad variety of arrangements
of old-age security viii and related concepts of social citizenship.

       Third, basic social citizenship could herald a new social model of welfare, distinct from
the Northern welfare state, by realizing social citizenship mainly through means-tested
benefits. For the history of Continental Europe, Leibfried and Tennstedt (1985) have
distinguished Arbeiterpolitik (policy for workers), which most explicitly emerged in 19th
century Germany, and Armenpolitik (policy for the poor) which had dominated earlier.
Similarly, Seekings (2008, 2013) has distinguished ‘workerist’ and ‘pauperist’ welfare regimes
for the South. Our findings suggest that social pensions cannot be equated with the poor laws
of early modern Europe. We found that social pensions differ with regard to their social
quality; some score high on social citizenship which distinguishes them from the old, much



                                                34
resented poor laws. In some Southern countries, social pensions appear to represent a new
social model, a genuine if modest form of social citizenship (hinted at by Seekings without
closer analysis), with less stigma attached and without negative impact on other aspects of
citizenship, like restrictions on civil and political rights which were attendant on the old poor
laws well into the 20th century. Moreover, with regard to the overall system of social security
(or the welfare state), concepts like ‘residual social policy’ (Titmuss 1974: 30f.) and ‘liberal
welfare state regime’ (Esping-Andersen 1990) which designate welfare arrangements that
rely on social assistance as mainstay of social security, with a critical undertone, are not
instructive in view of Southern countries in which poverty is much more widespread than in
the North and social assistance caters for much larger sections of the population.

5. Explaining the Global Spread of Social Pensions

Social pensions have had a successful ‘career’ both in national politics of Southern countries
and on global agendas of international organizations. We assume that changes in global
discourses have influenced domestic policies, but this influence is not easy to pin down.
Before we present an event history quantitative analysis that tests the impact of domestic
and global factors, we sketch the post WWII career of old age, old-age security and social
pensions as issues in global arenas (for an in-depth analysis of the recent career of the idea
of social cash transfers on global agendas see von Gliszczynski 2015). The idea of social
pensions broke through in the early 2000s, with some discursive consolidation in the early
2010s, when global actors started taking stock and looking back on the wave of new social
cash transfers introduced since the 1990s. But the movement has not stopped or met with
major resistance.

Changing global discourses

       Three drivers or arenas of global law and politics can be identified that have operated
independently but have partially converged and reinforced each other in advancing old age
as an issue. The three drivers and arenas include the human rights activities of the United
Nations; global development politics; and the global pension policies of specialized



                                               35
international organizations. That is, three discursive streams – turning old-age into a human
rights issue, into a development issue and into a global social policy issue – together advanced
the career of old age in global agendas.

       Old age figures in the United Nations (UN) in human rights documents, in special
World Assemblies and Plans of Action in view of ageing. The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights of 1948 refers to older persons, though only in the context of social security: ‘Everyone
has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of
his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services,
and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old
age …’ (Article 25 (1)). But the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
of 1966 (in force since 1976), which presents the pertinent rights of the Universal Declaration
in a more binding form, makes no explicit mention of older persons. Only the reference to
social insurance (article 9) implies a reference to older persons. But in the ‘Principles and
Guidelines for a Human Rights Approach to Poverty Reduction Strategies’ of the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR 2006: 8), the elderly are listed
among ‘those among the poor who are especially deprived and marginalized’ and ought to
be given priority. The UN attended to old age more specifically through two World Assemblies
and Plans of Action on Ageing, the first in Vienna 1982, the second in Madrid 2002 (UN 1982;
2002a,b).

       The second driver of old age as a global issue was a paradigm change in the global
development community since the 1990s. Building on discursive changes in the 1990s, ‘social
protection’ came to be seen as a piece of development policy from the turn of the millennium
(see von Gliszczynski 2015). Issues of social security had figured in development politics since
the 1950s but had been eclipsed by the prime goals of economic growth and development
(Leisering, Davy and Davy 2015). The recognition of social protection as part of development
strategies was predicated on changes in the conceptualization of poverty by international
organisations, on new global discourses, particularly on human rights, globalisation and the
Millennium Development Goals, and on the formation of a new policy community (von



                                              36
Gliszczynski 2015). In this way, the idea of social security was anchored in a much stronger
and more broadly based policy idea, namely development. The new paradigm of
development policy which included social protection is shared by all major global actors,
cutting across conventional ideologies and political camps, although there are variations in
interpreting the new paradigm. While social insurance had long been accepted as a relevant
instrument by development policy makers, the new paradigm went beyond social insurance
to include non-contributory social cash transfers for the poor who had been excluded by
social insurance. Besides the social security community, many of those coming to social
protection are from the humanitarian and food security world, where cash transfers are seen
as an improvement on previous humanitarian efforts and livelihood programs.

       Four varieties of social cash transfers were particularly successful on global agendas:
social pensions, family allowances, conditional cash transfers and general household
assistance (Leisering 2008, von Gliszczynski 2015). Among the four key global models of social
cash transfers, social pensions (and family allowances) stand out as a particularly strong and
consensual model. The discursive success of these four varieties depended on three factors:
advocacy by an international organizations (in the case of social pensions: by HelpAge
International), availability of a country example (in the case of social pensions: South Africa),
and availability of evidence on effectiveness of the model (von Gliszczynski 2015, von
Gliszczynski and Leisering 2016).

       The third driver of old age as a global issue was a change in the global politics and
policies of old-age security. By publishing the momentous report ‘Averting the Old Age Crisis
– Policies to Protect the Old and Promote Growth’ (1994), the World Bank took over from the
ILO as the leader in the global discourse on old-age security (see Wodsak 2006 on the context
of the report, Wodsak 2011 on the general change in discourse, and Orenstein 2008 on the
ensuing global campaign for pension privatisation by the World Bank). The report called for
a multi-pillar arrangement of old-age security, in view of downscaling social insurance
schemes, which are mostly run on a pay-as-you-go basis, in favour of funded private provision
for old age. The multi-pillar arrangement proposed by the report allowed for a variety of



                                               37
options for the first pillar, including minimum provisions though not exactly a social pension
(World Bank 1994: 16f.). However, the idea of social pensions remained dormant in the
aftermath of the Averting report, to be set out more explicitly in a World Bank publication of
2005 as a ‘zero pillar’ in a five-pillar-model (Holzmann and Hinz 2005). Although the original
thrust of Averting was to increase the private share in provisions for old age in view of
demographic change and global financial markets, the multi-pillar concept brought the design
of the overall architecture of the old-age security onto the global agenda, beyond the
traditional focus on social insurance, and this included a basic pillar.

       Since 1983 HelpAge International has emerged as a non-governmental advocacy
organisation for older persons (Walker Bourne, Gorman und Bünte 2011), linking
development and social protection discourses and advocating social pensions from the early
2000s (Leutelt 2017). The ILO Recommendation 202 of 2012 ‘Recommendation concerning
National Floors of Social Protection’ (ILO 2002, initiated in 2009: ILO and WHO 2009), includes
old-age security as a key area of such ‘floors’.

Domestic or global forces? Event history analyses

What has caused the rise of social pension adoption in the developing world? Following the
theory of world society and related findings for social insurance (Usui 1994, Scruggs et al.
2013) we can hypothesize that changing global norms and models of social protection have
put pressure on national governments to adopt social pensions in order to conform to
legitimate expectations of assuming responsibility for securing individual rights (Meyer et al.
1997: 153).

       In the following we analyze the timing of adoptions and reforms of non-contributory
pension legislation across the developing world, 1967 to 2011. ix We rely on data about social
pension legislation in 139 developing nation states and a few dependent territories such as
Hong Kong, which was collected as part of the project FLOOR (www.floorcash.org). 66 out of
these 139 nation states had adopted a social pension by the end of 2011.




                                               38
       Dependent variable. Event history (or survival) models are suited to investigating the
factors that drive the adoption of social pensions, because of the notion of timing and risk
inherent in these models, which is in line with our research question (cf. Box-
Steffensheimer/Jones 2004: 2-3). Event history analysis has frequently been used in similar
analyses of the adoption of social insurance laws (Usui 1994; Kangas 2012; Kim 2001), of the
rise of conditional cash transfers in Latin America (Sugiyama 2011), of welfare state
retrenchment (Hicks/Zorn 2005). Numerous studies have analysed the effects of world
society variables on the ratification of international conventions by states (Abu-Sharkh 2010;
Wotipka/Ramirez 2008) and on political change (Hannan/Carroll 1981). Since the primary
interest is to uncover the influence of covariates on the hazard of adopting social pensions
rather than tracing explicitly the influence of time itself (cf. Box-Steffensheimer 2004: 47), we
estimate a Cox proportional hazard model in which the hazard-rate (the rate at which units
‘fail’ at time t, conditional on their survival up to time t) is modelled as hi(t) = h0(t)exp(β'x),
where β'x are covariates, which are estimated, while the baseline hazard h0 is not estimated.
Proportional hazards are assumed, so at any point in time the hazard ratio of two units must
be constant, which implies that the effects of co-variates must not change over time. Model
specification requires defining two types of events: When are the units of analysis, the nation
states, at risk of adopting social pensions, and what is the exact event which causes them to
exit the risk set?

       The year 1966, when the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights (ICESCR) was signed, marks a major step in the institutionalization of legitimate
expectations regarding the collective responsibility of states towards the individual well-
being of their citizens. Though 1966 does not mark the first adoption of non-contributory
pensions in the world or even the global South, letting the clock start ticking in 1966, following
a world event, seems appropriate given our theoretical assumption of world-level processes.
Countries that gained independence after 1966 enter the risk-set in the year they gain
independence and are – counterfactually – treated as left-truncated. This delayed-entry
specification is chosen to account for the fact that the baseline hazard, while no specific form



                                                39
of time-dependency is assumed, is assumed to be conditional on the calendar year. It
provides a conservative test of the hypothesis of world-level processes as captured by
covariates, because the effect of (unobserved) global heterogeneity is absorbed by the
baseline-hazard, which can be interpreted as the calendar year specific incidence function.

       Studies usually focus on the first adoption of social policy legislation (Collier/Messick
1975; Usui 1994, Kangas 2012, Kim 2001) upon which countries drop out of the risk set. This,
however, neglects fundamental reforms or even the outright replacement of programs. Since
many countries have replaced earlier non-contributory pensions by more generous and
encompassing schemes, such reforms (for the definition of fundamental reforms see section
1 above) have had a significant impact on the current landscape of social pensions in the
developing world. To account for these reform processes, we estimate multiple event
models. Because the baseline hazard is assumed to differ between countries that have
already adopted a social pensions and those that have not, a stratified multiple event
specification is chosen (Box-Steffensmeier/Jones 2004: 158-9). This implies that a separate
baseline hazard is assumed for countries, which have already adopted a social pension earlier.
Countries that inherited social pensions from their past as dependent territories of another
polity are placed in the according stratum.

       Pilot projects, an increasingly popular instrument among policy makers, are only
included when they are commissioned by national governments. Sub-national and state-level
schemes are generally excluded, while schemes that apply geographical targeting are
included if they are part of national social policy, even though state level policies have played
a significant role in the advancement of social protection for the elderly in some countries
such as India and Mexico. Since we focus on effects on legislative adoption rather than
implementation, the year a law was passed is used for analysis, even if it was implemented
later, such as the Brazilian Continuous Cash Benefit (BPC, 1993 vs. 1996), or not at all, such
as the zero-pillar of the 2001 pension reform in the Dominican Republic (Ondetti 2012: 50f.).

       Hypothesis and independent variables. The study focuses mainly on identifying
exogenous effects on policy adoption: diffusion as measured through indicators of regional


                                               40
diffusion and linkages to world society – through the number of ILO Core Labour Standards
(which the ILO summarized in 1998 in the ‘Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights
at Work’) ratified by a country, or ratification of the ILO convention 102 ‘concerning Minimum
Standards of Social Security’ (1952).

       The influence of regional diffusion, that is, the diffusion between states in one region,
is captured by the regional density of social pensions at t-1 (i.e. lagged one year). We
distinguish six regions as done by the World Bank and the Central Intelligence Agency: Sub-
Saharan Africa, East Asia/Oceania, Eastern Europe/Central Asia, Latin America/Caribbean,
Middle East/North Africa, and South Asia. A similar indicator has been used with regard to
convention adoption by Wotipka/Ramirez (2008). We assume that regional diffusion patterns
are influenced by global level processes, and we model this effect separately for the years
before and after 2001, to capture the shift in global discourse as indicated by the 2002
‘Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing (MIPAA)’.

       Linkages to world society (Meyer et al. 1997) can be conceptualized either as
organizational linkages or as prior commitment to international norms. We use the number
of ratifications of ILO Core Labour Standards over the last ten years (including year t).
Strang/Chang (1993) use a similar indicator in their pooled time series analysis, however they
only use conventions they deem relevant to social security provision. Since no ILO or other
international convention is directly linked to the provision of non-contributory benefits to
older persons, we choose the number of ratifications of core labor standards during the last
ten years to operationalize the intensity of recent efforts to subscribe to the established
world models of modern statehood with regards to social issues. Because we assume no
long-term effects of convention ratification (Strang/Chang 1993: 248), only conventions
ratified during the last ten years are included. Von Gliszczynski (2015) points out that the core
labour standards also mark the first appearance of the concept of a global social floor, which
was only later extended to include minimum guarantees in health and income security,
culminating in the adoption of ILO recommendation 202 ‘concerning National Floors of Social
Protection’ in June 2012 (Deacon 2013). All in all, the ratification indicator adequately



                                               41
captures the extent to which a country – at least formally – accepts the notion of a ‘collective
responsibility’ for the well-being of its citizens as enshrined in global norms.

       In addition, two events are included in the models to account for their potential
influence on social pension adoption. In both cases the years since the event are transformed
into a decay function (exp((0 – years since the event)/X) to model the decreasing possibility
of the event exercising influence on social pension adoption, X being the assumed 'half-life'
of event influence. The first type of event, which relates to linkages to world society is the
ratification of the ILO convention 102 ‘concerning Minimum Standards of Social Security’ (its
half-life being 2 years). It includes provisions for providing old age benefits not only based on
employment record, i.e. contributory, but leaves open the possibility of guaranteeing the
minimum standards through means-tested or universal benefits.

       The other event included is a pension reform that involves privatization. Whether
pension privatization can be traced to advocacy by the World Bank in the 1990s, is
controversial in the literature (Weyland 2005, Orenstein 2005, Madrid 2003, Mesa-
Lago/Müller 2002). But the World Bank not only called for privatization but also envisaged
the introduction of a non-contributory pillar. Hujo/Cook (2012: 26) assume that social
pension adoption is prominently driven by a ‘larger package of reforms of the existing pension
system’ (ibid.). This applies, for example to Germany, which introduced a social pension as
part of the great 2001 pension reform which included relative cuts in public pensions and an
expansion of occupational and private pensions. The social pension was to make up for cuts
in public pensions. Since pension reform and social pension adoption are assumed to coincide
or follow closely on each other, a shorter 'half-life' of one year is used.

       The usual range of control variables is used to control the influence of alternative
(exogenous and domestic) explanations of welfare state development:

The logic of industrialism perspective assumes that processes of industrialization produce
new social risks but at the same time provide more means to mend them. This would suggest
that higher levels of economic development along with greater needs in form of a bigger




                                               42
share of elder persons in the population drive the adoption of social pensions. To test this
hypothesis – and related modernization theories – the model includes GDP per capita in
constant 2005 dollars, inflation to indicate fiscal stability, the share of population over 65, the
share living in rural areas and the proportion of GDP produced in agriculture. Contrary to
modernization theory, the influence of the population living in rural areas is expected to be
positive, since agricultural working relations are often informal, increasing the need for non-
contributory social security.

       Political theories of welfare state development (for an overview see Myles/Quadagno
2002), emphasizing either working class strength (e.g. measured in union density) or strength
of social-democratic parties, are harder to test in a global environment, because they assume
the existence of democratic procedures of interest articulation and influence on the
complexion of government, both of which are often absent in the developing world. To
capture effects of politics, three variables measuring different aspects of democracy are
constructed. One is the widely used Polity IV index of auto-/democracy (Marshall et al. 2012).
We assume that democracy is positively related to social pension adoption, by allowing
citizens to demand the realization of social rights via voting for relevant parties. That is, social
citizenship is realized via political citizenship. Since there is little reason to believe that the
effect of democracy is instantaneous, two other indicators are generated from the polity
scores to allow for two complementary mechanisms of democracy: The sum of democratic
years (defined as years with a polity score equal or above 6; cf. Haggard/Kaufman 2008: 72-
8) within the last ten years, which rests on the assumption that articulation of interests within
the public sphere takes time, such as election periods and the formation of political parties
(Huber/Stephens 2012: 105); and a democratization event indicator, which highlights the
role of social policy in the event of nation-building and democratization. We assume that
democratization may be accompanied by new social policies as realizations of ‘reasonable
relationships of reciprocity’ (Kaufmann 2013: 32) within a national community (as found, for
example, in Taiwan and South Korea). A similar idea underlies Haggard and Kaufman's




                                                43
treatment of ‘critical realignments’ in the ‘social contract’ at periods of transition of a polity
(2008: 45).

       However, pronounced ethnic diversity and ethnic cleavages may play a larger role in
political life and undermine political mobilization based on class or income (cf. Gough/Wood
2004: 29). For this reason, we include a time-invariant variable indicating the population
share of the largest ethnic group (data from Fearon 2003).

Further international linkages besides subscription to global norms are explored. Trade
openness, measured as imports plus exports as a share of GDP, is expected to either push for
social policy expansion via ‘compensation’ mechanisms, or conversely cause retrenchment
via mechanisms of ‘competition’ (Hicks/Zorn 2005; Korpi/Palme 2003), both being plausible
expectations for the adoption of social pensions.

       Data for the control variables is mostly taken from the World Development Indicators
published by the World Bank, additional data on country independence and democracy from
Cheibub et al. (2010).

       Analysis. Our event models include 104 countries and 51 adoption events – small
countries with a population of less than 500,000 are dropped from the analysis – during the
period from 1967 to 2011 yielding 3581 country-years.

       In both models (Table 7) we can clearly identify how socio-economic modernization
influences social pension adoption. While the absolute level of wealth as indicated by GDP
per capita does not have a significant effect, a high proportion of agricultural production
within a country's economy lowers the hazard (in technical terms) of adopting a non-
contributory pension program. Contrary to our assumption the effect of democracy is only
visible when we account for the stability of democratic rule as done in model 2. The second
model also shows that newly democratized countries are almost five times more likely to
adopt a social pension than undemocratic states or older democracies.

       With regard to global diffusion processes, we find evidence that both world-level and
regional processes are at play. There is a positive influence of the commitment to global
socio-political norms as well as a time dependent regional diffusion process. The effect of the
regional density of social pensions before 2002 remains non-significant in both models, while
the regional density of social pensions is clearly driving social pension adoption since 2002.

       Two additional findings are striking: Just as hypothesized, there is a strong effect of
pension privatization on social pension adoption and reform. And, when looking at adoptions
and reforms, the proportion of the population ages 65 and above has a significant positive
effect on the hazard-rate.

       All in all, adoptions and fundamental reforms of social pensions seem to be driven by
three major forces:

       First, socioeconomic modernization and domestic politics matter in the developing
world as they did in the rise of Northern welfare states, and do so in the expected ways: Social
pension adoption is driven by an increased influence of the citizenry on the composition of
governments. In Latin America the government participation of left parties or coalitions that
support the extension of social security has led to an increase in pro-poor social policies,
including social pensions (Huber/Stephens 2012). But ‘the democratic class struggle’ is not
the only way, in which democracy may drive the adoption of non-contributory pensions.
Democratization, that is, the introduction of democratic rule, can entail a new ‘social




                                              46
contract’ (Haggard/Kaufmann 2008), which includes basic provision for the elderly. In either
case, social rights complement the political rights of citizenship.

       Second, pension reform events. Comprehensive reforms of existing arrangements of
public pensions can provide incentives for policy makers to introduce or reform social
pensions. The recent wave of pension privatization (Weyland 2005, Orenstein 2005) was
shown to substantially increase the hazard of social pension adoption. A striking example is
Bolivia where pension privatization was directly linked to the introduction of the universal
social pension Bonosol (Müller 2009). A second type of reform pressure comes from changing
demographics as indicated by the rising proportion of older persons in the population. Both
privatization and ageing of societies raise issues of coverage, which policy makers may try to
solve by introducing or extending a non-contributory pension pillar.

       Third, global norms seem to be underlying both regional and world-level diffusion
processes. x The ‘socialization of global politics’ (Deacon et al. 1997: 3) has increased
legitimate expectations towards states to respond to social questions. When the ILO adopted
the ‘Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work’ in 1998, which summarized
the core labour standards, these were still mostly framed as issues regarding the labour
contract but already envisioned a global social floor, which would later be specified for health
provision and income maintenance. We have shown that the degree to which a country
accepts these global norms of 'proper' state behaviour influences the adoption and reform
of social pensions. The time-dependent nature of the indicator of regional diffusion within
world regions shows that global changes cause countries to look beyond their borders for
new policies.

6. Conclusion: Social Pensions as Social Citizenship and Global Norm

The spread of social pensions has induced a far-reaching change in the organisation of social
protection in the South, filling part of the coverage gap left by social insurance which is
confined to workers in the formal sector of the economy. We may assume that social
pensions will spread further, since the rise of social pensions is part of wider changes in global



                                               47
politics and even global culture regarding the recognition of old age (Leisering 2011). Our
main finding is that social pensions, which in the North, like other means-tested benefits,
have not normally been seen as a source of social citizenship, have indeed contributed to
spreading social citizenship to poor persons in the global South. The overall arrangement of
income maintenance in Southern countries has become more universal through the
narrowing of the coverage gap left by social insurance. The benefit level often is high enough
to lift people out of extreme poverty. Furthermore, using a broad index of social citizenship,
that covers the dimensions of resources, recognition and participation in society, we found
that a sizable number of countries realize a considerable degree of social citizenship through
social pensions. This dovetails with earlier qualitative studies which found that social
pensions do not just provide resources but may also enhance the status of and respect for
beneficiaries in the family and community, as well as the ability of beneficiaries to participate
in social life. Social pensions give a degree of dignity to older persons. Regarding the overall
arrangement of public pensions in a country, we identified four models of social citizenship
in view of the role played by social pensions. One model found in a small number of countries
could be seen as a new social model in the South, realizing social citizenship on the basis of
need rather than achievement, as familiar from the Northern social model of social insurance
and pensions for public sector employees.

       While global debates often centre on the juxtaposition of universal benefits, thought
to reflect social-democratic or progressive thinking, and means tested benefits considered to
reflect liberal views of social policy, this distinction turned out not to be helpful in explaining
the variety of social pensions. This is so because the juxtaposition universalism versus means
testing captures only a fraction of social citizenship and, as we have shown, the ways of means
testing differ considerably. The notion of universal benefits – benefits to which all citizens or
members of a social category are entitled – misses other important aspects of benefit
schemes that matter for the social quality of pensions and give rise to considerable
differences in social quality: benefit level, qualifying age, life expectancy at age 60, the scale
of a pension scheme (the share of the social pension in overall old-age security), details of



                                                48
institutional design, and implementation. Looking at social citizenship, we find that universal
pensions on average score 0.75 while means tested pensions, which do not apply an ascribed
poverty test, score 0.87. This includes that universal pensions on average have lower benefits
than means tested pensions. The different aspects that make up a social pension illustrate
the variety of social pensions. For example, more than half (34) of the social pensions in the
South guarantee an income above the international poverty line for at least 10 years of
benefit receipt on average. But almost as many (30) fall short of even such a minimal
conception of social citizenship. Benefits far below international poverty lines and/or short
periods of benefit receipt are found in 21 countries. Such transfers can hardly be seen to
realise a notion of ‘basic equality’ according to the concept of citizenship. Often pensions
provide ‘equal but poor’ (Myles 1984: 43) benefits. When measured not against international
but national poverty lines, only 8 countries out of 33, for which data on national poverty lines
is available, lift recipients above this line. Even more than minimum income protection
schemes in Europe, social pensions in the South normally realise at best a minimal conception
of social citizenship, a ‘modicum of income and security’ rather than the ‘life of a civilised
being according to the standards prevailing in the society’ (Marshall 1950: 11). When using
wage levels rather than poverty lines as measure for societal standards, this difference
becomes even more pronounced.

       Regarding the causes that made for the rise of social pensions we found that
conventional explanatory models, which focus on the effects of economic development and
democracy, apply but that the recent legislative activity regarding non-contributory pensions
across the global South is also influenced by global changes and linkages: diffusion between
nation-states in the same world region is conspicuously time sensitive, and the subscription
by states to global norms also has a positive effect on social pension legislation as we
expected from the point of view of world society theory. Overall the analysis seems to confirm
that social pensions have recently become a global model which is influencing policy making
in developing countries.




                                              49
       However, as common in this type of world society research, the analysis could not
satisfactorily identify the channels and modes of influence. To move beyond this kind of the
analysis, one would need to more explicitly model the changing meanings attached to the
human rights and ILO conventions in global and national arenas.

       In many countries we observe ‘decoupling’ between the adoption of international
conventions and local practices, as expected from the point of view of world society theory
(Meyer et al. 1997: 154-6). In these countries, the reality of social pensions deviates from the
grand rhetoric of international advocacy organizations to which states tend to subscribe. The
Dominican Republic's non-contributory pillar of the 2001 pension reform, for example, has
not yet been implemented (Ondetti 2012), the massive Indian and Bangladeshi programs
provide meagre benefits (9.5i$/month and 7.35i$/month), and even a country as developed
in economic terms as Thailand keeps its social pension benefit below the international
poverty line at just 28i$/month. On the other hand, there has been a steady increase in
coverage and benefits in many countries such as South Africa, Brazil and Costa Rica. In these
countries social pensions seem to be turning into the foundation of a new type of social
citizenship.

       The last fifteen years have seen a massive expansion of old-age pension coverage
across the developing world, which is mostly accounted for by the adoption and reform of
non-contributory, or 'social', pensions. All in all, our findings seem to confirm the remark
made by Gough and Therborn (2010: 711) that the ‘developmental paths of European welfare
states are not likely to be repeated’ in developing countries, in two ways. First, we found
evidence of a historical and geographical variation in the realization of social citizenship – in
development contexts means tested benefits can serve as fundamental rather than residual
elements of social policy. Second, we found that global norms and policy models, which have
emerged over the post WWII era, have contributed to the dissemination and extension of
non-contributory transfers throughout the global South, increasingly so since the 1990s.

i        Annex A in Böger (2013) lists all countries with the dates of the introduction and/or reforms of social
pensions.
ii        The social citizenship index for social pensions has been created by Böger (2013: section IV 3.1).
Palacios and Know-Vydmanov (2014) define a Social Pension Wealth index for social pensions that elaborates
on the OECD’s more general concept of Pension Wealth and includes some of the variables of our index. For the
distinctive features of our social citizenship index compared to Palacios and Know-Vydmanov and the OECD see
Note 6.
iii      Bahle et al. refer to minimum income protection schemes in general, not just social pensions.
iv         Palacios and Knox-Vydmanov (2014) also use the term ‘scale’, but in their usage the term includes
indicators that overlap with the social quality of the pension. By contrast, we restrict the term scale to refer
exclusively to coverage, in order to make social citizenship and scale more independent and cross-tabulate the
two. Palacios and Know-Vydmanov also refer to the OECD’s term ‘pension wealth’, transforming it into ‘social
pension wealth’. This concept is similar to our index of social citizenship, including coverage and benefit level,
but social pension wealth does not include a differentiation of the ways of means testing, which is crucial to our
analysis, and the underlying concept of identification of need. Therefore, our concepts social citizenship and
scale are less designed in economic terms, as ‘social pension wealth’ is, but aim to capture sociological aspects
like recognition and representation. If a social pension scheme is large, receiving a social pension may appear
as a normal condition in society, thus diminishing stigma which is potentially attached to non-contributory
benefits for small sections of the population. At the same time, a small social pension scheme, if ‘fundamental’
(that is, with a high degree of social citizenship), can be significant as a symbol of the state’s endeavour to secure
basic citizenship.
v        Similarly, Palacios and Sluchynsky (2006: 8ff.) distinguish between ‘core’ and ‘supplementary’ social
pensions.
vi        Palacios and Sluchynsky (2006: 9) also consider 40% as a threshold that indicates a substantial role for
a social pension.
vii      See also Böger (2013: Table 8) for the relationship between the scale of social pensions and the type of
targeting applied.
viii   For ways of modelling national arrangements of old-age security see Korpi and Palme (1998: 667),
Immergut et al. (2006: 21-23) and Leisering (2012: 114-118).
ix       For a more detailed analysis see Böger (2013). For an alternative analysis, also based on event history
data, see Rudolph (2016), who covers 185 countries, 1960-2012.
x       Remarkably, this does not hold when looking at pension adoptions only, without pension reforms (see
Böger 2013: 27-29).

Abstract

Social pensions—non-contributory provisions for old age, mostly means-tested—have mushroomed
in the global South since the 1990s, and have also been advocated by international organizations.
Using the data base FLOORCASH constructed by the authors and their research team, we cover
all countries of the global South, to go beyond existing case studies and selective comparisons.
We investigate the contribution of social pensions to rights-based social protection and seek to
explain their spread across the global South.
While in Northern welfare states universal social services and social insurance are seen as the
hallmarks of social citizenship as conceived by T.H. Marshall, measured by indices such as Esping-
Andersen’s decommodification index, this paper advances a conceptualization of social rights that
includes means-tested benefits, in order to recognize the bigger role of non-contributory transfers
in developing countries. Applying a new measure of the social quality of social pensions, we detect
considerable differences between countries, which are not reducible to the common distinction
universal vs. means-tested benefits. Combing the social quality measure with the dimension of
scale (population covered), we identify four normative models of old-age security. One of these
models might herald a new social model for the South. Finally the paper applies event history
analysis to explain the spread of social pensions across the global South, finding that standard
domestic variables, subscription to international norms, and pension reform events were central
drivers of social pension expansion.
