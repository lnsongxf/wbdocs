FOREWORD
I am pleased to launch this 10th South Africa Economic Update which offers a review of the country’s recent
economic and social developments and its outlook in the context of global economic prospects. It focuses on
the role of innovation in fostering economic growth, creating jobs and reducing poverty in an environment in
which more South Africans are getting poorer. Between 2008 and 2015, 4 out of 5 South Africans experienced
poverty, some temporarily, some permanently.

In recent years, two important vehicles of South Africa’s economic growth lost steam: high commodity prices
and foreign direct investments, the latter being sanctioned in 2017 with the downgrade to sub-investment level.
Meanwhile, South Africa diverged in productivity from main technological leaders, whereas private expenditure
in research and development contracted. These developments highlight the pressing need to focus on innovation
policy as an actionable tool for economic and social progress.

Reviewing South Africa’s innovation strengths – academic excellence, entrepreneurial networks in large
metros, a large array of operational public programs to support research and development, and weaknesses
– a business environment insufficiently conducive to the emergence of innovative startups, a low skills base,
a slow and expensive broad-band, high trading costs, the Update underlines the large untapped potential for
innovation. Innovation can not only raise South Africa’s competitiveness and allow breaking into new markets
and creating jobs. It can also significantly improve the life of millions of poor South Africans and their chance for
economic participation, through the provision of better and cheaper goods and services, in health, transports, and
e-government notably. Fundamentally, innovation can help South Africa diversify from its traditional commodity-
based economic model which did not lead to the reduction of inequalities in last decades.

The Update report builds on a solid research partnership between the Department of National Treasury, the
Department of Science and Technology, the National Advisory Council on Innovation, Statistics South Africa, and
the World Bank to better understand the drivers of innovation and how to maximize its social and economic
impact. South African authorities are to be commended for making firms’ tax and export transactions data
available to the research community, enabling a deeper investigation of the complex issues at stake. The Update’s
findings also build on the ongoing cooperation between the national government, metros and the World Bank
to improve the life of city dwellers, through better urban planning and management, and between Eskom and
the World Bank to promote innovative energy solutions.

As the World Bank, we stand ready to work with all stakeholders and support South Africa to fulfill its development
agenda and contribute towards ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. It is our hope that
South Africa will continue using the World Bank’s knowledge, global experience and convening power as a
platform for peer-to-peer learning in the identification of evidenced based pragmatic solutions to reach the
country’s National Development Plan’s goals.

² Taper tantrum refers to the 2013 surge in U.S. Treasury yields, which resulted from the Federal Reserve’s gradual reduction (or
tapering) in the amount of money it was feeding into the economy. In response, investors drew their money out of the bond market
rapidly, which sharply increased bond yields.
³ The cost of raising funds outside the domestic market reflects two factors: the risk-free rate, which is accepted as the interest rate
on a U.S. Treasury security with the same maturity; and a spread to reflect the greater risks that investors perceive as being associated
with the issue or issuer.

 ⁷ In comparison with a scenario in which the U.S. TFP would have grown from 2008 at the pace recorded over the period 1994–2007.
 This conclusion is obtained by estimating a leader-follower econometric model, whereby South Africa’s TFP growth would depend
 positively on U.S. TFP growth and the difference between U.S. and South African TFP levels.
