1.      The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT), the Capital Markets Board
and the Banking Regulation and Supervisory Authority (BRSA) are the authorities with
responsibility for specific elements of the Turkey National Payments System (NPS). The
CBRT, is the central bank and has regulatory and oversight responsibility for payment and
securities settlement systems. The CMB has responsibility for safe and efficient functioning of
the capital markets and is responsible for the CSDs, CCPs and TRs. The BRSA as part of its
banking supervision responsibility is responsible for regulation of payment instruments and
also regulation and supervision of non-bank e-money and payment institutions.

2.     This assessment covers the following CBRT owned and operated FMIs: The
Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) system and the Electronic Securities Transfer System
(ESTS). The assessment takes into account the interlinkages of the EFT and ESTS with the
other FMIs in Turkey: Takasbank and MKK.

3.      The presentation of the assessment takes into account the integrated nature of the
EFT and ESTS. These two systems are part of an integrated system and share the operating
rules, governance arrangements, risk management framework, access criteria and system
interfaces and message formats. These two systems have been assessed separately, but common
details are presented only in the assessment of the EFT system and this is referenced in the
ESTS assessment. The recommendations table presents an integrated set of recommendations.

4.      The EFT system broadly observes the risk management framework, Liquidity risk
management, Default Management and operational risk management principles; and,
partially observes the tiered participation principle. The rest are observed or not
applicable. The CBRT has a departmental level risk management framework and accordingly
the Payment Systems Department (PSD) has developed a risk management framework for the
CBRT payment and settlement systems. As the risk management framework is very recent, it
has not been subject to internal audit, but as a policy the PSD risk management framework
would be in the scope of internal audit department of the CBRT. The risk management
framework by design is internally focused and does not explicitly take into account risks arising
from external sources, linkages with other FMIs; and the risks posed by the CBRT payment
and settlement systems to other FMIs. The participants of the EFT system are exposed to
liquidity risk as there is a distinct pattern of concentration of transactions closer to the end of
the day. The CBRT has developed a default risk management framework but this has not been
tested comprehensively. The CBRT has developed a comprehensive operational risk
management framework, however the business continuity procedures do not fully take into
account operational risks arising from other FMIs and similarly the risks posed to other FMIs.
The rules and procedures of the CBRT payment and settlement systems do not acknowledge
tiered participation arrangements, however in reality there are some tiered participation
arrangements.

5.     The ESTS system broadly observes the risk management framework, liquidity,
default management and operational risk principles; and, the rest are observed or not
applicable. The observations related to risk management framework, liquidity risk, default
management and operational risk management are same as that for the EFT system. In the area
of legal risk, there is an ambiguity in the rules and procedures of the CBRT payment and
settlement systems and the overall legal framework, related to the sub-account structure of
Takasbank for participants of money markets and the Government securities secondary market.




                                                5
This creates a situation of potentially inadequate legal certainty for the protection of the
securities holdings of the sub-account holders.

6.      The responsibilities A and B are broadly observed while the other three are
observed. The CBRT and the CMB are the two overseers of FMIs in Turkey and there is a
clear articulation of the scope of each of these authorities. The regulatory and oversight
framework for Trade Repositories (TRs), which are in the purview of the CMB, is in the process
of development. The CMB has not established dedicated organization arrangements and
allocated dedicated resources for its oversight activities.

7.     The present document is the assessment of select Financial Market Infrastructures
(FMI) in Turkey against the Committee for Payments and Market Infrastructures
(CPMI) and International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO) Principles
for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs). The assessment 1 was conducted in the
context of field missions of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) to Turkey in
April 2016.

8.      This assessment covers the following FMIs: The Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)
system and the Electronic Securities Transfer System (ESTS). These two FMIs form part
of an integrated payment and securities settlement system called the “CBRT Payment and
Securities Settlement System”. This integrated system also includes the Retail Payment System
(RPS) which functions in Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) mode for customer initiated
inter-bank transactions. The EFT system also functions in the RTGS mode, but is used
exclusively for transactions related to participating banks proprietary transactions including for
the settlement of primary and secondary market transactions on Government securities and
central bank bills. The ESTS functions as a Central Securities Depository (CSD) for
Government securities and central bank bills; the ESTS also functions as a Securities
Settlement System (SSS) for the primary and OTC secondary market transactions between the
banks on these securities.

9.      The assessment takes into account the interlinkages of the EFT and ESTS with the
other FMIs in Turkey: Takasbank and Merkezi Kayit Kurulusu (MKK). The Takasbank
functions as the SSS for the secondary market transactions and repos on Government securities
on the Borsa Istanbul (BIST); SSS for equities and corporate bonds traded on the BIST; and,
as Central Counterparty (CCP) for the derivatives traded on the BIST. The Takasbank also
operates a Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) platform; money market with banks and
other institutional investors as participants; and a collateralized cash credit facility for banks
and other institutional investors. The Takasbank is also the Legal Entity Identifier Operating
Unit (LOU) for Turkey. The MKK functions as the CSD for equities and bonds traded in the
BIST and for Government securities held by brokers and individual and institutional investors.
The MKK holds securities in the name of the beneficial owner. There is a link between the
MKK and ESTS to record movement of Government securities from banks to investors and
vice versa. The MKK has an account at the ESTS to reflect the consolidated holding of
Government securities in the MKK by investors. The MKK has also recently received a license
from the CMB to function as a Trade Repository (TR) for OTC derivatives.

10.    The information used in the assessment included all relevant laws, rules and
procedures governing the systems, material available on these FMIs in the public domain
and from the CBRT and the CMB. In addition, extensive discussions were held with the
regulators and overseers – CBRT and CMB, the other FMIs – Takasbank and MKK; and
commercial banks. In addition, the mission team was provided with:

•     Self-assessment of the EFT system against the PFMIs.
•     Self-assessment of the ESTS against the PFMIs.
•     Self-assessment of the CBRT and CMB on their responsibilities for FMIs against the
      PFMIs.

     to the EFT, ESTS and the RPS.
•    Excerpts of the documents related to the internal policies and procedures and deliberations
     of relevant working groups and committees.

11.    This assessment uses the methodology presented in the CPMI-IOSCO publication
– “Assessment Methodology and Disclosure Framework for PFMIS (December, 2012)”
and takes into account the considerations related to the FMIs operated by central banks,
outlined in the CPMI publication “Application of PFMIs for central bank operated
FMIs” (August 2015).

12.     The presentation of the assessment takes into account the integrated nature of the
EFT and ESTS. These two systems are part of an integrated system and share the operating
rules, governance arrangements, risk management framework, access criteria and system
interfaces and message formats. The assessment tables for the EFT provide the detailed
descriptions for these and these are referenced in the ESTS assessment table instead of
repeating the same details again. The principles on credit risk, collateral management and
liquidity risk have been assessed for ESTS, to account for the credit extension to participants
which happens outside the EFT and ESTS system but it is integral to the functioning of both
FMIs. In the summary section and recommendations table, the highlights of the EFT and ESTS
assessments and the recommendations are presented together.

         II.      OVERVIEW OF THE PAYMENT, CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT LANDSCAPE

    A.         Regulation, Supervision and Oversight of Payment and Securities Settlement
                                            Systems

Institutional arrangements

13.      The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT), the Capital Markets Board
(CMB) and the Banking Regulation and Supervisory Authority (BRSA) are the
authorities with responsibility for specific elements of the Turkey National Payments
System (NPS). The CBRT, is the central bank and has regulatory and oversight responsibility
for payment and securities settlement systems. The CMB has responsibility for the safe and
efficient functioning of the capital markets and is responsible for the CSDs, CCPs and TRs.
The BRSA as part of its banking supervision responsibility is responsible for regulation of
payment instruments and also regulation and supervision of non-bank e-money and payment
institutions.
14.     The CBRT is the regulator, overseer and licensing authority for the payment and
securities settlement systems. The CBRT published its objectives and policies as regards
payment and securities settlement systems on its website in October 2014. According to this
the main objective of the CBRT is to ensure “safe, uninterrupted, efficient and effective
functioning of the systems.” The CBRT, is a member of the CPMI. The CBRT is the overseer
of the payment and securities settlement systems. The Payment Systems Department (PSD) of
the CBRT was established in November 2013 and is responsible for leading all initiatives
related to payment and securities settlement systems, operating the core systems, and
overseeing all payment and securities settlement systems in Turkey. The PSD is headed by an
Executive Director (ED) reporting to one of the four Deputy Governors of the CBRT and
executes its functions through four divisions – Payment Systems Operations, Regulation &




                                                8
Oversight, Payment Transactions, and Research & Development; organized as two groups with
each group reporting to a Deputy Executive Director (DED). The organization chart of the
CBRT and the PSD is presented below.

                  Figure 2: CBRT Payment Systems Department (PSD)




15.    The CMB is the regulatory and supervisory authority for the capital markets. The
Borsa Istanbul (BIST) is the only securities exchange and Merkezi Kayit Kurulusu (MKK)
functions as Turkey’s central securities depository (CSD) and registrar of dematerialized
corporate securities. Capital market trades conducted over BIST are settled and cleared by the




                                              9
Istanbul Settlement and Custody Bank (Takasbank). 2 Takasbank also acts as the central
counterparty (CCP) for derivatives transactions undertaken on BIST and at the Securities
Lending Market operated by itself. Government bonds, treasury bills, CBRT bills, capital
market instruments, share income certificates and international securities are traded on the
Borsa Istanbul. The BIST bonds and bills market is the only organized, fully automated market
for outright purchases and sales, as well as repurchase (repo) and reverse repurchase (reverse
repo) transactions with fixed income securities. Treasury bills and government bonds are the
most actively traded instruments. The CMB is a member of IOSCO and is responsible for
regulation, supervision and oversight of Turkey’s corporate securities market FMIs (CSD, CCP
and TR) and their observance of the PFMIs.
16.     The BRSA is the sole authority for banking regulation and supervision. 3 The
fundamental goal of the BRSA is to ensure confidence and stability in the financial
markets, provide effective operation of the credit market, and safeguard the rights and
interests of depositors. It was established in 1999 by the Turkish Government to improve the
effectiveness of regulation and supervision of the banking industry. BRSA is public legal entity
with administrative and financial autonomy. It was established according to Banks Act No.
4389 in June 1999 and began operating in August 2000. According to Banking Law (No. 5411),
in order to establish confidence and stability in financial markets, the sound operation of the
credit system, foster the development of the financial sector, and protect the rights and interests
of depositors, the responsibilities of BRSA are three-fold: (i) Regulate, monitor and supervise
banks and financial holding companies, as well as leasing, factoring and financing companies,
and ensure the enforcement of their regulations; (ii) Become members of international
financial, economic and professional organizations in which domestic and foreign equivalent
agencies participate, to sign memorandum of understanding with the authorized bodies of
foreign countries regarding the issues that fall under the Agency’s duty field; and (iii) Fulfil
other duties assigned by the law. As part of its responsibility for banking supervision, the BRSA
also regulates payment instruments and also regulates and supervises non-bank e-money and
payment institutions.


Legal and regulatory framework
17.     The CBRT derives its authority over the NPS from the Law on the Central Bank
of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT Law) – Law no. 1211, which was enacted in 1970 and
amended, most recently, in 2011; and the Law on Payment and Securities Settlement
Systems, Payment Services and Electronic Money Institutions No 6493 (PSL) enacted in
June 2013. The CBRT law, as amended in 2011, authorizes the CBRT to establish payment,
securities transfer and settlement systems, enact regulations to ensure the uninterrupted
operation and oversight of existing or future systems, and to determine the methods and
instruments, including the electronic environment for payments, that shall be used for
payments. The PSL, granted the CBRT broad authorities and responsibilities for the nation’s
payment and securities settlement systems. In specific, the law assigned responsibility to
CBRT to (i) prepare secondary regulation regarding establishment, operations, acquisition and
transfers of shares, and oversight of payment and securities settlement systems within a year

  Takasbank is a licensed as a non-deposit-taking sector-specific investment bank. Takasbank is regulated and
supervised by the BRSA. However the CMB and CBRT also oversee Takasbank: as CCP and TRa central
clearing institution by the CMB; and as SSS by the CBRT.

(Articles 4.3 and 8.1); (ii) designate payment and securities settlement systems that are subject
to the provisions of settlement finality and publish them in the Official Gazette; 4 (iii) license
payment and securities settlement systems; (iv) monitor licenses and revocation of licenses in
certain situations defined by the Law; (v) overseeing all payment and securities settlement
systems that operate in Turkey; and (vi) impose administrative fines on the system operators
that violate the provisions of Law and secondary regulations.
18.     CBRT has issued implementing regulations for the operation and oversight of
payment and securities settlement systems since the passage of the Payment Law. CBRT’s
‘Regulation on Operations of the Payment and Securities Settlement Systems’ and ‘Regulation
on Oversight of the Payment and Securities Settlement Systems’ were both enacted in June
2014. They set forth the principles and procedures regarding operating licenses, system rules,
operating conditions, the risk management framework, collateral, guarantee and credit
mechanisms, acquisition and transfers of shares, and oversight. The “Regulation on
Operations of the Payment and Securities Settlement Systems” (June 2014) – (ROPSSS) sets
forth the principles and procedures regarding operating licenses, system rules, operating
conditions, the risk management framework, collateral, guarantee and credit mechanisms,
acquisition and transfers of shares. The “Regulation on Oversight of the Payment and
Securities Settlement Systems” (June 2014) – (ROSPSSS) forms the basis for CBRT’s
oversight activities. The CBRT has also prepared the ‘Communique on Information Systems
of Payment and Securities Settlement Systems’. The Communique defines detailed provisions
that system operators are expected to take into consideration regarding the management of
information systems.
19.    Banking Law No 5411 lists payment services as one of the activities banks are
allowed to carry out. 5 In specific Article 4 (d) mentions “ Carrying out any type of payment
and collection transactions, including cash and deposit payment and fund transfer transactions,
correspondent bank transactions, or use of check accounts” and Article 4 (g) refers to “Issuing
payment instruments such as credit cards, bank cards and travellers checks, and executing
relevant activities.”
20.     The PSL lists activities, which are considered to be payment services and also
covers non-bank e-money providers and payment institutions. Article 12 of the PSL lists
the transactions that are to be deemed as "payment services". Among these activities are all
operations required for operating a payment account, payment transactions including transfers
of funds on a payment account of the payment service user and direct debits, issuing or
acquiring of payment instruments, money remittance and services for mediating invoice
payments. The PSL, includes provisions on the establishment, licensing, operating conditions,
and oversight of payment services. It is also considered to be a general framework of payment
services, and empowers the BRSA to prepare secondary regulations. Article 13 of the Law
exhaustively lists the institutions authorized to perform the above listed payment services as:
(i) The banks within the scope of the Banking Law; (ii) Electronic Money Institutions or (iii)
Payment Institutions. It should also be noted according to Article 5 of the Regulation No. 29043
on Payment Services, Electronic Money Issuance, Payment Institutions and Electronic Money
(27 June 2014), the Post Office (PTT) is also authorized to perform such payment services
within the scope of the provisions of the Postal Services Law No. 6475.
21.     Cheque Law (No 5941), which was enacted in 2009 and amended further in 2012,
governs all aspects of cheque payments. It describes and defines the modalities for the
issuance, acceptance and payment by cheque. The amendments to the law in 2012

decriminalized the issuance of bad cheques, imposing administrative sanctions in place of the
criminal sanctions in the 2009 version of the law. The law enables the establishment and
functioning of interbank cheque clearing houses, whose oversight and supervision vests with
the CBRT under the CBRT Law and the PSL. The rules and procedures of the Inter-bank
Cheque Clearing House (ICH) are governed according to the regulation issued by the CBRT.
22.     The Bank Cards and Credit Cards Law (No 5464), which was also enacted prior
to the PSL 6, serves to ensure efficient and effective functioning of the card payments
system by establishing the principles and procedures applicable to the issuance, use, and
clearing and settlement of bank cards and credit cards. 7 Organizations and entities which
establish a card system, issue cards and enter into merchant agreements, as well as merchants
and card holders are subject to and governed by the provisions of this law. This law is
complemented by secondary regulation of BRSA.
23.     On the securities side, the issuance and management of public debt is governed by
the Public Finance and Debt Management Law (Law No 4749). The law establishes rules
and procedures for the management of domestic and foreign public debt by the central
government and other establishments with more than 50% of their capital belonging to the
state, state banks, investment and development banks, municipalities, and other local
government agencies. The CBRT as an agent of the Undersecretariat of Treasury, is responsible
for issuing and settling government bonds and Treasury bills on behalf of the Treasury.
24.     The mandate of the Capital Market Law No 6362 (CML) is to “regulate and
supervise capital markets to ensure the functioning and development of capital markets
in a secure, transparent, efficient, stable, fair and competitive environment and to protect
the rights and interests of investors.” To this end, the CML provides for the establishment
of the CMB, as the independent regulator and overseer of the capital markets in Turkey. Capital
market instruments, their public offering and sale, exchange markets and other markets
organized pursuant to the law, capital market activities, capital market institutions, and investor
protection are subject to the provisions of the law. Settlement finality and irrevocability with
respect to capital market transactions is provided under the law. In addition, the law enables
the setting up of market infrastructures such as central securities depositories (CSD), central
clearing institutions, central counterparties (CCPs) and trade repositories (TRs) and defines
their activities. The law also has provisions for the setting up of the Turkish Capital Markets
Association (TCMA) as a self-regulatory professional body for institutions authorized to
perform investment activities. The CMB has issued secondary regulations related to CSDs and
CCPs and is in the process of issuing the regulations for TRs.
                 B.      Payment, Clearing and Settlement Systems in Turkey

25.      The CBRT owns and operates an integrated payment and securities settlement
system comprising two payment systems – EFT and RPS, functioning in RTGS mode;
and ESTS - a CSD-cum-SSS for Government securities and CBRT bills. The EFT is an
RTGS system and is fully integrated with the ESTS. The EFT was launched in April 1992,
modernized in 2000, and again, in 2012. The second generation EFT added key functionality
to the system, including a central queuing mechanism, funds management facilities, direct debit
facilities, and phased closure of operations, as well as an emergency backup center. The third

   Article 24 of the Payment Systems Law, exempts payment card related matters covered in the Bank Card and
Credit Card Law: “The provisions of this Law shall not be applied to bank and credit card related matters
regulated under the Bank Cards and Credit Cards Law Nr. 5464 dated February 23, 2006 and the regulations
issued pursuant to the Law Nr. 5464.”

generation split the processing of interbank (time critical banking payments) and retail
payments into two separate operations creating the RPS for customer initiated transactions and
with the EFT covering inter-bank proprietary transactions. There is no transaction value ceiling
or floor for these systems. According to the CBRT, by 2011, the rapid growth in the volume
of low value retail payments was creating a significant risk to the settlement of large value and
urgent payments, hence in consultation with the banks the RPS that was developed as a system
for handling the customer initiated transactions was created. The EFT, RPS and ESTS all use
the same inter-bank network and function as an integrated system. Message types are used to
direct messages to the appropriate sub-system. The CBRT is the system owner and operator,
the operative and administrative responsibility lies with the CBRT’s Payment Systems
Operation Division of the PSD and the technical responsibility with the Analytical IT
Development Division (Information Technology Department). Any bank operating in
accordance with the Banking Law can, with CBRT’s approval, become a direct participant in
the EFT, RPS and ESTS. There are a total of 54 participants, with the exception of the MKK
all other participants are banks.
26.     The participants in the EFT system and RPS are only banks. They have different
accounts at the CBRT for the EFT and RPS and support only local currency credit
transfers. The systems differ on the SLA for processing time and queue management
features. While both components are based on the RTGS-principle, the EFT service level
agreement (SLA) limits processing time 8 to a maximum of one minute (current average is one
second). In contrast, the RPS SLA limits the processing time to no more than 15 minutes
(current average is 30 seconds). EFT settles on First-in first-out (FIFO)-basis based on priority
and the RPS on By-Pass first-in first-out (By-Pass FIFO) basis; and EFT allows for queue
management, whereas RPS does not. The EFT system also has an automated multilateral
offsetting generated every minute. Participants have different settlement accounts for EFT and
RPS, between which funds can be moved intra-day. Both components support only Turkish
Lira (TRY) denominated credit transfers. In 2015, RPS settled 315,243,249 payments with a
total value of TRY 9.99 trillion, whereas EFT settled 2,918,019 payments with a total value of
TRY 42.73 trillion. The total value processed by the EFT and RPS system in 2015 was around
27.9 times the GDP of Turkey in 2015. The number of transactions processed by the EFT shows
a distinct skew to the later part of the operational day – on a typical day around 50% in the last
2.5 hours of operations. In January 2016, around 15.94% of transactions were queued for
inadequate balance and remained in the queue for an average of 7 minutes. The maximum
queue time 9 in January 2016, was around 18 minutes.

    This refers to the time taken to process a transaction assuming funds are available.

    This refers to the daily average time a transaction remains in queue.

27. The ESTS is the CSD for government debt securities and the CBRT bills. It also
functions as an SSS for the primary and OTC secondary market operations on these
securities, settling in DVP mode using Model 1; the ESTS also supports the use of these
securities as collaterals for the CBRT liquidity facilities. The ESTS maintains these
securities in dematerialized form and records the securities ownership from their initial issue,
transfers arising from secondary market transactions through to their final redemption. The
ESTS works in an integrated manner with the EFT to support DvP, using Model 1 – gross
settlement of both funds and securities leg. The proprietary securities holdings of banks are
held at banks’ own accounts in the ESTS. Retail and institutional investors accounts are held
in the MKK at the beneficial owner level. The MKK is also a participant in the ESTS and has
an account to reflect the consolidated holdings of these securities held by investors. Banks also
have separate collateral accounts, one each for respective CBRT liquidity facilities. The ESTS
supports holding of sub-accounts for customers – called the “007” accounts. As a practice
banks use this account only for intra-day transactions and at the end of day move all holdings
in the “007” accounts to the invetsors account in MKK. The Takasbank, is an exception, and it
uses this to also reflect holdings of investor’s assets as parts of its SSS activities. The ESTS
also supports various business flows such as Free of Payment (FOP) transfers of securities
between participants, repositioning of securities between the accounts of a participant, direct
debiting of securities by the CBRT, and the CBRT Portfolio Operations. In 2015, the ESTS
processed 302,512 securities transactions, 113,542 were DvP operations, for which the total
value of corresponding payment legs settled in EFT was TRY 7.01 trillion; the rest were free
of payment transfers.
28.     Operating hours of EFT, RPS and ESTS are weekdays (except national holidays)
from 8:30 to 17:30. The EFT and RPS settlement accounts are zero balance accounts, at the
start of the day EFT and RPS receives the previous day’s closing balances as starting balance
from the CBRT. The EFT and RPS receive electronic payment orders sent by the participants
on an ongoing basis, debit the sender’s account if its balance suffices, credit the settlement
account of the receiving participant, and inform the receiving bank. If funds are insufficient,
the messages are queued. At the end of every business day, EFT and RPS send reconciliation
reports to the participants and the CBRT.

29.    The Participant Interface System (PIS) is the system component used by




                                               14
participants for interfacing with the CBRT Payment Systems. The PIS is essentially a
messaging system and is the gateway to the EFT, RPS and the ESTS system. The participants
access PIS through a closed private network. The PIS checks the access rights, enforces
security measures, verifies digital signatures, manages the encryption and decryption and
validates messages. The PIS system is also used for distribution and access to end of day reports
and files shared between the participants and the CBRT payment and securities settlement
systems. The below figure shows how the various system components interact with each other.

               Figure 4: CBRT payment and securities settlement Systems




30.     The banks have access to diversified sources of liquidity for use in the EFT and
RPS system. The reserve maintenance period for banks is 14 days, within this period the banks
have access to their statutory reserves at the CBRT for use in the EFT and RPS system. The
CBRT as part of its monetary policy operations offers collateralized Intra-day Liquidity
Facility (ILF), overnight credit, daily repo operations, weekly repo auctions and finally the
Lender of Last Resort (LOLR) facilities. These are collectively called CBRT liquidity facilities.
The CBRT sets an overall borrowing cap across the standing facilities except the LOLR. The
cap is based on the asset size of a bank. The banks in addition have access to: the BIST repo
market; the inter-bank money market operated by the Takasbank; the cash credit facility offered
by the Takasbank; and, pre-agreed credit lines between banks. The below table summarizes the
various sources of liquidity, their operating hours, collaterals accepted, clearing and settlement
(C&S) institution and the Average Daily Value (ADV) based on data for March 2016.

   31.     The Takasbank functions as the SSS for the secondary market transactions and
   repos on Government securities on the Borsa Istanbul (BIST); SSS for equities and
   corporate bonds traded in the BIST; and, as Central Counterparty (CCP) for the
   derivatives traded on the BIST. The Takasbank also operates a Securities Lending and
   Borrowing (SLB) platform and acts as CCP at this platform as well; money market platform
   for banks and other institutional investors as participants; and a collateralized cash credit
   facility for banks and other institutional investors. The Takasbank is also the Legal Entity
   Identifier Operating Unit (LOU) for Turkey. The below charts shows the size of the various
   markets and the collaterals held by Takasbank for the operations across these markets.
   32.    The MKK functions as the CSD for equities and corporate bonds traded in the
   BIST. Government securities held by brokers and individual and institutional investors
   are also monitored on the MKK system. The MKK holds securities in the name of the
   beneficial owner. There is a link between the MKK and ESTS to record movement of
   Government securities from banks to investors and vice versa. The MKK has an account at the
   ESTS to reflect the consolidated holding of Government securities in the MKK by investors.

33.     Foreign exchange transactions are primarily conducted bilaterally between banks
and by banks with the CBRT. There is no PVP arrangement for the inter-bank foreign
exchange transactions. The banks place their bid and asks for foreign currency at the CBRT’s
Reuters page. The CBRT seeks to intervene, processes these and settles the Foreign Currency
(FCY) leg in correspondent accounts abroad. The CBRT also operates periodic FCY auctions
which also function in the same way. The banks also use OTC trades, again using foreign
correspondent bank accounts for the FCY leg. The banks have FCY accounts with the CBRT,
but these are only used for reserve maintenance and transactions are not allowed.
34.     Interbank cheque transactions are cleared through Interbank cheque Clearing
House (ICH)) which is overseen by the CBRT. Cheque clearing activities are executed in
Istanbul and Ankara Clearing Houses. Both clearing houses have identical hardware and
software, and can serve as a back-up center for each other. ICH functions as a Deferred Net
Settlement (DNS) system for cheque transactions clearing and settlement. Transactions are
settled, based on multilateral netting on T+2 basis, through the special settlement account of
ICH at the CBRT. The ICH notifies its member banks and the CBRT of each bank’s net debit
or credit position. After all debit positions have been closed by the debtor banks, the payments
are credited to the creditor banks.
35.    All domestic payment card transactions are processed through two domestic
switches - the Interbank Card Center System (BKM) and Gosas. The BKM is a DNS
system for debit card and credit card transactions. All banks in Turkey issuing cards or

netting, on the books of the central bank through the BKM’s special settlement account at the
CBRT. 13 Net results calculated on T+1 and settlement made on T+2. Credit and debit
transactions with non-member banks or with banks outside Turkey are processed outside
Turkey by Visa or MasterCard or via correspondent banking arrangements. BKM also offers
BKM Express, a digital wallet, which can be accessed via smartphones too and allows, among
others, Person-to-Person Transfers. The Gosas system also operates a card switch for its 10
members and processes the transactions between these banks. Gosas settles in DNS mode on
T+2 in the books of Garanti Bank. The Gosas system also has an acceptance mark called
“Bonus”.
36.     The Post and Telegraph (PTT) – the Turkish post operates postal banking services
through its department “PTT Bank”. The services provided by PTT Bank include: Postal
Cheque Account – a regular checking account with a linked Maestro 14 branded debit card
(96.72 million); prepaid cards for social protection payments of Government and other
international agencies (1.5 million); remittances, collection services, bill payments through its
vast network of branches (4,414 – largest in Turkey) for over 359 institutions; operate network
of ATMs (2124); and, ecommerce acquiring. The PTT bank also offers a mobile solution for
accessing its various services. The PTT bank does not have direct access to the EFT and RPS,
it accesses these through other banks. The PTT bank indirectly participates to the BKM.
37.     Pursuant to the provisions the PSL, the BRSA has recently commenced the process
of licensing e-money issuers and other payment institutions 15. The PSL introduced the
category of non-bank e-money issuers and other payment institutions and assigned the
regulatory and supervision of these institutions to the BRSA. The BRSA issued the
implementing regulations related to these in 2014. The BRSA has received 48 applications and
is in the process of reviewing them. It has already provided licenses to 5 e-money issuers and
11 payment institutions. The applications of the remaining 32 are under examination. Some of
these firms were already operating and applied under the “transition period” allowed under the
PSL for institutions in operation prior to the PSL coming into force.

39.    The CBRT is in the process of developing an oversight framework which envisages
articulating the specific standards to be used for specific types of systems, the data and
reporting requirements. As noted earlier the CBRT has issued a general policy statement on
payment and securities settlement systems, which makes the PFMIs applicable for all payment
and securities settlement systems in Turkey. As part of the new oversight framework the CBRT
intends to adapt the PFMIs in terms of specific principles and key considerations which would
be applicable for specific retail payment systems.

40.   The CBRT in co-ordination with the banks is evaluating inclusion of the TRY in
the CLS System.

                             III.    SUMMARY ASSESSMENT

Principles: Key Findings and Follow up

General organization (Principles 1 - 3)

41.     The legal basis for the EFT and ESTS, are the CBRT law, the PSL and specific
regulations pertaining to operations and oversight. The CBRT as the operator has
developed detailed operating rules – the Payment Systems Operating Rules (PSOR). The
participants are required to sign a participation contract which binds them to the PSOR. The
participation contract and the PSOR have a sound legal basis. All material legal aspects are
adequately covered in the PSL and the CBRT law. All participants of the EFT system are
subject to Turkish laws and regulations; and all operations are also performed in Turkey.

42.     The legal certainty for the arrangements with respect to the collateralized liquidity
support relating to securities held in ICSDs, should be ascertained. The usage of liquidity
support against securities held in the ICSDs are very limited and the securities pledged as
collateral are held in the name of CBRT, hence it is not an immediate issue of concern.
However as a good measure it would be important to review the legal certainty for these
arrangements.

43.     There appears to be some ambiguity on the legal basis for the protection of
participant securities holdings which are transferred by participants to the account of
Takasbank in ESTS. . Banks and individual and institutional investors participating in the
Government securities secondary market at the BIST or in the inter-bank money market
operated by the Takasbank, transfer securities to the account of Takasbank (in ESTS) for their
securities transactions and also to be used as collateral. The specific provisions related to
collateral in the PSL and CML are applicable, which protects the securities pledged as
collateral, however the protection for securities holdings in the sub-accounts from any
insolvency of Takasbank is not clear. The PSOR does not clearly recognize holding of
government securities sub-accounts by a participant [Takasbank in this case]. The CML and
other provisions related to CSDs do not specifically apply to this arrangement, as the ESTS is
outside the scope of the CML. However, articles in CML pertaining to segregation of assets of
investors in investor firms (article 46) appears to be applicable to Takasbank. Investor firms as
defined in article 3(v) of the CML and investment services as defined in article 37 (g)
encompass the activities of Takasbank as a SSS.




                                               20
44.     The objectives and policies of the CBRT regarding Payment and Securities
Settlement Systems place a high priority on stability, safety and efficiency. The CBRT has
documented governance arrangements for the institution as a whole that define clear and direct
lines of responsibility and accountability. The same governance framework has been applied
for the EFT system and ESTS as well, as a core responsibility of the PSD. There is a risk
management framework for the CBRT operated payment systems. There is an existing process
of auditing departmental risk management framework, however the PSD’s risk management
framework has not been audited yet. Mechanisms exist for involving stakeholders in decision-
making process, and the CBRT effectively communicates with the stakeholders through
different channels.

45.     The PSD has developed a risk management framework based on the ISO 30001
framework. The risk management framework covers the specific risks outlined in the PFMIs.
The framework is reviewed annually and is also subject to audit by the CBRT audit committee.
The PSOR provides adequate powers to the CBRT to ensure conformance to the operating and
security procedures outlined in the PSOR. The PSD has mechanisms in place for measuring
and monitoring specific aspects of liquidity risk and operational reliability of the EFT system.

46.     The risk management framework is however internally focused and does not
explicitly take into account the dependencies on other FMIs and also internal systems of
the CBRT. In particular, the operations of the EFT system has a heavy dependence on the
money markets operated by Takasbank and the CBRT markets department, given their role in
providing liquidity to participants. The Markets Department is the decision maker on the
provision of the CBRT liquidity support facilities and also has its own systems and processes.
This risk however is to an extent mitigated as the Takasbank and other FMIs are subject to the
oversight of the CBRT and the Markets department also has its own risk management
framework and co-ordination framework is in place.

Credit and liquidity risk management (Principles 4 - 7)

47.     The credit risk in the EFT and ESTS stems from the CBRT liquidity support
operations to the participants. The liquidity support operations are not integrated into the
EFT system and as such are handled by the markets department. The credit risk is considered
as part of the EFT risk management framework, but the full treatment of the credit risk from
liquidity support operations is in the domain of the markets department. The markets
department’s credit risk management framework includes instituting overall borrowing limits,
requiring all credit facilities to be collateralized with good quality securities, and applying
haircuts. The collaterals are re-valued daily and the CBRT has the rights to ask for additional
collateral when there is an adverse movement.

48.     The collateral management system and processes are external to the EFT and
ESTS and are managed by the CBRT markets department. The extension of liquidity
support is considered a monetary policy instrument. The choice of securities, haircut rates,
valuation practices and operational arrangements are an integral part of the CBRT monetary
policy operations framework. The CBRT maintains a list of eligible securities and their haircut
rates. The haircut rates depend on the types and maturity of securities. The eligible securities
are TRY government bonds, central bank bills, lease certificates issued by ALCTT (Asset
leasing company of the Turkish Treasury), foreign bonds and notes, IILM issuances and foreign
exchange deposits and foreign exchange banknotes deposits.




                                              21
49.     The CBRT as the operator of the EFT system and ESTS, by itself is not
constrained in TRY liquidity. However the participants could face liquidity shortages.
The participants have access to liquidity support from the CBRT and the inter-bank money
markets. These liquidity options are collateralized and in the case of the intraday and overnight
CBRT liquidity support there is an overall borrowing limit for the participant. However,
liquidity support is available without any limit within the framework of LOLR. There is no
explicit stress testing mechanism in place, however there is an ongoing review of the policy
framework relating to the CBRT intraday liquidity support. There is however no set time-
period for this. The transaction pattern in the EFT system shows existence of substantial
liquidity risk. The CBRT has studied this and is currently evaluating suitable options.

Settlement (Principles 8 - 10)

50.     The EFT functions as a RTGS system with final settlement through the day and
settles in central bank money. Settlement finality is protected in the PSL and clearly
articulated in the PSOR and as such has a sound legal basis.

51.    In ESTS, securities are dematerialised and processed in book entry form.
Although it was possible to rematerialize and physically deliver the securities previously,
as of November 2012 physical printing of government debt securities has been
terminated. With the redemption of latest printed securities, there have been no printed
government debt securities since July 2013. Since government debt securities are only in
dematerialised form, there is no risk associated with the storage and delivery of physical
instruments.

CSD and exchange-of-value settlement systems (Principles 11, 12)

52.     The ESTS functions as a CSD-cum-SSS for Government securities and central
bank bills. The ESTS system settles the securities transactions in DVP mode using model
1. The funds leg is settled at the EFT system. The CBRT, in the capacity as the agent of the
Prime Ministry Undersecretariat of Treasury, carries out the dematerialised issue, custody and
redemption of government securities, which are issued by the Prime Ministry Undersecretariat
of Treasury, by the CBRT, and by other public institutions. Since the CBRT is the CSD for the
securities in ESTS, there is neither custody risk stemming from the insolvency of the CSD nor
the risk of the participants’ securities being sequestrated due to the other activities of the system
operator. In ESTS, the securities owned by the participants’ customers are segregated from the
participants’ own holdings and kept in a special securities account of the MKK. MKK keeps
these securities by customer details in its system enabling customers to track their holdings.
All the operations by the CBRT in ESTS require dual approval, are logged and, if needed, can
be tracked. During the end of day operations of ESTS, participants are notified about their
securities account holdings and their daily operations for reconciliation purposes. All the
securities held in the ESTS are in dematerialized book entry form, there are no physical
securities.

Default management (Principles 13, 14)

53.     The PSD has developed a default management procedure recently covering all the
payment and securities settlement systems operated by the CBRT. The default procedure
is consistent with the provisions in the PSOR and derives its legal basis from the PSL. Given



                                                 22
that the procedure was adopted very recently it has not been tested in its entirety. The
participants in the system are all banks, except the MKK. Banks are supervised by the BRSA
and the MKK by the CMB. These authorities have the sole right related to insolvency or
bankruptcy of these participants. There are existing co-ordination and information sharing
arrangements between the CBRT, BRSA and the CMB. Hence there is high degree of certainty
that the CBRT will have adequate notice to execute its default management process.
Nevertheless, any delays in executing the default management process, could escalate the risks
in the system.

General business and operational risk management (Principles 15 - 17)

54.     The EFT and ESTS are central bank operated FMIs, as such aspects related to
liquid assets, wind down plans and viable plan for raising additional capital are not
applicable. The pricing policy for the EFT system aims for a full investment and operational
expenses recovery. The pricing structure is clear and communicated to the participants. The
fees are recovered on a monthly basis and the corresponding information is available to
participants. The costs of the EFT system are covered under the general budget of the CBRT
and subject to the standard audit process.

55.     The CBRT Payment and Securities Settlement Systems have a comprehensive
operational risk management Framework spanning people, process and systems. The risk
management framework is reviewed once a year. Industry best practices for IT risk
management framework – ISO 27001 and ITIL for IT services management, have been used.
There are adequate processes and procedures in place to address people aspects and the IT
systems and processes have been developed using industry standards and best practices. There
are periodic IT security reviews and there are dedicated organizational arrangements in place
for monitoring and managing the IT security aspects. The IT infrastructure is built in a way
that there is no single point of failure and there is full-fledged backup site which works on a
load sharing basis with the main site. In addition there is an application package developed
using a completely different hardware and software platform to cover the risk of a simultaneous
impact on both the infrastructures, which is a possibility in particular with cyber risk incidents.

56.     There is a well-laid out BCP plan with an organized governance arrangement to
monitor and review its execution. However the BCP scenarios are focussed on the
infrastructure of the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems. Scenarios, either
arising within the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems, within the CBRT or
externally, which can cause a widespread impact have not been included. The participants are
included in the BCP tests and there are plans underway to include complex scenarios to fully
cover business continuity risks arising from and posed to other FMIs and participants– in
particular Takasbank and MKK.

57.     The PSOR covers operational risk management in articles 17-20, however there is
no explicit mandate on this and there is no structured process to measure ongoing
compliance with these aspects. However, the CBRT recently surveyed the participants to
assess their BCP plans and cyber resilience. All the participants reported having BCPs, but
there were some gaps in terms of the quality of the BCP and cyber resilience readiness of some
participants. The CBRT is already addressing this as part of its revised business continuity
guide.




                                                23
Access (Principles 18 - 20)

58.     Criteria and requirements for participation are clearly stated in the PSOR and
are disclosed to related parties. Only banks and the MKK, which is a special participant of
ESTS for the implementation of safekeeping of the securities in the name of customers, are
accepted as participants in the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems. Only banks
are participants in the EFT system. The policy decision on only allowing access to banks has
been taken based on considerations of liquidity risk management. The CBRT does not allow
access to specific components of the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems, all
participants have access to the EFT, RPS and ESTS system. The MKK is the only exception.
The CBRT monitors compliance to operational aspects of the participation criteria and is
guided by the BRSA for the continued qualification of the participant to function as a bank.
Suspension and orderly exit rules are stated in the PSOR and disclosed to participants.

59.     The PSOR acknowledges and regulates only the direct participants in the CBRT
payment and securities settlement systems and there is no definition or rules set for
indirect participation; however the EFT system in practice does have tiered
arrangements. Entities that are not eligible for participation can perform operations through
the participants, but are treated as customers of participants, rather than indirect participants.
One bank and one entity carrying out electronic payment services, are accessing the EFT
system through other banks. Other market intermediaries and non-bank financial entities also
access the services of the EFT and also likely other elements of the CBRT payment and
securities settlement systems. The usage of TETS by brokers and other market intermediaries
is also an example of a tiered participation arrangement for the EFT system. The ESTS system
however by design does not have tiered participation. The CBRT has developed capability to
track the details of the initiator, recipient and purpose of transactions, based on specialized
fields in the message formats. These tools can be used to develop a comprehensive monitoring
framework for tiered participation arrangements.

60.     The ESTS and the MKK system have an issuer CSD-investor CSD link. The risk
management framework however does not explicitly acknowledge this arrangement as a link.
However the MKK is overseen by the CBRT for its SSS functions and hence also has a full
integrated view of the risks arising from the ESTS-MKK link.

Efficiency (Principles 21, 22)

61.     Message exchange of the CBRT Payment and Securities Settlement System is
managed via secure services using industry standard technologies and using XML based
proprietary message formats. It is possible to easily convert XML messages used in the
CBRT payment and securities settlement systems into other message formats. The PIS used to
interface with the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems offers adequate tools to
allow STP mode.

62.     The process for secondary market transactions on Government securities varies
based on the nature of counterparty, creating inefficiencies for the participants. The
processes related to settlement of the securities and funds leg vary based on whether the
counterparty of a transaction for a bank is another bank, a custodian, individual investor or
other institutional investor. Addressing this will require some changes in ESTS and introducing
new interfaces between the MKK, ESTS and Takasbank.



                                               24
Transparency (Principles 23, 24)

63.     Rules and procedures for the CBRT Payment and Settlement Systems are defined
clearly and shared with participants. System descriptions, system rules, general structure
and workflows, summary statistics and pricing policy are disclosed to the public through the
CBRT web page and the CBRT Payment Systems User Group web site. Pricing tariff is defined
yearly based on pricing policy and disclosed to participants and to the public at least one month
before its entry into force. The CBRT is committed to publish the details of the assessment of
the EFT system and ESTS in line with the requirements of this principle.

Responsibilities: Key Findings and Follow up

64.     The CBRT law, the PSL and the CML clearly layout the specific payment and
market infrastructures that are subject to regulation, supervision and oversight of the
authorities. These laws put together, assign the responsibility for regulating, supervising
and overseeing payment systems and SSS with the CBRT; and CCPs, CSDs and TRs with
the CML. The authorities have further publically announced their adoption of the CPMI-
IOSCO PFMIs. The CMB has specifically stated that the PFMIs would be applicable for the
MKK and Takasbank. The CBRT in its public statement on its objectives for payment and
securities settlement systems has articulated that it will apply the PFMIs to all the payment and
securities settlement systems under its oversight. The CBRT has further issued the ROPSS,
which articulates its powers to regulate and oversee the payment and securities settlement
systems. The CMB has issued specific regulations/communiques for the CSDs and CCPs,
however it has not yet issued regulations for TRs. The powers of the CMB with respect over
TRs is however clear and derives from the CML. Also, while the CMB has licensed the MKK
as a TR, it has not yet commenced operations and the CMB as part of its approval to MKK to
commence operations as a TR intended to issue a regulation/communique to fully articulate its
regulatory and oversight actions and powers related to TRs.
65.     The CBRT and the CMB have the relevant powers to obtain information and
induce change to carry out their oversight activities. These powers have been explicitly
articulated in secondary regulations with respect to the payment systems and SSS, by the
CBRT. The CMB has articulated its powers with respect to the CCPs and SSS. However its
powers with respect to the TRs have not been explicitly articulated yet. At this point, however
there are no TRs in Turkey. The CMB has licensed the MKK to function as a TR. However
prior to its becoming operational, the CMB intends to issue specific regulations.

66.     The CBRT and the CMB has adequate resources and qualified staff to carry out
its oversight and regulatory responsibilities with respect to the FMIs in its oversight. The
CBRT has specific designated staff for carrying out the oversight activities. The CMB’s
oversight activities are housed in a department which also includes regulation and supervision
of brokers and also the BIST. The CMB has however not allocated dedicated resources for the
oversight of FMIs under its purview.

67.     The CBRT and the CMB have articulated their policies with respect to FMIs
through a policy statement publsihed on their respective websites. The policy statement
is consistent with the respect legal powers and regulations issued by these authorities. The
CBRT and the CMB have issued policy statements articulating their adoption of the PFMIs. In
the case of the CBRT it has required all the payment and securities settlement systems in its
purview to adopt the PFMIs and has already completed the self-assessment against the PFMIs
for the FMIs operated by it. The CBRT in addition has asked the Takasbank and the MKK, to
complete self-assessments as SSS. The CMB has asked the Takasbank and the MKK to
complete self-assessments as CCP and CSD respectively. The legal and regulatory measures
governing the functioning of the CBRT and the CMB allow data sharing amongst them and
with other related authorities, in particular the BRSA which regulates the Takasbank as a
banking institution. The FSC provides the structured mechanism for sharing, analyzing and
resolving any issues related to the financial sector that may impact financial stability. This

 in place to share and seek information and collaborate on an as needed basis.

                  or Shortcomings
      A                             The CMB should ensure that CMB
                 Lack of regulatory it         issues          a
                 framework for TRs regulation/communique on                       Medium
                                    TRs, before it accords
                                    approval to the MKK to
                                    commence its operations as a
                                    TR.

      B                               The CMB could consider           CMB        Medium

                                      respect to the FMIs in its
                                      scope. The CMB should
                                      issue the regulations related
                                      to TRs ahead of MKK
                                      commencing its operations.

Principle 1: Legal basis
An FMI should have a well-founded, clear, transparent, and enforceable legal basis for each
material aspect of its activities in all relevant jurisdictions.
Key consideration 1 The legal basis should provide a high degree of certainty for each
                          material aspect of an FMI’s activities in all relevant jurisdictions.
                          The main legal and regulatory measures related to payment and settlement
                          systems are listed below. The detailed discussions on these measures are
                          in paragraphs 17-24.

                        CBRT Law: This law covers the institutional arrangements and powers of
                        the CBRT, inter alia this includes powers of oversight over payment and
                        settlement systems and rights to operate payment and settlement systems.

                        PSL: This is a specialized law covering payment and settlement systems
                        and establishes the legal basis for finality, netting and protection of
                        collateral rights. This law also establishes the regulatory and oversight
                        powers of the CBRT over payment and settlement systems. The CBRT has
                        issued regulations detailing the regulatory framework for operation and
                        licensing of payment and settlement systems and the oversight
                        arrangements for these.

                        CML: This law covers the institutional arrangements and powers of the
                        CMB and assigns regulatory and oversight powers over CSDs, CCPs and
                        TRs to the CMB. This law also covers finality, netting and protection of
                        collateral rights for the FMIs in the purview of the CMB. The CMB has
                        issued specific regulations and communiques on CCPs, CSDs and other
                        aspects.

                        In addition the CBRT as the operator of the EFT and ESTS has also
                        established operating rules – the PSOR, as required under the PSL.

                        Material aspects and relevant jurisdictions

                        The EFT system is operated by the CBRT and functions as a RTGS system with
                        periodic multilateral offsetting. All the system participants are banks licensed for
                        operations in Turkey by the BRSA and fully subject to the laws of Turkey,
                        including for its participation in the EFT system.

                        The EFT system by itself does not offer any liquidity support, however all
                        participants except the MKK, can avail the liquidity support from the CBRT, the
                        inter-bank money market, Takasbank cash credit facility and credit lines amongst
                        banks.

                        The CBRT liquidity supports are: intra-day credit, overnight credit; 1-week
                        repos; and, under the LOLR facility. The liquidity support offered by the CBRT




                                                      33
                       are all collateralized. The accepted collaterals are Turkish government bonds,
                       central bank bills, lease certificates issued by ALCTT (Asset leasing
                       company of the Turkish Treasury), foreign bonds and notes, International
                       Islamic Liquidity Management (IILM) 17 issuances, foreign exchange
                       deposits and foreign exchange banknotes deposits.

                       The inter-bank money markets are also collateralized and accepted collaterals
                       include the ones used for the CBRT liquidity support and in addition corporate
                       bonds, foreign currency and gold.

                       The material aspects for the EFT system that require legal certainty are:
                              •        Right of the CBRT to operate payment systems
                              •        Rights and interests of parties
                              •        Settlement Finality
                              •        Delivery versus payment
                              •        Collateral rights
                              •        Netting
                              •        Electronic means of initiating transactions

                       Relevant jurisdictions

                       The relevant jurisdiction for the functioning of the CBRT payment and
                       settlement systems is Turkey.

                       Legal basis for each material aspect

                       Right of the CBRT to operate payment systems

                       The article 4(f) of the CBRT Law lists establishment and operation of payment,
                       securities and settlement systems, as part of the fundamental duties and powers
                       of the CBRT. The same article vests oversight powers with the CBRT over all
                       payments, securities transfer and settlement systems. This article was amended
                       as part of the PSL and as such needs to be read together. These terms are defined
                       in the PSL (art 3).

                       Rights and interests of parties
                       The rights and responsibilities of the CBRT and system participants are defined
                       clearly in the Payment Systems Operating Rules (PSOR) - sections 3, 4 and 5.
                       Article 4(2) of the PSL establishes that rights and responsibilities of the operator
                       and participants would be as per the contract between the operator and
                       participants and the system rules established by the operator. The PSOR
                       constitute the system rules of the EFT system and all participants of the EFT
                       execute a “Participation Contract” with the CBRT as the operator of the EFT
                       system.
                       The PSOR, means of initiating transactions, message structure and associated
                       aspects are includes as the annexes of the “Participation Contract”. The article 3
                       of the “Participation Contract”, make the annexes to the contract an integral part
                       of the contract and are as such considered binding.

Settlement Finality
The Article 10 of the PSL establishes settlement finality and irrevocability for
systems designated by the CBRT (Art 11). The CBRT has designated the EFT,
RPS and the ESTS in the official gazette and accordingly the provisions of article
10 of the PSL covers the EFT system.

Article 10(1) of the PSL requires the following to be defined in the operating
rules of the system: the point of time when a transaction become irrevocable
andthe time of entry and time when a settlement of a transfer order is final.

Article 10(3) of the PSL further elaborates that any decisions, including those
relating to insolvency and bankruptcy, taken under any other law regarding any
transfer orders, would be valid only for those that enter the system after the
system operator has been notified. Article 10 (4) of the PSL covers systems using
netting process and makes the provisions of article 10 (3) applicable to them. In
particular, allowing transfer orders that entered the system before the system
operator was notified of any legal decision, to be included in the netting process.

The PSOR has defined irrevocability as the time when the settlement accounts
have been debited or credited (art 8) and this is also considered the time when the
settlement is final. Article 7(3) of the PSOR further defines that the “server time”
recorded in relevant timestamps as the time that will be used for recording time
of entry, irrevocability and finality.

The term “transfer order” as defined in the PSL encompasses securities transfer
and hence the provisions also apply to the DVP settlements involving the
securities settlements in the EFT system. The Article 9.1.b of the PSOR specifies
that under DVP settlement the securities transfer and the funds transfer for a
securities settlement transaction would be carried out simultaneously.

Collateral rights
Article 10 (7) of the PSL preserves the right of the collateral holder (participant
and operator) in a payment system to use the collateral to fulfill the obligations
of the owner to the system, in the event of any notifications relating to any
transactions issued under any other law (as covered in article 10(3)); article 10(5)
of the PSL also specifies that any balances in fund and securities accounts of any
participant impacted by the notifications, would be used primarily for settling
obligations to the system. This provision ensures that the collateral placed by a
participant is bankruptcy and insolvency remote.

Netting
Netting is defined in article 3(o) of the PSL. As noted earlier the provision of
settlement finality also applies to systems using netting, ensuring enforceability
of netting arrangements even in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of any
participant

Electronic means of initiating transactions
The PSOR, means of initiating transactions, message structure and associated
aspects are elaborated in the annexes of the “Participation Contract”. These
clearly describe the process of initiating and receiving a transaction. Hence the
electronic means of initiating the transaction are hence considered binding.
Although the CBRT is not a Certification Authority (CA) defined in the



                              35
                      Electronic Signature Law 5070, based on its duties regarding the payment
                      systems assigned by the CBRT Law, the CBRT issues and uses the digital
                      certificates compliant with the Electronic Signature Law, limited to the CBRT
                      services such as the CBRT Payment Systems and the Electronic Data Transfer
                      System.
Key consideration 2   An FMI should have rules, procedures, and contracts that are clear,
                      understandable, and consistent with relevant laws and regulations.
Description           The PSOR constitutes the rules and procedures of the EFT system. The PSOR
                      and detailed description of the process and technical aspects are presented as
                      annexes to the participation contract signed by all participants. As noted earlier
                      the article 3 of the participation contract makes the annexes an integral part of the
                      contract.
                      Copies of the participation contract and the PSOR are delivered to the participants
                      at their application. The CBRT has the authority to make additional regulations
                      on operational details (PSOR, Art 13).
                      As per the internal procedures of the CBRT, the CBRT Executive Committee
                      approves changes to the Rule Book. All changes are announced to all participants
                      in advance.

                      The Article 3 of the PSOR lays out the legal basis for the PSOR as deriving from
                      article 4 of the CBRT law and article 4 and 7 of the PSL. The PSOR provisions
                      are consistent with these provisions and further are consistent with the Article 7
                      of the ROPSSS. This consistency is also assessed through the payment systems
                      oversight activities of the CBRT.
Key consideration 3   An FMI should be able to articulate the legal basis for its activities to
                      relevant authorities, participants, and, where relevant, participants’
                      customers, in a clear and understandable way.
Description           The Article 3 of the PSOR lays out the legal basis for the PSOR as deriving from
                      article 4 of the CBRT law and article 4 and 7 of the PSL.

Key consideration 4   An FMI should have rules, procedures, and contracts that are
                      enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. There should be a high degree
                      of certainty that actions taken by the FMI under such rules and
                      procedures will not be voided, reversed, or subject to stays.
Description           Enforceability of rules, procedures and contracts

                      The PSOR derives its legal basis from the PSL and CBRT Law. The PSL
                      clearly acknowledges the role of operating rules of a system. The CBRT
                      as the operator the EFT system has an internal legal team that prepared the
                      PSOR and vets all procedures and contracts and this is then further
                      approved by the executive committee of the CBRT.

                      Degree of certainty for rules and procedures

                      Given the clear and well-founded legal basis for the PSOR and the
                      participation contract, there is high degree of legal certainty for the rules
                      and procedures.

                      Until now there have been no adverse court rulings related to the
                      enforceability of the operating rules and procedures of any payment and
                      securities settlement systems.



                                                    36
Key consideration 5   An FMI conducting business in multiple jurisdictions should identify
                      and mitigate the risks arising from any potential conflict of laws
                      across jurisdictions.
Description           All the participants in the EFT system are subject to Turkish laws and
                      regulations.

                      The collaterals accepted for the liquidity support operations include some
                      securities held in ICSDs – notably Eurobonds in Euroclear and some IILM
                      issuances in a Malaysian CSD. The process of providing liquidity support
                      involving these foreign securities, requires the collateral securities to be
                      transferred to the account of the CBRT in the respective ICSDs. These
                      transfers could be subject to conflict of law.
Key conclusions       The EFT functions as a RTGS system with periodic multilateral offsetting.
                      The liquidity support provision to participants is outside of the EFT
                      system, but is integral to the functioning of the EFT system.

                      The legal basis for the EFT comprises the CBRT law, the PSL and specific
                      regulations pertaining to operations and oversight. CBRT as the operator
                      the PSL has developed detailed operating and procedures – the PSOR. The
                      participants are required to sign a participation contract which binds them
                      to the PSOR. The participation contract and the PSOR have a sound legal
                      basis. All material legal aspects are adequately covered in the PSL and the
                      CBRT law. All participants of the EFT system are subject to Turkish laws
                      and regulations; and all operations are also performed in Turkey.

                      The PSOR and participation contract and other related contractual aspects
                      are vetted by the CBRT legal department and by the executive committee.

                      There could be some conflict of law issues with respect to the
                      collateralized liquidity support relating to securities held in ICSDs. The
                      risk arises from any ruling in the jurisdiction on the ICSD having an impact
                      on CBRT's holdings, for example if the jurisdiction does not support
                      finality or protection of customer assets, there would be impact on CBRT.
                      Their usage is however very limited and the securities pledged as collateral
                      are held in the name of the CBRT, hence it is not an immediate issue of
                      concern.
Assessment of         Observed.
Principle 1
Recommendations       The CBRT could consider seeking external legal opinion on the
and                   enforceability of the PSOR, all contractual arrangements and also with
comments              respect to the conflict of law with respect to the securities held in the
                      ICSDs.

Principle 2: Governance
An FMI should have governance arrangements that are clear and transparent, promote the safety
and efficiency of the FMI, and support the stability of the broader financial system, other relevant
public interest considerations, and the objectives of relevant stakeholders.
Key consideration 1 An FMI should have objectives that place a high priority on the safety
                         and efficiency of the FMI and explicitly support financial stability and
                         other relevant public interest considerations
Description              The EFT system is operated by the CBRT. The general objectives and duties of
                          the CBRT which is also as an overseer of the NPS, covers the EFT system.

                          According to the article 4.I (f) of the CBRT Law, the fundamental duties and
                          powers of the CBRT related with payment systems are defined as “establishing
                          securities transfer and settlement systems, oversight and regulation of the systems
                          that are founded or to be founded to ensure smooth operation of the systems,
                          establishing procedures and tools to be used for payments including electronic
                          payments.” The article 4.I (g) of the CBRT further assigns financial stability as a
                          responsibility to the CBRT.
                          The PSL, article 9.1 (h) also recognizes implications of payment systems on
                          financial stability and empowers the CBRT to take necessary actions to address
                          any adverse impact.
                          The Objectives and Policies of the CBRT Regarding Payment and Securities
                          Settlement Systems have been defined in accordance with the CBRT Law and the
                          CBRT’s Strategic Plan and has been disclosed to the public on the CBRT web
                          site 18.
                          The CBRT’s Strategic Plan for 2014-2018 19, under the heading of 2.1.1. Public
                          Area of the Main Policies Section, also explicitly recognizes the objective of the
                          CBRT to ensure efficient, secure and effective functioning of payment systems it
                          operates and also the overall NPS. The strategic plan is available to all the
                          participants and the public at large, as it is published on the CBRT website.

                          The CBRT carries out the following core policies and activities:
                                •       To make regulations to ensure the safe, uninterrupted, effective
                                operation of payments systems and to mitigate the risks those systems may
                                have,
                                •       To define the methods and instruments to be used for payments,
                                •       To make regulations for the payment system that are up-to-date
                                and comply with international standards in order to ensure financial and
                                monetary stability and to efficiently pursue the monetary policy,
                                •       To oversee the systems to ensure their compliance with the
                                national and international regulations and standards,

                                    settlement systems,
                                    •       To continuously monitor the compliance of the systems to the
                                    PFMIs in order to prevent the systemic risk that payment systems may
                                    trigger or transmit,
                                    •        To monitor the developments that may affect the efficiency and
                                    safety of the systems,
                                    •        To conduct the activities related with the systems in cooperation
                                    with the institutions responsible for the oversight of the financial system
                                    and system participants.

                            A division of the PSD of the CBRT is responsible for the operations of the EFT
                            (as a part of the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems) and a separate
                            division for its oversight. As part of the CBRT’s strategic planning and reporting
                            procedure, each CBRT department annually establishes a performance program in
                            order to support the aims and objectives defined in the CBRT’s strategic plan. The
                            performance program is evaluated annually, and reported and presented to the
                            CBRT Board.
                            In addition, national and international developments and standards and
                            participants’ requests and public opinion are taken into consideration while
                            defining the objectives concerning the CBRT Payment Systems.
Key consideration 2         An FMI should have documented governance arrangements that
                            provide clear and direct lines of responsibility and accountability.
                            These arrangements should be disclosed to owners, relevant
                            authorities, participants, and, at a more general level, the public.
Description                 Governance arrangements

                            The CBRT’s governance structure and role and responsibilities of the bodies are
                            determined by the CBRT Law. The law and other regulations related with
                            governance are publicly disclosed on the CBRT web site 20.

                            The CBRT Law defines the CBRT Board as the highest decision making body.
                            The CBRT Board accordingly (art 22 (e)) has the authority to make the strategic
                            decisions for payment systems, to approve the relevant directives, to define the
                            roles of the departments and to approve the budgets needed for investment and
                            operation.
                            The CBRT law, article 30, establishes the role of the Executive Committee in the
                            general governance of the central bank, accordingly the CBRT Executive
                            Committee has an important role on the governance of the EFT system. Issues to
                            be raised for decision to the CBRT Board are first evaluated by the Executive
                            Committee. Notably, the amendments to the PSOR are approved by the Executive
                            Committee.
                            The PSD of the CBRT is responsible for establishing the CBRT Payment and
                            Securities Settlement Systems, to operate them effectively and efficiently, to
                            enhance them according to the predefined policies and to oversee them. These
                            duties and responsibilities are explicitly mentioned in the Regulation on
                            Organization and Duties of the CBRT.
                            The PSD is headed by an executive Director. The Operation and oversight
                            functions of the CBRT Payment Systems are assigned to units in two separate

                       divisions, each of the divisions is reporting to different Deputy Executive
                       Directors.
                       In January 1991, with the approval of the Governor, the Committee on Legal,
                       Administrative and Operational Issues of the CBRT Payment Systems (HITI
                       Committee) was founded for the studies that the CBRT carries out in the field of
                       payment systems. In December 2013, with the decision of the Executive
                       Committee, the HITI Committee was restructured, in which the EDs of Banking
                       and Financial Institutions Department, Legal Department, Information
                       Technology Department, Audit Department, Issue Department, Accounting
                       Department, Markets Department, Payment Systems Department convene under
                       the chairmanship of a vice governor (responsible for PSD) so that related
                       departments views and perspectives are taken in to account for strategic decisions.
                       All departments account for their duties to the Executive Committee and the
                       CBRT Board. The General Assembly reviews the annual reports presented by the
                       CBRT Board and the Auditing Committee, and approves the financial reports.

                       The PSD prepares a Payment Systems Monthly Report and this is presented to the
                       members of the CBRT Board, the Auditing Committee and the Executive
                       Committee. In addition to that, a quarterly review of the systems is presented to
                       the Executive Committee. These reports have detailed information on the
                       functioning of the system, data on volume and value of payments, network
                       analysis based on the transaction patterns, any exceptions like system downtime
                       and any new developments.
                       Moreover, in order to review and evaluate the CBRT Payment and Securities
                       Settlement Systems in the light of enhancements both in payment systems and in
                       technology and to bring forward proposals for improvement, the CBRT Payment
                       Systems are annually evaluated against a specific theme. The outcome of this
                       study, including findings and suggestions for improvements, is presented to the
                       CBRT senior management in the Periodic Evaluation Report of the CBRT
                       Payment and Securities Settlement Systems. The last two annual reports covered
                       business continuity planning and liquidity. These reports provide a very detailed
                       analysis of the specific theme, study the international experience and best
                       practices, and identify areas for improvement.
                       Various channels and platforms have been established to support the information
                       exchange and cooperation between the CBRT and participants. The User Group
                       Meetings, are held at least once a year, for a period of 1-2 days. During these
                       meetings, the opinions of the participants on system operations and possible
                       enhancements are taken, and information on projects and studies are shared. The
                       working groups within the Banks Association of Turkey (BAT) also play an
                       important role. In addition to a permanent working group within the BAT for the
                       CBRT Payment and Securities Settlement Systems, specific working groups are
                       formed on project basis. These working groups support the cooperation between
                       the participants and the CBRT.

                            The Regulation on Organization and Duties of the CBRT clearly defines the duties
                            and powers of the CBRT departments including their roles related with the CBRT
                            Payment Systems. A detailed summary of duties of the governor and the

                            In addition, the PSOR, which defines the roles, authorities and responsibilities
                            related with the CBRT Payment Systems as well as rights and duties of the parties
                            of the system, is available to all system participants.
Key consideration 3         The roles and responsibilities of an FMI’s board of directors (or
                            equivalent) should be clearly specified, and there should be
                            documented procedures for its functioning, including procedures to
                            identify, address, and manage member conflicts of interest. The board
                            should review both its overall performance and the performance of its
                            individual board members regularly.
Description                 Roles and responsibilities of the board

                            The powers and duties of the CBRT Board are defined in Article 22 of the CBRT
                            Law. Apart from its other powers and duties, the CBRT Board is also empowered
                            to take decisions related to the payment and securities settlement systems operated
                            by the CBRT and also the NPS.
                            The composition of the CBRT Board, its working methods and the required
                            qualifications for its members are defined by Articles 19, 20 and 21 of the CBRT
                            Law. The decision mechanism in the case of a dispute is defined by Articles 22
                            and 26 of the law.
                            There exist various committees like the Data Security Committee and the Business
                            Continuity Committee that have been established based on the approved
                            arrangements of the CBRT Board, however the CBRT Board Members do not
                            participate in them.
                            As noted earlier, the HITI Committee, ensures coordination among CBRT
                            departments on aspects related to payment systems.

                            Review of performance

                            The CBRT is established as a joint stock company and is subject to the provisions
                            of private law in cases where the CBRT Law is not explicit. Therefore, as a joint
                            stock company, the provisions of the Turkish Commercial Code (Law No.6102)
                            shall also apply to CBRT. The Article 15 of the CBRT Law empowers the General
                            Assembly to review and evaluate the performance of the CBRT Board and the
                            provisions of the Turkish Commercial Code define the procedures for the review
                            and evaluation of the performance of the CBRT Board.

                            Business Continuity Committees and Information Security Committee report
                            annually to the Executive Committee and the Board of the CBRT. The HITI
                            Committee, on the other hand, is not a performing body, but rather a collaborative
                            forum.

Key consideration 4   The board should contain suitable members with the appropriate skills
                      and incentives to fulfill its multiple roles. This typically requires the
                      inclusion of non-executive board member(s).
Description           The EFT system (as part of the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems)
                      is owned and operated by the CBRT, the qualifications for the CBRT Board
                      Members are determined considering all the duties and responsibilities of the
                      CBRT.
                      The CBRT Board Members are chosen by the General Assembly of the CBRT.
                      The article 19 of the CBRT Law requires the CBRT Board Members to have a
                      university degree and to have knowledge and experience in banking, economics
                      and finance. The Governor, who also chairs the CBRT Board, should also have
                      the same qualifications according to article 25.
                      The CBRT Board Members other than the Governor do not have a direct role on
                      the daily management of the CBRT. In this respect, those members are non-
                      executive board members.
Key consideration 5   The roles and responsibilities of management should be clearly
                      specified. An FMI’s management should have the appropriate
                      experience, a mix of skills, and the integrity necessary to discharge
                      their responsibilities for the operation and risk management of the
                      FMI.
Description           Roles and responsibilities of management

                      The PSD of the CBRT is responsible for the operations and management of the
                      EFT, under the supervision of the Executive Committee.
                      The Executive Committee is composed of the Governor and four Vice Governors
                      and is chaired by the Governor. Vice governors are appointed by a joint decree for
                      a period of five years on the recommendation of the Governor. Vice governors
                      may be reappointed upon the expiration of this term. The duties of the Executive
                      Committee are defined by the Article 30 of the CBRT Law, and include, inter alia,
                      ensuring coordination in the operations of the CBRT.
                      The PSD is responsible for the daily operation of the CBRT Payment Systems.
                      Oversight of the systems is carried out by a division of the PSD that is not
                      responsible for the operations. Hence, operation and oversight responsibilities are
                      segregated at the Deputy Executive Director level.
                      The Regulation on the Organization and Duties of the CBRT clearly defines the
                      roles, powers and responsibilities of CBRT departments and their executive
                      directors. Accordingly, each executive director has duties and responsibilities to
                      plan, to determine procedures, to organise the work, to coordinate the subsidiary
                      divisions, to train and educate the staff and in general ensure that the activities are
                      accomplished in a manner that is accurate, complete, on-time and in compliance
                      with all internal rules and procedures and applicable laws and regulations.
                      The CBRT departments prepare their annual performance programs, which
                      include work plans, performance objectives and performance indicators, within
                      the framework of their duties and responsibilities, in order to achieve the
                      objectives that take place in the CBRT’s Strategic Plan. The annual performance
                      programs are subject to the approval of the CBRT Board before implementation.
                      The performance of the departments is annually presented to the CBRT Board
                      through performance reports. Objectives and performance indicators for the
                      CBRT Payment Systems are included in the performance program of the CBRT
                      Payment Systems Department and these are monitored by the CBRT Board.

                      The objectives of the PSD for 2016 are inter alia:

                       • To maintain the business continuity via the CBRT Payment Systems in
                         case operations are interrupted.
                       • To manage the risks on the CBRT Payment Systems by using Risk
                         Management Framework.
                       • To organize training for branch employees related to the CBRT
                         Payment Systems and give support to other trainings and workshops.
                       • To carry out researches and business development studies for the CBRT
                         Payment Systems
                       • To work towards the inclusion of Turkish lira in CLS Bank(and
                         accordingly the connection of the EFT to CLS Bank)

                      The performance indicators of the PSD for 2016 are inter alia:

                       • Number of tests on emergency cases
                       • Number of tests on business continuity
                       • Annual average of the CBRT Payment Systems closing time
                       • Number of the days on which the CBRT Payment Systems’ closing time
                         was delayed
                       • The ratio of annual transaction value of the CBRT Payment Systems to
                         GDP
                       • Number of research papers produced

                      Experience, skills and integrity

                      The qualifications required for the Governor and the vice governors are defined
                      by the Articles 25 and 29 of the CBRT Law.
                      Executive directors of departments and directors of divisions reporting to them are
                      appointed by the CBRT Board. Executive directors, deputy executive directors
                      and directors are required to have at least a university degree.
                      The experience required for the executive director and other positions is defined
                      in the CBRT’s Regulation on Promotion and Title Change.
                      Governors and vice governors may be excused from duty through the same
                      procedure applied for his/her appointment, only when the prohibitions stated in
                      Article 27 of the Central Bank Law are violated and there is no longer any
                      possibility for him/her to perform the duties entrusted by this Law.
                      Executive directors and directors may be excused from duty by the CBRT Board.

Key consideration 6   The board should establish a clear, documented risk-management
                      framework) that includes the FMI’s risk-tolerance policy, assigns
                      responsibilities and accountability for risk decisions, and addresses
                      decision making in crises and emergencies. Governance arrangements
                      should ensure that the risk-management and internal control functions
                      have sufficient authority, independence, resources, and access to the
                      board.
Description           Risk management framework




                                                    43
                      There is no institutional risk management framework at the overall CBRT level.
                      However, the PSD has developed a risk management framework in 2014 with the
                      approval of the CBRT Executive Committee, and this is being applied for the
                      functioning of the EFT system.
                      The risk management framework has also been placed to the Board as part of the
                      annual performance program and reporting process.

                      Risk Management Framework of the CBRT Payment Systems consists of an
                      application process as well as a risk management policy document that defines
                      principles, aim, scope, roles and responsibilities regarding risk management. In
                      line with this policy, the implementation results are presented to the CBRT
                      Executive Committee annually. The implementation results are also presented to
                      the Board through annual performance program and reporting process.
                      This risk management framework is elaborated in the section on Principle 3.

                      Authority and independence of risk management and audit functions

                      In line with the CBRT Audit Regulation, the Audit Department performs audit
                      activities, in order to determine and evaluate the risks that may occur during the
                      processes run by the CBRT, and to suggest risk management measures. After
                      getting the views of the audited departments, the Audit Reports are presented to
                      the Governor.
                      The audits are carried out annually for a set of departments and functions.
                      As part of this the CBRT Payment Systems Risk Management Framework and its
                      application are also subject to audit. However there has been no audit till date of
                      the PSD and its risk management framework, as it was developed only in 2014.
Key consideration 7   The board should ensure that the FMI’s design, rules, overall strategy,
                      and major decisions reflect appropriately the legitimate interests of its
                      direct and indirect participants and other relevant stakeholders.
                      Major decisions should be clearly disclosed to relevant stakeholders
                      and, where there is a broad market impact, the public.
Description            Identification and consideration of stakeholder interests
                      There are several channels and platforms where system participants discuss
                      technical and operational issues among themselves, or when necessary with the
                      CBRT, and bring technical and operational issues to the attention of the CBRT.
                      The CBRT Payment Systems Working Group within the BAT play an important
                      role related to seeking the opinions of the participants. This group is permanent
                      and it allows participants to discuss, evaluate and agree upon various issues among
                      themselves. In addition to this group, specific working groups are formed within
                      the BAT about the CBRT Payment Systems on project basis.
                      When needed, the CBRT may participate in the BAT working groups. The results
                      and proposals of the working groups are evaluated within the CBRT governance
                      framework, and those that have been approved are put into practice.
                      In addition, during User Group Meetings, which are held at least once a year, plans
                      related with the systems are revised, current practices and changing business
                      requirements are discussed and participant views and needs are collected.

                      Disclosure
                      The CBRT discloses the principle decisions about the payment systems to the
                      participants via following channels:

                                    •    Presentations and explanations at User Group Meetings
                                    •  Announcements to the public are also made through Remarks by the
                                       Governor and press releases.
                               In addition there is a the private chatroom for the EFT system, which is used at
                               times for addressing any specific clarifications from participants related to day-to-
                               day operations.
Key conclusions                This principle is assessed taking into account the considerations for FMIs operated
                               by central banks as stated both in the PFMIs and in Application of the Principles
                               for financial market infrastructures to central bank FMIs. 23
                               The objectives and policies of the CBRT regarding Payment and Securities
                               Settlement Systems place a high priority on stability, safety and efficiency. The
                               CBRT has documented governance arrangements for the institution as a whole
                               that define clear and direct lines of responsibility and accountability. The same
                               governance framework has been applied for the EFT system as well, as a core
                               responsibility of the PSD.

                               There is a risk management framework for the CBRT operated payment systems.
                               There is an existing process of periodic auditing of departmental risk management
                               framework, however the PSD’s risk management framework has not been audited
                               yet. The plans for the first audit of the PSD’s risk management framework are
                               being drawn up and is expected to be completed in the coming months.

                               Mechanisms exist for involving stakeholders in decision-making process, and the
                               CBRT effectively communicates with the stakeholders through different channels.
Assessment of                  Observed
Principle 2
Recommendations                The CBRT could consider including specific indicators related to efficiency
and comments                   and effectiveness of the EFT system and satisfaction levels of the
                               participants, as use these to measure the performance of the EFT system.
                               These indicators could include:
                                   • Average wait time in queue;
                                   • Percentage of transactions processed in the last 2 hours and the first
                                       2 hours;
                                   • Number of instances of extension of operating hours;
                                   • Turnover ratios; and
                                   • Satisfaction levels of participants.

Principle 3: Framework for the comprehensive management of risks
An FMI should have a sound risk-management framework for comprehensively managing legal,
credit, liquidity, operational, and other risks.
Key consideration 1 An FMI should have risk-management policies, procedures, and
                          systems that enable it to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the
                          range of risks that arise in or are borne by the FMI. Risk-management
                          frameworks should be subject to periodic review.
Description               Risks that arise in or are borne by the FMI

                        The EFT system functions as a RTGS system. The liquidity support for the EFT
                        system is external to the EFT system and seen by the CBRT as part of the monetary
                        policy instruments of the CBRT. For the purposes of this assessment, the risks
                        associated with the intra-day liquidity support provision of the CBRT are also
                        being considered.

                        The risks that the EFT system is exposed to and could pose to its participants and
                        other FMIs are:
                                •        Legal Risk
                                •        Credit Risk
                                •        Liquidity Risk
                                •        Operational Risk
                                •        Custody Risk

                        The EFT system as the core large value payments system in Turkey is critical to
                        contain and limit systemic risk. As the EFT system is operated by the CBRT, the
                        general business risks are not considered as a material risk.

                        Risk management policies, procedures and systems

                        The CBRT PSD has developed a risk management framework based on the ISO
                        31000 standard. The risk management framework was adopted in adopted October
                        2014.

                        The Framework comprises of an application process as well as a risk management
                        policy document. The policy defines principles, aim, scope, roles and
                        responsibilities regarding risk management. The application process, defines the
                        risk management process and activities, including inputs, outputs, triggers and
                        actions. The Risk Management Framework also includes “Risk Criteria” that
                        define impact and probability rates and acceptable risk level.

                        The Risk Management Framework is executed by the PSD. There are three roles
                        in the framework, namely (i) Departmental Risk Management Group (DRMG),
                        (ii) Risk Working Group (RWG) and (iii) Department Staff Assigned to Risk
                        Management Application.




                                                  46
The DRMG is comprised of the ED of the PSD, DEDs of the PSD responsible for
the operations division and Directors of the Research and Business Development
and Operations. The DRMG is responsible for providing the vision and objectives
and make necessary assignments and supervises the conformance to the risk
management framework. The RWG is responsible for the annual review of the
framework, to keep the framework updated, and guiding and coordinating the
application. Staffs are assigned from the operations division for applying the risk
management framework. Other CBRT departments, system participants and
service providers are also involved in the risk management process when needed.

In order to eliminate legal risks, the CBRT regulations related to the CBRT
Payment and Securities Settlement Systems are issued after internal review by the
legal department to ensure that it has a sound legal basis.

The EFT system works in the RTGS mode and hence there is no credit risk
between participants. However as an operator the CBRT is exposed to the default
of a participant in repaying the intra-day credit. This risk is contained by requiring
the credit be fully collateralized with good quality collaterals with appropriate
valuation and haircut practices.

In order to manage the liquidity risk, several functionalities are provided in the
EFT such as queue management and full access to the account balances.
Multilateral offsetting is also used in the EFT, with the offsetting algorithm
running every minute, with an additional option to manually trigger offsetting if
needed.
Additionally, the liquidity in the EFT system and in the market is monitored. The
CBRT may provide intraday and overnight credit against collateral in order to
prevent temporary liquidity shortfalls in situations that may affect the efficiency
of the financial markets and also as part of its LOLR operations.

The participants can instantly monitor their balances and queued payments using
the online-inquiry services. The settlement statuses and the closing times of the
systems and any changes in operational aspects of participants are notified to all
participants automatically by the System.

The CBRT has formed a Business Continuity Committee to carry out the activities
for ensuring the continuity of key processes of the CBRT in any circumstance and
for developing, testing and regularly reviewing the Business Continuity Plan
(BCP) of the CBRT. The CBRT Payment Systems Business Continuity
Application Plan has been developed as a part of the CBRT BCP. This also covers
the EFT system. Within the CBRT Payment Systems Business Continuity
Application Plan, operational risks for critical business processes have been
addressed by the CBRT Payment Systems Risk Management Framework, the
controls have been defined with respect to identified risks and the operational and
technical procedures and documents have been prepared for recovery and
resumption in case of adverse scenarios.

The collateral collected by the CBRT for liquidity support operations are held in
its name in the ESTS for Turkish government securities and in ICSDs for specific
securities - Turkish Government Eurobonds or IILM issuances. The CBRT does
not reuse or on-lend these collaterals.

                     Review of risk management policies, procedures and systems

                     Efficiency and effectiveness of the risk management framework are reviewed
                     periodically and results are reported. Additionally, events that may cause deviation
                     from standards and goals are monitored by the RWG.
                     The risk management framework is required to be reviewed every year in
                     February. The first review of the risk management framework was conducted in
                     February 2016. In this process international standards and best practices, feedback
                     from stakeholders, requests received from participants as part of daily operations,
                     information requests, user satisfaction surveys and results of research studies are
                     taken into consideration.
                     The policies, procedures and systems used to identify and manage risks regarding
                     the CBRT Payment Systems are also the subject to PSD’s oversight activities.
                     Moreover, like all other activities of the CBRT, they are subject to audit by the
                     CBRT Audit Department.
Key consideration 2 An FMI should provide incentives to participants and, where relevant,
                    their customers to manage and contain the risks they pose to the FMI.

Description          The PSOR article 13(4) authorises the CBRT to impose sanctions on participants
                     that fail to fulfil their obligations. Further the PSOR, section V, as part of the
                     participant’s responsibilities outlines in detail the participants obligation to secure
                     its systems, use appropriate internal arrangements, conform to the PSOR and have
                     an effective business continuity plan.

                     In order to eliminate risk arising from delayed payments, the CBRT is very strict
                     with respect to the systems’ official closing times and if the working hours are
                     extended, payments after the official closing time are charged 10 times the regular
                     price. In 2015, there were a total of 9 extensions for a total period of 245 minutes.
                     During these extensions, there were a total of 2,408 transactions amounting to
                     around TRY 560 million, covering both the RPS and EFT system. Five of these
                     extensions were made by the CBRT for money market operations, the remaining
                     4 were at the request of participants. The approval authority for extension requests
                     varies based on the duration – for 15 minutes it is the operations director, beyond
                     that and up to 1 hour it is the PSD ED and beyond that it is the Deputy Governor.

                     Participants are required to inform the CBRT about problems in their systems that
                     can affect the CBRT Payment and Securities Settlement Systems (including the
                     EFT) as promptly as possible. Real time information sharing utilities provides
                     participants with necessary and simultaneous information in order to help them
                     identify and manage their risks.

                     In addition, the CBRT discusses problems concerning the operations of the system
                     with participants, shares plans on technical and operational updates, and takes
                     opinions and change requests of the participants in User Group Meetings and
                     working group meetings.

                     Regarding the liquidity support, an unpaid intraday liquidity support is rolled over
                     as an overnight credit which attracts interest. In addition, there is an overall
                     borrowing limit for liquidity support facilities except the LOLR, hence limiting
                     the borrowers’ access to other CBRT liquidity facilities.




                                                 48
                      Real time information sharing utilities provides participants with necessary and
                      simultaneous information in order to help them identify and manage their risks.
                      All notifications for participants are sent automatically as part of the service
                      management utilities in the EFT system. In this context, system statistics and
                      details on payments are also reported to participants at the end of the day.
                      In case of problems, the CBRT and participants actively use predefined chat-
                      rooms and e-mail groups to communicate with each other.
Key consideration 3 An FMI should regularly review the material risks it bears from and
                    poses to other entities (such as other FMIs, settlement banks, liquidity
                    providers, and service providers) as a result of interdependencies and
                    develop appropriate risk-management tools to address these risks.
Description         Material risks

                      The CBRT PSD risk management framework has used the PFMIs to identify
                      material risks and includes the following risks:
                              •        Credit Risk
                              •        Liquidity Risk
                              •        Operational Risk
                              •        Legal Risk
                              •        Systemic Risk
                              •        General Business Risk
                              •        Custody and Investment Risk

                      The CBRT PSD considers the operational risk to be the most material risk for the
                      EFT.

                      The risk management framework and the annual review is outlined in the KC 1 of
                      this principle is used to monitor and mitigate the risks.

                      The indicators for system up time and the performance of the IT systems are
                      collected and reported on a daily, monthly, quarterly and annual basis to the
                      Executive Committee and the annual report is also placed to the board as part of
                      the annual performance review of the PSD. The system up-time is also included
                      explicitly as a performance indicator for the PSD.

                      The “Sink-Rank” methodology is used for assessing the concentration and
                      network analysis of the transaction patterns. This in particular provides a view on
                      the liquidity risk for participants. This analysis and the analysis of effectiveness
                      of the offsetting algorithms is included in the monthly, quarterly and annual
                      reports.

                      Risk management tools

                      The CBRT PSD as part of the CBRT business continuity plan, has a very well-
                      defined business continuity and operational risk management plan. This is the
                      main tool used for the management of operational risk of the EFT system.

                      The PSD has also instituted a survey of its participant’s BCP processes, as part of
                      its annual thematic review report in 2014. Based on the findings of this review the
                      PSD is now preparing complex scenarios of use in its BCP testing.

                    concern and assess the effectiveness of a full range of options for
                    recovery or orderly wind-down. An FMI should prepare appropriate
                    plans for its recovery or orderly wind-down based on the results of that
                    assessment. Where applicable, an FMI should also provide relevant
                    authorities with the information needed for purposes of resolution
                    planning.
Description         Scenarios that may prevent an FMI from providing critical operations and
                    services

                      The PSD uses the risk management framework outlined in the KC 1 of this
                      principles. It identified operational risk as the most material risk. Specific
                      scenarios that may prevent it from providing critical operations and services are
                      identified as part of the BCP process.

                      various system components by taking into consideration the predefined business
                      priorities.
                      Please see Principle 17 (Operational Risk) for detailed discussion on this.

                      Recovery or orderly wind-down plans

                      The EFT is operated by the CBRT, given this the recovery and wind-down plans
                      are not applicable, as noted in the PFMIs and the CPMI-IOSCO publication on
                      application of PFMIs to central bank operated FMIs.
Key conclusions       The PSD has developed a risk management framework based on the ISO 31000
                      framework. The risk management framework covers the specific risks outlined in
                      the PFMIs. The framework is reviewed annually and is also subject to audit by the
                      CBRT audit committee.

                      The PSOR provides adequate powers to the CBRT to ensure conformance to the
                      operating and security procedures outlined in the PSOR.

                      The PSD has mechanisms in place for measuring and monitoring specific aspects
                      of liquidity risk and operational reliability of the EFT system.

                      The risk management framework is however internally focused and does not
                      explicitly take into account the dependencies on other FMIs and also internal
                      systems of the CBRT. In particular, the operations of the EFT system has a heavy
                      dependence on the Takasbank and the CBRT markets department, given their role
                      in providing liquidity to participants. Takasbank is the SSS for the inter-bank
                      markets which is a major source of the liquidity used in the EFT system. The
                      Markets Department is the decision maker on the provision of the CBRT liquidity
                      support facilities and also has its own systems and processes.

                      This risk however is to an extent mitigated as the Takasbank and other FMIs are
                      subject to the oversight of the CBRT and the Markets department also has its own
                      risk management framework and there is co-ordination at the HITI committee.

Principle 4. Credit risk
An FMI should effectively measure, monitor, and manage its credit exposure to participants
and those arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes. An FMI should maintain
sufficient financial resources to cover its credit exposure to each participant fully with a high
degree of confidence. In addition, a CCP that is involved in activities with a more-complex risk
profile or that is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions should maintain additional
financial resources sufficient to cover a wide range of potential stress scenarios that should
include, but not be limited to, the default of the two largest participants and their affiliates that
would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposures to the CCP in extreme but
plausible market conditions. All other CCPs should maintain, at a minimum, total financial
resources sufficient to cover the default of the one participant and its affiliates that would
potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposures to the CCP in extreme but plausible
market conditions.

                           An FMI should establish a robust framework to manage its credit
                           exposures to its participants and the credit risks arising from its
                           payment, clearing, and settlement processes. Credit exposure
                           may arise from current exposures, potential future exposures, or
                           both.
Description                The EFT system functions as a RTGS system. There is no liquidity support
                           mechanisms within the EFT system. Participants can seek liquidity support
                           from the CBRT, subject to an overall “borrowing limit” against collaterals
                           and from the inter-bank money markets. The liquidity support offered by
                           the CBRT is structured as monetary policy instruments and is managed by
                           the Markets department of the CBRT.

                           The markets department’s risk management framework for managing the
                           credit risk includes establishing an overall borrowing limit based on the
                           asset size of the participant; requiring good quality collateral; and, applying
                           haircuts. There is no set frequency for these reviews. The last review was
                           carried out in September 2015.

                           Credit risk is also acknowledged in the PSD’s risk management framework.

                           In addition, securities transactions (both primary and secondary market)
                           which settle in the EFT system are performed with the DvP settlement
                           mechanism to eliminate principal risk.
                           On the other side, in accordance with the Article 40.I (a) of the CBRT Law,
                           the CBRT may provide intraday and overnight liquidity against collateral
                           in order to prevent temporary liquidity shortfalls and technical payment
                           problems that may affect the efficiency of the financial markets.
                           In this context, the CBRT performs following Money Market Operations:
                                • Intra-day liquidity support

                          • Repo Auctions
                          • Overnight credit
                          • Lender of Last Resort
                      There is a separate collateral account in the ESTS for each of these
                      facilities. There is a project underway to have one common pool of
                      collaterals.
                      The intra-day liquidity support facility is not charged, but there is a
                      commission of TRY 10 per million. The rest of the facilities are interest
                      bearing.
                      There is a consolidated borrowing limit for these and these are fully
                      collateralized. The accepted collaterals are:
                          - TRY denominated government securities, CBRT bills,
                                Government Sukuks Lease certificates issued by the ALCTT;
                          - Foreign currency deposits and foreign exchange banknotes
                                deposits; and
                          - Foreign currency denominated Turkish government securities –
                                Eurobonds and Sukuks (Lease certificates issued by the ALCTT).
                          - Foreign Government securities

                      The participants can move collateral in and out, only with the approval of
                      the CBRT Markets Department.
                      Haircuts are applied to all the collateral and the haircut varies by securities
                      and maturity of the security.
Key consideration 2   An FMI should identify sources of credit risk, routinely measure
                      and monitor credit exposures, and use appropriate risk-
                      management tools to control these risks.

                      Credit risk management framework is implemented by the CBRT markets
                      department. The framework has identified the following sources of credit
                      risk:
                          - Failure to repay credit facility availed
                          - Drop in value of securities if the collateral needs to be enforced.

                      The risk management tools include:
                         - Credit facilities are fully collateralized
                         - Accepting only good quality collateral with limited volatility
                         - Establishing an overall borrowing limit
                         - Mechanisms to address concentration risk
                         - Applying haircuts
                         - Retaining ability to call for additional collateral if there is a major
                              change in the value of the securities placed as collaterals.

                      collaterals held are validated on a daily basis.

Key consideration 3
                       The following key consideration         PS CSD SSS CCP TR
                       applies to                              ●      ●


                      A payment system or SSS should cover its current and, where
                      they exist, potential future exposures to each participant fully
                      with a high degree of confidence using collateral and other
                      equivalent financial resources (see Principle 5 on collateral). In
                      the case of a DNS payment system or DNS SSS in which there is
                      no settlement guarantee but where its participants face credit
                      exposures arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement
                      processes, such an FMI should maintain, at a minimum,
                      sufficient resources to cover the exposures of the two participants
                      and their affiliates that would create the largest aggregate credit
                      exposure in the system.
Description           Coverage of exposures to each participant

                      Since the EFT system functions as a RTGS system and uses DvP principle,
                      the participants do not face any credit exposure.
                      In addition, the CBRT Payment Systems are subject to the Article 10 of the
                      Payment Systems Law. Since settlement finality is guaranteed by the law,
                      there is no credit risk for participants that may arise from legal issues.

                      For DNS payment systems and DNS SSSs in which there is no
                      settlement guarantee

                      The EFT system functions as a RTGS system, this issue is not applicable.

                      A CCP should cover its current and potential future exposures
                      to each participant fully with a high degree of confidence using
                      margin and other prefunded financial resources (see Principle 5
                      on collateral and Principle 6 on margin). In addition, a CCP that
                      is involved in activities with a more-complex risk profile or that
                      is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions should
                      maintain additional financial resources to cover a wide range of
                      potential stress scenarios that should include, but not be limited
                      to, the default of the two participants and their affiliates that
                      would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for
                      the CCP in extreme but plausible market conditions. All other
                      CCPs should maintain additional financial resources sufficient to
                      cover a wide range of potential stress scenarios that should

                      credit exposure for the CCP in extreme but plausible market
                      conditions. In all cases, a CCP should document its supporting
                      rationale for, and should have appropriate governance
                      arrangements relating to, the amount of total financial resources
                      it maintains.

                       The following key consideration       PS CSD SSS CCP TR

                      A CCP should determine the amount and regularly test the
                      sufficiency of its total financial resources available in the event of
                      a default or multiple defaults in extreme but plausible market
                      conditions through rigorous stress testing. A CCP should have
                      clear procedures to report the results of its stress tests to
                      appropriate decision makers at the CCP and to use these results
                      to evaluate the adequacy of and adjust its total financial
                      resources. Stress tests should be performed daily using standard
                      and predetermined parameters and assumptions. On at least a
                      monthly basis, a CCP should perform a comprehensive and
                      thorough analysis of stress testing scenarios, models, and
                      underlying parameters and assumptions used to ensure they are
                      appropriate for determining the CCP’s required level of default
                      protection in light of current and evolving market conditions. A
                      CCP should perform this analysis of stress testing more
                      frequently when the products cleared or markets served display
                      high volatility, become less liquid, or when the size or
                      concentration of positions held by a CCP’s participants increases
                      significantly. A full validation of a CCP’s risk-management
                      model should be performed at least annually.

                      In conducting stress testing, a CCP should consider the effect of
                      a wide range of relevant stress scenarios in terms of both
                      defaulters’ positions and possible price changes in liquidation
                      periods. Scenarios should include relevant peak historic price
                      volatilities, shifts in other market factors such as price
                      determinants and yield curves, multiple defaults over various
                      time horizons, simultaneous pressures in funding and asset
                      markets, and a spectrum of forward-looking stress scenarios in a
                      variety of extreme but plausible market conditions.

                      An FMI should establish explicit rules and procedures that
                      address fully any credit losses it may face as a result of any
                      individual or combined default among its participants with
                      respect to any of their obligations to the FMI. These rules and
                      procedures should address how potentially uncovered credit
                      losses would be allocated, including the repayment of any funds
                      an FMI may borrow from liquidity providers. These rules and
                      procedures should also indicate the FMI’s process to replenish
                      any financial resources that the FMI may employ during a stress
                      event, so that the FMI can continue to operate in a safe and sound
                      manner.
Description           Allocation of credit losses

                      As noted in the KC 4.1, 4.2 and 4.2 the credit extended to the participants
                      by the CBRT is fully collateralized. In the event of any participant default
                      the collateral rights could be enforced. As the EFT system is structured as
                      a RTGS system, there is no credit risk between participants.
                      Any loss that may stem from credit given to a participant is not shared with
                      other participants. Any loss is covered by high quality collateral and failing
                      bank’s other possessions held with the CBRT.
                      Rules and procedures to be applied in the case of a default of a participant
                      are described in the discussion on Principle 13.

                          No liquidity provider is needed since the transactions are all in TRY and
                          the operator of the EFT system is the CBRT.

                          Replenishment of financial resources

                          As the central bank of issue, the CBRT always has access to necessary
                          liquidity in TRY.

Key conclusions           The EFT system functions as a RTGS system it does not create credit
                          exposures arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes.The
                          credit risk related to the operation of the EFT stems from the CBRT
                          liquidity support operations to the participants. The liquidity support
                          operations are not integrated into the EFT system and as such are handled
                          by the markets department. The credit risk is considered as part of the EFT
                          risk management framework, but the full treatment of the credit risk from
                          liquidity support operations is in the domain of the markets department.

                          The markets department’s credit risk management framework includes
                          instituting overall borrowing limits, requiring all credit facilities to be
                          collateralized with good quality securities, and applying conservative
                          haircuts. The collaterals are re-valued daily and the CBRT has the rights to
                          ask for additional collateral when there is an adverse movement.

Principle 5. Collateral
An FMI that requires collateral to manage its or its participants’ credit exposure should accept
collateral with low credit, liquidity, and market risks. An FMI should also set and enforce
appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits.
Key consideration 1          An FMI should generally limit the assets it (routinely) accepts as
                             collateral to those with low credit, liquidity, and market risks.
Description
                          The rules pertaining to the assets that can be used as collateral are
                          determined and related activities are carried out by the Markets Department
                          of the CBRT. These assets currently are limited to:
                               • Foreign currency deposits held by participants with the CBRT
                               • Foreign currency physical notes deposited with the CBRT
                               • Foreign government issued treasury bills and bonds only after the
                                   CBRT evaluates the maturity structure and characteristics,
                                   deposited in CBRTs accounts in ICSDs.
                               • Central bank liquidity bills, deposited in the ESTS collateral
                                   accounts.

                               accounts.
                           •   Turkish Treasury issued Eurobonds and sukuks, deposited in
                               CBRT’s account in ICSDs.
Key consideration 2   An FMI should establish prudent valuation practices and develop
                      haircuts that are regularly tested and take into account stressed
                      market conditions.
Description           Valuation practices

                      The rules for the valuation of assets that are eligible as collateral and the
                      haircut rates are determined and applied by the CBRT Markets Department.
                      Valuation process is repeated on a daily basis and current values are
                      published.

                      Haircutting practices

                      Haircut is determined for each securities type. Haircut rates are determined
                      according to the type and remaining term to maturity of the securities.
                      Remaining terms shorter than one year are assessed as low risk and lower
                      haircut rates are applied, while higher haircut rates are applied for longer
                      remaining terms.

Key consideration 3   In order to reduce the need for pro-cyclical adjustments, an
                      FMI should establish stable and conservative haircuts that are
                      calibrated to include periods of stressed market conditions, to
                      the extent practicable and prudent.
Description
                      The earmarked collateral in CBRT standing facility operations is revalued
                      on daily basis to ensure sufficient coverage. While applying haircut, CBRT
                      lends an amount less than the market value of the collateral. The haircuts
                      are designed to protect the CBRT against possible further falls in the value
                      of collateral.

                      CBRT applies different hair cuts for different asset classes of securities,
                      reflecting their different risk charasteristics and publishes them. CBRT may
                      also apply haircut add-ons for a specific counterparty depending on its risk
                      exposure.

                      CBRT adopts “granular approach” that takes into consideration various
                      characteristics of assets such as their types, maturities, liquidity conditions,
                      currencies and their performance through the cycle and particularly in
                      stressed market conditions. In this context, the haircut schedule reflects the
                      information gained about the performance of different asset classes over
                      time and particularly in stressed conditions observed during the crises.

                      It is also important to note that the authority to determine the haircut ratios
                      and to apply haircut add-ons spesific to a particular counterparty was
                      delegated to Governor by the Board in order to accelerate the decision
                      process when it is needed.There is no established schedule for review of
                      haircut related policies; the last review was in September 2015.

Key consideration 4   An FMI should avoid concentrated holdings of certain assets
                      where this would significantly impair the ability to liquidate such
                      assets quickly without significant adverse price effects.
Description
                      The rules for the prevention of collateral concentration on certain assets are
                      determined and applied by the CBRT Markets Department.
                      At least 30% of the securities by value held as collateral must be government
                      debt securities.

Key consideration 5   An FMI that accepts cross-border collateral should mitigate the
                      risks associated with its use and ensure that the collateral can be
                      used in a timely manner.
Description
                      The CBRT Markets Department accepts Turkish Government issued
                      securities denominated in foreign currency – Eurobonds and sukuk.
                      The CBRT Markets Department after detailed analysis accepts some foreign
                      government securities.

                      Participants are required to transfer securities of these types to the CBRTs
                      account in the foreign ICSD – currently only Euroclear.

                      This ensures that the CBRT is fully in possession of the collateral and can
                      use them in a timely manner to cover any default.

                      The EFT system supports only transactions in TRY. The CBRT as a central
                      bank of issue, is not constrained in TRY liquidity and hence need not
                      necessarily liquidate the collateral right away.

Key consideration 6   An FMI should use a collateral management system that is well-
                      designed and operationally flexible.
Description           Collateral management system design

                      The CBRT uses a collateral management system focused on the type of the
                      asset and the maturity of the asset. The credit amount that a bank can receive
                      from all of the CBRT’s market operations is limited by an overall borrowing
                      limit that is determined by the size of its assets.

                      The discount rate are determined by asset’s type and maturity date.

                      List of eligible securities can be updated if it is needed.

                      Operational flexibility

                      The participants can move in collateral to the collateral account and move
                      out collateral at any time, subject to CBRT approval. The process is
                      automated however there is a manual approval process. The CBRT markets
                      department is appropriately staffed to allow for a quick turnaround for the
                      approvals during the operating hours of the EFT system.

Key conclusions       The collateral management system and processes are external to the EFT
                      system and are managed by the CBRT markets department. The extension
                      of liquidity support is considered a monetary policy instrument. The choice

                        of securities, haircut rates, valuation practices and operational arrangements
                        are an integral part of the CBRT monetary policy operations.

                        The CBRT maintains a list of eligible securities and their haircut rates. The
                        haircut rates depend on the type and the maturity of the securities. The
                        eligible securities are TRY government bonds, central bank bills, lease
                        certificates issued by ALCTT (Asset leasing company of the Turkish
                        Treasury), foreign bonds and notes, IILM issuances and foreign exchange
                        deposits and foreign exchange banknotes deposits.

                        There is no scheduled calendar for review of haircut rates. The policy for
                        haircut rates takes into account measures to avoid procyclical adjustments.
                        Also, as a central bank of issue, the CBRT has ability to smooth any changes
                        required in haircut rates.

                        The participants can move collateral in and out efficiently but needs an
                        approval of the CBRT. The CBRT has ensured that it is resourced
                        appropriately to accord necessary approval in a timely manner.

Principle 6. Margin
A CCP should cover its exposure to its participants for all products through an effective
margin system that is risk-based and regularly reviewed.
Key consideration 1       A CCP should have a margin system that establishes margin
                          levels commensurate with the risks and particular attributes of
                          each product, portfolio, and market it serves.

Key consideration 2   A CCP should have a reliable source of timely price data for its
                      margin system. A CCP should also have procedures and sound
                      valuation models for addressing circumstances in which pricing
                      data are not readily available or reliable.

                      applicable.

Key consideration 3   A CCP should adopt initial margin models and parameters that
                      are risk-based and generate margin requirements sufficient to
                      cover its potential future exposure to participants in the interval
                      between the last margin collection and the close out of positions
                      following a participant default. Initial margin should meet an
                      established single-tailed confidence level of at least 99 percent
                      with respect to the estimated distribution of future exposure. For
                      a CCP that calculates margin at the portfolio level, this
                      requirement applies to each portfolio’s distribution of future
                      exposure. For a CCP that calculates margin at more-granular
                      levels, such as at the sub-portfolio level or by product, the
                      requirement must be met for the corresponding distributions of
                      future exposure. The model should (a) use a conservative
                      estimate of the time horizons for the effective hedging or close
                      out of the particular types of products cleared by the CCP
                      (including in stressed market conditions), (b) have an
                      appropriate method for measuring credit exposure that accounts
                      for relevant product risk factors and portfolio effects across
                      products, and (c) to the extent practicable and prudent, limit the
                      need for destabilising, procyclical changes.

                      variation margin at least daily to limit the build-up of current
                      exposures. A CCP should have the authority and operational
                      capacity to make intraday margin calls and payments, both
                      scheduled and unscheduled, to participants.

Key consideration 5   In calculating margin requirements, a CCP may allow offsets or
                      reductions in required margin across products that it clears or
                      between products that it and another CCP clear, if the risk of one
                      product is significantly and reliably correlated with the risk of
                      the other product. Where two or more CCPs are authorised to
                      offer cross-margining, they must have appropriate safeguards
                      and harmonised overall risk-management systems.

Key consideration 6   A CCP should analyse and monitor its model performance and
                      overall margin coverage by conducting rigorous daily
                      backtesting – and at least monthly, and more-frequent where
                      appropriate, sensitivity analysis. A CCP should regularly
                      conduct an assessment of the theoretical and empirical
                      properties of its margin model for all products it clears. In
                      conducting sensitivity analysis of the model’s coverage, a CCP
                      should take into account a wide range of parameters and
                      assumptions that reflect possible market conditions, including
                      the most-volatile periods that have been experienced by the
                      markets it serves and extreme changes in the correlations

Principle 7: Liquidity risk
An FMI should effectively measure, monitor, and manage its liquidity risk. An FMI should
maintain sufficient liquid resources in all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where
appropriate, intraday and multiday settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of
confidence under a wide range of potential stress scenarios that should include, but not be limited
to, the default of the participant and its affiliates that would generate the largest aggregate
liquidity obligation for the FMI in extreme but plausible market conditions.

                         custodian banks, liquidity providers, and other entities.
Description
                         The CBRT as the operator of the EFT system itself is not exposed to any
                         liquidity risk as the EFT is structured as a RTGS system and there are no
                         overdrafts allowed. The CBRT liquidity support to the participants is in TRY
                         and the central bank of issue, it is not constrained in access to TRY liquidity.

                         The EFT participants have full access to their queue and can set priority for
                         transfer orders and change them as needed for queued transactions.

                         There is a multilateral offsetting in the EFT system every minute.

                         The participants are able to use the reserves held with the CBRT for meeting
                         liquidity needs in the EFT system. The reserve maintenance period is 14 days.
                         There are no specific minimum balances required at the end of a day, the only
                         requirement is to ensure that the average balance across the 14 day period is
                         met.

                         The CBRT as the operator provides liquidity support as part of its monetary
                         policy operations and these could be used by the participants for meeting its
                         liquidity needs in the EFT system.

                         The participants also can secure liquidity in the inter-bank money markets
                         operated by the Borsa Istanbul (BIST) and Takasbank. The CBRT is an active
                         participant and quotes its lending and borrowing rate at the BIST inter-bank
                         money market to maintain the interest rates in a pre-defined corridor.

                         These markets settle in the Takasbank at 4.30 PM. The participants can bring
                         this liquidity into the EFT system quickly as the Takasbank is also a
                         participant in the EFT system.

                         In addition the participants have access to the Takasbank cash credit facility
                         and also any credit lines agreed with other participants.




                                                 64
                      The transaction pattern in the EFT system shows a marked skew towards
                      transactions settling post 3 PM, with around 60% of transactions being settled
                      post 3 PM and around 35% post 4 PM.

                      There is a marked trend of settlements being bunched closer to the end of the

                      The CBRT has studied this topic as part of its 2015 annual review and is
                      currently evaluating potential options. The analysis had concluded that there
                      are a few structural reasons for the concentration of payments towards the
                      closing period: large in flow of settlements of the TRY leg of correspondent
                      banking transactions and that the ILF is unattractive hence the reliance on
                      using the inter-bank money markets which settle at 4 PM.

                      position in the EFT system covering the source of liquidity, the amount of
                      liquidity available in the system, and the distribution of the liquidity among
                      participants hour by hour.

                      The BRSA, is establishing a framework for monitoring liquidity of banks in
                      accordance with the BIS publication - “Monitoring metrics for intraday
                      liquidity risk management”. Once this framework has been adopted the
                      liquidity related analysis are also intended to be shared with the Markets

                      For the purpose of meeting its minimum liquid resource

                      currency include cash at the central bank of issue and at
                      creditworthy commercial banks, committed lines of credit,
                      committed foreign exchange swaps, and committed repos, as well

                      access as part of the minimum requirement to the extent it has

                      An FMI may supplement its qualifying liquid resources with other
                      forms of liquid resources. If the FMI does so, then these liquid
                      resources should be in the form of assets that are likely to be
                      saleable or acceptable as collateral for lines of credit, swaps, or
                      repos on an ad hoc basis following a default, even if this cannot be
                      reliably prearranged or guaranteed in extreme market conditions.
                      Even if an FMI does not have access to routine central bank credit,
                      it should still take account of what collateral is typically accepted
                      by the relevant central bank, as such assets may be more likely to
                      be liquid in stressed circumstances. An FMI should not assume the

Description       Same day settlement

                  The EFT system is structured as a RTGS system. Unsettled transactions are
                  cancelled at the end of the day. The EFT system is structured as a V topology
                  and the receiving participant does not have visibility into incoming transfer
                  orders. The participants have access to liquidity support from the CBRT and
                  the inter-bank money markets.

                  Replenishment of liquidity resources

                  The EFT system is operated by the CBRT. The CBRT as part of its monetary
                  policy operations can extend liquidity support to the participants, however as
                  a central bank of issue, it is not constrained in its liquidity.

Key Conclusions   The CBRT as the operator of the EFT system itself is not exposed to any
                  liquidity risk as the EFT is structured as a RTGS system and there are no
                  overdrafts allowed. The EFT system is structured as a RTGS system.
                  Unsettled transactions are cancelled at the end of the day.
                  The CBRT as the operator of the EFT system, by itself is not constrained in
                  TRY liquidity. However the participants could face liquidity shortages. The
                  participants have access to liquidity support from the CBRT and the inter-
                  bank money markets. These liquidity options are collateralized and in the case
                  of the intraday and overnight CBRT liquidity support there is an overall
                  borrowing limit for the participant. However, liquidity support is available
                  without any limit within the framework of LOLR.

                  The CBRT as the central bank of issue is not constrained in TRY and as such
                  does not require any tests to verify its adequacy of resources to provide
                  required liquidity. However the operational aspects related to liquidity
                  provision and also ability of participants to conform to the collateral
                  requirements need attention. The operational aspects are in the scope of the
                  operational risk management and covered in principle 17. The availability of
                  adequate collateral, however will need attention. In this regard, there is an
                  ongoing review of the policy framework relating to the CBRT intraday
                  liquidity support. There is however no set time-period for this.

                  The transaction pattern in the EFT system shows existence of substantial
                  liquidity risk for the participants. The CBRT has studied this and is currently
                  evaluating suitable options.

                  departments of the CBRT. There could be additional indicators like estimate
                  of participant’s liquidity available both from the CBRT and also the inter-
                  bank money markets. This could build on the framework being established
                  by the BRSA on liquidity risk.

                       The CBRT could consider encouraging earlier settlements in the inter-bank
                       money markets to allow for more liquidity to flow into the EFT system earlier.

                       The CBRT as part of the ongoing review of its current policy on liquidity risk,
                       analyze options to make intra-day liquidity support by the CBRT more
                       attractive to the participants and implement suitable options.

                       The CBRT could evaluate if pricing policies could incentivize earlier
                       settlement perhaps as part of overall throughput guidelines.

Principle 8: Settlement finality
An FMI should provide clear and certain final settlement, at a minimum by the end of the value
date. Where necessary or preferable, an FMI should provide final settlement intraday or in real
time
Key consideration 1       An FMI’s rules and procedures should clearly define the point
                          at which settlement is final.
Description               Point of settlement finality

                           The Article 10 of the PSL establishes settlement finality and irrevocability
                           for systems designated by the CBRT (Art 11). The CBRT has designated
                           the EFT, RPS and the ESTS in the official gazette and accordingly the
                           provisions of article 10 of the PSL covers the EFT system.
                           Article 10(1) of the PSL uses the term “transfer order”, requires the point
                           of time when a transaction become irrevocable, the time of entry and time
                           when a settlement of a transfer order is final, to be defined in the operating
                           rules of the system. Article 10(3) of the PSL further elaborates that any
                           decisions taken under any other law regarding any transaction orders,
                           would be valid only for transactions that enter the system after the system
                           operator has been notified. Article 10 (4) of the PSL covers systems using
                           netting process and makes the provisions of article 10 (3) allow transaction
                           orders that entered the system before the system operator was notified of
                           any legal decision, to be included in the netting process.

                           The PSOR has defined irrevocability as the time when the settlement
                           accounts have been debited or credited (art 8) and this is also considered
                           the time when the settlement is final. Article 7(3) of the PSOR further
                           defines that the “server time” recorded in relevant timestamps as the time
                           that will be used for recording time of entry, irrevocability and finality.

                           The term “transfer order” as defined in the PSL encompasses securities
                           transfer and hence the provisions also apply to the DVP settlements
                           involving the securities settlements in the EFT system. The Article 9.1.b of
                           the PSOR specifies that under DVP settlement the securities transfer and
                           the funds transfer for a securities settlement transaction would be carried
                           out simultaneously.

                      The PSL is available on the CBRT website and also in gazette. The PSOR
                      is available to the participants and also as part of the application process to
                      the banks that apply to become a participant.

                      Finality in the case of links

                      The EFT system is a payment system and as such there are no links.



Key consideration 2   An FMI should complete final settlement no later than the end
                      of the value date, and preferably intraday or in real time, to
                      reduce settlement risk. An LVPS or SSS should consider
                      adopting RTGS or multiple-batch processing during the
                      settlement day.
Description           Final settlement on the value date

                      The EFT system is structured as a RTGS system and all settlements are
                      final as noted in the KC 1.

                      Intraday or real-time final settlement

                      Transfer orders are settled only on their value date as and when funds are
                      available in the senders settlement account and orders for future value dates
                      are not accepted. As such, EFT provides intraday settlement in real time
                      provided funds are available in the senders account with CBRT.

                      Participants can track the status of their operations in real-time through
                      reporting facilities provided by the system.


Key consideration 3   An FMI should clearly define the point after which unsettled
                      payments, transfer instructions, or other obligations may not be
                      revoked by a participant.
Description
                      In the EFT system, it is possible to cancel transfer orders before they are
                      settled. However, a settled transaction cannot be cancelled or revoked. This
                      is stated in the Article 8 of the PSOR.
                      In EFT, participants can get detailed and summary reports on queued
                      payments and can cancel unsettled queued payments. At the end of the
                      business day, all payments in queues are cancelled automatically.
                      The EFT systems does not provide information to the receiver party about
                      incoming payments before the payment is settled, payment cancellations
                      from queues are transparent to the receiver.
                      Participants can request for extension of operating hours on a particular
                      day. Extensions request are made on phone and extensions granted are
                      communicated to all participants. Extensions up to 15 minutes are to be
                      authorized by the EFT operations head, beyond 15 minutes and up to 1
                      hour requires the approval of the ED of the PSD. Extensions beyond that
                      require approval of a Deputy Governor of the CBRT.




                                           72
Key conclusions             The EFT functions as a RTGS system with final settlement through the
                            day. Settlement finality is protected in the PSL and clearly articulated in
                            the PSOR and as such has a sound legal basis.

Principle 9: Money settlements
An FMI should conduct its money settlements in central bank money where practical and
available. If central bank money is not used, an FMI should minimize and strictly control the
credit and liquidity risk arising from the use of commercial bank money.
Key consideration 1        An FMI should conduct its money settlements in central bank
                           money, where practical and available, to avoid credit and
                           liquidity risks.
Description                The EFT system settles in the books of the CBRT and as such uses central
                          bank money.

Key consideration 2       If central bank money is not used, an FMI should conduct its
                          money settlements using a settlement asset with little or no credit
                          or liquidity risk.
Description               The EFT system settles in the books of the CBRT and as such uses central

Key consideration 3       If an FMI settles in commercial bank money, it should monitor,
                          manage, and limit its credit and liquidity risks arising from the
                          commercial settlement banks. In particular, an FMI should
                          establish and monitor adherence to strict criteria for its
                          settlement banks that take account of, among other things, their
                          regulation and supervision, creditworthiness, capitalisation,
                          access to liquidity, and operational reliability. An FMI should
                          also monitor and manage the concentration of credit and
                          liquidity exposures to its commercial settlement banks.

Principle 11: Central Securities Depositories
A CSD should have appropriate rules and procedures to help ensure the integrity of securities
issues and minimise and manage the risks associated with the safekeeping and transfer of
securities. A CSD should maintain securities in an immobilised or dematerialised form for
their transfer by book entry.
Key consideration 1       A CSD should have appropriate rules, procedures, and controls,
                          including robust accounting practices, to safeguard the rights of
                          securities issuers and holders, prevent the unauthorised creation

Principle 12: Exchange-of-value settlement systems
If an FMI settles transactions that involve the settlement of two linked obligations (for example,
securities or foreign exchange transactions), it should eliminate principal risk by conditioning
the final settlement of one obligation upon the final settlement of the other.
Key consideration 1        An FMI that is an exchange-of-value settlement system should
                           eliminate principal risk by ensuring that the final settlement of one
                           obligation occurs if and only if the final settlement of the linked
                           obligation also occurs, regardless of whether the FMI settles on a
                           gross or net basis and when finality occurs.
 Description                The EFT system is a payment system settling transfer order denominated
                          only in TRY. The EFT system is used for settling the securities settlement
                          transactions in a DVP mode, however the ESTS functions as the SSS for that.
                          This principle is hence addressed as part of the ESTS assessment.

                          The EFT system is used for the TRY leg of foreign exchange transactions,
                          however these are structured as two separate transactions and as such there
                          is no PVP arrangement to link the two legs.

Key conclusions           The EFT system does perform exchange-of-value settlement. The EFT
                          system is used for DVP settlements by the ESTS. There is no PVP for foreign
                          exchange transactions, with the TRY leg settling independently of the foreign
                          exchange leg, with the TRY denominated transfer orders being settled in
                          RTGS mode.

Principle 13: Participant-default rules and procedures
An FMI should have effective and clearly defined rules and procedures to manage a
participant default. These rules and procedures should be designed to ensure that the FMI
can take timely action to contain losses and liquidity pressures and continue to meet its
obligations.
Key consideration 1 An FMI should have default rules and procedures that enable
                         the FMI to continue to meet its obligations in the event of a
                         participant default and that address the replenishment of
                         resources following a default.
Description              Participant default rules and procedures

                        The EFT system functions as a RTGS system and no overdrafts are
                        allowed. The article 13(7) of the PSOR defines default as resulting from
                        insolvency of the participant or failure to settle its dues with the CBRT –
                        which could be either repayment of the credit availed through the liquidity
                        support operations of the CBRT or any fees due to the CBRT. The article
                        also further notes that in the event of default or other circumstances
                        including bankruptcy, termination of operations, merger or any other
                        technical or operational issues, the CBRT can use the participants assets
                        in the EFT, RPS or ESTS system to collect the amount owed to the CBRT.

                        Article 13(8) of the PSOR lists the actions that the CBRT could take on
                        participants who have defaulted or those facing operational or technical
                        issues:
                        • Suspend the money settlement temporarily.
                        • Suspend a participant temporarily. In this case, participant’s
                        settlement accounts are closed for operation and the messages sent by and
                        to the participant are automatically rejected.
                        • Use corrective direct debit operation to transfer funds and securities
                        between participants’ settlement accounts.
                        • Transfer balances of participant’s settlement accounts outside the
                        system in order to keep them in blocked accounts.


                        Use of financial resources

                        The EFT system is structured as a RTGS system, participants themselves
                        bear no credit risk amongst them. The CBRT is exposed to the default of
                        a participant to the extent the collateral posted by the defaulting
                        participant does not cover the liquidity facility availed by the participant.




                                              77
                      This however is considered outside the system as the liquidity facility
                      provided is treated as a monetary policy operation.
                      Nevertheless the PSOR, as noted above, allows the CBRT to access all of
                      the participant’s assets in the system including the collateral posted to
                      cover its loss. This provision in the PSOR has a sound legal basis deriving
                      from article 10(5) of the PSL.
                      The CBRT may provide intraday and overnight liquidity to other
                      participants in order to prevent liquidity shortfalls arising from a
                      participants default.
Key consideration 2   An FMI should be well prepared to implement its default rules
                      and procedures, including any appropriate discretionary
                      procedures provided for in its rules.
Description           The PSD has developed a default management procedure for the RPS,
                      EFT and ESTS in one integrated document. The document outlines the
                      process to be followed in various scenarios. This document was adopted
                      after endorsement by the management on the 21st December 2015.
                      Operations start upon receiving the written notification from the CBRT
                      Legal Department and are conducted in accordance with the PSL, PSOR
                      and applicable regulations.
                      Additionally, in case of a default of a participant, operations to be
                      performed in the CBRT Payment Systems are documented, including the
                      co-ordination with other relevant departments of the CBRT.
Key consideration 3   An FMI should publicly disclose key aspects of its default
                      rules and procedures.
Description           The default management processes are outlined in the PSOR, article 13.
                      The PSOR is available to all participants.

Key consideration 4   An FMI should involve its participants and other stakeholders
                      in the testing and review of the FMI’s default procedures,
                      including any close-out procedures. Such testing and review
                      should be conducted at least annually or following material
                      changes to the rules and procedures to ensure that they are
                      practical and effective.
Description
                      The default procedure was developed taking into account past experience
                      in handling defaults of participants in the early 2000’s. This process
                      however is not tested in its entirety. Specific elements are included in the
                      business continuity operations and on an ongoing basis – for example the
                      online communications tools available in the EFT system.

Key conclusions       The PSD has developed a default management procedure recently
                      covering all the payment and securities settlement systems operated by
                      the CBRT.

                      The default procedure is consistent with the provisions in the PSOR and
                      derives its legal basis from the PSL.

                      Given that the procedure was adopted very recently it has not been tested
                      in its entirety.

                      The participants in the system are all banks, except the MKK. Banks are
                      supervised by the BRSA and the MKK by the CMB. These authorities




                                            78
                         have the sole right related to insolvency or bankruptcy of these
                         participants.
                         There are existing co-ordination and information sharing arrangements
                         between the CBRT, BRSA and the CMB.

                         Hence there is high degree of certainty that the CBRT will have adequate
                         notice to execute its default management process. Nevertheless, any
                         delays in executing the default management process, could escalate the
                         risks in the system.

                         The CBRT could consider as part of publication of the PFMI assessments

Principle 14. Segregation and Portability
A CCP should have rules and procedures that enable the segregation and portability of
positions of a participant’s customers and the collateral provided to the CCP with respect to
those positions.
Key consideration 1       A CCP should, at a minimum, have segregation and portability
                          arrangements that effectively protect a participant’s customers’
                          positions and related collateral from the default or insolvency of
                          that participant. If the CCP additionally offers protection of
                          such customer positions and collateral against the concurrent
                          default of the participant and a fellow customer, the CCP should
                          take steps to ensure that such protection is effective.
Description               Customer protection from participant default

                         The EFT system is a payment system and hence this principle and KC are

Key consideration 2     A CCP should employ an account structure that enables it
                        readily to identify positions of a participant’s customers and to
                        segregate related collateral. A CCP should maintain customer
                        positions and collateral in individual customer accounts or in
                        omnibus customer accounts.

                        not applicable.

Key consideration 3     A CCP should structure its portability arrangements in a way
                        that makes it highly likely that the positions and collateral of a
                        defaulting participant’s customers will be transferred to one or
                        more other participants.
Description             The EFT system is a payment system and hence this principle and KC are
                        not applicable.

Key consideration 4     A CCP should disclose its rules, policies, and procedures relating
                        to the segregation and portability of a participant’s customers’
                        positions and related collateral. In particular, the CCP should
                        disclose whether customer collateral is protected on an
                        individual or omnibus basis. In addition, a CCP should disclose
                        any constraints, such as legal or operational constraints, that
                        may impair its ability to segregate or port a participant’s
                        customers’ positions and related collateral.
Description
                        The EFT system is a payment system and hence this principle and KC are
                        not applicable.
Key conclusions
                        The EFT system is a payment system and hence this principle is not

Principle 15: General business risk
An FMI should identify, monitor, and manage its general business risk and hold sufficient
liquid net assets funded by equity to cover potential general business losses so that it can
continue operations and services as a going concern if those losses materialize. Further,
liquid net assets should at all times be sufficient to ensure a recovery or orderly wind-down
of critical operations and services.
Key consideration 1 An FMI should have robust management and control systems
                         to identify, monitor, and manage general business risks,
                         including losses from poor execution of business strategy,
                         negative cash flows, or unexpected and excessively large
                         operating expenses.



                                             80
Description           In the EFT system, all risks including general business risk are managed
                      within the CBRT Payment Systems Risk Management Framework.
                      General business risk has been considered to be low since the owner and
                      operator of the EFT is the CBRT, and no important risks have been
                      identified in this context.
                      All expenses related with the systems are managed within the bank’s
                      general budget. Budgeting and accounting procedures are controlled by
                      the CBRT Accounting Department and subject to audit by the CBRT
                      Audit Department. The results are also controlled by the management of
                      the CBRT.

                      The pricing model of the EFT system is structured to fully recover
                      investment and operating expenses related to hardware and software of
                      the CBRT Payment Systems and personnel costs.

                      The pricing model for the EFT operations is based on the amount of the
                      payment to be transferred. The current tariff structure is as follows:
                         - Fixed fees of TRY 0.20 (min. fee) and TRY 20.80 (max. fee) are
                              charged for the payments with amounts below a lower limit (TRY
                              8,000); and, above an upper limit (TRY 832,000), respectively.
                         - The fee varies for the payments with an amount between those
                              limits (i.e., between TRY 8,000 and TRY 832,000) and it is
                              calculated by multiplying its value with a constant ratio
                              (0.000025).

                      The limits and their corresponding fees are determined each year and
                      announced to the participants by the CBRT.

Key consideration 2   An FMI should hold liquid net assets funded by equity (such as
                      common stock, disclosed reserves, or other retained earnings)
                      so that it can continue operations and services as a going
                      concern if it incurs general business losses. The amount of
                      liquid net assets funded by equity an FMI should hold should
                      be determined by its general business risk profile and the
                      length of time required to achieve a recovery or orderly wind-
                      down, as appropriate, of its critical operations and services if
                      such action is taken.
Description           The EFT system is owned and operated by the CBRT. This key
                      consideration is not applicable, as stated in the Application of the
                      Principles for financial market infrastructures to central bank FMIs.
Key consideration 3   An FMI should maintain a viable recovery or orderly wind-
                      down plan and should hold sufficient liquid net assets funded
                      by equity to implement this plan. At a minimum, an FMI
                      should hold liquid net assets funded by equity equal to at least
                      six months of current operating expenses. These assets are in
                      addition to resources held to cover participant defaults or
                      other risks covered under the financial resources principles.
                      However, equity held under international risk-based capital
                      standards can be included where relevant and appropriate to
                      avoid duplicate capital requirements.

Key conclusions          The EFT is a central bank operated FMI, as such several KCs related to
                         liquid assets, wind down plans and viable plan for raising additional
                         capital are not applicable.

                         The pricing policy for the EFT system aims for a full investment and

                         communicated to the participants. The fees are recovered on a monthly
                         basis and the corresponding information is available to participants. The
                         costs of the EFT system are covered under the general budget of the CBRT
                         and subject to the standard audit process.

An FMI should safeguard its own and its participants’ assets and minimise the risk of loss on
and delay in access to these assets. An FMI’s investments should be in instruments with
minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks.
Key consideration 1      An FMI should hold its own and its participants’ assets at
                         supervised and regulated entities that have robust accounting
                         practices, safekeeping procedures, and internal controls that
                         fully protect these assets.

                      The settlement accounts of the participants are held at the CBRT. The TRY
                      denominated government securities collateral placed for CBRT liquidity
                      support are held at the ESTS – owned and operated by the CBRT. The
                      foreign currency denominated Turkish and foreign government securities
                      placed as collateral are held in the name of the CBRT in ICSDs. The foreign
                      currency funds used as collateral are again held in the books of the CBRT.

                      The operations of the EFT are fully subject to the internal audit process of
                      the CBRT.

                      The CBRT does not reuse the collaterals placed with it.

Key consideration 2   An FMI should have prompt access to its assets and the assets
                      provided by participants, when required.
Description
                      All the collateral assets except those placed in the ICSDs are in the full
                      control of the CBRT. The collaterals placed in the ICSD are held in the
                      name of the CBRT and hence can be easily accessed subject to the
                      operating hours of the ICSD.

Key consideration 3   An FMI should evaluate and understand its exposures to its
                      custodian banks, taking into account the full scope of its
                      relationships with each.

                      name of the CBRT and hence can be easily accessed subject to the
                      operating hours of the ICSD.

Key consideration 4   An FMI’s investment strategy should be consistent with its
                      overall risk-management strategy and fully disclosed to its
                      participants, and investments should be secured by, or be claims
                      on, high-quality obligors. These investments should allow for
                      quick liquidation with little, if any, adverse price effect.

                      The EFT is owned and operated by the CBRT. The CBRT does not reuse
                      the collateral placed with it. Its investment strategy as a central bank is
                      outside the scope of this assessment as noted in the CPMI-IOSCO
                      publication on the application of PFMIs to central bank operated FMIs.

Key conclusions       The EFT system is owned and operated by the CBRT. The settlement
                      accounts of the participants are in the books of the CBRT. The collaterals
                      collected for the liquidity support options are either held in the ESTS or in
                      ICSD in its name. The CBRT does not reuse the collateral. The investment
                      strategy of the CBRT is outside the scope of this assessment.

Principle 17: Operational risk
An FMI should identify the plausible sources of operational risk, both internal and external,
and mitigate their impact through the use of appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and
controls. Systems should be designed to ensure a high degree of security and operational
reliability and should have adequate, scalable capacity. Business continuity management
should aim for timely recovery of operations and fulfillment of the FMI’s obligations,
including in the event of a wide-scale or major disruption.
Key consideration 1 An FMI should establish a robust operational risk-management
                        framework with appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and
                        controls to identify, monitor, and manage operational risks.
Description             Identification of operational risk

                       Operational risk is managed at the CBRT corporate level. The CBRT has
                       stablished a Business Continuity Committee and has tasked this with
                       identifying operational risks, and mitigating them through developing and
                       testing business continuity plans.
                       The CBRT’s Business Continuity Strategy Document, prepared by the
                       Business Continuity Committee, categorises the sources of operational risk
                       (sources required to manage all the processes including the sub-processes)
                       into labour, information (data and documents), physical infrastructure,
                       network infrastructure and the system. Definitions of these categories are
                       as follows:
                        • Labour includes all the personnel who work at the headquarters, in
                        Ankara and Istanbul branches,
                        • System includes all the hardware and software,
                        • Information includes all types of raw or processed data and reports that
                        are both in and out of the system,
                        • Physical infrastructure includes the elements such as the structural
                        features of premises and the buildings, the technological infrastructure and
                        hardware, equipment and furniture,
                        • Network infrastructure includes the elements such as telephones, fax
                        machines, external network connections and information communication
                        technology related devices.
                       In addition to the corporate level business continuity activities, the Risk
                       Management Framework of the CBRT Payment Systems, which has been
                       developed based on ISO 31000, is used for the identification, monitoring
                       and management of the operational risks that arise from the internal (the
                       system, labour, etc.) and external (participants, interconnected systems,
                       etc.) sources of risk.
                       The EFT, as a part of the CBRT Payment and Securities Settlement
                       Systems have been designed and developed within the CBRT. The design
                       principles have paid attention to resilience, robustness and recovery
                       facilities. The sources of potential single points of failures have been
                       eliminated by using the mechanisms of full redundancy in the hardware




                                               84
and network. Moreover, the systems are reviewed annually with respect to
these features and facilities.
The CBRT data centres – primary and secondary housing the IT systems
are categorized as Tier 3, as per the internal assessments of the CBRT. Tier
3 data centres are designed to have an up time of 99.9%.
In the CBRT, in order to ensure the continuous provision of critical
services, the staffs that are considered critical for the provision of these
services have at least one backup. In addition, guides and procedures,
which describe the steps to be followed by the CBRT staff to perform the
critical operations, are documented so that the CBRT staff other than
primary and substitute ones can carry on these services in case of
emergency. This is tested as part of the business continuity planning and
staff other than the primary and substitute ones are required to perform the
activities.
Information and documents are kept and backed up in line with the
principles of the CBRT’s Information Security Policy. Data, which are
classified as critical, are kept in two copies in fireproof safes, one of which
is located at the backup centre.
Until the date of this report, no single point of failure with regards to human
resources, information sources, physical and communications
infrastructures or information systems of the CBRT Payment Systems has
been identified.

Management of operational risk

The Risk Management Framework of the CBRT Payment and Securities
Settlement Systems includes the goals and principles, roles and
responsibilities, review policies and the flows and details about the periodic
application of the framework. Operational risks of the CBRT Payment and
Securities Settlement Systems are also managed on the basis of this
framework.

The scenarios for the business continuity and disaster recovery
management of the CBRT Payment and Securities Settlement Systems are
defined in the CBRT Payment Systems Business Continuity Application
Plan. The actions to be taken by the participants when these scenarios
materialize are given in the CBRT Payment Systems Disaster Recovery
and Contingency Guide, which also contains the technical and operational
procedures. These have been shared with the participants and has been
used for the past BCP testing. These documents are now being
reviewed and a new version released in Q3 2016.

Policies, processes and controls

The most important source of operational risk for the EFT system is the
information system, which is composed of hardware, software and
communications infrastructure. The EFT system as part of the CBRT
Payment and Securities Settlement Systems have been developed by using
the CBRT’s proprietary enterprise information technology platform. All of
the critical CBRT systems have been developed and are running on this
platform, and benefit from the flexibility, stability, security and capacity
planning of this platform. The platform uses modern technological




                        85
hardware and software facilities, and applications are developed as per
approved written processes based on the industry IT standards and best
practices.

The CBRT has established an Information Security Management System
based on ISO 27001 to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability
of all information assets. All the security measures, controls, and all the
security tests including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, are
carried out in accordance with the principles and objectives of the
Information Security Policy.

All the services provided within the scope of IT operations have been
classified according to the Information Technology Infrastructure Library
(ITIL) framework and service level agreements have been agreed upon. All
the events, incidents, problem and service requests related with the CBRT
Payment and Securities Settlement Systems are managed according to the
ITIL compliant framework. The CBRT Payment Systems Service Desk is
the first and only point of contact for the execution of service operations.
Technical and operational experts take part at the second level.

The IT portfolio, project, change and configuration management activities
are carried out according to the approved processes, which are established
based on the standards and best practices, and to procedures identified in
these processes. The CBRT’s Corporate Portfolio and Project Management
Methodology have been developed by using the methodology of the Project
Management Institute (PMI). The Change Management and Configuration
Management are carried out according to ITIL v3.

The procedures are reviewed and tested regularly and after every major
change. Tests are performed in an environment similar to production so
that all the potential risks are minimized as much as possible.

In addition to that, the CBRT Payment Systems Risk Management
Framework, which is used for managing all types of risks of the systems,
has been developed based on ISO 31000.

The risks arising from the human resources are also handled by the
practices of the CBRT Human Resources Department. The CBRT employs
experts and qualified personnel in their fields and improves the knowledge
and skills of existing personnel through extensive training continuously.

Apart from the Bank’s internal training, which constitutes a part of the in-
service training, Bank’s personnel also participate in the short and long
term training programs organised by other organizations and institutions
both in Turkey and abroad. The CBRT’s employee turnover rate is very
low.

The code of business conduct and the information security rules that must
be complied with and the sanctions to be imposed in case of a default are
specified in the Disciplinary Regulation of the CBRT and the CBRT
Information Security Policy, and presented to all the employees. Periodic
activities are carried out for briefing the personnel and increasing their
awareness on Information Security Policy. Moreover, critical processes in
the system are carried out with the approval of at least two employees, as




                       86
                     required by the Bank’s authorisation policy. The authentication is based on
                     user-id and password and user-ids are tagged to specific IP addresses.

                     The requirements for all of the improvements in the CBRT Payment and
                     Securities Settlement Systems are planned considering the factors of
                     budget, human resources and schedule and in cooperation with relevant
                     departments, and are managed with the corporate project and portfolio
                     management methodology in a measurable way. Projects are prioritised
                     taking into account the requirements, legal obligations, cost-benefit and
                     risk assessment result.

                     In order to minimise the risks arising from the changes, the systems are
                     updated, approved, monitored, tested and then opened to service in the
                     production environment, and predefined processes are followed during
                     these activities.
Key consideration 2 An FMI’s board of directors should clearly define the roles and
                    responsibilities for addressing operational risk and should
                    endorse the FMI’s operational risk-management framework.
                    Systems, operational policies, procedures, and controls should be
                    reviewed, audited, and tested periodically and after significant
                    changes.
Description         Roles, responsibilities and framework

                     The Business Continuity Committee, which was established by the
                     CBRT’s Board in December 2009, takes actions to ensure business
                     continuity and to mitigate the operational risks at the corporate level.

                     The Committee is chaired by a vice governor and is composed of executive
                     directors of the relevant departments. The Committee appoints working
                     groups, which consist of representatives from the related departments, to
                     carry on the business continuity activities. The Business Continuity
                     Committee reports to the Executive Committee when required and presents
                     a report to the Board at least once a year.

                     As part of the business continuity studies of the CBRT, the critical
                     processes of the EFT as a part of the CBRT Payment and Securities
                     Settlement Systems have been identified via impact and risk analyses.
                     Based on this the CBRT Payment Systems Department Business
                     Continuity Application Plan has been prepared. The roles and
                     responsibilities of the recovery teams at the corporate level are defined in
                     the CBRT’s Business Continuity Strategy Document, whereas the details
                     of the groups that are specifically constituted for the CBRT Payment
                     Systems are defined in the CBRT Payment Systems Department Business
                     Continuity Application Plan.

                     Moreover, all types of risks in the CBRT Payment Systems, including the
                     operational risks, are managed at the departmental level within the context
                     of the CBRT Payment Systems Risk Management Framework (described
                     in principle 3). The Framework is reviewed and updated when needed or at
                     least once a year. The activities carried out within the framework, the
                     developments and the results of risk assessments are presented to the
                     Executive Committee at least once a year, and to the CBRT Board as a part
                     of the performance planning and reporting process.




                                            87
                     Review, audit and testing

                     The strategies, policies and documents that are in the scope of the CBRT
                     business continuity studies are reviewed by the Business Continuity
                     Committee.

                     The CBRT’s Business Continuity Plan and CBRT Payment Systems
                     Department Business Continuity Application Plan are tested regularly at
                     least once a year. However, interim tests are also performed when a change
                     in the business processes or human resources takes place or when the
                     Business Continuity Application Plan is amended. The test program and
                     results are reviewed by the Committee and periodically audited by the
                     Audit Department.

                     Tests are carried on the disaster recovery centre or on a test environment
                     constructed with a configuration similar to that of the production
                     environment. In addition, the test requests of the participants are met in
                     coordination with the other relevant departments of the CBRT.

                     When needed, special purpose questionnaires are used to survey the
                     readiness level of participants for business continuity and disaster recovery,
                     to learn their expectations from the CBRT, and to take their suggestions
                     and opinions.
Key consideration 3 An FMI should have clearly defined operational reliability
                    objectives and should have policies in place that are designed to
                    achieve those objectives.
Description
                     The Business Continuity Strategy of the CBRT defines the acceptable
                     downtime for critical processes as 1 hour. The Recovery Time and
                     Recovery Point Objectives [RTO and RPO] have been defined for each
                     sub-process in order to maintain the critical business functions. Besides,
                     the Business Continuity Application Plan has been prepared so that the time
                     critical functions are resumed in one hour, and the settlement obligations
                     are accomplished within the specified time objectives and before the end
                     of the day. The Business Continuity Application Plan is tested at least once
                     a year.
                     The performance program of the IT Department of the CBRT aims an
                     annual up time of over 99% for the main computer system, database and
                     communications infrastructure hosting the EFT system as part of the CBRT
                     Payment and Securities Settlement Systems.
                     In addition to business continuity objectives, the performance program of
                     the IT Department involves performance objectives and indicators related
                     to the technical performance of the EFT system as part of the CBRT
                     Payment and Securities Settlement Systems. For instance, the performance
                     objectives for the average settlement time have been specified as 30
                     seconds for EFT and ESTS, and as 60 seconds for RPS. Transaction
                     volumes and average processing times are reported daily on the User Group
                     web site, and are included in the CBRT Payment Systems Monthly Reports.

                     The events and incidents in the components of the CBRT Payment and
                     Securities Settlement Systems are monitored in real time by using the
                     service management applications. The relevant parties are informed at once
                     and all the incidents are recorded in the database. As a fundamental part of




                                             88
                        the service management practice, a service catalogue, which include all the
                        services provided together with the assigned service level agreement, has
                        been created and announced to the participants. All incidents that occur in
                        the CBRT Payment and Securities Settlement Systems are listed in the
                        CBRT Payment Systems Monthly Report. The responses to these incidents
                        and the cases for which the response times exceeded the committed service
                        level agreements are further evaluated. The Performance Program of the IT
                        Department for 2015, has the objective of a maximum of 5 minutes for the
                        average resolution time of incidents handled by the Service Desk.

                        The performance objectives and their realisations are monitored and the
                        results are presented to the CBRT Board once a year. In addition to that,
                        the satisfaction levels of the users are measured via post incident surveys.
                        The responses are collated and presented in the annual CBRT payment
                        systems report.

                        In order to achieve operational reliability objectives, a testing policy
                        employing extensive testing on a regular basis has been developed.
                        Accordingly, disaster recovery tests, functional tests, capacity and
                        performance tests are performed based on the scenarios described in the
                        CBRT Payment Systems Department Business Continuity Application
                        Plan. New functions and changes are extensively tested, with the
                        involvement of participants if needed, and are put into service within the
                        knowledge of all stakeholders.
                        System components and resources are monitored regularly. The Incident
                        Management System has been used to detect, respond, resolve and report
                        the incidents that may lead to emergency situations. The events related to
                        participant interfaces and connections are included in the Incident
                        Management Systems and notifications to participants are available. The
                        Problem Management System has also been established to analyse the root
                        cause of an incident. All actions taken to manage a problem are recoded
                        and managed in the system.
                        Moreover, the Information Security Management System, established in
                        the context of Information Security Policy, defines the rules for ensuring
                        the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all information assets of the
                        CBRT and for securing the processes that make use of these assets.
Key consideration 4 An FMI should ensure that it has scalable capacity adequate to
                    handle increasing stress volumes and to achieve its service-level
                    objectives.
Description         Stress tests and performance tests are carried out with the involvement of
                        participants in test environments that are similar to the production
                        environment. If the result of the impact analysis performed within the
                        context of the Change Management Process necessitates, the performance
                        and capacity tests are repeated after all significant changes.
                        The capacity of the systems are adjusted so that the accumulated messages
                        can be processed within one hour and before the end of the day once the
                        systems start to operate after a long lasting disruption. The total message
                        volumes are continuously monitored; the current volumes and increase in
                        volumes, peak days and the projected message volumes are regularly
                        reported. Similarly, the resource requirements for the system are reviewed
                        periodically.
                        The performances and resource usage of the components of the overall
                        CBRT Payment and Securities Settlement Systems are continuously

                     monitored. Threshold based early warning mechanisms have been
                     developed for specific parameters.


Key consideration 5 An FMI should have comprehensive physical and information
                    security policies that address all potential vulnerabilities and
                    threats.
Description         Physical security

                     The Information Security Policy of the CBRT defines the rules for ensuring
                     the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all information assets of the
                     Bank and for securing the processes that make use of these assets.

                     The article “Physical and Peripheral Security of Information Security
                     Policy” of the policy document defines the principles and procedures
                     regarding the safety of the secure zones and the equipment in the CBRT
                     premises. The same article also specifies the principles and procedures for
                     ensuring the physical and peripheral safety against the risks arising from
                     the unauthorized access and damages to information, work areas, personnel
                     and equipment located at the buildings and facilities of the CBRT.

                     In addition, the Preventive Security Services Directive of the CBRT is
                     binding for the Information Security Policy in respect of the rules that must
                     be obeyed for ensuring physical security. Project Management and Change
                     Management processes are carried out according to the physical security
                     principles stated in Information Security Policy.

                     Information security

                     The principles stated in the Information Security Policy specify the
                     principles and procedures for ensuring the safety of all information assets
                     in the CBRT. Within the context of Information Security Policy
                     Management System, all information assets have been identified, impact
                     analysis for possible threats have been made and the risks have been
                     mitigated using proper controls.

                     These studies are regularly repeated and necessary measures for the new
                     conditions are put in place. The issues and results of the studies regarding
                     the Information Security Management System, which is promoted by the
                     top management, are assessed by the Information Security Committee.

                     This committee is chaired by the ED of the IT department and its members
                     are the Deputy General Managers of all the departments in Ankara and the
                     head of the Ankara branch of the CBRT. The Committee gathers on an
                     annual basis and prepares the action plans based on the results of annual
                     assessments. Moreover, Information Security Committee report annually
                     to the Executive Committee and the Board of the CBRT, and are discharged
                     by the Board.

                     The Information Security Management System and the Information
                     Security Policy of the CBRT are based on the ISO 27001 standard.

Key consideration 6 An FMI should have a business continuity plan that addresses
                    events posing a significant risk of disrupting operations,
                    including events that could cause a wide-scale or major
                    disruption. The plan should incorporate the use of a secondary
                    site and should be designed to ensure that critical information
                    technology (IT) systems can resume operations within two hours
                    following disruptive events. The plan should be designed to
                    enable the FMI to complete settlement by the end of the day of
                    the disruption, even in case of extreme circumstances. The FMI
                    should regularly test these arrangements.
Description         Objectives of business continuity plan

                     The business continuity objectives (RTO, RPO etc.) have been defined in
                     the CBRT’s Business Continuity Strategy document. Within the scope of
                     business continuity studies, the critical processes have been identified by
                     performing impact analysis on all sub-processes and the criteria such as
                     acceptable longest downtime and bearable data loss levels have been
                     determined.

                     The BCP of the CBRT deals with the critical processes that have been
                     identified as having acceptable downtimes up to 1 hour. The processes of
                     the overall CBRT Payment and Securities Settlement Systems are
                     considered as critical processes.
                     The BCP contains basic failure scenarios, which have been formed by
                     combining various threats that yield to similar results with respect to their
                     impacts on the resources, as well as institution wide action plans and
                     governance procedures. There are nine specific scenarios that are included
                     in the BCP: Eight of the scenarios involve failure of some or all of the 5
                     components – PIS, EFT, RPS, ESTS and network. One scenario covers
                     failure of one or more participants.

                     The Business Continuity Application Plans, on the other hand, constitute
                     parts of the BCP and are formed by the relevant departments that own the
                     critical business processes. Within the scope of the Business Continuity
                     Application Plan prepared by PSD, the risks attributed to the critical
                     business processes in the payment systems have been handled by using the
                     Risk Management Framework of the PSD. Also, within the same plan, the
                     controls have been defined, disaster recovery scenarios including extreme
                     but plausible conditions have been determined and operational and
                     technical procedures for disaster recovery have been prepared.

                     The PSD Business Continuity Application Plan also defines the recovery
                     teams that will work in emergency situations, their roles and
                     responsibilities and the communication procedures to be used between
                     these departmental recovery teams and the corporate level recovery teams.

                     Design of business continuity plan

                     The Payment Systems Department Business Continuity Application Plan
                     focuses on the impacts that may be caused by contingency situations
                     including extreme scenarios where the operations are disrupted on the
                     critical infrastructures and services. The Plan targets to resume the




                                             91
operations of the overall CBRT payment and securities settlement systems
in 1 hour once a devastating event takes place.

The emergency scenarios in the Business Continuity Application Plan also
include alternative methods such as using the Emergency Application
Package (EAP), a facility built using completely different hardware and
software platforms, enabling the execution of payment systems operations
in a different platform, and following manual procedures for the provision
of time critical services. The EAP can be invoked with manual feed of the
last operational balances in the EFT system. This system does not have the
full-fledged functionality of the EFT system and functions based on upload
of transactions which are netted periodically.

There are formal procedures for delaying end-of-day operations in
situations where the settlement functions cannot be completed before the
end-of day.

As stated in the Business Continuity Strategy document, in emergency
situations the CBRT Communications and Foreign Relations Department
is responsible for the communications with the mass media and for the
liaisons with the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA), the
Undersecretariat of Treasury, Borsa Istanbul (BIST) and any other
institutions in Turkey or abroad with which the CBRT has operations.
Moreover, the Business Continuity Strategy Document describes the
recovery teams that will work in emergency situations and defines their
roles and responsibilities.

In addition to the recovery teams, special teams play roles in emergency
situations so as to meet the additional requirements arising from the
operations of payment systems. For instance, the role of service desk and
special technical and operational task groups functioning within the context
of the Business Continuity Application Plan have also been defined.


Secondary site

The components of the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems
work at two different premises in a continuous backup and load sharing
mode. To minimize the risks induced by the third-party service providers,
the networking infrastructure is backed up by installing two physically
separate and redundant networks provided by two different service
providers and by utilizing two different networking technologies.

The human resources required to maintain the operations of the system
have been included in the plan. A Disaster Recovery Management Centre
has been established at the secondary site and has been equipped with the
infrastructure and hardware that the personnel may need to resume the
operations.

The scenarios in the Business Continuity Application Plan also cover
alternative methods that may be used to achieve the resilience of the CBRT
Payment and Securities Settlement Systems in accordance with the
continuity objectives.




                       92
In addition the EAP can be used if there is a simultaneous disruption to
both the infrastructures. The EAP also constitutes a good alternative for
cyber incidents, which could impact also the integrity of the data, impairing
it in such a way that the RTO becomes hard to achieve.

Moreover, as a part of the worst case scenarios, procedures for manual
execution of time critical operations have been prepared and included in
the Business Continuity Application Plan.

Review and testing

The CBRT’s BCP is reviewed at least once a year and the effectiveness of
the plan is tested within the context of specified functions and processes.
The purpose of the test is to ensure that the plan is complete, essential and
applicable and the RTO and RPO objectives are achievable. The other
purpose of the test is to identify and enhance the aspects that need to be
improved.

The disaster scenarios of the Business Continuity Application Plan are also
tested at least once a year. However, the tests can also be performed in
interim periods when there is a change in business processes, personnel or
plans.

The participants, especially the critical and systemically important ones,
are included in the business continuity test plans. In addition, the service
requests of the participants to test their own business continuity
arrangements are met and supported in cooperation with the relevant
departments of the CBRT. Whenever deemed necessary, special purpose
questionnaires are conducted to assess participants’ business continuity and
disaster recovery readiness levels, and to collect their suggestions, opinions
and expectations from the CBRT. Recently a survey was administered to
all participants to gather information on their BCP, Cyber resilience and
also quality of the BCPs. The results of the survey are presented below:

The questionnaire consisted of questions grouped into 4 main parts:
    - The activities related to the business continuity and disaster
        recovery throughout the entire institution.
    - Business continuity and disaster recovery plans of the participant
        for the CBRT’s payment and securities settlement systems.
    - The works carried out on cyber resilience at the institution.
    - The feedback on applications and services given by CBRT for
        disaster recovery of its payment systems.
Unanswered questions were accepted as negative response. Highlights
from the outcome of the survey are as follows:
    - All participants have a defined process for business continuity.
        More than half of the participants (mostly critical participants)
        follow a generally accepted standard like ISO 22301 or BS 25299.
    - Almost all participants’ BCP are audited or reviewed by both
        internal and external auditors regularly (for most of them it is
        annual).
    - Almost all participants identified their critical processes related
        with the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems.




                        93
    -   Almost all participants clearly defined the roles and
        responsibilities in their BCP.
    -   Almost all participants defined their minimum service levels in
        emergency situations.
    -   All participants have a disaster recovery center (secondary site) to
        be used in case of a disaster in their main sites. The secondary site
        is identically constructed as the main site for 34 participants.
    -   Almost all participants (43) regularly, generally on a yearly basis,
        test their disaster recovery and implementation plans. Nearly half
        of the participants include the scenarios in which both sites are not
        operational in these tests.
    -   37 participants consider cyber security incidents in setting their
        business continuity objectives and 28 participants have a special
        process for the responses to cyber related incidents.
    -   30 participants have internal cyber incident response teams.
        Moreover, some of these participants and the others outsourced
        services for cyber incidents’ (identification, detection, response,
        recovery, etc).
    -   All participants carry out regular penetration tests (by getting a
        service from an external security company or from internal
        experts).
    -   All participants have a promulgated information security policy
        and they follow programs to raise the cyber security awareness of
        its employees.
    -   The participants mostly gave positive feedback to the applications
        and services given by the CBRT for disaster recovery of its
        payment systems. They in particular noted that the amount of
        information and communication channels provided by the CBRT
        is sufficient and good enough.
    -   A few participants stated that the number of tests should be
        increased and be more extensive.

The result of the survey is being used by the CBRT for developing the new
updated version of the CBRT Payment System Business Continuity
Implementation Plan and the CBRT Payment Systems Disaster Recovery
and Contingency Guide. This version will be released in Q3 2016.

Test scenarios are defined in the annual test plan prepared by the Business
Continuity Committee. Departments are expected to prepare their test plans
in accordance with the annual plan. The Business Continuity Committee
approves the departmental test plans and evaluates their results. In addition,
the entire testing process and results are audited by the Audit Department.
Business continuity tests are also covered by payment systems oversight
activities.

The testing activities and regular improvements related with business
continuity may involve the critical participants, all participants, or linked
FMIs depending on the scenarios. The service requests by these
stakeholders for testing their business continuity plans are also met in
cooperation with relevant departments.

Key consideration 7 An FMI should identify, monitor, and manage the risks that key
                    participants, other FMIs, and service and utility providers might
                    pose to its operations. In addition, an FMI should identify,
                    monitor, and manage the risks its operations might pose to other
                    FMIs.
Description         Risks to the FMI’s own operations

                     All components of the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems,
                     except the private network, have been developed in-house using internal
                     resources of the CBRT. Although the private network is owned by BAT
                     and operated by the CBRT, the telecommunication services are provided
                     by the third party service providers. To minimize the risks arising from the
                     service providers, the network is backed up with two redundant, physically
                     separated and technologically diversified backbones provided by two
                     different service providers. As an extension to the core networking services
                     acquired from the providers, detailed agreements are put under contract
                     with the service providers within the scope of these support and
                     maintenance services, and the services taken are assessed by all relevant
                     departments at the end of the contract period.
                     Within the scope of the Risk Management Framework of the CBRT
                     Payment Systems, the risks arising from all participants especially the
                     critical ones and linked FMIs are also handled. For this purpose, the critical
                     participants of the systems are determined regularly using a network
                     analysis based on sink-rank model. The business continuity efforts of the
                     participants and the measures they take in this respect are monitored by
                     administering surveys to them.

                     Risks posed to other FMIs

                     Since the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems constitute the
                     backbone of the national payment system of Turkey and the daily final
                     settlement of several other FMIs are made by transfers over these systems,
                     any disruption in the CBRT Payment Systems may directly affect other
                     FMIs. Therefore, the acceptable outage periods have been determined
                     accordingly and alternative methods (e.g., Emergency Application
                     Package, Offline Connection Facility for the Participant Interface System,
                     manual procedures) for the resumption of the time critical processes have
                     been developed and continuously improved.

                     Center (BKM) and the ACH system are also settled in the EFT system.

Key conclusions      The CBRT Payment Systems have a comprehensive operational risk
                     management Framework spanning people, process and systems. The risk
                     management framework is reviewed once a year.

                     Industry best practices for IT risk management framework – ISO 27001
                     and ITIL for IT services management, have been used.

                     There are adequate processes and procedures in place to address people
                     aspects and the IT systems and processes have been developed using
                     industry standards and best practices.

                  There are periodic IT security reviews and there are dedicated
                  organizational arrangements in place for monitoring and managing the IT
                  security aspects.

                  The IT infrastructure is built in a way that there is no single point of failure
                  and there is full-fledged backup site which works on a load sharing basis
                  with the main site. In addition there is an application package developed
                  using a completely different hardware and software platform to cover the
                  risk of a simultaneous impact on both the infrastructures, which is a
                  possibility in particular with cyber risk incidents.

                  There is a well-laid out BCP plan with an organized governance
                  arrangement to monitor and review its execution. However the BCP
                  include only scenarios that relate to the infrastructure of the CBRT payment
                  and securities settlement systems. Scenarios, either arising within the
                  CBRT payment and securities settlement systems, within the CBRT or
                  externally, which can cause a widespread impact have not been included.

                  The participants are included in the BCP tests and there are plans underway
                  to include complex scenarios to fully cover business continuity risks arising
                  from and posed to other FMIs and participants– in particular Takasbank
                  and MKK.

                  The PSOR covers operational risk management in articles 17-20, however
                  there is no explicit mandate on this and there is no structured process to
                  measure ongoing compliance with these aspects. However, the CBRT
                  recently surveyed the participants to assess their BCP plans and cyber
                  resilience. All the participants reported having BCPs, but there were some
                  gaps in terms of the quality of the BCP and cyber resilience readiness of
                  some participants. The CBRT is already addressing this as part of its
                  revised business continuity guide.
                  The CBRT includes the risks it poses to other FMIs as part of the
                  framework for assessing risks from and to participants.


Assessment of     Broadly Observed
Principle 17
Recommendations   The CBRT could build on the specific provisions in the PSOR to include
and comments      explicit mandates with respect to operational risk management for its
                  participants and have a mechanism to assess compliance to those on an
                  ongoing basis.

                  The CBRT could consider including more stringent operational risk
                  management measures for the participants with a large share of
                  transactions, based on the monthly network analysis being carried out.

                  The CBRT could also consider incorporating a more structured assessment
                  of the operational risks it can pose to other FMIs and the risks it could be
                  exposed from them. This assessment could become the basis for the more
                  detailed and complex scenarios being proposed for inclusion in the revised
                  business continuity plans. These scenarios could include:
                      • Failure closer to the market closing time – say at 4.30 PM;
                      • Failure of the Takasbank inter-bank money market platform;
                      • Impact to the BIST platforms;

                         •   Impact to MKK;
                         •   Failure on the days of a government securities primary issuance or
                             a foreign exchange auction; and,
                         •   Operational impact on any external provider used by several
                             participants and FMIs.

Principle 18. Access and participation requirements
An FMI should have objective, risk-based, and publicly disclosed criteria for participation,
which permit fair and open access.
Key consideration 1 An FMI should allow for fair and open access to its services,
                       including by direct and, where relevant, indirect participants and
                       other FMIs, based on reasonable risk-related participation
                       requirements.
Description            Participation criteria and requirements

                      The Article 5 of the PSOR defines the legal and operational aspects of
                      participation criteria and requirements as follows:
                           • All banks operating in Turkey in accordance with the Banking Law,
                                 and the MKK may participate in the Systems.
                           • In order to participate in the CBRT payment and securities settlement
                                 systems a bank should:
                                a. apply in writing to the CBRT with banking permit and
                                     authorization documents,
                                b. be approved for participation by the executive committee of the
                                     CBRT
                                c. sign the Participation Contract,
                                d. have an account with the CBRT,
                                e. complete the procedures in BAT that are required for participation
                                     in the Systems,
                                f. have the software required to access the systems, prepare the
                                     infrastructure for network connection and have these
                                     arrangements approved by the CBRT,
                                g. conform to the infrastructure preparation calendar and to the
                                     participation date determined by the CBRT, and complete the
                                     preparations without delay.
                                h. Successfully complete the system acceptance tests.
                           • Without being subject to the provisions of Article 6 and 28 of the
                                 PSOR [related to leaving the system and penal provisions], the MKK
                                 has an ESTS account and participates only in the ESTS component
                                 with the purpose of book-keeping the securities on investors.
                      Financial criteria and requirements to be a bank, on the other hand, is defined
                      in Banking Law as “Its paid-up capital, consisting of cash and free of all kinds
                      of fictitious transactions, should not be less than 30 million Turkish liras.”

                     In addition as a policy measure the participation is approved for all three
                     systems – EFT, RPS and ESTS and participation to specific systems alone is
                     not allowed. The only exception is the MKK, which participates only in the
                     ESTS component.
                     Access to trade repositories

                     This item is not applicable to the EFT.
Key consideration 2 An FMI’s participation requirements should be justified in terms of
                    the safety and efficiency of the FMI and the markets it serves, be
                    tailored to and commensurate with the FMI’s specific risks, and be
                    publicly disclosed. Subject to maintaining acceptable risk control
                    standards, an FMI should endeavour to set requirements that have
                    the least-restrictive impact on access that circumstances permit.
Description         Justification and rationale of participation criteria

                     The requirements related to IT infrastructure and related aspects are required
                     to mitigate operational risks.
                     The EFT system by itself does not have any liquidity support mechanisms. EFT
                     being a RTGS system needs access to ample liquidity. As per the prevalent
                     policy framework only banks have access to liquidity support from the CBRT.
                     Due to this, currently only banks are allowed to participate in the EFT system.

                     Least restrictive access

                     The main criteria for participation to the systems are being a bank operating in
                     Turkey and meeting the operational requirements. The PFMIs allow for
                     specific exceptions related to central bank operated FMIs.

                     The applications of banks for participating in the systems are approved by the
                     CBRT Executive Committee, which takes the opinions of related the CBRT
                     departments into consideration. The applications are assessed by the HITI
                     Committee in the first place and the final decision is made by the Executive
                     Committee. The need for a change in participation criteria is reviewed in this
                     process.

                     The PTT bank (division of the Turkish Post) had applied for access and was
                     declined by the HITI committee for not having effective means of liquidity
                     management. The PTT bank offers some prepaid card and debit cards linked to
                     postal cheque accounts which is akin to a current account offering zero interest.
                     The PTT does have access to the BKM card switch.

                     Mellat Bank, an Iranian bank, was earlier denied access due to the US and other
                     international sanctions on Iranian banks. This bank has re-applied at the
                     beginning of 2016 after the lifting of sanctions and has now become a
                     participant as of April 8th, 2016.

                     Habib Bank, a Pakistani bank, had sought access only to the RPS system and
                     was denied access to the system.

                                  Disclosure of criteria

                                  System participation criteria are disclosed in the “Who can be a participant?”
                                  section of the CBRT Payment Systems Web Site 24. The PSOR, which contains
                                  detailed information on operational workflow for becoming a participant, is
                                  shared with participants through the CBRT Payment Systems User Group Web
                                  Site.
     Key consideration 3 An FMI should monitor compliance with its participation
                         requirements on an ongoing basis and have clearly defined and
                         publicly disclosed procedures for facilitating the suspension and
                         orderly exit of a participant that breaches, or no longer meets, the
                         participation requirements.
     Description         Monitoring compliance

                                  All participants of the EFT system are under the supervision of the BRSA,
                                  which monitors their continued compliance to applicable banking regulations.
                                  If the BRSA decides to terminate the banking license of a participant, the
                                  provisions of the PSOR article 7 and 8 can be invoked to manage the exit of
                                  the participant from the EFT system.
                                  The conformance of the participant to the operational requirements are assessed
                                  by the CBRT as part of the ongoing monitoring of the EFT system transaction
                                  flows.

                                  Suspension and orderly exit

                                  Suspension and orderly exit operations are performed in accordance with the
                                  PSOR. According to the PSOR, without prejudice to the Article 68 [penal
                                  provisions] of the CBRT Law, the CBRT can take measures of “warning”,
                                  “temporary suspension” and “permanent orderly exit” for a participant.

                                  Participants’ bank and branch codes in the CBRT Payment Systems are updated
                                  by add/remove operations when necessary. In the case of a suspension or
                                  orderly exit of a participant, all participants are informed through
                                  announcements made via e-mail group, and the participant list in
                                  http://eftemkt.tcmb.gov.tr is updated.
     Key Conclusions              Criteria and requirements for participation are clearly stated in the CBRT
                                  Payment Systems Rule Book and disclosed to related parties. Only banks and
                                  the MKK, which is a special participant of ESTS for the implementation of
                                  safekeeping of the securities in the name of customers, are accepted as
                                  participants in the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems. Only
                                  banks are participants in the EFT system.
                                  The policy decision on only allowing access to banks has been taken based on
                                  considerations of liquidity risk management.
                                  The CBRT does not allow access to specific components of the CBRT payment
                                  and securities settlement systems, all participants have access to the EFT, RPS
                                  and ESTS system. The MKK is the only exception.
                                  The CBRT monitors compliance to operational aspects of the participation
                                  criteria and is guided by the BRSA for the continued qualification of the

Principle 19. Tiered Participation Arrangements
An FMI should identify, monitor, and manage the material risks to the FMI arising from tiered
participation arrangements.
Key consideration 1     An FMI should ensure that its rules, procedures, and agreements
                        allow it to gather basic information about indirect participation in
                        order to identify, monitor, and manage any material risks to the
                        FMI arising from such tiered participation arrangements.
Description             Tiered participation arrangements, Risks to the FMI

                         According to the Article 5 of the PSOR, only banks that operate in Turkey and
                         the MKK can be a participant in the CBRT payment and securities settlement
                         systems. In the PSOR, there is no definition or arrangement for tiered
                         participation in the systems.

                         The intermediary institutions or payment institutions that cannot participate in
                         the systems can perform operation on the system via the facilities provided by
                         the system participants for their customers, but they are not considered as a
                         tiered participant.
                         There are however some arrangements which fall under the “tiered
                         participation” arrangement as defined in the PFMIs:
                              - Institutions like PTT Bank and Habib Bank access the EFT system
                                  through other direct participants.
                             -   The Takasbank operates the Takasbank Electronic Funds Transfer
                                 System (TETS), which is used by brokers to move their funds from
                                 their accounts held with Takasbank to other banks, using the EFT and
                                 RPS system. These transactions are structured to appear as a
                                 transactions from a special designated branch of Takasbank. The
                                 brokers are able to initiate the transaction themselves.
Key consideration 2      An FMI should identify material dependencies between direct and
                         indirect participants that might affect the FMI.
Description
                         As mentioned for the KC 1, the PSOR does not acknowledge tiered
                         arrangements and as such there is no monitoring of tiered participation
                         arrangements.

Key consideration 3      An FMI should identify indirect participants responsible for a
                         significant proportion of transactions processed by the FMI and



                                              100
                      indirect participants whose transaction volumes or values are large
                      relative to the capacity of the direct participants through which they
                      access the FMI in order to manage the risks arising from these
                      transactions.
Description
                      As mentioned for the KC 1, the PSOR does not acknowledge tiered
                      arrangements and as such there is no monitoring of tiered participation
                      arrangements.

                      The CBRT, in 2013, built in special fields in the messages to track the details
                      of the transaction initiator and other details. There is also an ongoing initiative
                      at the request of the Takasbank to introduce more analytical tools related to
                      these.

Key consideration 4   An FMI should regularly review risks arising from tiered
                      participation arrangements and should take mitigating action when
                      appropriate.
Description           As mentioned for the KC 1, the PSOR does not acknowledge tiered
                      arrangements and as such there is no monitoring of tiered participation
                      arrangements.
Key conclusions
                      The PSOR acknowledges and regulates only the direct participants in the
                      CBRT payment and securities settlement systems and there is no definition or
                      rules set for indirect participation. Entities that are not eligible for participation
                      can perform operations the participants, but are treated as customers of
                      participants, rather than indirect participants.

                      Based on the discussion in principle 18, it is clear that two banks and one entity
                      carrying out electronic payment services, are accessing the EFT system through
                      other banks. Other market intermediaries and non-bank financial entities also
                      access the services of the EFT and also likely other elements of the CBRT
                      payment and securities settlement systems.

                      The usage of TETS by brokers and other market intermediaries is also an
                      example of a tiered participation arrangement.

                      The CBRT has developed capability to track the details of the initiator,
                      recipient and purpose of transactions, based on specialized fields in the
                      message formats. These tools can be used to develop a comprehensive
                      monitoring framework for tiered participation arrangements.

Recommendations
and comments          The CBRT should consider instituting mechanisms to collect information,
                      about the non-bank financial companies that access the services of the EFT
                      through participants. Information like the terms of the service between the
                      participant and the non-bank financial entity, the typical transaction volume
                      and value, and any credit extension and liquidity facilities offered. The CBRT
                      should then assess any risks arising from these tiered arrangements.

Principle 21: Efficiency and effectiveness
An FMI should be efficient and effective in meeting the requirements of its participants and the
markets it serves.
Key consideration 1       An FMI should be designed to meet the needs of its participants
                          and the markets it serves, in particular, with regard to choice of a
                          clearing and settlement arrangement; operating structure; scope
                          of products cleared, settled, or recorded; and use of technology
                          and procedures.
Description               During the development and improvement of the CBRT Payment and
                           Securities Settlement Systems, the needs and the structure of the financial
                           system of Turkey have been taken into consideration.
                           Since the first generation EFT, which was one of the first examples in the
                           World of RTGS system when it went into operation in 1992, the CBRT
                           payment and securities settlement systems have been improved by taking
                           into consideration the country’s market needs, legal obligations,
                           requirements from the participants, worldwide developments in the payment
                           systems, needs arising from interoperability and interdependencies and
                           technological developments.
                           Accordingly, the CBRT cooperates with system participants, stakeholders,
                           authorities and other FMI’s and take their opinions and recommendations
                           into consideration when defining workflows, message contents and daily
                           operational procedures.
                           Permanent technical and operational working groups have been formed
                           within the BAT to improve cooperation with system participants.

                               Additionally, during the User Group Meetings the opinions of the
                               participants on system operations and possible enhancements are taken,
                               information on projects and studies are shared. Participants can also
                               communicate with the CBRT by forwarding questions and requests to the
                               CBRT Payment Systems Service Desk and can track progress of their
                               requests electronically.
                               Additionally, through questionnaires, official communications, one-to-one
                               or group meetings with participants and with other stakeholders feedbacks
                               and recommendations are collected. When developing new systems or
                               modules, specific working groups are formed with the participation of related
                               parties in order to ensure efficient participation in the development process.
                               National and international developments in finance and technology as well
                               as new standards, principles and legal obligations that may affect the CBRT
                               payment and securities settlement systems’ workflow, infrastructure,
                               technological design or operations are monitored, evaluated together with
                               stakeholders, and the systems are updated accordingly if necessary.
                               The systems have been restructured and improved during the period of 2011-
                               2013 with modern technologies and have become more flexible allowing
                               easier change management. The notable changes made in the 2011-2013
                               period include introduction of XML based message formats, enhancements
                               to the offsetting algorithms and introduction of the RPS and ESTS system.
Key consideration 2            An FMI should have clearly defined goals and objectives that are
                               measurable and achievable, such as in the areas of minimum
                               service levels, risk-management expectations, and business
                               priorities.
Description                    The CBRT’s main goals and objectives in payment and securities settlement
                               systems is to “ensure safe, efficient, effective and continuous operation of the
                               systems.” These goals and objectives are vital for financial stability and
                               effective implementation of monetary policy. The fundamental policy and
                               activities of the CBRT is disclosed to public through the CBRT web site 25.
                               The CBRT Payment and Securities Settlement System forms the backbone
                               of Turkish NPS, and hence the continuity of the systems is critical. For this
                               reason, business continuity and disaster recovery plans have been developed
                               to ensure the continuity of systems.
                               Service levels of the systems for the settlement have been defined clearly and
                               shared with participants. The design documentation of the systems states that
                               a settlement will be completed in 60 seconds in EFT and ESTS, and in 15
                               minutes for RPS, provided that the sender has sufficient balance in the
                               settlement account. Daily performance statistics are available in the CBRT
                               Payment Systems User Group web site.
                               The definitions regarding the CBRT services, priorities, response and
                               solution times are defined in the CBRT Payment Systems Service
                               Management Document, which is shared with participants. System incidents,
                               change requests from participants and their progress are tracked
                               electronically in Service Management System. Data and information in this
                               system is regularly analysed and reported to the management; and necessary
                               action plans are formed when needed. User satisfaction questionnaires are
                               sent to participants through the Service Management System following the
                               closure of an incident/service record in order to measure the efficiency and

                          performance in reaching the goals.
                          Risks in the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems are managed
                          within the CBRT Payment Systems Risk Management Framework. The risk

                          reported periodically and assessed in the context of risk management goals.
                          Additionally, performance goals and performance indicators are identified,
                          assessed and reported to the Board within the annual Performance Programs
                          and Performance Reports of the CBRT Payment System Department.
Key consideration 3       An FMI should have established mechanisms for the regular
                          review of its efficiency and effectiveness.
Description               The CBRT organizes regular meetings with participants to assess the
                          efficiency and effectiveness of the CBRT payment and securities settlement
                          systems. When needed, these meetings are supported with questionnaires,
                          sub-group meetings and correspondence. Additionally, all requests, incidents
                          and problem solving steps are recorded and reported regularly for the
                          services provided.
                          The Risk Management Framework is used as an important tool for
                          effectiveness along with the governance model involving participants and
                          the CBRT departments.
                          All activities of the systems are subject to internal oversight in the context of
                          efficiency and effectiveness.
                          The CBRT Activity Based Cost Accounting regularly tracks payment
                          systems costs, as with all other costs of the CBRT.
                          The pricing policy of the CBRT Payment Systems has been defined and
                          disclosed to the public as “Messages in EFT and ESTS are subject to pricing
                          in order to cover the investment and operating costs of systems’ hardware
                          and software.”
Key conclusions           Objectives and goals of the CBRT Regarding payment and securities
                          settlement Systems are clearly defined and disclosed to the public on the
                          CBRT’s web site.
                          There are effective mechanisms in place for the participants to express the
                          views and provide feedback on the functioning of the EFT system.
                          The service satisfaction and performance of the system is tracked and
                          reported to senior management. The pricing policy is clear and transparent
                          and the fees are communicated to participants in an easily accessible manner.
                          The CBRT also monitors the operational costs of the CBRT payment and
                          securities settlement systems on an ongoing basis as part of the “activity
                          based cost” accounting process.

Principle 22: Communication procedures and standards
An FMI should use, or at a minimum accommodate, relevant internationally accepted
communication procedures and standards in order to facilitate efficient payment, clearing,
settlement, and recording.
Key consideration 1      An FMI should use, or at a minimum accommodate,
                         internationally accepted communication procedures and
                         standards.
Description              Communication procedures

                         The message exchange between the participants and the CBRT payment
                         and securities settlement system is established via secure services and
                         using XML based proprietary message formats. The CBRT payment and
                         securities settlement systems communicate through a closed private
                         network and provides services only within the country. The CBRT
                         payment and securities settlement systems do not have international
                         operations.
                         Participants access the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems
                         via a single interface – the PIS. The CBRT’s enterprise information
                         platform provides easy integration with applications of the participants.
                         The participants have access to features in the PIS which can be used to
                         have a full Straight Through Processing (STP) processing of transactions.
                         Many participants access the EFT system and other elements of the CBRT
                         payment and securities settlement system in STP mode.

                         Communication standards

                         During the restructuring of the CBRT Payment and Securities Settlement
                         System, the CBRT considered using the ISO 20022 format, based on
                         feedback from participants it was decided to use XML based proprietary
                         message formats.
                         At present, it is easy to add new messages and develop the current messages
                         according to needs. As the message format uses XML, conversion to the
                         other messaging formats is also easy.
                         The systems use International Banking Account Number (IBAN) for
                         account numbers, and International Securities Identification Number
                         (ISIN) for securities codes.
                         Participants are defined by the four digit codes assigned by the CBRT.
                         Conversion of these codes to BIC codes used in SWIFT is straightforward.
Key conclusions          Message exchange of the CBRT Payment Systems is managed via secure
                         services using industry standard technologies and using XML based
                         proprietary message formats. It is possible to easily convert XML messages
                         used in the CBRT payment and securities settlement systems into other
                         message formats.
                         The PIS used to interface with the CBRT payment and securities settlement
                         systems offers adequate tools to allow STP mode.

                      The FMI should provide clear descriptions of priced services for
                      comparability purposes.
Description
                      Pricing tariff of the CBRT Payment Systems is determined on a yearly basis
                      in accordance with the pricing policy and announced to participants at least
                      one month before its entry into force. Pricing policy is disclosed to the public
                      from the CBRT Payment Systems web site.
                      The tariff structure specifies prices for the services of systems for each
                      operation type (message fees, archive information requests, etc.) in a detailed
                      and clear form. Message pricing does not contain any discount rates other than
                      exceptions applied to some CBRT operations that are defined by related laws
                      and regulations. On the other side, operations performed after official closing
                      time of the system are subject to a penal tariff and rules to be applies on this
                      case is also stated clearly in the tariff.


Key consideration 5   An FMI should complete regularly and disclose publicly responses
                      to the CPSS-IOSCO disclosure framework for financial market
                      infrastructures. An FMI also should, at a minimum, disclose basic
                      data on transaction volumes and values.
Description           The CBRT has already completed the self-assessment of the CBRT payment
                      and securities settlement system. This self-assessment formed the basis of this
                      present assessment. The results of assessment of the CBRT’s Payment
                      Systems against PFMI is intended to be disclosed to public in line with the
                      PFMI Disclosure Framework in due course.
                      The volume and value of payments settled in the CBRT Payment Systems are
                      annually disclosed on the CBRT Payment Systems web site and updated
                      regularly. In addition, Electronica Data Distribution System (EDDS) provides
                      options for querying daily total values, average volume and amount data as
                      graphs, tables or in a mode suitable for computerized processing.
                      Additionally, on the CBRT Payment Systems User Group web site, which is
                      only accessible to participants, participants can query data on the basis of
                      participant or operations within a time period.
                      Working principles, history and the interconnections of the system are
                      accessible through the CBRT Payment Systems web site. The web site also
                      contains useful knowledge such as legal basis of payment systems in Turkey
                      (PSL), the importance of the payment systems and particularly their effect on
                      the financial stability, goals and policies, information on the PFMI, central
                      banks’ role in the payment systems, payment systems in Turkey, international
                      cooperation and information on international payments.
                      The CBRT Payment Systems web site and the CBRT web site have both
                      Turkish and English versions.
Key conclusions       Rules and procedures for the CBRT Payment Systems are defined clearly and
                      shared with participants. System descriptions, system rules, general structure
                      and workflows, summary statistics and pricing policy are disclosed to the
                      public through the CBRT web page and the CBRT Payment Systems User
                      Group web site.
                      Pricing tariff is defined yearly based on pricing policy and disclosed to

Principle 1: Legal basis
An FMI should have a well-founded, clear, transparent, and enforceable legal basis for each
material aspect of its activities in all relevant jurisdictions.
Key consideration 1 The legal basis should provide a high degree of certainty for each
                          material aspect of an FMI’s activities in all relevant jurisdictions.
                          Material aspects and relevant jurisdictions

                       The ESTS system is operated by the CBRT and functions as a CSD-cum-SSS for
                       government securities and CBRT bills. All the system participants except the
                       MKK, are banks licensed for operations in Turkey by the BRSA and fully subject
                       to the laws of Turkey, including for its participation in the ESTS system. The
                       MKK is regulated by the CMB and it was established in accordance with the
                       provisions of the CML (Article 81).

                       The ESTS is an integral part of the CBRT payment and securities settlement
                       system and is closely integrated with the EFT system.

                       The ESTS system is used to record the ownership of Government securities of
                       the banks held with the CBRT. The retail investor and other non-bank
                       institutional investors can buy the securities in the secondary market and their
                       holdings are recorded in the MKK and the consolidated holdings are reflected as
                       a combined holding of the MKK.

                       In this arrangement the ESTS effectively functions as the issuer CSD and the
                       MKK, the investor CSD.

                       The Takasbank which functions as the SSS for the Government securities traded
                       in the BIST, also holds sub-accounts of the banks and other investors. There is
                       one consolidated omnibus account of the Takasbank with the ESTS and the sub-
                       accounts are in the books of the Takasbank. The banks can move securities in
                       their ESTS account to Takasbank either for collateral or for participation in the
                       BIST or Takasbank money markets. The banks can also move their holdings to
                       their accounts in MKK or as part of a sale to their customers account in MKK.

                       The ESTS system by itself does not offer any liquidity support, however all
                       participants except the MKK, can avail the liquidity support from the CBRT and
                       through the inter-bank money markets. This is availed through the EFT system.

                       The liquidity support facilities offered by the CBRT are all collateralized. The
                       accepted collaterals are Turkish government securities, central bank bills and
                       foreign collaterals – Eurobonds and sukuk securities. The liquidity support are:
                       intra-day credit, overnight credit; 1-week repos; and, under the LOLR facilities.

                       The inter-bank money markets are also collateralized and accepted collaterals
                       include the once used for the CBRT liquidity support and in addition foreign
                       currency and gold.




                                              112
The material aspects for the ESTS system faces the material risks described in
the KC 1.1 of the EFT assessment. In addition the ESTS has the following
additional material risk:
•       Dematerialization
•       Protection of customer assets

Legal basis for each material aspect

The legal basis for the material risks common to the EFT and ESTS are the same
and are described in the KC 1.1. Here only the legal basis for dematerialization
is covered.

Dematerialization

The Article 6 of the Public Finance and Debt Management Act, empowers the
undersecretary of the treasury to conclude with the CBRT, the means and process
for dematerialization and re-materialization of public debt securities. There was
accordingly a decision by the Undersecretary on the 2nd November 2012, post
which all government securities are dematerialized. The article 3 (p) of the CML
explicitly defines the MKK as the agency created to dematerialized “capital
market securities”. The definition of “capital market securities” in 3 article 3(p)
encompasses government securities. This is further elaborated in the article 13 of
the CML and further in the “Communique on principles and procedures for book
keeping of dematerialized capital market instruments” issued by the CML.


Protection of customer assets

In the CML, the definition of capital market instruments (article 3) covers
government securities. However article 136 of the CML, exempts the
ESTS from the purview of the CML. Hence the communique of the CML
related to CSDs also does not apply to the ESTS. The protection of
customer assets held with the ESTS as a CSD or a participant in the ESTS,
in the event of any impact to the operator or a participant, is not covered
in the PSOR or any other legal measure covering the ESTS. However,
articles in CML pertaining to segregation of assets of investors in investor
firms (article 46, subarticles 5 and 6) appears to be applicable to
Takasbank. Investor firms as defined in article 3(v) of the CML and
investment services as defined in article 37 (g and g^) encompass the
activities of Takasbank as a SSS. With respect to the holdings of banks in
the CBRT, as a central bank, this is not necessarily a concern. However,
for the securities held in the books of the Takasbank in the name of the
institutional investors and banks, this results in there being ambiguity
about explicit legal protection for the protection of their assets.

The protection of participant’s collateral from insolvency of an FMI or the
particular counterparty however is covered through the relevant provisions
related to protection of collateral in the PSL and also the CML. Further the
CMB regulations pertaining to repo and reverse repo classify the securities
used for repo and reverse repo as collateral lodged with the lender.




                        113
Key consideration 2   An FMI should have rules, procedures, and contracts that are clear,
                      understandable, and consistent with relevant laws and regulations.
Description           The PSOR constitutes the rules and procedures of the ESTS system. The PSOR
                      and detailed description of the process and technical aspects are presented as
                      annexes to the participation contract signed by all participants. As noted earlier
                      the article 3 of the participation contract makes the annexes an integral part of the
                      contract.
                      Copies of the participation contract and the PSOR are delivered to the participants
                      at their application. The CBRT has the authority to make additional regulations
                      on operational details (PSOR, Art 13).
                      As per the internal procedures of the CBRT, the CBRT Executive Committee
                      approves changes to the Rule Book. All changes are announced to all participants
                      in advance.

                      The Article 3 of the PSOR lays out the legal basis for the PSOR as deriving from
                      article 4 of the CBRT law and article 4 and 7 of the PSL. The PSOR provisions
                      are consistent with these provisions and further are consistent with the Article 7
                      of the ROPSS. This consistency is also assessed through the payment systems
                      oversight activities of the CBRT.
Key consideration 3   An FMI should be able to articulate the legal basis for its activities to
                      relevant authorities, participants, and, where relevant, participants’
                      customers, in a clear and understandable way.
Description
                      The Article 3 of the PSOR lays out the legal basis for the PSOR as deriving from
                      article 4 of the CBRT law and article 4 and 7 of the PSL.

Key consideration 4   An FMI should have rules, procedures, and contracts that are
                      enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. There should be a high degree
                      of certainty that actions taken by the FMI under such rules and
                      procedures will not be voided, reversed, or subject to stays.
Description           Enforceability of rules, procedures and contracts

                      Same as in the KC 1.4 for the EFT system.


                      Degree of certainty for rules and procedures

                      Same as in the KC 1.4 for the EFT system.

Key consideration 5   An FMI conducting business in multiple jurisdictions should identify
                      and mitigate the risks arising from any potential conflict of laws
                      across jurisdictions.
Description
                      All the participants in the ESTS system are subject to Turkish laws and
                      regulations.

Key conclusions       The ESTS functions as the CSD-cum-SSS for Government securities and CBRT
                      bills. The MKK is the investor CSD for government securities for non-bank
                      institutional and retail investors.




                                              114
                   The legal basis for the ESTS comprises the CBRT law, the PSL and specific
                   regulations pertaining to operations and oversight. CBRT as the operator the PSL
                   has developed detailed operating and procedures – the PSOR. The participants
                   are required to sign a participation contract which binds them to the PSOR. The
                   participation contract and the PSOR have a sound legal basis. All material legal
                   aspects are adequately covered in the PSL and the CBRT law. All participants of
                   the EFT system are subject to Turkish laws and regulations; and all operations
                   are also performed in Turkey.

                   The legal basis for Dematerialization is covered using a combination of the Public
                   Debit Management Law, the CML and the communique on dematerialization
                   issued by the CML.

                   The PSOR and participation contract and other related contractual aspects are
                   vetted by the CBRT legal department and by the executive committee.

                   The legal protection for the securities and assets of the investors held in the books
                   of Takasbank, is covered as part of provisions in the CML pertaining to
                   investment firms and services.
Assessment of      Observed
Principle 1
Recommendations
and                The CBRT should review the legal and regulatory framework for the protection
comments           of customer assets held by Takasbank, including perhaps seeking external
                   opinion and implement specific amendments or additional measures to address
                   any gaps if identified.

                   In case it is determined that there is indeed a legal gap, the CBRT in co-ordination
                   with the CMB could collectively consider the following options:

                   - Takasbank could be licensed as a CSD (it already holds a license as a SSS, a
                   limited purpose bank and a CCP), in which the measures related to protection of
                   customer assets in MKK would become applicable for Takasbank as well;
                   - Classify Takasbank as a participant with underlying participants (institutional
                   investors) being termed as “indirect participants” in a sort of tiering arrangement
                   or perhaps as a custodian; and further having separate accounts of Takasbank in
                   the ESTS – one for its proprietary holdings and another for its holdings as a SSS;
                   - Divesting Takasbank of this role and transferring all such customer accounts-
                   specifically institutional investor accounts to MKK (which in any case is already
                   performing this function), with holdings of banks continuing to be reflected in
                   ESTS; or
                   - Specifically amending the relevant statutes to effect protection to customer
                   assets in case of bankruptcy of Takasbank.

Principle 2: Governance
An FMI should have governance arrangements that are clear and transparent, promote the safety
and efficiency of the FMI, and support the stability of the broader financial system, other relevant
public interest considerations, and the objectives of relevant stakeholders.
Key consideration 1 An FMI should have objectives that place a high priority on the safety
                         and efficiency of the FMI and explicitly support financial stability and
                         other relevant public interest considerations
Description              The ESTS is an integral part of the CBRT payment and securities settlement
                        systems and the governance arrangements for the ESTS system are the same as
                        for the EFT system, as described in the EFT assessment.

Key consideration 2     An FMI should have documented governance arrangements that
                        provide clear and direct lines of responsibility and accountability.
                        These arrangements should be disclosed to owners, relevant
                        authorities, participants, and, at a more general level, the public.

                        .

Key consideration 3     The roles and responsibilities of an FMI’s board of directors (or
                        equivalent) should be clearly specified, and there should be
                        documented procedures for its functioning, including procedures to
                        identify, address, and manage member conflicts of interest. The board
                        should review both its overall performance and the performance of its
                        individual board members regularly.

                        for the EFT system, as described in the EFT assessment.
Key consideration 4     The board should contain suitable members with the appropriate
                        skills and incentives to fulfill its multiple roles. This typically requires
                        the inclusion of non-executive board member(s).

 Key conclusions                   This principle is assessed taking into account the considerations for FMIs
                                   operated by central banks as stated both in the PFMIs and in Application of the
                                   Principles for financial market infrastructures to central bank FMIs. 27
                                   The objectives and policies of the CBRT regarding Payment and Securities
                                   Settlement Systems place a high priority on stability, safety and efficiency. The
                                   CBRT has a documented governance arrangements for the institution as a whole
                                   that define clear and direct lines of responsibility and accountability. The same
                                   governance framework has been applied for the EFT system as well, as a core
                                   responsibility of the PSD.

                                   There is a risk management framework for the CBRT operated payment systems.
                                   There is an existing process of auditing departmental risk management
                                   framework, however the PSD’s risk management framework has not been
                                   audited yet.

                                   Mechanisms exist for involving stakeholders in decision-making process, and the
                                   CBRT effectively communicates with the stakeholders through different
                                   channels.

              range of risks that arise in or are borne by the FMI. Risk-management
              frameworks should be subject to periodic review.
Description   Risks that arise in or are borne by the FMI

              The ESTS functions as a CSD-cum-SSS for government securities and
              CBRT securities holdings of banks held with the CBRT. The ESTS settles
              in DVP mode, using DVP model 1 for both the primary market and
              secondary market transactions. The funds leg are settled in the EFT system.
              The liquidity support for the EFT system is external to the EFT system and
              seen as part of the monetary policy instruments of the CBRT. For the
              purposes of this principle, the risks associated with the intra-day liquidity
              support provision of the CBRT are also being considered.

              The ESTS has a link with the MKK. The ESTS functions as the issuer CSD
              and the MKK as the investor CSD. The link is used by banks for moving
              their securities holdings to the MKK for use in the inter-bank money
              markets and secondary market trades or for transferring securities to their
              customers account in the MKK. In general, however the participants move
              their securities to Takasbank’s account in the ESTS for participation in the
              secondary market.

              The risks that the ESTS system is exposed to and could pose to its
              participants and other FMIs are, the same as that of the EFT system:
                     •       Legal Risk
                     •       Credit Risk
                     •       Liquidity Risk
                     •       Operational Risk
                     •       Custody and Investment Risk

              In addition, the risks arising from the ESTS - MKK and also the ESTS-
              Takasbank link also needs to be considered.

              The ESTS as a CSD-cum-SSS is critical to contain and limit systemic risk.
              As the ESTS is owned and operated by the CBRT, the general business
              risks are not considered as a material risk.

                    recovery or orderly wind-down. An FMI should prepare appropriate
                    plans for its recovery or orderly wind-down based on the results of that
                    assessment. Where applicable, an FMI should also provide relevant
                    authorities with the information needed for purposes of resolution
                    planning.

                      Recovery or orderly wind-down plans

                      The ESTS is owned and operated by the CBRT, given this the recovery and
                      wind-down plans are not applicable, as noted in the PFMIs and the CPMI-
                      IOSCO publication on application of PFMIs to central bank operated FMIs.


Key conclusions       The PSD has developed a risk management framework based on the ISO
                      31000 framework. The risk management framework covers the specific



                                              120
                  risks outlined in the PFMIs. The framework is reviewed annually and is
                  also subject to audit by the CBRT audit committee.

                  The PSOR provides adequate powers to the CBRT to ensure conformance
                  to the operating and security procedures outlined in the PSOR.

                  The PSD has mechanisms in place for measuring and monitoring specific
                  aspects of liquidity risk and operational reliability of the EFT system.

                  The risk management framework is however internally focused and does
                  not explicitly take into account the dependencies on other FMIs and also
                  internal systems of the CBRT. In particular, the operations of the EFT
                  system has a heavy dependence on the Takasbank and the CBRT markets
                  department. Takasbank is the SSS for the inter-bank markets which is a
                  major source of the liquidity used in the EFT system. The Markets
                  Department is the decision maker on the provision of the CBRT liquidity
                  support facilities and also has its own systems and processes.

                  This risk however is to an extent mitigated as the Takasbank and other FMIs
                  are subject to the oversight of the CBRT and the Markets department also
                  has its own risk management framework.

                  The ESTS has a link, as the issuer CSD with the MKK which acts as the
                  investor CSD. The risks posed by ESTS to the MKK needs to be taken into
                  account in the risk management framework.

                  In addition, there is also a link between the ESTS and Takasbank arising
                  from the way the securities transfers related to the money market and
                  secondary market transactions on Government securities are structured.
                  The risks arising from this link also need to be considered.

Principle 4. Credit risk
An FMI should effectively measure, monitor, and manage its credit exposure to participants
and those arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes. An FMI should maintain
sufficient financial resources to cover its credit exposure to each participant fully with a high
degree of confidence. In addition, a CCP that is involved in activities with a more-complex risk
profile or that is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions should maintain additional
financial resources sufficient to cover a wide range of potential stress scenarios that should
include, but not be limited to, the default of the two largest participants and their affiliates that
would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposures to the CCP in extreme but
plausible market conditions. All other CCPs should maintain, at a minimum, total financial
resources sufficient to cover the default of the one participant and its affiliates that would
potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposures to the CCP in extreme but plausible
market conditions.

                           An FMI should establish a robust framework to manage its credit
                           exposures to its participants and the credit risks arising from its
                           payment, clearing, and settlement processes. Credit exposure
                           may arise from current exposures, potential future exposures, or
                           both.
Description                The ESTS functions as a CSD-cum-SSS. The EFT system is used for
                           the funds leg of the settlement. The EFT system functions as a RTGS
                           system. Participants can seek liquidity support from the CBRT,
                           subject to an overall “borrowing limit” against collaterals and from
                           the inter-bank money markets, Takasbank cash credit facility and
                           using pre-arranged credit lines with other participants.

                           The ESTS system settles securities settlement in DVP mode using
                           DVP model 1. The only scope of credit risk comes from the credit
                           risk associated with the liquidity provision in the EFT system for the
                           funds settlement leg.

                           The credit risk management framework for the ESTS with respect to
                           the risk related to liquidity provision is the same as for the EFT
                           system, as described in this principle for the EFT system.

Key consideration 2        An FMI should identify sources of credit risk, routinely measure
                           and monitor credit exposures, and use appropriate risk-
                           management tools to control these risks.

                      A CCP should determine the amount and regularly test the
                      sufficiency of its total financial resources available in the event of
                      a default or multiple defaults in extreme but plausible market
                      conditions through rigorous stress testing. A CCP should have
                      clear procedures to report the results of its stress tests to
                      appropriate decision makers at the CCP and to use these results
                      to evaluate the adequacy of and adjust its total financial
                      resources. Stress tests should be performed daily using standard
                      and predetermined parameters and assumptions. On at least a
                      monthly basis, a CCP should perform a comprehensive and
                      thorough analysis of stress testing scenarios, models, and
                      underlying parameters and assumptions used to ensure they are
                      appropriate for determining the CCP’s required level of default
                      protection in light of current and evolving market conditions. A
                      CCP should perform this analysis of stress testing more
                      frequently when the products cleared or markets served display
                      high volatility, become less liquid, or when the size or
                      concentration of positions held by a CCP’s participants increases
                      significantly. A full validation of a CCP’s risk-management
                      model should be performed at least annually.

                      In conducting stress testing, a CCP should consider the effect of
                      a wide range of relevant stress scenarios in terms of both
                      defaulters’ positions and possible price changes in liquidation
                      periods. Scenarios should include relevant peak historic price
                      volatilities, shifts in other market factors such as price
                      determinants and yield curves, multiple defaults over various
                      time horizons, simultaneous pressures in funding and asset

                      An FMI should establish explicit rules and procedures that
                      address fully any credit losses it may face as a result of any
                      individual or combined default among its participants with
                      respect to any of their obligations to the FMI. These rules and
                      procedures should address how potentially uncovered credit
                      losses would be allocated, including the repayment of any funds
                      an FMI may borrow from liquidity providers. These rules and
                      procedures should also indicate the FMI’s process to replenish
                      any financial resources that the FMI may employ during a stress
                      event, so that the FMI can continue to operate in a safe and sound

Key conclusions          The ESTS uses the EFT system for the settlement of the funds leg.
                         The credit risk in the EFT stems from the CBRT liquidity support
                         operations to the participants. The liquidity support operations are
                         not integrated into the EFT system and as such are handled by the
                         markets department. The credit risk is considered as part of the EFT
                         risk management framework, but the full treatment of the credit risk
                         from liquidity support operations is in the domain of the markets
                         department.

                         The markets department’s credit risk management framework
                         includes instituting overall borrowing limits, requiring all credit
                         facilities to be collateralized with good quality securities, and
                         applying haircuts. The collaterals are re-valued daily and the CBRT
                         has the rights to ask for additional collateral when there is an adverse
                         movement.

 Principle 5. Collateral
 An FMI that requires collateral to manage its or its participants’ credit exposure should
 accept collateral with low credit, liquidity, and market risks. An FMI should also set and
 enforce appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits.
 Key consideration        An FMI should generally limit the assets it (routinely) accepts as
 1                        collateral to those with low credit, liquidity, and market risks.
 Description              The ESTS is a CSD-cum-SSS. The ESTS uses the EFT system for
                          the settlement of funds leg in DVP mode using DVP model 1.
                          The collateral management framework for the ESTS is the same as
                          for the EFT system, as described in this principle for EFT system.

 Key consideration      An FMI should establish prudent valuation practices and
 2                      develop haircuts that are regularly tested and take into account
                        stressed market conditions.

Key consideration   In order to reduce the need for pro-cyclical adjustments, an
3                   FMI should establish stable and conservative haircuts that are
                    calibrated to include periods of stressed market conditions, to
                    the extent practicable and prudent.
Description         The collateral management framework for the ESTS is the same as
                    for the EFT system, as described in this principle for EFT system.

Key consideration   An FMI should avoid concentrated holdings of certain assets
4                   where this would significantly impair the ability to liquidate such
                    assets quickly without significant adverse price effects.
Description         The collateral management framework for the ESTS is the same as
                    for the EFT system, as described in this principle for EFT system.

Key consideration   An FMI that accepts cross-border collateral should mitigate the
5                   risks associated with its use and ensure that the collateral can be
                    used in a timely manner.
Description         The collateral management framework for the ESTS is the same as
                    for the EFT system, as described in this principle for EFT system.


Key consideration   An FMI should use a collateral management system that is well-
6                   designed and operationally flexible.
Description         Collateral management system design

                    The collateral management framework for the ESTS is the same as
                    for the EFT system, as described in this principle for EFT system

                    The collateral management framework for the ESTS is the same as
                    for the EFT system, as described in this principle for EFT system.

Key conclusions     The ESTS functions as a CSD-cum-SSS and uses the EFT system for
                    the settlement of the funds leg in DVP mode, using DVP model 1.

                    The collateral management system and processes are external to the
                    EFT and ESTS system and are managed by the CBRT markets
                    department. The extension of liquidity support is considered a
                    monetary policy instrument. The choice of securities, haircut rates,
                    valuation practices and operational arrangements are an integral part
                    of the CBRT monetary policy operations. The collateral is managed
                    in the ESTS system and in some sense it plays parts of the role of a
                    collateral management system.

                    The CBRT maintains a list of eligible securities and their haircut
                    rates. The haircut rates depend on the securities, participant and

Principle 6. Margin
A CCP should cover its exposure to its participants for all products through an effective
margin system that is risk-based and regularly reviewed.
Key consideration       A CCP should have a margin system that establishes margin
1                       levels commensurate with the risks and particular attributes of
                        each product, portfolio, and market it serves.

Key consideration     A CCP should have a reliable source of timely price data for its
2                     margin system. A CCP should also have procedures and sound
                      valuation models for addressing circumstances in which pricing
                      data are not readily available or reliable.

                      applicable.

Key consideration     A CCP should adopt initial margin models and parameters that
3                     are risk-based and generate margin requirements sufficient to
                      cover its potential future exposure to participants in the interval



                                             128
                    between the last margin collection and the close out of positions
                    following a participant default. Initial margin should meet an
                    established single-tailed confidence level of at least 99 percent
                    with respect to the estimated distribution of future exposure. For
                    a CCP that calculates margin at the portfolio level, this
                    requirement applies to each portfolio’s distribution of future
                    exposure. For a CCP that calculates margin at more-granular
                    levels, such as at the sub-portfolio level or by product, the
                    requirement must be met for the corresponding distributions of
                    future exposure. The model should (a) use a conservative
                    estimate of the time horizons for the effective hedging or close
                    out of the particular types of products cleared by the CCP
                    (including in stressed market conditions), (b) have an
                    appropriate method for measuring credit exposure that accounts
                    for relevant product risk factors and portfolio effects across
                    products, and (c) to the extent practicable and prudent, limit the
                    need for destabilising, procyclical changes.

Key consideration   A CCP should mark participant positions to market and collect
4                   variation margin at least daily to limit the build-up of current
                    exposures. A CCP should have the authority and operational
                    capacity to make intraday margin calls and payments, both
                    scheduled and unscheduled, to participants.

                    The ESTS is a CSD-cum-SSS and this KC and principle are not
                    applicable.

Key consideration   In calculating margin requirements, a CCP may allow offsets or
5                   reductions in required margin across products that it clears or
                    between products that it and another CCP clear, if the risk of one
                    product is significantly and reliably correlated with the risk of
                    the other product. Where two or more CCPs are authorised to
                    offer cross-margining, they must have appropriate safeguards
                    and harmonised overall risk-management systems.

Key consideration   A CCP should analyse and monitor its model performance and
6                   overall margin coverage by conducting rigorous daily
                    backtesting – and at least monthly, and more-frequent where
                    appropriate, sensitivity analysis. A CCP should regularly
                    conduct an assessment of the theoretical and empirical
                    properties of its margin model for all products it clears. In
                    conducting sensitivity analysis of the model’s coverage, a CCP
                    should take into account a wide range of parameters and
                    assumptions that reflect possible market conditions, including
                    the most-volatile periods that have been experienced by the
                    markets it serves and extreme changes in the correlations

Principle 7: Liquidity risk
An FMI should effectively measure, monitor, and manage its liquidity risk. An FMI should
maintain sufficient liquid resources in all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where
appropriate, intraday and multiday settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of
confidence under a wide range of potential stress scenarios that should include, but not be limited
to, the default of the participant and its affiliates that would generate the largest aggregate
liquidity obligation for the FMI in extreme but plausible market conditions.

                      For the purpose of meeting its minimum liquid resource

                      currency include cash at the central bank of issue and at
                      creditworthy commercial banks, committed lines of credit,

                      An FMI may supplement its qualifying liquid resources with other
                      forms of liquid resources. If the FMI does so, then these liquid
                      resources should be in the form of assets that are likely to be
                      saleable or acceptable as collateral for lines of credit, swaps, or

                      Even if an FMI does not have access to routine central bank credit,
                      it should still take account of what collateral is typically accepted
                      by the relevant central bank, as such assets may be more likely to
                      be liquid in stressed circumstances. An FMI should not assume the

Key Conclusions   The ESTS system uses the EFT system for the settlement of the funds
                  leg in DVP mode, using DVP model 1.

                  The EFT system is structured as a RTGS system. Unsettled transactions
                  are cancelled at the end of the day.

                  The CBRT as the operator of the EFT system, by itself is not
                  constrained in TRY liquidity. However the participants could face
                  liquidity shortages. The participants have access to liquidity support
                  from the CBRT and the inter-bank money markets. These liquidity
                  options are collateralized and in the case of the CBRT liquidity support
                  there is an overall borrowing limit for the participant.


                  There is a marked trend of settlements being bunched closer to the end
                  of the day, with over 60% of the transactions settling post 2 PM and
                  35% post 4 PM.

Assessment of     Broadly Observed.
Principle 7
Recommendations   The risk management framework of the EFT system could consider
and comments      daily and periodic analysis of the liquidity risk jointly by the PSD and
                  Markets departments of the CBRT. There could be additional
                  indicators like estimate of participants available both from the CBRT
                  and also the inter-bank money markets. This could build on the
                  framework being established by the BRSA on liquidity risk.

                  The CBRT could consider encouraging earlier settlements in the inter-
                  bank money markets to allow for more liquidity to flow into the EFT
                  system earlier.

                  The CBRT as part of the ongoing review of its current policy on
                  liquidity risk, analyze and implement suitable options to make intra-
                  day liquidity support by the CBRT more attractive to the participants
                  and implement suitable options.

                       The CBRT could evaluate if pricing policies could incentivize earlier
                       settlement perhaps as part of overall throughput guidelines and
                       accordingly implement them.

                       The CBRT has an existing practice of not assigning priorities and
                       leaving it to the participants in view of the practice of closely monitor
                       their liquidity. However in view of the liquidity risks being
                       externalized by the buyer side, the CBRT could evaluate in co-
                       ordination with participants the automatic assigning of the highest
                       queue priority for the DVP settlements emanating from the ESTS
                       system.

Principle 8: Settlement finality
An FMI should provide clear and certain final settlement, at a minimum by the end of the value
date. Where necessary or preferable, an FMI should provide final settlement intraday or in real
time
Key consideration 1       An FMI’s rules and procedures should clearly define the point
                          at which settlement is final.
Description               Point of settlement finality

                           The Article 10 of the PSL establishes settlement finality and irrevocability
                           for systems designated by the CBRT (Art 11). The CBRT has designated
                           the EFT, RPS and the ESTS in the official gazette and accordingly the
                           provisions of article 10 of the PSL covers the EFT system.
                           Article 10(1) of the PSL uses the term “transfer order”, requires the point
                           of time when a transaction become irrevocable, the time of entry and time
                           when a settlement of a transfer order is final, to be defined in the operating
                           rules of the system. Article 10(3) of the PSL further elaborates that any
                           decisions taken under any other law regarding any transaction orders would
                           be valid only for transactions that enter the system after the system operator
                           has been notified. Article 10 (4) of the PSL covers systems using netting
                           process and makes the provisions of article 10 (3) allow transaction orders
                           that entered the system before the system operator was notified of any legal
                           decision, to be included in the netting process.

                           The PSOR has defined irrevocability as the time when the settlement
                           accounts have been debited or credited (art 8) and this is also considered
                           the time when the settlement is final. Article 7(3) of the PSOR further
                           defines that the “server time” recorded in relevant timestamps as the time
                           that will be used for recording time of entry, irrevocability and finality.

                           The term “transfer order” as defined in the PSL encompasses securities
                           transfer and hence the provisions also apply to the DVP settlements
                           involving the securities settlements in the EFT system. The Article 9.1.b of
                           the PSOR specifies that under DVP settlement the securities transfer and




                                               137
                      the funds transfer for a securities settlement transaction would be carried
                      out simultaneously.

                      The PSL is available on the CBRT website and also in gazette. The PSOR
                      is available to the participants and also as part of the application process to
                      become a participant.

                      Finality in the case of links

                      As noted earlier, the ESTS has a link with the MKK system. This link is
                      used to transfer the securities holdings of banks in the ESTS system to the
                      MKK system and vice-versa. The CBRT has developed a mechanism for
                      using this link for sale of securities belonging to a bank in the secondary
                      market, however the reverse is not allowed.

                      The MKK has an account in the ESTS to record the consolidated holdings
                      of all its participants and their customers. A transfer of securities by a bank
                      from its holding in the ESTS to MKK and vice-versa, is processed as a
                      free-of-payment transfer in the ESTS. The reflections of the transfers in the
                      MKK system is based on a message flow from and to the ESTS system.

                      For a sale of securities holdings of a bank to another participant in the inter-
                      bank money markets is processed as a DVP transaction in the ESTS system
                      and the securities transferred from the ESTS holding of the bank to the
                      MKK’s consolidated holding in the ESTS. A message is triggered from the
                      ESTS to the MKK to convey the completion of the transfer.

                      The operations beyond the ESTS are handled by the MKK as free-of-
                      payment transfer. Purchase of securities in the inter-bank money markets
                      for deposit in the ESTS is not allowed and it will need to be done in two
                      steps. The first step for purchasing in the inter-bank money markets and
                      then the free-of-payment transfer from MKK’s account in the ESTS to the
                      buying participants account in the ESTS.

                      However, as per current market practice, for inter-bank money markets, the
                      practice is to transfer securities to Takasbank’s account in the ESTS. The
                      SSS functions for the Takasbank related markets are handled by the
                      Takasbank. All transfers between ESTS and Takasbank are free-of-
                      payment transfers.

Key consideration 2   An FMI should complete final settlement no later than the end
                      of the value date, and preferably intraday or in real time, to
                      reduce settlement risk. An LVPS or SSS should consider
                      adopting RTGS or multiple-batch processing during the
                      settlement day.
Description           Final settlement on the value date

                      The ESTS system settles in DVP mode, using DVP model 1. The
                      funds leg are settled in the EFT system. The EFT system is structured
                      as a RTGS system and all settlements are final as noted in the KC 1.

                      Intraday or real-time final settlement

                            The ESTS system settles in DVP mode, using DVP model 1.
                            Participants can track the status of their operations in real-time through
                            reporting facilities provided by the system.
Key consideration 3         An FMI should clearly define the point after which unsettled
                            payments, transfer instructions, or other obligations may not be
                            revoked by a participant.
Description                 In ESTS, securities selling operations that are performed in DvP principle
                            are initiated by the seller. The buyer is notified and sends a buy request
                            after the seller starts the operation. The seller can only cancel the transfer
                            order before the funds leg is settled. Once payment is settled, the securities
                            transfer is also settled and DVP operation cannot be revoked by seller or
                            buyer. This is detailed in the article 8 of the PSOR.
                            Participants can request for extension of operating hours on a particular
                            day. Extensions request are made on phone and extensions granted are
                            communicated to all participants. Extensions up to 15 minutes are to be
                            authorized by the EFT operations head, beyond 15 minutes and up to 1
                            hour requires the approval of the ED of the PSD. Extensions beyond that
                            require approval of a Deputy Governor of the CBRT.
Key conclusions             The ESTS settles in DVP mode using DVP model 1. The funds leg are
                            settled in the EFT system. The EFT functions as a RTGS system with final
                            settlement through the day. Settlement finality is protected in the PSL and
                            clearly articulated in the PSOR and as such has a sound legal basis.

                            The ESTS has a link with MKK for free-of-payment transfer of banks
                            securities holdings in the ESTS to MKK. The MKK maintains a
                            consolidated account in the ESTS to reflect the securities holdings of its
                            participants in its books. The transfer from ESTS to MKK and vice-versa
                            happens in DVP mode for sale and as a book entry transfer for the free-of-
                            payment transfers.

Principle 9: Money settlements
An FMI should conduct its money settlements in central bank money where practical and
available. If central bank money is not used, an FMI should minimize and strictly control the
credit and liquidity risk arising from the use of commercial bank money.
Key consideration 1        An FMI should conduct its money settlements in central bank
                           money, where practical and available, to avoid credit and
                           liquidity risks.

                      manage, and limit its credit and liquidity risks arising from the
                      commercial settlement banks. In particular, an FMI should
                      establish and monitor adherence to strict criteria for its
                      settlement banks that take account of, among other things, their
                      regulation and supervision, creditworthiness, capitalisation,
                      access to liquidity, and operational reliability. An FMI should
                      also monitor and manage the concentration of credit and
                      liquidity exposures to its commercial settlement banks.

Principle 10: Physical Deliveries
An FMI should clearly state its obligations with respect to the delivery of physical instruments
or commodities and should identify, monitor, and manage the risks associated with such
physical deliveries.
Key consideration 1     An FMI’s rules should clearly state its obligations with respect
                        to the delivery of physical instruments or commodities.
Description
                          Securities including government debt securities are processed in book entry
                          form in the ESTS. There are two banks which are not participants of the
                          ESTS system, their ownership of securities is recorded in their accounts in
                          the CBRT Ankara and Istanbul branch, outside of the ESTS. For this
                          purpose, their securities kept in ESTS are recorded as holdings of CBRT
                          branches.
                          Although, physical printing and delivery of securities have been possible
                          previously, with the decision by Prime Minister Undersecretariat of
                          Treasury dated the November 2nd of 2012, the printing and
                          rematerialisation of government debt securities ended.
                          On November 11th of 2012, the CBRT announced via an instruction that
                          the printing of the government securities was terminated from that point
                          and the regulations related with securities’ printing have been updated
                          appropriately.
                          With the redemption of the latest printed securities, there are now no
                          printed government debt securities since July 2013.
Key consideration 2       An FMI should identify, monitor, and manage the risks and costs
                          associated with the storage and delivery of physical instruments
                          or commodities.
Description
                          Since government debt securities are not printed and they are kept only in
                          dematerialised form, there is no risk associated with the storage and
                          delivery of physical instruments or commodities.
Key conclusions
                          In ESTS, securities are dematerialised and processed in book entry form.
                          Although it was possible to rematerialize and physically deliver the
                          securities previously, as of November 2012 physical printing of
                          government debt securities has been terminated. With the redemption of
                          latest printed securities, there have been no printed government debt
                          securities since July 2013.
                          Since government debt securities are only in dematerialised form, there is
                          no risk associated with the storage and delivery of physical instruments and
                          as such this principle is not applicable for ESTS.

Principle 11: Central Securities Depositories
A CSD should have appropriate rules and procedures to help ensure the integrity of securities
issues and minimise and manage the risks associated with the safekeeping and transfer of
securities. A CSD should maintain securities in an immobilised or dematerialised form for
their transfer by book entry.
Key consideration 1       A CSD should have appropriate rules, procedures, and controls,
                          including robust accounting practices, to safeguard the rights of
                          securities issuers and holders, prevent the unauthorised creation
                          or deletion of securities, and conduct periodic and at least daily
                          reconciliation of securities issues it maintains.
Description               The ESTS functions as the CSD for government securities and CBRT
                          bills. The ESTS participants are banks and only their proprietary
                          holdings are held in the ESTS. Banks also hold these securities in the
                          MKK and so do individual and institutional investors. The MKK
                          records these holdings at the level of the beneficial owner. The MKK
                          has an account in the ESTS system to reflect the consolidated holdings
                          of these securities in the MKK system.

                          As discussed in the assessment of principle 1 for the ESTS, the
                          Takassbank holds sub-accounts of participants for facilitating its SSS
                          functions for the money markets and secondary market on
                          Government securities. The sub-accounts are reflected also in the
                          ESTS.

                          In February 2016:
                           • 20% of the securities recorded in the ESTS were government issued
                             sukuks and 80% of the securities recorded were government bills.
                           • As for the transaction volumes: 37% of it is for DVP operations, 57%
                             of it is for free transfers, 6% of it is for repositioning [moving
                             securities between different collateral accounts].
                           • As for the transaction values: 51% of it is for DVP operations, 38%
                             of it is for free transfers, 11% of it is for repositioning.

                          Safeguarding the rights of securities issuers and holders

                          Since the CBRT is the owner and operator of the ESTS, there is no risk for
                          participants’ securities to be sequestrated due to the other activities of the
                          CBRT.
                          The CBRT is subject to external and internal audit. During external audits
                          of the CBRT and internal audit of the CBRT departments, transactions and
                          holdings in some ESTS accounts are requested and controlled.
                          Similarly, when participants of ESTS are being externally audited, their
                          account holdings and transactions in ESTS are requested from the CBRT
                          by the auditors.
                          As a part of the audit of the Undersecretariat of Treasury, the Turkish Court
                          of Accounts requests holdings in some ESTS securities accounts of certain
                          dates (usually, issue or redemption dates). Moreover, issue and redemption
                          processes are also overseen. Article 4 of the Law on Turkish Court of



                                                142
Accounts (Law No. 6085), entitled “Independence, Audit Area, Duties
and Competences of Turkish Court of Accounts” states that the Turkish
Court of Accounts shall audit joint stock companies established by
special law, in this case the CBRT.

As noted in the discussion on principle 1 for the ESTS, there is an
ambiguity in the legal certainty of the protection of securities of
banks and other institutional investors held with Takasbank.

Prevention of the unauthorised creation or deletion of securities

Securities in ESTS are kept in the name of the participants in separate
accounts. Participants can inquire their account details online.
Every system participant is authorised only for the account types that it
may have. In addition, for each operation type the account types that can
be used are also defined. During initiation of ESTS transactions, suitability
of accounts type for operation and parties are controlled by the system. If
the operation type or related participants are not allowed to use the
securities account mentioned in the message, the related transaction is
automatically rejected by the system.
In ESTS, some account types, including Issue Operations account type,
can only be used by the CBRT. All the securities are issued by increasing
the holdings in Issue Operations account, only with the approval of three
authorised personnel of the CBRT Markets Department. Then securities
are transferred to the system participants from this account.
The securities within the system can only be deleted via diminishing the
holdings in the Issue Operations account. This is also performed with
approval of three authorised CBRT personnel.
Also, during the end of day operations, securities holdings in ESTS are
compared with the overall securities pool accounts maintained at the CBRT
Istanbul Branch. In this way, any inconsistency between the balances is
automatically detected.

Periodic reconciliation of securities issues

The End of day Statement, which is sent during the end of day processing,
notifies the participants, including the MKK, about their holdings and their
daily transactions. In this context, daily changes of the Issue Operations
account holdings are also reported to and hence controlled by the CBRT.
Moreover, during the end of the day processing, total of securities holdings
in ESTS and holdings on the basis of securities, the values reported by End
of day Statement and the data at the CBRT mainframe computer are
verified by cross checks.
Since the CBRT carries out the issue, custody and redemption of
government debt securities in the capacity of the financial agent of the
Undersecretariat of Treasury, the CBRT informs the Undersecretariat of
Treasury about the issue and redemption operations in advance, and carries
operation with the approval of the Undersecretariat of Treasury. The
Treasury does not have access to the ESTS and the CBRT systems. The
CBRT carries on all operations related to the ESTS on behalf of the
Treasury. Telephone, fax and official letters are used for the



                      143
                      communication purposes during the issue, custody and redemption
                      operations. During the issue operations, a private online connection is
                      also used between the Treasury and the CBRT.
                      The MKK as a participant of the ESTS has access to its account in the
                      ESTS system. During the coupon payment for securities, the details of
                      the securities holdings of investors in the MKK is sought.
Key consideration 2   A CSD should prohibit overdrafts and debit balances in
                      securities accounts.
Description           Settlements of the transfer orders accepted to the system are not guaranteed
                      and they are only settled when the balance of the participant’s settlement
                      account is sufficient. Negative balances and overdrafts from accounts are
                      not allowed.
Key consideration 3   A CSD should maintain securities in an immobilised or
                      dematerialised form for their transfer by book entry. Where
                      appropriate, a CSD should provide incentives to immobilise or
                      dematerialise securities.
Description
                      In ESTS, securities are dematerialised and processed in book-entry form.
                      Although it was possible to rematerialise the securities previously, the
                      decision of the Undersecretariat of Treasury, dated the November 2nd of
                      2012, ended the printing and rematerialisation of government debt
                      securities. On the November 11th of 2012, the CBRT announced an
                      instruction that the printing of the government securities has been
                      terminated.
                      With the redemption of latest printed securities, there have been no printed
                      government debt securities since July 2013.
Key consideration 4   A CSD should protect assets against custody risk through
                      appropriate rules and procedures consistent with its legal
                      framework.
Description
                      Since safekeeping of the securities in ESTS is performed by the CBRT,
                      there is no custody risk that may stem from insolvency.
                      All the operations by the CBRT users in ESTS are carried out by dual
                      control – maker and checker. These operations are logged and, if needed,
                      can be tracked. In addition, in the context of daily reconciliation, during
                      the end of day processing, participants are notified about their securities
                      account holdings and their daily transactions.
                      The MKK is charged with monitoring all capital market instruments and
                      rights related with them in electronic environment and in the name of the
                      beneficial owners. On the 30th of June 2012, the MKK became a participant
                      of ESTS on special conditions and started to centrally monitor the
                      government debt securities owned by retail and institutional investors,
                      including banks for their secondary market trades in the BIST and inter-
                      bank money markets. Participants of ESTS are responsible for transferring
                      their customers’ securities to the MKK Customer Securities Account held
                      in ESTS.
                      The banks participating in ESTS are under the supervision of the BRSA
                      and subject to internal and external audit. Moreover, the CBRT is
                      authorised to audit the CBRT payment and securities settlement system
                      participants for their activities related with the system.

                      Securities holdings of individual and institutional investor are held in their
                      own names in the MKK system.
                      Since securities in ESTS are kept only in dematerialised form, there is no
                      risk associated with theft of physical securities.
                      …..
Key consideration 5   A CSD should employ a robust system that ensures segregation
                      between the CSD’s own assets and the securities of its
                      participants and segregation among the securities of
                      participants. Where supported by the legal framework, the CSD
                      should also support operationally the segregation of securities
                      belonging to a participant’s customers on the participant’s books
                      and facilitate the transfer of customer holdings.
Description           The securities of the ESTS participants are held in the specific individual
                      accounts of the participants in their own names.
                      The securities of customers of ESTS participants are segregated from the
                      participants’ own holdings and kept in a special securities account in ESTS,
                      namely MKK Customer Securities Account, owned by the MKK.
                      In the MKK system, the holdings in the MKK Customer Securities Account
                      are kept segregated in the name of beneficial owner based on declarations
                      by ESTS participants. Customers are able to track their holdings on the
                      MKK system.


                      As noted in the KC 1 of this principle and earlier in the assessment
                      of principle 1 of the ESTS, the Takasbank maintains sub-accounts of
                      participants in the money markets and secondary market for
                      Government securities. These sub-accounts are reflected in the
                      ESTS. The CMB as part of its ongoing oversight and supervision of
                      Takasbank validates the effective segregation of customer assets.
Key consideration 6   A CSD should identify, measure, monitor, and manage its risks
                      from other activities that it may perform; additional tools may
                      be necessary in order to address these risks.
Description
                      The CBRT, as a central bank, is not exposed to the risks like liquidity risk
                      or general business risk, due to its other activities. Therefore the
                      identification, measurement and monitoring of risks due to other activities
                      is not valid for the CBRT.
                      Risks that the CBRT may incur due to its activities other than operating the
                      payment systems are managed by the relevant CBRT departments.
Key conclusions
                      The CBRT, in the capacity as the agent of the Prime Ministry
                      Undersecretariat of Treasury, carries out the dematerialised issue, custody
                      and redemption of government securities, which are issued by the Prime
                      Ministry Undersecretariat of Treasury, by the CBRT, and by other public
                      institutions.
                      The ESTS functions as a CSD-cum-SSS for these securities.
                      ESTS carries out the book entry transfer and settlement of government debt
                      securities and securities issued by the CBRT.
                      Since the CBRT is the CSD for the securities in ESTS, there is neither
                      custody risk stemming from the insolvency of the CSD nor the risk of the

                          participants’ securities being sequestrated due to the other activities of the
                          system operator.
                          In ESTS, the securities owned by the participants’ customers are
                          segregated from the participants’ own holdings and kept in a special
                          securities account of the MKK. MKK keeps these securities by customer
                          details in its system enabling customers to track their holdings. However,
                          as noted in the discussion on principle 1, Takasbank holds securities
                          accounts of the participants in the inter-bank money market in its books.
                           The specific rules and provisions related to this are not explicitly covered
                          in the POSR or other legal measures covering the ESTS.
                          All the operations by the CBRT in ESTS require dual approval, are logged
                          and, if needed, can be tracked. During the end of day operations of ESTS,
                          participants are notified about their securities account holdings and their
                          daily operations for reconciliation purposes.
                          All the securities held in the ESTS are in dematerialized book entry form,
                          there are no physical securities.
                          The Takasbank maintains sub-accounts for participants in the money
                          markets and secondary market for Government securities. These
                          sub-accounts are reflected separately in the ESTS and also in the
                          books of Takasbank.

Recommendations           The CBRT potentially in co-ordination with the BRSA and the CMB
and comments              could institute measures to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of
                          the segregation of assets of the participants of the Takasbank SSS
                          and other Takasbank operated markets. In addition, the CBRT could
                          also institute measures to ensure that it is able to transfer
                          customers/participants securities holdings with Takasbank to the
                          MKK in the event of a default of Takasbank.

Principle 12: Exchange-of-value settlement systems
If an FMI settles transactions that involve the settlement of two linked obligations (for example,
securities or foreign exchange transactions), it should eliminate principal risk by conditioning
the final settlement of one obligation upon the final settlement of the other.
Key consideration 1        An FMI that is an exchange-of-value settlement system should
                           eliminate principal risk by ensuring that the final settlement of one
                           obligation occurs if and only if the final settlement of the linked
                           obligation also occurs, regardless of whether the FMI settles on a
                           gross or net basis and when finality occurs.

Principle 13: Participant-default rules and procedures
An FMI should have effective and clearly defined rules and procedures to manage a
participant default. These rules and procedures should be designed to ensure that the FMI
can take timely action to contain losses and liquidity pressures and continue to meet its
obligations.
Key consideration 1 An FMI should have default rules and procedures that enable
                         the FMI to continue to meet its obligations in the event of a
                         participant default and that address the replenishment of
                         resources following a default.
Description              Participant default rules and procedures

                        The ESTS functions as a CSD-cum-SSS and settles in the EFT system for
                        the funds leg in DVP mode, using DVP model 1. The default
                        arrangements of the ESTS system as the same as that described for the

Key consideration 4     An FMI should involve its participants and other stakeholders
                        in the testing and review of the FMI’s default procedures,
                        including any close-out procedures. Such testing and review
                        should be conducted at least annually or following material
                        changes to the rules and procedures to ensure that they are
                        practical and effective.

Description              The default arrangements of the ESTS system as the same as that
                         described for the EFT in the earlier assessment table.

Key conclusions          The PSD has developed a default management procedure in December,
                         2015 covering all the payment and securities settlement systems operated
                         by the CBRT.

                         The default procedure is consistent with the provisions in the PSOR and
                         derives its legal basis from the PSL.

                         This procedure however is not tested in its entirety.

                         The participants in the system are all banks, except the MKK. Banks are
                         supervised by the BRSA and the MKK by the CMB. These authorities
                         have the sole right related to insolvency or bankruptcy of these
                         participants.
                         There are existing co-ordination and information sharing arrangements
                         between the CBRT, BRSA and the CMB.

                         Hence there is high degree of certainty that the CBRT will have
                         adequate notice to execute its default management process.
                         Nevertheless, any delays in executing the default management process
                         could escalate the risks in the system.
Assessment of             Broadly Observed
Principle 13
Recommendations          The CBRT should conduct periodic testing of the default management
and                      procedure as a whole and include the participants also in this exercise.
comments                 This could be integrated with the BCP or conducted as a standalone
                         exercise at least once a year.

Principle 14. Segregation and Portability
A CCP should have rules and procedures that enable the segregation and portability of
positions of a participant’s customers and the collateral provided to the CCP with respect to
those positions.
Key consideration 1       A CCP should, at a minimum, have segregation and portability
                          arrangements that effectively protect a participant’s customers’
                          positions and related collateral from the default or insolvency of
                          that participant. If the CCP additionally offers protection of
                          such customer positions and collateral against the concurrent
                          default of the participant and a fellow customer, the CCP should
                          take steps to ensure that such protection is effective.

                      applicable.

Key consideration 2   A CCP should employ an account structure that enables it
                      readily to identify positions of a participant’s customers and to
                      segregate related collateral. A CCP should maintain customer
                      positions and collateral in individual customer accounts or in
                      omnibus customer accounts.
Description
                      The ESTS is CSD-cum-SSS and hence this principle and KC are not
                      applicable.

Key consideration 3   A CCP should structure its portability arrangements in a way
                      that makes it highly likely that the positions and collateral of a
                      defaulting participant’s customers will be transferred to one or
                      more other participants.
Description           The ESTS is CSD-cum-SSS and hence this principle and KC are not
                      applicable.

Key consideration 4   A CCP should disclose its rules, policies, and procedures relating
                      to the segregation and portability of a participant’s customers’
                      positions and related collateral. In particular, the CCP should
                      disclose whether customer collateral is protected on an
                      individual or omnibus basis. In addition, a CCP should disclose
                      any constraints, such as legal or operational constraints, that
                      may impair its ability to segregate or port a participant’s
                      customers’ positions and related collateral.
Description
                      The ESTS is CSD-cum-SSS and hence this principle and KC are not
                      applicable.

Principle 15: General business risk
An FMI should identify, monitor, and manage its general business risk and hold sufficient
liquid net assets funded by equity to cover potential general business losses so that it can
continue operations and services as a going concern if those losses materialize. Further,
liquid net assets should at all times be sufficient to ensure a recovery or orderly wind-down
of critical operations and services.
Key consideration 1 An FMI should have robust management and control systems
                         to identify, monitor, and manage general business risks,
                         including losses from poor execution of business strategy,
                         negative cash flows, or unexpected and excessively large
                         operating expenses.
Description              The ESTS system and the EFT system are part of the integrated
                         CBRT payment and securities settlement system, owned and
                         operated by the CBRT. The details for the general business risk are
                         the same as for the EFT system as recorded in the previous
                         assessment table.
Key consideration 2 An FMI should hold liquid net assets funded by equity (such as
                         common stock, disclosed reserves, or other retained earnings)
                         so that it can continue operations and services as a going
                         concern if it incurs general business losses. The amount of
                         liquid net assets funded by equity an FMI should hold should
                         be determined by its general business risk profile and the
                         length of time required to achieve a recovery or orderly wind-
                         down, as appropriate, of its critical operations and services if
                         such action is taken.
Description              The details for the general business risk are the same as for the EFT
                         system as recorded in the previous assessment table.
Key consideration 3 An FMI should maintain a viable recovery or orderly wind-
                         down plan and should hold sufficient liquid net assets funded
                         by equity to implement this plan. At a minimum, an FMI
                         should hold liquid net assets funded by equity equal to at least
                         six months of current operating expenses. These assets are in
                         addition to resources held to cover participant defaults or
                         other risks covered under the financial resources principles.
                         However, equity held under international risk-based capital
                         standards can be included where relevant and appropriate to
                         avoid duplicate capital requirements.

Key consideration 4   Assets held to cover general business risk should be of high
                      quality and sufficiently liquid in order to allow the FMI to
                      meet its current and projected operating expenses under a

Principle 16. Custody and Investment Risks
An FMI should safeguard its own and its participants’ assets and minimise the risk of loss on
and delay in access to these assets. An FMI’s investments should be in instruments with
minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks.
Key consideration 1      An FMI should hold its own and its participants’ assets at
                         supervised and regulated entities that have robust accounting
                         practices, safekeeping procedures, and internal controls that
                         fully protect these assets.
Description              The ESTS system and the EFT system are part of the integrated

                         participants, and investments should be secured by, or be claims
                         on, high-quality obligors. These investments should allow for

Principle 17: Operational risk
An FMI should identify the plausible sources of operational risk, both internal and external,
and mitigate their impact through the use of appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and
controls. Systems should be designed to ensure a high degree of security and operational
reliability and should have adequate, scalable capacity. Business continuity management
should aim for timely recovery of operations and fulfillment of the FMI’s obligations,
including in the event of a wide-scale or major disruption.
Key consideration 1 An FMI should establish a robust operational risk-management
                        framework with appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and
                        controls to identify, monitor, and manage operational risks.
Description             The ESTS system and the EFT system are part of the integrated

Key consideration 2 An FMI’s board of directors should clearly define the roles and
                    responsibilities for addressing operational risk and should
                    endorse the FMI’s operational risk-management framework.
                    Systems, operational policies, procedures, and controls should be

                    including events that could cause a wide-scale or major
                    disruption. The plan should incorporate the use of a secondary
                    site and should be designed to ensure that critical information
                    technology (IT) systems can resume operations within two hours
                    following disruptive events. The plan should be designed to
                    enable the FMI to complete settlement by the end of the day of
                    the disruption, even in case of extreme circumstances. The FMI

                      The CBRT includes the risks it poses to other FMIs as part of the
                      framework for assessing risks from and to participants.


Assessment of         Broadly Observed
Principle 17
Recommendations       The CBRT could build on the specific provisions in the PSOR to include
and comments          explicit mandates with respect to operational risk management for its
                      participants and have a mechanism to assess compliance to those on an
                      ongoing basis.

                      The CBRT could consider including more stringent operational risk
                      management measures for the participants with a large share of
                      transactions, based on the monthly network analysis being carried out.

                      The CBRT could also consider incorporating a more structured assessment
                      of the operational risks it can pose to other FMIs and the risks it could be
                      exposed from them. This assessment could become the basis for the more
                      detailed and complex scenarios being proposed for inclusion in the revised
                      business continuity plans.

Principle 18. Access and participation requirements
An FMI should have objective, risk-based, and publicly disclosed criteria for participation,
which permit fair and open access.
Key consideration 1 An FMI should allow for fair and open access to its services,
                       including by direct and, where relevant, indirect participants and
                       other FMIs, based on reasonable risk-related participation
                       requirements.
Description
                      The ESTS system and the EFT system are part of the integrated CBRT payment
                      and securities settlement system, owned and operated by the CBRT. The details
                      for the access and participation requirements are the same as for the EFT
                      system as recorded in the previous assessment table.

                      Participation criteria and requirements

                      The details for the access and participation requirements are the same as for the
                      EFT system as recorded in the previous assessment table. In addition to banks,
                      the only other participant in the ESTS is the MKK.

                      Access to trade repositories

                      This item is not applicable to the ESTS.
Key consideration 2 An FMI’s participation requirements should be justified in terms of
                    the safety and efficiency of the FMI and the markets it serves, be
                    tailored to and commensurate with the FMI’s specific risks, and be
                    publicly disclosed. Subject to maintaining acceptable risk control
                    standards, an FMI should endeavour to set requirements that have
                    the least-restrictive impact on access that circumstances permit.

                      The details for the access and participation requirements are the same as for the

                      EFT system as recorded in the previous assessment table.
Key consideration 3 An FMI should monitor compliance with its participation
                    requirements on an ongoing basis and have clearly defined and
                    publicly disclosed procedures for facilitating the suspension and

Principle 19. Tiered Participation Arrangements
An FMI should identify, monitor, and manage the material risks to the FMI arising from tiered
participation arrangements.
Key consideration 1     An FMI should ensure that its rules, procedures, and agreements
                        allow it to gather basic information about indirect participation in
                        order to identify, monitor, and manage any material risks to the
                        FMI arising from such tiered participation arrangements.
Description             The ESTS system and the EFT system are part of the integrated CBRT
                        payment and securities settlement system, owned and operated by the
                        CBRT. The details for the tiered participation arrangements are the same
                        as for the EFT system as recorded in the previous assessment table.

                         the EFT system as recorded in the previous assessment table.
Key consideration 2      An FMI should identify material dependencies between direct and
                         indirect participants that might affect the FMI.
Description              The details for the tiered participation arrangements are the same as for
                         the EFT system as recorded in the previous assessment table.
Key consideration 3      An FMI should identify indirect participants responsible for a
                         significant proportion of transactions processed by the FMI and
                         indirect participants whose transaction volumes or values are large
                         relative to the capacity of the direct participants through which they



                                               157
                         access the FMI in order to manage the risks arising from these
                         transactions.
Description              The details for the tiered participation arrangements are the same as for
                         the EFT system as recorded in the previous assessment table.
Key consideration 4      An FMI should regularly review risks arising from tiered
                         participation arrangements and should take mitigating action when
                         appropriate.
Description              The details for the tiered participation arrangements are the same as for
                         the EFT system as recorded in the previous assessment table.
Key conclusions          The PSOR acknowledges and regulates only the direct participants in the
                         CBRT payment and securities settlement systems and there is no definition or
                         rules set for indirect participation. Entities that are not eligible for participation
                         can perform operations the participants, but are treated as customers of
                         participants, rather than indirect participants.
                         However in the case of ESTS, retail investors and institutional investors
                         who wish to hold government securities and CBRT bills, can do so in
                         the MKK and also for banks which are not a member of the ESTS in the
                         CBRT branches. Hence by design there are no tiered participants in the
                         ESTS system and this is hence not an issue of concern.

An FMI that establishes a link with one or more FMIs should identify, monitor, and manage link-
related risks.

                         Before entering into a link arrangement and on an ongoing basis
                         once the link is established, an FMI should identify, monitor, and
                         manage all potential sources of risk arising from the link
                         arrangement. Link arrangements should be designed such that each
                         FMI is able to observe the other principles in this report.
Description
                         ESTS has a link with the MKK, the ESTS functions as the issuer CSD
                         and the MKK the investor CSD. The ESTS is part of the CBRT payment
                         and securities settlement system and in the risk management framework,
                         the MKK is treated as another participant and not as a link.




                                                158
                      However the MKK is overseen by the CBRT for its SSS functions and
                      hence also has a full integrated view of the risks arising from the ESTS-
                      MKK link.

                      For the purpose of finality, the MKK has an account in the ESTS to
                      represent the consolidated holding of retail and institutional investors in
                      the MKK. The transfers from and to MKK are first reflected as a transfer
                      from a participants account in the ESTS to the MKK and a message is
                      triggered to the MKK to reflect the necessary changes in its books.

                      The MKK has access to its ESTS account all through the operational
                      hours and also receives at the end of the business day, the account
                      balance and list of transactions.

                      As noted earlier in the assessment of the principle 1 of the ESTS, the
                      ESTS also has a link with Takasbank.

                      protection to the FMIs involved in the link.

                      The MKK has access to its ESTS account all through the operational
                      hours and also receives at the end of the business day, the account
                      balance and list of transactions.

                      While the ESTS does not treat the arrangement with the MKK as a link
                      in its risk management framework, it is nevertheless not an issue of
                      concern, as both are overseen by the CBRT, which hence has an
                      integrated view of the risks arising from the link.

Assessment of         Observed.
Principle 20
Recommendations       The CBRT should consider updating its risk management for the CBRT
and comments          payment and securities settlement systems and reflect the arrangement
                      between the ESTS and MKK; and ESTS and Takasbank as a link and
                      address the risks accordingly.

Principle 21: Efficiency and effectiveness
An FMI should be efficient and effective in meeting the requirements of its participants and
the markets it serves.
Key consideration 1       An FMI should be designed to meet the needs of its participants
                          and the markets it serves, in particular, with regard to choice
                          of a clearing and settlement arrangement; operating structure;
                          scope of products cleared, settled, or recorded; and use of
                          technology and procedures.
Description               The ESTS system and the EFT system are part of the integrated
                          CBRT payment and securities settlement system, owned and
                          operated by the CBRT. The details for the efficiency and
                          effectiveness are the same as for the EFT system as recorded in the
                          previous assessment table.

Key consideration 2        An FMI should have clearly defined goals and objectives that
                           are measurable and achievable, such as in the areas of
                           minimum service levels, risk-management expectations, and
                           business priorities.
Description                The details for the efficiency and effectiveness are the same as for
                           the EFT system as recorded in the previous assessment table.
Key consideration 3        An FMI should have established mechanisms for the regular
                           review of its efficiency and effectiveness.
Description                The details for the efficiency and effectiveness are the same as for
                           the EFT system as recorded in the previous assessment table.
Key conclusions            The details for the efficiency and effectiveness for the EFT system
                           are also applicable for the ESTS system. In addition, there are no
                           opportunities to simplify the process of Government securities
                           transactions. The process varies based on the counterpart.
Assessment of Principle    Observed
21
Recommendations and        The CBRT in co-ordination with other relevant stakeholders could
comments                   study the current process for Government securities transactions
                           and explore opportunities to simplify and make the process more
                           efficient.

                           Creating a simplified process for Government securities
                           transactions will likely require:
                               - Move OTC market to the BIST or Takasbank and interface
                                   with MKK
                               - System interface between MKK-Takasbank, and ESTS;
                                   and
                               - Introduce ability to mark pledges in the ESTS system;

Principle 22: Communication procedures and standards
An FMI should use, or at a minimum accommodate, relevant internationally accepted
communication procedures and standards in order to facilitate efficient payment, clearing,
settlement, and recording.
Key consideration 1      An FMI should use, or at a minimum accommodate,
                         internationally accepted communication procedures and
                         standards.

                VII.     DETAILED ASSESSMENT REPORT – RESPONSIBILITIES




Responsibility A 28: Regulation, supervision, and oversight of FMIs
FMIs should be subject to appropriate and effective regulation, supervision, and oversight by a central
bank, market regulator, or other relevant authority
Key consideration 1            What criteria do authorities use to identify FMIs that should be
                               regulated, supervised and overseen?
Description                    The authorities with responsibilities for oversight of the FMIs are the CBRT
                                 (by virtue of the CBRT Law and PSL) and the CMB (by virtue of the CML).
                                 These two authorities have different but co-ordinated approach of classifying
                                 FMIs. The approach followed by these authorities are presented below.
                                 CBRT
                                 Payment and securities settlement systems are both defined as “the structure
                                 that has common rules and provides the infrastructure required for the
                                 clearing and settlement transactions carried out in order to realize payment
                                 and securities transfers arising from transfer orders among three or more
                                 participants” in the PSL, articles 3 (j) and 3 (ö). The CBRT is the authorized
                                 institution which regulates, licenses and oversees all payment and securities
                                 settlement systems in Turkey. In terms of regulation and oversight, there is
                                 no differentiation among these systems. Thus all of the systems in Turkey,
                                 which are compatible with the definition in the Payment Systems Law, are
                                 regulated, licensed and overseen by the CBRT. The Article (11) of the PSL,
                                 authorizes the CBRT to designated specific payment and securities settlement
                                 systems for which the provisions related to finality and protection of
                                 collateral rights, described in PSL article (10), would apply. The CBRT has
                                 accordingly designated 29 the EFT, RPS, ESTS, MKK and Takasbank. MKK,
                                 Takasbank, Interbank Clearing House (ICH) and the Interbank Card Center
                                 (ICC). The MKK and Takasbank are licensed by the CBRT as SSS.
                                 The Regulation on Oversight of the Payment and Securities Settlement
                                 Systems (ROSPSS) was issued by the CBRT to implement its oversight
                                 powers vested with by the CBRT law and the PSL. In the article 5(3) of the
                                 ROSPSS, the CBRT powers to classify payment and securities settlement
                                 systems and apply different standards to them is articulated. The CBRT
                                 currently is in the process of publishing its oversight framework.
                                 The framework proposes to categorize the systems as SSS and payment
                                 system. The payment systems are further sub-categorized as systemically
                                 important, systems of system wide importance and prominently important

                      systems. The framework further proposes, classifying the systemically
                      important payment systems and the SSS as FMIs and the CPMI-IOSCO
                      PFMIs as the applicable standards for them.
                      CMB
                      The systems subject to the oversight of the CMB are listed in the CML. The
                      CMB considers all the systems subject to its oversight, as FMIs. In this
                      regard, Article 35 (g), (ğ), (h) of the CML, specifies that all central clearing
                      institutions, central depository institutions and, trade repositories are the
                      institutions for which the establishment and principles of activities are
                      determined by the Board. Also Article 78 of CML regulates CCPs – defined
                      as central clearing institutions undertake the duty to complete clearing by
                      acting as seller against buyer and buyer against seller. Article 78 also decrees
                      that exchanges or other organized market places may also apply to the CMB
                      in order to initiate the practice of the central counterparty for the traded
                      capital market instruments. The article 81 of the CML, specifically authorizes
                      the MKK to function as the CSD for the Turkish capital markets. The article
                      87 of the CML, describes the role of the trade respositories.
                      The CMB has further issued the “Bylaw on the General Regulation on the
                      establishment and operating principles of central clearing and settlement
                      institutions”. This serves as the regulation articulating the powers of the CMB
                      over CCPs and how these should function.
                      The CMB has also issued the “Regulation on the Establishment, Operation,
                      Conduct and Audit Principles of the Central Securities Depository”. This
                      regulation spells out the operating principles and responsibilities of the MKK
                      and the CMB’s powers of oversight over its CSD activities.
Key consideration 2   How the criteria are publicly disclosed?
Description
                      The Payment Systems Law and the Capital Market Law are publicly
                      disclosed by being published in the Official Gazette and respectively on the
                      CBRT’s and the CMB’s web site.
                      The list of payment and securities settlement systems licensed by the CBRT
                      are listed on their website. There is however no specific articulation of the
                      classification of the systems and the criteria to classify a system as an FMI.


Key conclusions for   The CBRT law, the PSL and the CML clearly layout the specific payment
Responsibility A      and market infrastructures that are subject to regulation, supervision and
                      oversight of the authorities. These laws put together, assign the responsibility
                      for regulating, supervising and overseeing payment systems and SSS with the
                      CBRT; and CCPs, CSDs and TRs with the CML.


                      The authorities have further publically announced their adoption of the
                      CPMI-IOSCO PFMIs. The CMB has specifically stated that the PFMIs
                      would be applicable for the MKK and Takasbank. The CBRT in its public
                      statement on its objectives for payment and securities settlement systems has
                      articulated that it will apply the PFMIs to all the payment and securities
                      settlement systems under its oversight.




                                      167
                              The CBRT has further issued the ROPSS, which articulates its powers to
                              regulate and oversee the payment and securities settlement systems. The
                              CMB has issued specific regulations/communiques for the CSDs and CCPs,
                              however it has not yet issued regulations for TRs. The powers of the CMB
                              with respect over TRs is however clear and derives from the CML. Also,
                              which the CMB has licensed the MKK as a TR, it has not yet commenced
                              operations and the CMB as part of its approval to MKK to commence
                              operations as a TR intended to issue a regulation/communique to fully
                              articulate its regulatory and oversight actions and powers related to TRs.

Assessment of                 Broadly Observed.
Responsibility A
Recommendations and           The CBRT as part of the finalization of the oversight framework could
comments                      consider defining explicit criteria for systemically important payment
                              systems and elaborate which specific systems it considers FMIs to which the
                              PFMIs would be applied.

                              The CMB should ensure that it issues a regulation/communique on TRs,
                              before it accords approval to the MKK to commence its operations as a TR.




Responsibility B: Regulatory, supervisory, and oversight powers and resources
Central banks, market regulators, and other relevant authorities should have the powers and resources
to carry out effectively their responsibilities in regulating, supervising, and overseeing FMIs.

CMB

The CML provides a very general power to the CMB in terms of oversight and
regulation of capital market institutions including CCPs, CSDs and TRs.

Powers to obtain timely information

According to Article 77 of CML: “CMB has the regulatory, supervisory and
overseeing powers on central clearing institutions within the scope of this article.
The Board may request from central clearing institutions and members of these
institutions to carry out the issues it deems necessary about central clearing
operations and to send all kinds of information and documents regularly, or upon its
demand. The power to request all kinds of information regularly or upon demand
covers the power to request timely information as well. In that the CML gives the
authority to request information in a time period specified by CMB regarding
“information on demand” whereas regular reporting requirements are specifically
tied to a time period in the related laws or bylaws.”
According to Article 78/1 of CML being a central clearing institution is a prerequisite
for providing central counterparty services. So abovementioned article directly
applies to CCPs in the Turkish capital markets. Therefore there are no relevant
constraints to obtain timely information from the CCPs.
According to Article 80/4 of CML, the CMB is the supervisory and surveillance
authority of central securities depositories under this article – namely the MKK,
which is explicitly mentioned in the article. The article further reads as: “The Board
may request from central securities depositories and their members to carry out the
issues it deems necessary about central custody activities and to send all kinds of
information and documents upon its request or regularly. “
According to Article 81/6 of CML, the Board is the supervision and surveillance
authority of the MKK and may request from the MKK and its members to carry out
the issues it deems necessary about the monitoring of capital market instruments in a
dematerialized form and to send all kinds of information and documents in written
format or in the electronic environment upon its request or regularly.
At the moment there are no implementing regulation is not in force in Turkey yet, for
TRs. On the other hand, regulation on the powers or other authority of CMB or any
other relevant authority enabling them to obtain timely information from the TRs,
including confidential and non-public information, in order to carry out its
responsibilities is planned to take place in the implementing regulation.

Powers to induce change or enforce corrective action



                     171
                      According to Article 103/1 the CML: “persons who act in violation of the
                      regulations, determined standards and forms based on this Law as well as general and
                      specific decisions of the Board, shall be imposed an administrative fine from twenty
                      thousand Turkish Liras up to two hundred fifty thousand Turkish Liras by the Board.
                      However, in cases where a benefit has been gained due to the violation of the
                      obligation, the amount of the administrative fine to be imposed cannot be less than
                      twice of this benefit.”

                      In addition, according to Article 111/1 of the CML: “the person who does not give at
                      all or under the demanded format the information, documents and registers, including
                      those kept in the electronic environment, requested by the Board or by those assigned
                      according to this Law, shall be sentenced with prison from one year up to three years.”

                      From the abovementioned articles, the CMB has the powers to impose an
                      administrative fine to actions against the bylaws and discretionary power to impose
                      an administrative fine or to apply to court for demanding sentence according to
                      Article 111 for actions other than the ones specified in the bylaws regarding the
                      submission of information requested by CMB.

                      According to Article 9/3 of the “Bylaw on the Establishment and Operations of
                      Central Clearing Institutions”; the provisions under Article 41 of CML shall also
                      apply for the cancellation of the operation license granted by the Board to a central
                      clearing institution. (Being a central clearing institution is a prerequisite to act as a
                      CCP in Turkey according to 78/1 of CML, so this provision also applies to the CCPs).

                      Article 41 of CML that is applicable to central clearing institutions acting against the
                      regulations is given below:

                      “Withdrawal of the license and activity permission
                      ARTICLE 41 – (1) In cases listed below, the Board may withdraw the permission for
                      activity and license it has granted in the scope this Law, without prejudice to other
                      related provisions of this Law:
                      a) Expressly renouncing the authority to carry out activities, or not performing any
                      activity under the related permission for two years starting from the date the
                      permission was granted
                      b) Having obtained permission for activity by making false or misleading statements
                      or through other illegal means
                      c) No longer being able to meet the conditions required for the permission for activity
                      and not being able to meet them again within three months starting from the date
                      when it has been established by the Board that they have been lost”.

Key consideration 2   Authorities should have sufficient resources to fulfill their
                      regulatory, supervisory, and oversight responsibilities.
Description           CBRT

                      Resources
                      In Turkey, the CBRT is the regulator and overseer of payments systems and SSS. The
                      CBRT has adequate funding and experienced human resources to carry out regulation
                      and oversight of payment systems and securities settlement systems in Turkey. The
                      CBRT has autonomy regarding its budget and human resources policies. The CBRT
                      personnel participate in many seminars and trainings all around the world about
                      payment systems. In CBRT, the PSD is responsible for various activities related to



                                            172
payment and securities settlement systems in Turkey. There is a separate division
authorized for the regulation and oversight of these systems in the PSD.
The oversight and regulation division is composed of 15 employees. One of them is
the director, two of them are performing the deputy director role, 10 of them are
specialists regarding payment and securities settlement systems in Turkey and two of
them are support personnel. There are two specialists responsible for the oversight of
each payment or securities settlement system.
Legal protections
The PSL has specific article on the investigation and prosecution procedure,
protecting the powers of the CBRT personnel carrying out their oversight and
regulatory activities.
PSL, Article 37 (3):” Investigating and prosecuting the Central Bank of the Republic
of Turkey personnel due to their actions during performance of their duties stated in
this Law and the regulations to be issued pursuant to this Law, shall be subject to
written application of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey to Chief Public
Prosecutor’s Office.”
CMB

Resources

In Turkey, the CMB is the regulatory and oversight authority for CCPs, CSDs and
TRs. The CMB has adequate funding and experienced human resources from
different disciplines (economics, finance, lawyers and engineers) to carry out
regulation and oversight of these FMIs in Turkey. The CMB has autonomy with
respect to its budget and human resources policies. The CMB personnel are
encouraged to participate in many seminars and trainings globally and are assigned
to participate in related committees within the international organizations. In CMB,
the Department of Intermediary Activities is responsible for regulation and oversight
of the CCPs, CSDs and TRs in Turkey.
This department is also responsible for investment firms operating in Turkey
including 92 brokerage firms and 45 banks and their investment services. Regulation,
supervision and oversight of Borsa İstanbul A.Ş.’s exchange activities, Takasbank’s
central clearing functions, MKK’s CSD and proposed TR functions fall under the
responsibility of this department as well. There are 48 employees ccomprised of one
director, three deputy directors, 26 specialists, 12 assistant specialists and 6 support
personnel.

There are no specific individuals assigned with the oversight activities with respect
to the FMIs under CMB’s scope. Assignments are made on a task basis depending on
the overall work schedule.

From a legal perspective, the relevant provisions are:
- CML, Article 117 (1): “ CMB possesses a public legal entity and an administrative
and financial autonomy established for carrying out the tasks and exercising the
authorities granted by the CML and the related legislations. “
- CML, Art 117 (3): “the Board makes use of the financial resources it disposes in
the context of this Law and the related legislation freely, as much as its tasks and




                     173
                          authorities require and in the framework of the principles and procedures determined
                          in its own budget.”
                          - CML, Art 117/4, the Board employs staff in an adequate number and quality for the
                          purpose o carrying out the tasks and use the authorities given with CML and the
                          related legislation.
                          - CML, Art 117/5, all the money, documents and property of the Board qualify as
                          state property and they cannot be attached and pledged.
                          Legal Protection
                          The CM, article 88 empowers the board to assign staff to execute the powers vested
                          with it. The article 89, further requires the supervised entities to provide any requested
                          information by the authorized CMB staff and if needed authorizes the CMB to search
                          with the support of police for any required information in the premises and systems
                          of the supervised entities.


Key conclusions for       The CBRT and the CMB have the relevant powers to obtain information and induce
Responsibility B          change to carry out their oversight activities.

                          These powers have been explicitly articulated in secondary regulations with respect
                          to the payment systems and SSS, by the CBRT. The CMB has articulated its powers
                          with respect to the CCPs and SSS. However its powers with respect to the TRs have
                          not been explicitly articulated yet. At this point, however there are no TRs in Turkey.
                          The CMB has licensed the MKK to function as a TR. However prior to its becoming
                          operational, the CMB intends to issue specific regulations.

                          The CBRT and the CMB has adequate resources and qualified staff to carry out its
                          oversight and regulatory responsibilities with respect to the FMIs in its oversight. The
                          CBRT has specific designated staff for carrying out the oversight activities. The
                          CMB’s oversight activities are housed in a department which also includes regulation
                          and supervision of brokers and also the BIST.


Assessment of       Broadly Observed
Responsibility B
Recommendations and The CMB could consider assigning specific responsibilities to staff with respect to
comments            the FMIs in its scope. The CMB should issue the regulations related to TRs ahead
                          of MKK commencing its operations.




                                                174
Responsibility C: Disclosure of policies with respect to FMIs
Central banks, market regulators, and other relevant authorities should clearly define and disclose their
regulatory, supervisory, and oversight policies with respect to FMIs.
Key                  Authorities should clearly define their policies with respect to
consideration 1      FMIs, which include the authorities’ objectives, roles, and regulations
Description          CBRT
                     The CBRT is responsible for the regulation and oversight of payment and securities
                     settlement systems in Turkey. The PSL aims to regulate the procedures and principles
                     regarding these systems.
                     The CBRT also published 30 a policy statement titled “Objectives and Policies Regarding
                     Payment and Securities Settlement Systems”:
                     “…..
                     In this context, by taking into account the relevant national regulations and international
                     practices and standards, the CBRT’s main objective regarding payment and securities
                     settlement systems and its oversight activities to be carried out in this area, is to ensure
                     the “safe, uninterrupted, efficient and effective functioning of the systems”.
                     Main policies and activities pursued by the CBRT in order to achieve this objective, which
                     is critical for sustaining financial stability and for effective implementation of monetary
                     policy, are as follows:

                  CMB policies with respect to CCPs, including its roles and regulations are clearly defined
                  in Article78 of CML as well as in the bylaw on “Central Counterparty Applications of
                  Istanbul Clearing And Settlement Bank”.
                  Moreover the objective of CMB to regulate CCPs is to protect the financial stability of the
                  capital markets as specified in Art 78 (1) and explicitly classifies these institutions as
                  systemically important in the same article. CMB’s roles and regulations are explicitly
                  mentioned both in CML Article 78 and in the bylaw on “Central Counterparty Services of
                  Takasbank”.
                  The objective of CMB to regulate CCPs is also explained in the rationale for Article 78 of
                  the CML as given below.
                  “The settlement finality of transactions in financial markets manifests itself in the existence
                  and sustainability of the system in general. The settlement finality of transactions in
                  financial markets, beyond ensuring investors’ trust, is also crucial in minimizing the
                  systemic risk. Within this context, with this Article, for the first time in the Turkish
                  regulations, the settlement finality of transactions in Turkish financial markets are
                  guaranteed and the related infrastructure is being built. Also taking into consideration
                  that the collaterals of investors will be used in settlement finality, such collaterals are
                  preserved against attachments, pledges or other similar civil applications.”
                  For CSDs, CMB’s objectives, roles and authorities are clearly defined in CML (Articles
                  80, 81 and 128) and in secondary regulations (Regulation on the Establishment, Operation,
                  Conduct and Audit Principles of the Central Securities Depository and the Communiqué
                  on the Procedures and Principles for the Book Keeping of Dematerialized Capital Market
                  Instruments).
                  The CMB also published 31a "policy statement" expressing that

                  “ …by taking into account the relevant national regulations and international practices
                  and standards, the CMB’s main objectives regarding financial market infrastructures and
                  its oversight activities to be carried out in this area, is to ensure the safe, uninterrupted,
                  efficient and effective functioning of capital markets.”

                  Main policies and activities pursued by the CMB in order to achieve this objective, which
                  is critical for sustaining stability of capital markets and fostering a safe environment for
                  investors, are as follows:

                      •   Making the necessary regulations, which are up to date and in compliance with
                          international standards.

                      •   Conducting oversight of the FMIs in order to ensure their compliance with
                          national and international regulations and standards.

                      •   Ensuring the FMIs operate in compliance with the CPMI-IOSCO PFMIs.

                      •   Carrying out activities regarding the FMIs in cooperation with the authorities,
                          which are responsible for supervision of the financial system, FMIs and their
                          beneficiaries.

Description               CBRT
                            The CBRT’s main objective regarding payment and securities settlement systems
                            and their oversight activities to be carried out in this area, is to ensure the “safe,
                            uninterrupted, efficient and effective functioning of the systems”. As stated in
                            the aforementioned policy statement, ensuring the systems to operate in
                            compliance with the PFMIs is one of the main policies and activities of the CBRT
                            regarding payment and securities settlement systems.
                            The CBRT has also based the ROPSS and ROSPSS on the PFMIs.

Description           CBRT
                      The regulations are applied to all payment and securities settlement systems
                      Turkey. There is no differentiation CBRT operated or private sector operated
                      FMIs. However by its nature, there are some exceptions regarding specific
                      principles and KCs to the payment and securities settlement system owned and
                      operated by the CBRT.
                      The CBRT owns and operates a payment and securities settlement system. On the
                      other hand, there are private sector owned payment and securities settlement
                      systems. However the CBRT is responsible for the regulation and oversight of all
                      payment and securities settlement systems in Turkey. In the CBRT, separate
                      divisions are responsible for the operation and oversight of the payment and
                      securities settlement systems, and those separate divisions report to different
                      Deputy Executive Directors.
                      In the policy statement, CBRT has stated that all the systems in Turkey should
                      adopt PFMIs. If any system doesn’t comply with the principles, according to
                      Article 9 (1)-b of the PSL, the CBRT can take the appropriate measures listed in
                      the Article 9/2.

                      regulations of CMB are in compliance with CPMI-IOSCO PFMIs and all FMIs
                      operating in Turkey, under its jurisdiction, should adopt PFMIs.
                      Additionally in the policy statement, ensuring that the FMIs to operate in
                      compliance with the PFMIs is listed among the main policies pursued by the CMB
                      in order to ensure the safe, uninterrupted, efficient and effective functioning of
                      capital markets.
                      The principles are applied to all FMIs under supervision of CMB regardless of the
                      ownership structures that are regulated with CML.
                      The CMB has the powers as noted in the discussion on Responsibility A and B,
                      to require the FMIs to address any gaps identified in the assessments against the
                      PFMIs.
Key conclusions for
Responsibility D      The CBRT and the CMB have issued policy statements articulating their adoption
                      of the PFMIs. In the case of the CBRT it has required all the payment and securities
                      settlement systems in its purview to adopt the PFMIs and has already completed
                      the self-assessment against the PFMIs for the FMIs operated by it. The CBRT in
                      addition has asked the Takasbank and the MKK, to complete self-assessments as
                      SSS.

                      The CMB has sought the Takasbank and the MKK to complete self-assessments

                                  payment and securities settlement systems. The other authority in securities
                                  settlement systems area is the CMB. The CBRT and CMB discuss and

                                  Stability Committee (FSC). This committee is primarily responsible for
                                  financial stability and systemic risk which also includes the area regarding
                                  FMIs.
                                  The FSC provides the coordination for the cooperation among relevant

                                  The FSC provides the coordination for the cooperation among relevant
                                  institutions on FMIs in Turkey. One of the main duties of the FSC is to
                                  determine and monitor systemic risks and to identify necessary measures and
                                  policy proposals in order to mitigate them. In this context, participating
                                  authorities also can discuss how they can support each other while fulfilling
                                  their responsibilities.
                                  Additionally there are mandatory bilateral information sharing and also ad-
                                  hoc cooperation initiatives as mentioned in Responsibility E KC 3, among
                                  relevant authorities in Turkey regarding the payment and securities
                                  settlement systems. All of these cooperation methods foster efficient and
                                  effective communication.
                                  During times of market stress or crisis situations, the FSC gathers the views
                                  of all the participants and by the help of the cooperation the decisions are
                                  made faster and more efficiently.

                      CMB
                      To foster the cooperation amongst CMB, CBRT and BRSA for their various
                      responsibilities with respect to the Takasbank and MKK, frequent meetings
                      among institutions are held for consultations on important or conflicting
                      issues when necessary.
                      All the cooperation arrangements by or including CMB derive their legal
                      basis from the Article 128 (1-ç) of the CML that gives the duty to exchange
                      information and cooperate in any manner with other financial regulatory and
                      supervisory institutions in order to ensure financial stability or fulfil the
                      requirements of national or international legislation to the CMB.
                      In terms of trade reporting, banks deal with derivatives pre-dominantly in
                      OTC mode and the BRSA has already been collecting derivatives data from
                      banks. The BRSA experts share their experiences and information about the
                      dynamics of the markets and participants. The CBRT makes contributions
                      with respect to the international regulations and relations. The CMB as
                      authorized by law, leads the project. In terms of OTC market reform, all
                      regulatory authorities have developed an efficient and effective
                      communication and consultation environment.
Key consideration 2   If an authority has identified an actual or proposed operation of
                      a cross-border or multicurrency FMI in its jurisdiction, the
                      authority should, as soon as it is practicable, inform other
                      relevant authorities that may have an interest in the FMI’s
                      observance of the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for financial market
                      infrastructures.
Description
                      CBRT
                      Takasbank provides multicurrency services. Takasbank (SSS) processes
                      transactions in USD and EUR. But CBRT did not notify other related central
                      banks and relevant authorities on these operations because of low transaction
                      volume (Takasbank’s total trading volume in 2015 for all the foreign
                      currencies is around 350 million US dollars).
                      CMB

                      MKK as a CSD, has a link with the Austrian Central Securities Depository
                      (OeKB) for free of payment transfers of securities and corporate actions that
                      are listed on both Vienna stock exchange and BIST.

                      Foreign CSDs’ opening accounts at MKK and MKK’s opening accounts at
                      foreign CSDs are subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of the
                      CMB according to the regulations. The CBRT is also informed about these.

Key consideration 3   Authorities should apply these principles consistently within and
                      across jurisdictions, including across borders, and to each type of
                      FMI covered by the principles
Description           CBRT
                      Forms of cooperation
                      The relevant authorities cooperate through the FSC. The FSC provides the
                      forum for the cooperation among relevant institutions on FMIs in Turkey.




                                     182
                      In addition to this, there is bilateral information sharing obligation among
                      authorities with respect to relevant regulations.
                      Additionally relevant authorities use ad-hoc methods like the ones mentioned
                      below for cooperation in Turkey;
                      -Informal communications with related authorities.
                      -Arranging meetings on issues regarding the related authorities.
                      -Consulting other related authorities on issues that may affect the decisions
                      of other authorities or on new regulations related to FMIs.
                      -Cooperation by forming ad-hoc working groups.
                      In addition there is a Financial Sector Committee which comprises of the
                      representatives of the same institutions as in the FSC, represented at a more
                      operational level. This meets twice a year and FMIs are also discussed in
                      this committee.

                      Efficiency and effectiveness of cooperation

                      In the FSC there are five participant authorities. The Undersecretariat of the
                      Treasury is responsible for managing the FSC and promotes efficiency and
                      effectiveness by taking the views of the participants. So the cooperation in
                      the committee ensures efficiency and effectiveness in terms of decisions to
                      be made in the payments area.
                      Furthermore, the ad-hoc cooperation methods mentioned above can also be
                      effective during the periods when authorities need to cooperate swiftly.
                      CMB
                      Forms of cooperation

                      According to Article 128 (1-ç) of the CML, one of the duties of the CMB is
                      to exchange information and cooperate in any manner with other financial
                      regulatory and supervisory institutions in order to ensure financial stability
                      and fulfil the requirements of national or international legislation.

                      Efficiency and effectiveness of cooperation

                      The authorities are in constant communication with each other and there is
                      easy access to related personnel. Ad-hoc cooperation methods mentioned
                      above are also used during the periods when authorities need to cooperate
                      swiftly.
                      The FSC provides a forum to secure consensus of all the relevant agencies
                      with respect to areas related to financial stability and the overall financial
                      sector topics.
Key consideration 4   For an FMI where cooperative arrangements are appropriate, at
                      least one authority should accept responsibility for establishing
                      efficient and effective cooperation among all relevant authorities.
                      In international cooperative arrangements where no other
                      authority accepts this responsibility, the presumption is the

                      authority or authorities with primary responsibility in the FMI’s
                      home jurisdiction should accept this responsibility
Description
                      The FSC is responsible for establishing efficient and effective cooperation
                      among all relevant authorities. The Undersecretariat of the Treasury is
                      responsible for the functioning of the FSC.
                      All authorities are responsible for acting on issues under their jurisdictions
                      according to their relevant legal powers.
                      The results of the FSC meetings and the decisions of the committee are
                      presented to the Council of Ministers by, the Chair of the FSC.
                      In cases where a negative development that could spread over to the entire
                      financial system occurs and such development is detected by the FSC, the
                      Council of Ministers shall be in charge to determine the measures to be taken
                      and all the relevant institutions and agencies are competent and responsible
                      for promptly implementation of measures taken.
                      In this context, The Undersecretariat of the Treasury set the meeting dates,
                      determines the agenda and informs the participants regarding the next steps.
Key consideration 5   At least one authority should ensure that the FMI is periodically
                      assessed against the principles and should, in developing these
                      assessments, consult with other authorities that conduct the
                      supervision or oversight of the FMI and for which the FMI is
                      systemically important
Description           CBRT
                      The CBRT ensures that the payment and securities settlement systems are
                      periodically assessed against the PFMIs. Additionally, the CBRT oversees
                      these systems pursuant to the PSL. The CBRT also cooperates with other
                      authorities that conduct the supervision/oversight of the systemically
                      important payment and securities settlement systems in Turkey.
                      The specific legal basis for oversight derives from the PSL, article 8 (1). Also
                      the payment and securities settlement systems perform self-assessments
                      pursuant to Article 8 of ROSPSS once a year.
                      The specific provisions of the ROSPSS are:
                      “
                      Article 8– (1) The system operator shall carry out self-assessment related to
                      the system at least once a year and share the self-assessment report with the
                      Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey.
                      (2) Self-assessment activities that are performed pursuant to the first
                      paragraph of this Article shall be carried out so as to measure system
                      operator’s observance level to policy, rules, principles, standards and such
                      considerations declared by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey with
                      regard to the systems.
                      (3) Self-assessment that is carried out by the system operator constitutes
                      inputs to oversight activities that are conducted by the Central Bank of the




                                      184
Republic of Turkey , but it is not binding for the assessments the Central Bank
of the Republic of Turkey related to the system.
(4) The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey is authorized to set out the
principles and procedures related to self-assessment activities that are
conducted by the system operator.

According to Articles 9 (15), 9 (16) and 9 (28) of the ROPSS, in case that the
subject of activity of the applicant institution is under the scope of another
regulation, the CBRT shares information with the related authority regarding
the application for license. The specific provisions are as below:
“
Article 9- (15) In case that the subject of activity of the applicant institution
is under the scope of Capital Market Law No. 6362, dated 6/12/2012, Bank
shall share information with Capital Market Board regarding the operation
license application . The Capital Market Board shall share information with
the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey regarding applications made to
the Capital Market Board, in case applicant institution is a system operator.
(16) In case that the subject of activity of the applicant institution is under
the scope of Banking Law No. 5411, dated 19/10/2005 or Bank Cards and
Credit Cards Law No. 5464, dated 23/2/2006, Bank shall share information
with the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency regarding operation
license application. The Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency shall
share information with the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey regarding
applications made to the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency, in
case applicant institution is a system operator.
"
The ROPSS, article 28 also articulates the provisions related to the co-
operation with the CMB and the BRSA. The specific provisions are”
“
Article 28- (1) Developments regarding the system operator and system
participants to be notified to Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency
and Capital Markets Board in accordance with the relevant legislations or
detected by themselves, and that may disrupt smooth operation of the system,
shall be shared with the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey by these
authorities.
(2) The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey shall share the developments
which are notified to the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey pursuant to
the legislations or which are detected by the Central Bank of the Republic of
Turkey, itself, and that can disrupt smooth functioning of the system with
competent authorities. Among these developments, the Central Bank of the
Republic of Turkey shall share the ones that may disrupt the smooth
operation of the institutions operating under the scope of Law Nr.5411 or
Law Nr.5464 with the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency; and the
ones that may have a negative impact on smooth operation of the institutions
operating under the scope of Law Nr.6362 with the Capital Market Board.

CCPs are supervised, overseen and regulated by the CML, article 78 that
gives the authority to the CMB. The specific provisions are:
“
Article 78/3: Principles regarding guarantees that central clearing
institutions that are to provide central counterparty services would take from
their members as well as principles concerning the guarantee fund within
their organization shall be determined by the Board upon the proposal of the
related clearing institution.
Article 78/4: For capital market instruments subject to the central
counterparty practice, conditions related to clearing membership and
membership types including the obligations of members and minimum
requirements concerning capital, internal audit and risk management shall
be established by the related clearing institution upon taking the approval of
the Board,
Article 78/5: Central clearing institutions that are to provide central
counterparty services must have and maintain an adequate level of capital in
line with the financial risks they have undertaken in the related capital
market instruments and other risks, establish and maintain a data processing
infrastructure as well as internal control, risk management and internal audit
systems. The internal audit units of these institutions are obliged to control
the reliability and adequacy of their risk management and data processing
infrastructures as a minimum at six month intervals and to notify the Board
of the results. The Board may decide the related control be made more
frequently and require an independent audit to be conducted with regard to
the issues mentioned above. Furthermore, the Board is authorized to require
the financial adequacy of the institution that is to provide central
counterparty services to be assessed with methods it would specify, including
stress tests, and to request a credit rating to be assigned in cases where it
deems necessary.
Article 78/6: In order to maintain financial stability, The Board may impose
additional obligations including capital requirements on these institutions of
systemic importance and their members.
“
On the other hand, the bylaw on CCP services of Takasbank contains detailed
requirements for Takasbank as a CCP. The policy statement issued by the
CMB determines the general periodic assessments of FMIs against the
principles under the supervision of CMB.
Additionally, according to Article 128 of the CML, one of the responsibilities
of CMB is to exchange information and cooperate in any manner with other
financial regulatory and supervisory institutions in order to ensure financial
stability and fulfil the requirements of national or international legislation.
Within this context, under normal circumstances, CMB shares assessments
with other authorities on demand or will consult on issues that may cause
conflicts. Other than these the CMB can share assessments when there are
material risks noted or discovered as part of review of the assessments that




               186
                      may cause problems or may affect the evaluations of other authorities
                      regarding the FMIs.

Key consideration 6   When assessing an FMI’s payment and securities settlement
                      arrangements and its related liquidity risk-management
                      procedures in any currency for which the FMI’s settlements are
                      systemically important against the principles, the authority or
                      authorities with primary responsibility with respect to the FMI
                      should consider the views of the central banks of issue. If a
                      central bank of issue is required under its responsibilities to
                      conduct its own assessment of these arrangements and
                      procedures, the central bank should consider the views of the
                      authority or authorities with primary responsibility with respect
                      to the FMI
Description
                      The CBRT, as the regulatory and oversight authority for payment and
                      securities settlement systems, assesses the FMI’s payment and securities
                      settlement arrangements and its related liquidity risk management procedures
                      for all of the currencies which are subject to the transactions processed in the
                      FMI.
                      The CBRT is the primary authority for the regulation and oversight of
                      payment and securities settlement systems and it is the only issuer for TRY.
                      Takasbank (SSS) processes transactions in USD and EUR. But CBRT did
                      not notify other related central banks and relevant authorities on the
                      operations of the FMI because of low transaction volume (Takasbank’s total
                      trading volume in 2015 for all the foreign currencies is 350 million US
                      dollars).
                      The CBRT has the powers to seek and share information from relevant
                      central banks and other authorities, if needed.
Key consideration 7   Relevant authorities should provide advance notification, where
                      practicable and otherwise as soon as possible thereafter,
                      regarding pending material regulatory changes and adverse
                      events with respect to the FMI that may significantly affect
                      another authority’s regulatory, supervisory, or oversight
                      interests.
Description           CBRT
                      The ROPSS, article 28, explicitly lays out the sharing of information on any
                      incidents or developments with any payment and securities settlement
                      systems in its oversight. The article also enjoins other regulators and
                      authorities to notify the CBRT if they become aware of any issues which may
                      affect the functioning of the payment and securities settlement systems in the
                      purview of the CBRT.

“
The CBRT takes and considers the view of other authorities, as and when
needed. For instance, during the preparation of the PSL and the secondary
regulations, the CBRT sought the views of the CMB and the BRSA and also
other stakeholders and addressed them accordingly.
CMB
According to Article 128 (1-ç) of the CML, one of the responsibilities of the
CMB is to exchange information and cooperate in any manner with other
financial regulatory and supervisory authorities in order to ensure financial
stability and/or fulfil the requirements of national or international legislation.
CMB, BRSA and CBRT provide advance notification and get consultation
for all pending material regulatory changes and adverse events with respect
to MKK and Takasbank that may significantly affect the respective
regulatory, supervisory or oversight interests of CBRT within the limits of
CML.
Information sharing with foreign authorities are covered by the article 128
(1-d) of CML, as one of the responsibilities of the CMB:
“Cooperating in any manner in relation to capital markets and signing
bilateral or multilateral memoranda of understanding in accordance with the
principles of reciprocity and the protection of professional confidentiality,
with corresponding foreign institutions that are authorised to regulate and
supervise capital markets, in order to exchange information, meet requests
for document, inspecting the headquarters, branch offices or subsidiaries or
affiliates located in Turkey of institutions performing activities in the capital
markets of foreign countries as well as in the bodies from which they
outsource within the framework of a written contract and to take the
necessary administrative measures, share the expenditures related to the
activities to be carried out in this context”
Additionally, CMB as the supervisory and oversight authority for CCPs,
CSDs and TRs considers the views of other relevant authorities as
appropriate and make necessary amendments or take necessary actions with
best effort and good faith along with considerations to the restrictions in
CML, if any.




                188
                      For example, during the drafting and adoptiong of the CML and the bylaw
                      on CCP Services of Takasbank, the CMB sought the views of the CBRT,
                      BRSA and other related authorities and made necessary amendments where
                      appropriate.

Key consideration 8   Relevant authorities should coordinate to ensure timely access to
                      trade data recorded in a TR.
Description
                      CBRT
                      The CBRT does not regulate or oversee a TR.
                       CMB
                      Article 87 (3) of CML covers the access to the trade recorded in a TR. The
                      article states that “Sharing of information kept at trade repositories with third
                      persons, including public legal entities, shall be subject to the approval of the
                      Board. The legislation concerning the usage of personal data shall be
                      complied with in the implementation of this paragraph.”
                      The CMB has prepared the secondary regulation for TRs and is in the process
                      of stakeholder consultation.

Key consideration 9   Each authority maintains its discretion to discourage the use of an
                      FMI or the provision of services to such an FMI if, in the
                      authority’s judgment, the FMI is not prudently designed or
                      managed or the principles are not adequately observed. An
                      authority exercising such discretion should provide a clear
                      rationale for the action taken both to the FMI and to the authority
                      or authorities with primary responsibility for the supervision or
                      oversight of the FMI.
Description
                      The article 9 (1.c) of the PSL empowers to take a set of actions outlined in
                      article 9.2 of the PSL, in the event that the CBRT notes any impact to safety,
                      stability and soundness of the system. The article 9 (3), requires the operator
                      of the payment and securities settlement system to be notified of any action
                      that will be taken. The Article 9.1 also covers other scenarios like the operator
                      is not managing the system in accordance with the law or is functioning
                      against the terms of license.

                      The article 96,97,98 and 103 of the CML, provides is a broad range of powers
                      to apply fines, seek changes in policies and procedures and also change in
                      management in the event of any unlicensed activities, deterioration in
                      financial position and failure to adhere to any regulations or directives from
                      the CMB.

                      The general provisions related to sharing information amongst the BRSA,
                      CMB and the CBRT discussed earlier are applicable in these scenarios as
                      well.

                      Having said this, so far, the CBRT and the CMB have never needed to
                      exercise discretion to discourage the use of an FMI, or the provision of
                      services to an FMI, on the grounds that it is not prudently designed or
                      managed, or the principles are not adequately observed.

Key consideration 10   Cooperative arrangements between authorities in no way
                       prejudice the statutory or legal or other powers of each
                       participating authority, nor do these arrangements constrain in
                       any way an authority’s powers to fulfil its statutory or legislative
                       mandate or its discretion to act in accordance with those powers.
                       The co-operative arrangements are consistent with the legal and regulatory
                       powers of the respective authorities.
Key conclusions for    The legal and regulatory measures governing the functioning of the CBRT
Responsibility E       and the CMB allow data sharing amongst them and with other related
                       authorities, in particular the BRSA which regulates the Takasbank as a
                       banking institution.

                       The FSC provides the structured mechanism for sharing, analyzing and
                       resolving any issues related to the financial sector that may impact financial
                       stability. This mechanism is also used for FMI related discussions.

                       There are also other ad-hoc mechanisms in place to share and seek
                       information and collaborate on an as needed basis.


Assessment of          Observed

                                 AUTHORITIES RESPONSE

The CMB and the CBRT strongly support the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
performed by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank and believe in its contributions
to the efforts for enhancing the soundness of financial market infrastructures in member
countries.

The assessment’s results gave relevant authorities an external opinion on the condition of the
FMIs in Turkey and helped them to understand the issues that require attention in this area.
The CBRT is pleased that the FSAP team’s assessment of the CBRT’s payment and securities
settlement systems and the relevant authorities broadly indicates compliance with the principles
and Responsibilities mentioned in PFMIs and in general, the CBRT agrees with the findings
and assessments of the FSAP team and appreciates the recommendations for further
improvement of the CBRT’s payment and securities settlement systems.

On the other hand the Turkish authorities welcome the opportunity to mention the following
comments:

CBRT’s Official Comments on Assessment of Observance of the PFMIs for CBRT’s
Payment and Securities Settlement Systems

Principle 3 (Framework for the Comprehensive Management of Risks)

The Risk Management Framework (RMF) of the CBRT Payment Systems was referring to the
interlinked FMIs.

By considering the FSAP recommendation, the Risk Management Framework (RMF) has been
reviewed and modified to explicitly emphasize that all risks related with systems’ participants
and the ones arising from or to linkages and interdependencies including the interlinked FMIs
and third-party service providers are considered while the risks are mitigated. The revised RMF
is being used in its 2016 application.

Principle 7 (Liquidity Risks)

As stated in the FSAP report, “the CBRT itself is not exposed to any liquidity risk as the
operator of the EFT System.”

However, despite the fact that the PFMI itself highlights the liquidity risk of the FMI operator
rather than that for the participants, and that all the key questions of the Assessment
Methodology are related to the liquidity risk of FMI operator and there is no specific key
question on the liquidity risk for the participants, the recommendations and the assessment
regarding the Principle 7 focus on the liquidity risk for the participants. Hence, the CBRT
believes that the current assessment and rating does not reflect the compliance level of the EFT
System with respect to Principle 7.

Principle 13 (Participant Default Rules and Procedures)

Although the Default Management Procedure for the Participants of the CBRT Payment
Systems has not been tested as a whole together with the participants yet, the facilities used in



                                              191
the procedure were tested together with the participants. The CBRT has planned a test for the
procedure in its yearly test plan, but does not deem necessary to include all the participants in
the test.

Principle 17 (Operational Risk)

Currently, the provisions of the Emergency Guide of the CBRT Payment Systems support the
PSOR provisions related to the operational risk. The Business Continuity Application Plan of
the PSD (BCAP) has recently been developed in line with the CBRT’s institutional business
continuity study and will replace the existing documents. A part of the BCAP, the Participant
Guideline, which is soon to be finalized upon the feedback of the participants, includes
provisions to meet the recommendation on including specific mandates with respect to business
continuity management for its participants and having a mechanism to access compliance.

The CBRT has already identified the critical participants of the Systems through a network
analysis based on sink-rank model. The CBRT has started to work more closely with these
participants and plans to apply more stringent operational risk management measures for them.
In this regard, a working group on operational risk was also founded at the Banks Association
of Turkey with the participation of systemically important participants and the CBRT.

Moreover, the CBRT has already been working on the issues related to the recommendations
to incorporate more structural assessment of operational risk for other FMIs and to include
more complex scenarios in the revised continuity plan as a result of this assessment. As stated
in the response to the assessment of the Principle 3, the revised RMF explicitly considers the
risks related to the interlinked FMIs, and based on this consideration two FMIs, which are also
participants of the CBRT Payment Systems, have been identified as critical participants.

Principle 19 (Tiered Participant Arrangements)

The financial sector of Turkey is mainly composed of banks and all banks except a very small
one are direct participants of the CBRT Payment Systems. Nevertheless, for the fulfillment of
the PFMI’s recommendations on tiered participation, the CBRT has instituted a mechanism by
using its power in PSOR in order to assess the risks arising from the tiered arrangements. To
this end, the CBRT has started to collect and analyze the relevant information from the
System’s participants about their non-bank financial customers through periodical
questionnaires.

CMB’s Official Comments on Assessment of Observance of the Responsibilities of Relevant
Authorities for FMIs

The CMB would like to extend its sincerest thanks to FSAP team for carrying out the
assessment of observance of the CPMI-IOSCO principles for financial market infrastructures.
The detailed assessment of responsibilities of CMB has served a great opportunity to CMB to
detect the areas which need improvement.

The CMB is committed to follow PFMIs for the FMIs under its responsibility and has the goal
to work towards implementing the FSAP’s recommendations.

On the other hand, the CMB also wishes to underline some issues regarding FSAP’s
recommendations to serve a better understanding of CMB’s road map and some practical issues



                                              192
Under Authorities Responsibility A, the assessment refers to lack of regulatory framework for
TRs and recommends the CMB should ensure that it issues a regulation/communique on TRs,
before it accords approval to the MKK to commence its operations as a TR.

The Implementing Regulation on Procedures Concerning TR’s Activities and The
Communiqué on Reporting Obligations to TRs have been drafted and sent to related authorities
and professional associations for consultation or proposal in March 2016. Trade reporting
requirements and MKK’s operational conditions are regulated through these regulations. The
draft regulations are planned to be revised based on the proposals received and finalized in the
second half of 2016. After adoption of the regulations, related parties will be given time for
adaptation. First reporting of transactions are expected to take place as of 2017.

The recommendation under the Authorities Responsibility B requires CMB to consider
assigning specific responsibilities to staff with respect to the FMIs in its scope.

Before being merged with Intermediary Activities Department as a result of an organizational
re-structuring process, formerly Market Oversight and Regulation Department of CMB used
to be exclusively responsible for central clearing and central depository institutions as well as
exchanges. After merger, the Intermediary Activities Department is responsible for FMIs as
well as investment firms and investment services. Thus, employees of this department are
working on both fields as a result of their job definitions.

The Turkish authorities look forward to continuing the dialogue with the FSAP team to work
to improve the FMIs in Turkey.
