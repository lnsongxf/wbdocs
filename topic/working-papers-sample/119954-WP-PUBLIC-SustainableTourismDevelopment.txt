20 Reasons Sustainable Tourism
Counts For Development
Sustainable tourism is a proven tool for development, benefitting
communities in destinations around the world. As demand for
global tourism continues to grow, the opportunities for sustainable
development also increase. This report aims to raise awareness
of sustainable tourism as a powerful and effective tool for
development, leveraging the momentum generated by the United
Nations designating 2017 as the International Year of “Sustainable
Tourism for Development”.

More than 50 years after the World Bank financed its first tourism for
development projects in Morocco and Tunisia,1 the case for tourism as
a sustainable development model is still a compelling one. Tourism is
highly labor intensive, facilitates the development of new infrastructure,
helps fund conservation, revitalizes modern and historic cities, and can
contribute to international understanding. Despite these benefits, tourism
is more often viewed as a luxury for those who can afford it, rather than a
nimble development tool.

This paper challenges development professionals to embrace the broad,
cross-cutting potential of tourism to enhance the lives of those living in
existing and emerging destinations.




Sustainable Tourism is defined as:
“Tourism that takes full account of its current and
future economic, social, and environmental impacts,
addressing the needs of visitors, the industry,
the environment, and host communities.”
(UNWTO, 2016)

Sustainable Economic Growth
Tourism’s broad-reaching economic benefits


1. Stimulates GDP Growth
Travel and tourism make up the largest service industry
in the world and it continues to grow. This industry
stimulates Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in host
countries and contributes substantially to government
tax revenues. Worth USD7.6 trillion dollars, the travel
and tourism sector accounts for more than 10% of global
GDP, and represents 7% of all international trade and
30% of the world’s export in services.4 Tourism receipts
provide an important source of foreign exchange
for countries around the world, enabling economic
growth and investment in a multitude of other sectors.
In 2016, tourism grew by 3.1%, outperforming the global
economy’s growth of 2.5%.5

2. Increases International Trade
International tourism exports have surpassed the growth of world trade
over the past four years.6 Worth USD1.4 trillion in export earnings, tourism
is the third largest global export, after chemicals and fuels, and ranked
ahead of automotive products and food.7 From 2010 to 2015, export
earnings from international tourism grew by nearly 25%, outpacing
automotive manufacturing at 22%, food at 19%, and chemicals at 9%.8
Additionally, tourism can help open new markets, resulting in the export
of new products. The growth of European tourists in Nepal, for example,
led to the rapid rise of pashmina exports to the West.9 Tourism is shown
to drive the growth of trade in countries like Nicaragua, Chile, Venezuela,
and the Dominican Republic.10 Firms in Arizona were 30 to 50% more likely
to trade with their Mexican counterparts, if their management had visited
Mexico for leisure or business.11

5. Supports Low-Income Economies
Tourism is particularly important for less developed and low-
income economies. In 2015, the world’s 48 lower income and lower
middle income countries received 29 million international tourist
arrivals (nearly a threefold increase in a decade) and earned USD21
billion from international tourism. Tourism is the first or second
largest source of export earnings in 20 of the 48 UN-classified Least
Developed Countries (LDCs).19

Tourism accounted for 26.5% of exports in Cambodia, and is expected
to grow by 11.8% in 2017.20 Tourism makes up 73% of exports in Sao
Tome and Principe, and is projected to increase by 8.4% in the
coming year.21 Tourism accounts for over 25% of GDP in at least
seven Small Island Developing States (SIDS)22, and 10 LDCs have
seen triple-digit growth in tourism arrivals since 2009, underscoring
the growing importance of tourism.23 The sector was a key driver for
the graduation of Samoa, Cabo Verde and the Maldives from LDC
status, and of other LDCs soon to graduate.24

8. Strengthens Rural Communities
From a policy perspective, rural tourism is about economic
diversification: creating jobs for rural youth, ethnic minorities,
women and marginalized people; alleviating poverty; and
preserving heritage and culture.33 China has been promoting rural
tourism as an effective way to alleviate poverty since 2009, when
it implemented the National Rural Tourism Development Program
(2009-2015) allowing the country to grow rural tourism at the
national level.34 China estimates that by 2020, two billion travelers
will visit three million rural tourism businesses annually, lifting two
million people in rural areas out of poverty every year.35 Revenues
from rural tourism reached nearly USD82.7 billion in 2016, up 30%
from the year before.

Similar impacts are found in other regions. Evidence from six southern
African countries (Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia,
and Zimbabwe) found that employment generation and income
opportunities for the local communities from ecotourism reduced
poverty levels.36 In Thailand, poverty rates are around 10% lower in
villages next to protected areas, which are typically large tourism
demand drivers and generate tourism business opportunities.37
In Namibia, communal conservancies are considered one of the most
innovative conservation models in the world, not only protecting
the nation’s wildlife, but allowing for inventive tourism partnerships
that create jobs and attract visitors who travel to see the flourishing
wildlife populations. In 2011, Namibia’s Community Based National
Resource Management Program generated almost USD3.7 million
in direct benefits (cash returns to conservancies, employment
remuneration, and in-kind contributions) to communities, and
created 1,512 full-time jobs and 11,223 part-time jobs.38




Tourism has the potential to reach
and benefit large numbers of people.

                   9. Revitalizes Urban Areas
                   Improving the competitiveness of cities is an increasingly important pathway
                   to ending extreme poverty.39 By 2050, the urban population will rise to
                   66%, or six billion people, with growth concentrated in Asia and Africa.40
                   Many cities will continue to pursue tourism-based urban regeneration for
                   its potential to create jobs, improve infrastructure, and attract investments.41

                   The 1997 opening of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao catapulted the
                   Spanish city, once affected by terrorism and lagging industry, to fame.
                   This gave rise to the ‘Bilbao effect’, whereby a city is positively transformed for
                   residents, tourists, and investors by a new museum.42 Of the museum’s one
                   million annual visitors, 70% are international, most of whom stay overnight
                   and travel on to Basque Country, spreading the economic impact of tourism
                   beyond the urban center.43 By actively promoting tourism, the South African
                   cities of Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban have benefited from economic
                   growth and employment, and improved local assets, such as waterfronts,
                   cultural attractions, business centers, retail, and festivals and events.
                   These cities now capture one-third of the national tourism expenditure.44

                   When Singapore integrated tourism development into urban planning, the
                   city-state enhanced the quality of life for its residents and gained a reputation
                   as a vibrant global city. Since 1964, when Singapore first created its tourism
                   board, visitation has increased from 100,000 to nearly 13 million international
                   tourists a year.45, 46

                   10. Improves Access to Income via Travel Tech
                   Tourism is leading the way in upscaling the sharing economy through
                   technology, which is transforming the way travel is researched, purchased,
                   provided and experienced. It also offers many new, more informal ways to
                   earn money through tourism, that allow people to leverage existing resources,
                   such as their home, their culinary traditions or a car. Through home-rental
                   platforms like Airbnb and VRBO (Vacation Rentals By Owner), locals can
                   rent out their homes to visitors looking for an authentic travel experience,
                   which results in more money staying in the local economy. Online travel
                   agencies and rating systems are levelling the playing fields and providing new
                   opportunities for entrepreneurs to reach broad bases of customers.

11. Benefits Women
Tourism is one of the few sectors where female labor participation is already
above parity in some regions.47 According to the International Labour
Organization’s analysis of tourism, poverty reduction, and gender equality in
2013, women make up 60 to 70% of all workers in the tourism industry. In the
Caribbean, women’s participation in the hotel and restaurant industry ranges
between 43% and 63%.48


“Tourism also offers women the opportunity for social,
professional and economic empowerment, especially
through the sharing economy.”
It is estimated that more than one million women host on Airbnb, making up 55% of
the global Airbnb community who earned more than USD10 billion on the platform.
In Kenya, the typical female host makes enough to cover one-third of the average
annual household expenditures.49 As a result of tourism’s comparative advantage
for women, gender development strategies are starting to incorporate tourism
as a critical sector for women’s economic and social advancement.50


12. Bolsters Artisans
Artisans benefit from selling goods to tourists, and eventually the world.
The global market for artisan crafts is significant and continues to expand:
world exports of artisan products rose from a value of USD17.5 billion in 2002
to USD32 billion in 2008, an increase of 87%.51 According to the Creative Economy
Report 2008, arts and crafts is the only creative industry where developing
countries have a leading position in the global market, generating 65% of all
artisanal revenues.

Tourism and the expansion of leisure and art markets have contributed to the
dynamism of arts and crafts in the world market.52 United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) also calls attention to the
importance of selling artisan products to tourists in its Crafts and Tourism Index,
citing country-specific spending. The organization estimates that tourists spend
an average of USD5.5 per day on crafts while visiting Latvia. Spending ranges by
country with USD35.29 per tourist in Mexico and USD62.9 in Ecuador.53

14. Raises Climate Change Awareness
Tourism is often an innovator of sustainable consumption
and production, and climate change awareness. There are
many examples of tourism resorts introducing wind and
solar power, organic farming, and sustainable fisheries
to communities that would not otherwise be exposed to
these environmental advances. This triggers a sustainability
multiplier effect on the local community and often a
certification or award of some kind. The Sustainable Tourism
Program of the 10-Year Framework of Program (10YFP) on
Sustainable Consumption and Production,60 highlights the
case of St Kitts and Nevis in the Caribbean, where sustainable
tourism initiatives resulted in a reduction of 80,000 gallons
per year in fuel imports and put a megawatt of solar energy
back on the grid.61 A number of tourism companies have also
introduced carbon-offset programs like United Airlines’ Eco-
Skies CarbonChoice, which calculates each traveler’s carbon
footprint and goes beyond offsetting to invest in projects
that reduce carbon and give back to the destination.62

The Blue Economy is now understood as use         The Nature Conservancy estimates that
of the sea and its resources for sustainable      coral reefs generate income of USD36 billion

16. Protects Cultural Sites
Tourism plays an important role in cultural heritage management, funding,
and protection. Cultural tourism is an important tourism segment, and
visitor spending on entrance tickets, guides and souvenirs contributes
to capital needed for the protection of important sites.69 The UNWTO
Silk Road Program, with 33 member states, is an outstanding example
of cultural route protection through tourism.70 Other examples include
territorial cohesion and intercultural dialogue among countries in the
Mediterranean basin covering the Umayyad Route.71 The UNESCO World
Heritage List currently holds 1,052 properties, 814 of which are cultural.
Research shows that, apart from heritage conservation, tourism growth is
one of the outcomes pursued by countries when nominating their national
sites.72 Ensuring the protection of these sites remains the basis for their
inscription in the World Heritage List, but disseminating their values and
facilitating heritage interpretation to locals and visitors are vital as well.


17. Sustains Intangible Culture
Intangible cultural heritage, music, performing arts, and oral traditions
can also be revived or protected by tourism.73 The Tanzania Tourist Board
has supported local communities in over 50 destinations to organize
cultural excursions, which not only shared Tanzania’s cultural diversity
with its 70,000 annual tourists, it preserved that culture, and generated
income for 3,000 local people.74 Through tourism business, the Los Uros
community in Peru’s Lake Titicaca were able to preserve its crafts and
traditional boating. In Mali, a tour-guide training and safeguarding project
protected Dogon masks and dance performances, while also creating
unique tourism experiences.75

Tourism fosters international collaboration and understanding




18. Spreads Philanthropy
Tourism can be an effective way to engage visitors in philanthropy. Often seeing
a situation firsthand can change the way people empathize with those in need.
In 2016, Americans gave more than USD390 billion in charitable donations, showing
the potential of travel philanthropy.76 A growing number of businesses are providing
philanthropic opportunities to their guests. A hotel association in Torres del Paine,
Chile, offers a voluntary contribution for a community fund at the point of checkout.
The Torres del Paine Legacy Fund sees tourism growth as an opportunity to leave
positive impact - transforming each new arrival into means of improving conservation
efforts and addressing social issues in Torres del Paine and its surrounding
communities.77 Volunteer tourism has also grown rapidly since 1990, with an estimated
1.6 million participants annually. Though volun-tourists have been criticized, tourists
have also positively impacted their host communities by providing medical assistance,
educational services, agricultural workers, and ecological conservation help.78


19. Cultivates Intercultural Understanding
Tourism fosters peace, intercultural understanding, and global citizenship.
Meeting diverse peoples and experiencing other cultures play a critical role in
reducing stereotypes and promoting peace, security, and intercultural understanding.
Research by the WTTC and the Institute of Economics and Peace found that countries
with a more open and sustainable tourism sector tend to be more peaceful.79
Accommodation exchanges, a phenomenon that is trending upwards in travel, help
foster new social ties and cultural learning, as guests often interact with hosts.80
Tourism also leads to regional cooperation to create shared tourism products and
to welcome more tourists. The Africa Union (AU) and the African Development Bank
are implementing an open visa policy for members of the AU to encourage the free
movement of people, and boost tourism and trade. Travel and tourism in Africa is now
forecasted to rise.81 Travel can also promote family bonding, healing, self-reflection
and renewal. The break from the routine at home can enable new conversations,
develop new skills or passions, and forge new bonds through those memories.82

Tourism has served as a post-conflict recovery tool for many
destinations. Rwanda rebranded itself as a nature-based tourism
destination and is now recognized for its mountain gorillas rather than
conflict.83 The Rwandan government’s prioritization of sustainable
tourism development not only brought new inclusive job models,
community support and growth, but brought improved infrastructure
to the country, which contributed to post-conflict stabilization.84
Sierra Leone is currently launching a new tourism strategy to revamp
a sector that had been negatively affected by the Ebola crisis.85
Following the years of wars in the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, the
Croatian National Tourist Board has pivoted its strategic direction and
marketed the country, which has led to great grains in tourism and new
income, and stability as a by-product. The tourism sector also made efforts
to establish cross-border travel and exchanges, which were important for
re-establishing contact with former enemies and building peace in the
region.86 In Sri Lanka the tourism industry took an active role in promoting
peacebuilding and helped the country recover post-conflict.86
