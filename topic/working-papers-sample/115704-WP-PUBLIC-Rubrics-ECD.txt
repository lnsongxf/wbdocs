                                                        Guidelines for Rubric Scoring
   1.   Scores for sub-indicators, indicators, policy levers, and policy goals should be marked directly in rubric for easy reference in the future.
   2.   For each sub-indicator- decide score: Latent: 1 point, Emerging 2 points, Established: 3 points, Advanced: 4 points
   3.   Take average of sub-indicators for overall indicator score
   4.   Take average of all indicators within each policy lever for overall policy lever score
   5.   Take average of 3 policy lever scores for each policy goal score
   6.   Use the following delineation of each score to indicate level of development
