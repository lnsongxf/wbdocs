as measured through impact or process evaluations or program administrative data,
as available; and a discussion of the key factors that likely contributed to those results.
Readers who might be interested in replicating a particular approach are encouraged to
consult the references to gain further insights.
  Following are important questions to consider when exploring potential adaptations of
these approaches:
•	 Is the problem that this approach seeks to address similar to the problem in the new
   context? (e.g., low take-up of ECD services, poor nutrition, lack of stimulating home
   environments for disadvantaged children)
•	 Does the capacity exist to implement this approach in a similar manner, or would
   significant modifications need to be made?
•	 On what types of background infrastructure (physical, human, legal and regulatory,
   etc.) does this approach depend? For example, does the approach require that there be
   a workforce with a particular skill set? Does it assume a certain method of delivering
   child care?
•	 Is the cost per beneficiary likely to be similar in this new context? Is this a good value
   for money given the available resources?
•	 What type of monitoring, and possibly evaluation, would be needed? Are they feasible?

make decisions about the scheduling, physical setting, and implementation features of

Community involvement and education: The program was designed to help increase the                                    None known
capacity of poor communities to engage in participatory planning that would result in new
or improved ECE services. Villages were sensitized to the importance and benefits of ECE
and provided with technical support. Technical advisors helped villagers assess existing
services and unmet needs, submit a proposal for a block grant, establish a team to manage
the grant, and identify people to serve as teachers and child development workers.

Traditional Community Welfare Homes (abbreviated as HCBs in Spanish) are led by a
“communitarian mother” (MC), who is a home-based childcare provider. Each home                                        TYPE OF INTERVENTION

Community engagement: RISE undertook community sensitization to engage the
community before starting the community preschools. School management committees
were trained and worked to support the centers.
Capacity building for the ministry: Building capacity in the MoEVT to design, develop
and produce IAI programming and materials contributed to the ministry’s ability to
take over the implementation and institutionalize the approach after just a few years of
implementation.

quality. In 2009 – 2011, with assistance from the World Bank and other development partners, the Government of Cambodia
scaled up three pilot ECD programs: formal preschools staffed by government teachers, informal preschools staffed by trained
community members, and home-based programs run by trained women from the community. Researchers worked with the
government to evaluate the programs by randomly assigning the formal preschools and the two community-based programs to
respective eligible communities.
  Across all three of the scaled-up programs, enrollment was low. Interviews with parents suggest that the costs of supplies,
inconvenient timing of the school day for work schedules, and a lack of information contributed to low enrollment in formal
preschools. Community preschools experienced difficulty retaining teachers (due in part to low stipends) and finding space,
while the home-based programs often were not even implemented. Researchers found that the three programs by and large
had no impact on children’s development or school readiness, and a subset of children in the formal preschools actually
did worse than children in the control group on cognitive skills important for school readiness. Cambodia’s experience
underscores the importance of working closely with communities to enroll children in ECD programs and of ensuring that
quality does not become diluted at scale.

Expanding Access Without Commensurate Emphasis on Quality
In South Africa, public preschool, or “Grade R” (Reception Year), is designed to prepare 5-year-old children for primary
schooling. In 2001, the government introduced the ECD Conditional Grant in order to expand access to Grade R for children
from low socio-economic status households. In 2001, less than 40% of 5-year-olds in South Africa had access to pre-primary
education. By 2011, this figure had risen to over 80%, and as of 2015 preschool participation is nearly universal. While the
country saw substantial increase in access, it faced challenges in ensuring program quality; and in many cases, learning
outcomes have not improved.
  A recent impact evaluation (see “For more information”) found that Grade R did not have a significant impact on learning
outcomes in mathematics or language for children from the three poorest wealth income quintiles. This suggests that the
quality of preschool, particularly for low-income families, is critical to achieve the desired outcomes. The government is
currently implementing an improvement plan to address the system’s shortfalls. This includes development of Grade R
regulations, improved pre-service and in-service training for Grade R practitioners, and culturally relevant teaching and
learning materials for children and their parents or caregivers.
