            Introduction:
1           The Need for Deeper
            Ethnographic Analysis

Mass displacements of people due to natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, earth-
quakes, volcanoes, hurricanes, and typhoons, or anthropogenic disasters, such as fam-
ines, wars, conflicts, persecution, or genocide, are common throughout history (Jones
and Murphy 2009; Sanghi et al. 2010). Various historical records from ancient to recent
societies indicate that displaced peoples have always sought access to nearby or neigh-
boring areas for safety and security and for basic humanitarian needs, including food,
water, shelter, and clothing. In response to these migrations, destination societies have
historically recognized their duty to host displaced peoples until they
can be repatriated, resettled, and/or integrated (Oliver-Smith 1996).
                                                                           Grievances are especially
Often, the host society’s views on the refugees are driven by fear
                                                                           prevalent in protracted situations
and uncertainty of “outsiders,” “migrants,” or “foreigners,” feeding a
                                                                           of refugee camps built in rural
dominant narrative that refugees and displaced peoples usually have
                                                                           areas with virtually no local
negative impacts on their host communities (Agier 2002, 2011; Veney
                                                                           infrastructure.
2007). There is a crucial need to understand the complexities of these
interactions with respect to the dominant narratives and the frequent
occurrence of violence and conflict over real and perceived grievances between refugees
and their local host communities with regard to access to land, water, jobs, opportuni-
ties, and development (Betts 2009; Jacobsen 2002; Martin 2005; Porter et al. 2008).

Grievances are especially prevalent in protracted situations of refugee camps built in
rural areas with virtually no local infrastructure (Agier 2002, 2011; Crisp 2003). In these
circumstances, refugees find themselves surrounded by impoverished local host com-
munities underserved by regional and national governments and with little to no role in
making decisions about the land and resources given to the refugees by the host govern-
ments and the UNHCR. Host communities subsequently view the refugee camps as an
imposition (Aukot 2003; Chkam 2016; Jacobsen 2002), and these grievance narratives
have existed as long as the refugee camps have. The role that daily interactions between
refugees and hosts play are often ignored in such narratives, including those between
refugee and host, employer and employee, trader and consumer, or patron and client—
as well as master and servant or oppressor and victim (Betts 2014; Grabska 2011). The
                                                                                              1
2   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



    resulting complexities result in emergent experiences of Indignity and servitude as well
    as dignity and well-being (Aukot 2003; Hilhorst and Jansen 2009).

    This report outlines the complex dynamic interface between narratives, interactions,
    and external factors in determining the impacts of refugees on the social economies and
    psychosocial well-being of host communities by focusing on the refugees of Kakuma
    Refugee Camp and the Turkana host community located in Turkana County, Kenya.
    Various factors are explored in the attitudes, behaviors, and actions of refugee-host
    interactions that foster a sense of indignity (matharau in KiSwahili and ng’imeny in
    Turkana). The feeling of servitude and inequity many experience as a result of these
    interactions can be described by the Turkana word etic (pronounced e-tich), which
    means working for or under.

Turkana County, until 2013 known formerly as Turkana District of the Rift Valley Prov-
ince of Kenya, is the largest county in Kenya (77,000 square kilometers). It is also one of
the most impoverished and marginalized areas of the country and indeed in all of Sub-
Saharan Africa. Kakuma Refugee Camp is the largest settlement in Turkana County.
Due to the crises in Somalia (2011–14) and South Sudan (2013–ongoing), the camp
has grown from a population of 85,000 in 2011 to more than 160,000
in September 2016. The complex interactions between the Turkana The complex interactions
host community and the refugees are being tested by the changing between the Turkana host
demographics of the refugee settlement at Kakuma with regard to its community and the refugees
scale and the cultural origins of the refugees. In addition to coping are being tested by the changing
with an influx of more than 100,000 people in the past five years, the demographics of the refugee
Turkana community must also deal with recent changes in governance settlement at Kakuma.
infrastructure that are expected to bring significant development to
Turkana County, including devolution, resource discovery, and oil extraction in South
Turkana County, and fresh water aquifers in North Turkana County under the follow-
ing assumptions:

n	   The devolution process and the increased autonomy of the county government with
     regard to resource allocation and spending will help build and support public devel-
     opment infrastructure at an unprecedented rate, scale, and reach;

n	   The discovery of oil will lead to the development of a regulated extractive industry
     that provides opportunities, jobs, and a better standard of living for the local people;
     and

n	   The discovery of immense freshwater aquifers will enable the development of exten-
     sive and intensive agriculture, including irrigation-based methods, potentially lead-
     ing to long-term development.

The combined effects of these three recent developments could potentially transform
Turkana County’s public infrastructure and social and political economies from their
current state of general impoverishment, marginalization, lack of health care and nutri-
tion, and low levels of education.
4   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



    Acknowledging that, at least for the short to medium term, Kakuma Refugee Camp
    may be an enduring part of the Turkana landscape, with the ongoing presence of more
    than 160,000 refugees possessing diverse skill sets and varying access to capital and
    resources, allows for the possibility that refugees could play a large and positive role in
    the projected development of Turkana County. To create an inclusive space for refu-
    gees and hosts to work together for the generation of sustainable livelihoods and lives,
    policy makers need to understand and accommodate the complex interactions between
    host and refugee. Specifically, the interactions must move from generating indignity
    (matharau or ng’imeny) to fostering dignity (heshima in KiSwahili and arimatoi in Tur-
    kana); and for the Turkana, moving from servitude (etic) to working with or together
    (aking’arakin). These complexities are mapped and described in this social impact
    analysis based on intensive ethnographic and survey research conducted by the World
    Bank, UNHCR, and the University of Notre Dame.
2           Goals, Objectives,
            and Methodology

This social impact analysis describes the complexities of the interactions between refu-
gees and their host community and assesses their positive and negative outcomes within
the current relief paradigm, contextualized by: (1) the history of interactions between
the Turkana people and the central Kenyan government from the British colonial period
to the current administration; (2) recent developments regarding devolution, oil, and
water; and (3) since 1992, the arrival and continuing flow of large numbers of refugees
into northern Turkana. An analysis of the data helps to map the strengths and weak-
nesses with ongoing interactions, and examines potential problems and intervention
points. The overall goal of the social impact analysis is to provide a set of evidence-based
insights and policy recommendations to the Kenyan government, the UNHCR and asso-
ciated bodies, and development actors to support Turkana’s development and to benefit
Kakuma so that members of refugee and host communities alike can study, find jobs and
opportunities, run businesses, work, raise children, celebrate achievements, and mourn
their dead according to their own traditions and customs, and that they have equal
access to health care and other public services. In short, the larger goal is to empower the
refugees of Kakuma as well as their Turkana hosts to live lives of dignity.


Methodology
According to the World Development Report (World Bank 2015: 144–45) “ethnography
[is a] powerful tool for understanding the ways in which social and cultural context
shapes decision making, choices, and interpersonal relations,” and for a greater under-
standing of motivations, perceptions, agendas, and subsequent actions and responses to
any development intervention. Using an ethnographic approach to gain data on social
and economic behaviors, motivations, perceptions, and agendas of both the host and
refugee communities, the primary objective of the social impact analysis is to assess and
analyze the net social—including psychosocial and socioeconomic—costs and benefits
of the presence of refugees at the Kakuma Refugee Camp on the host community of
Turkana County. The findings from the social impact analysis in conjunction with

    interactions over the past 24 years, and it will assist UNHCR, the Kenyan government,
    and other interested organizations initiate and execute the proposed transformation of
    Kakuma through the necessary shift from a short-term emergency approach to a long-
    term approach to development and financing.


    Ethnographic Research
    To better understand the social economies of the Turkana people and the refugees of
    Kakuma, we used ethnographic approaches, following a longitudinal study conducted in
    and around Kakuma since 2008, composed of participant observations, semistructured
    interviews, and focus groups with the Turkana in their homes and villages, including
    following a traditional moran cattle-raiding near the Lokichoggio area, which did not
    result in any casualties. In addition to interactions during the interviews for this study,
    participant observations involved close engagement with the host and refugee commu-
    nities in food-sharing and other friendship rituals before, during, and after the interac-
    tions rather than conducting one-time interviews, which are more common in these
    kinds of studies. This research benefitted from the resulting deep trust built between
    study participants and researchers, which has: (1) enabled a deeper understanding of
    Turkana cultural institutions, such as bond-friendships and Turkana “cattle complex”
    (Herskovits 1926), which are “foreign” even to non-Turkana Kenyans; (2) uncovered
    attitudes among the Turkana regarding their 100 years of exclusion and marginaliza-
    tion/discrimination; and (3) elicited accurate and precise data on the complexity of the
    attitudes, experiences, and narratives of the Turkana regarding the refugees.

    The ethnographic research was conducted in the towns of Kakuma, Lodwar, Lorugum,
    and Lokichoggio in Turkana County, Kenya (map 2.1) in May and June 2015. Kakuma
    town is adjacent to the refugee camp and is the primary residence of the members of the
    host community who work in the refugee camp as construction workers, domestic ser-
    vants, security guards, charcoal and firewood producers and sellers, livestock producers
    and sellers, and even survival sex workers.1 Lorugum, a town 170 kilometers (km) south
    of Kakuma, is an area of sustained development and significant investment by the Kenyan
    government due to the Turkwel River Hydroelectric Project. Development efforts include
    investments in reforestation, livestock management, agriculture, and small industry.

    Lokichoggio is 96 km from Kakuma and 35 km from the Kenya–South Sudan Border.
    Lokichoggio, the site of the UNHCR refugee camp from 1990–92, also served as the pri-
    mary base for the UNHCR Sudan Relief Mission and, subsequently, for numerous non-
    governmental organizations (NGOs). After 2008, UNHCR and the NGOs involved in the

South Sudan relief and humanitarian mission moved to Juba, and the Kenyan work staff
moved to Kakuma or back to southern Kenya, leaving Lokichoggio an underdeveloped
and impoverished community. Lodwar is the capital of Turkana County and the seat of
its government. It has grown in political importance as a result of the governance changes
brought about by devolution. As the county’s capital, Lodwar has also served as the center
for development and disaster and conflict relief efforts for the Turkana people, and it hosts
many relief and development organizations at a level comparable to Kakuma.

The research followed procedures for informed consent and voluntary participation and
protection of informants as described by the Institutional Review Board of the Office of
Research at the University of Notre Dame (Protocol ID: 15–05–2534). The field research
was sanctioned by the Kenyan government and UNHCR. Data were elicited using par-
ticipant observations, intensive semistructured interviews, and focus group discussions.
The participants (n=121) interviewed were selected from the refugee (n=30) and the host
communities (n=91), primarily through contacts from previous research in Kakuma
(see Ohta 2005; Oka 2014; Horn 2010). Precautions were taken to make sure that initial
participants and assistants were selected from different ethnic and social groups within
both the refugee and host communities. While these initial contacts and research assis-
tants might have heard about each other, care was taken that
they lived and worked in social networks that did not overlap, Map 2.1. Map of Turkana County, Kenya
which also ensured that the participants would hail from dif-
ferent social networks. Seven themes were selected for the eth-
nographic research under the social impact analysis (table 2.1).
These themes were built around previous ethnographic work
on the informal and formal economies of Kakuma and Turkana
County (Pérouse de Montclos and Kagwanja 2000; Ohta 2001,
2005; Oka 2011, 2014).


Psychosocial Stress and Anthropometric
Surveys in the Turkana Host Community
A large-scale survey of stress and health indicators was con-
ducted through interviews and anthropometric measure-
ments in Kakuma town, which is adjacent to Kakuma Refugee
Camp, as well as in the towns of Lokichoggio, Lorengo, and
Lorogum in Turkana County, Kenya (see map 2.1). The meth-
odologies for the health and nutritional survey of Turkana
were built on previous bioanthropological approaches in
South Turkana County (Brainard 1986; Pike 1999, 2004).              Source: HRW 2015.

10   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     A robust sample (n=600) was assembled comprising equal numbers of men and women
     from each of the four towns. A frequent assumption is that refugee camps negatively
     impact their host communities through resource competition and conflict. Based on
     prior anthropological research, this research focused on whether or not host commu-
     nities could also benefit from the presence of refugees through economic exchange.
     To assess the impact, anthropometric measures of physical and nutritional well-being
     between communities in the Turkana were compared. Data were elicited for the follow-
     ing aspects:

     n	   Demographic information, including gender, age, marital status, number of
          spouses, number of children, livestock, livelihood, and social support.

     n	   Psychosocial stress, for which participants were asked to freely list the main sources
          of stress and worry in their lives. Specifically, following a previous study among Tur-
          kana (Pike 2004; Pike and Williams 2006), each informant was asked to list their
          worries and concerns about their lives with no limit on their number and without
          ranking them. The host community was also asked about refugee-related worries
          and perceptions across the four sites in order to calculate negative, positive, and
          neutral perceptions toward the refugees. While the informants came up with their
          own names and descriptions for their worries, the strength of classification/categori-
          zation of them into the eight categories of stressors was tested using Cohen’s Kappa
          for pair-wise comparisons of agreement (Cohen’s K = 0.88, p<0.0001).

     n	   Anthropometric measures, including body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) based on
          height and weight and sum of skinfolds (SSF). While BMI provides a convenient
          proxy for physical well-being and energy status, SSF, which measures body fat con-
          tent, is a well-established indicator of energy status. Body fat content, especially in
          impoverished and malnourished populations, is positively correlated with better
          nutrition, physical health, and maternal and reproductive health. There are various
          ways to measure body fat content, including isotopic determination of total body
          water, radiography, electrical conductance, and impedance. However, the most com-
          mon methods are hydrostatic weighing, which involves whole body immersion, and
          SSF, which is less accurate or precise than hydrostatic measurements but which is
          ideal for field studies because it is a standardized nonintrusive method of measuring
          the thickness of subcutaneous fat tissue at 2–7 points on the body. It enables the
          calculation of body fat percentage (BFP), which allows for a determination of energy
          status for the prior 6–12 months.

The specific aim was to test whether Kakuma Refugee Camp affects the well-being
of the Turkana host community, measured through BMI, SSF, and BFP (n=600). The
methodology for this part of the social impact analysis involved detailed surveys of 300
men and 300 women, comprising 75 men and 75 women from each of the four study
locations.


Expectations and Hypotheses
The primary hypotheses tested using the data from the social impact analysis are
grounded in observations from previous studies, which conclude that the impact of
the presence of a large number of refugees in Kakuma has both positive and negative
impacts. Specifically, the study expected to find that:

n	   There is a significant variation in the well-being of the host community at Kakuma
     compared with those of the other study sites—Lorugum, Lorengo, Lokichoggio, and
     Lodwar. The hypothesis was tested with the following caveats:

     –	 There is some overlap among Kakuma, Lodwar, and Lorugum due to the close
        presence of relief and development efforts and organizations; and

     –	 Lorengo and Lokichoggio have the worst outcomes in terms of social, physical,
        and mental well-being due to the absence or withdrawal of development and
        relief organizations, respectively.

n	   Pathways taken by the host community of Kakuma toward well-being differ from the
     host communities at the other study sites, confounded by the impact of the refugee
     presence and by daily interactions with refugees, hosts, and relief-development orga-
     nizations. Specifically:

     –	 The presence of the relief-development infrastructure and the refugees provide
        the Turkana of Kakuma greater access to jobs, wage labor, and other opportu-
        nities, but increase the potential for conflict and distrust between refugees and
        hosts.

     –	 Despite increased access to jobs, better wages, and development opportunities in
        Kakuma, there is still a significant variation in physical and psychosocial well-
        being within the host community, indicating exacerbated structural inequity.

     n	   Levels of development investment would emerge as a significant factor in under-
          standing the differential trajectories of well-being across Turkana County, where
          the level of development investment and presence is directly correlated with social,
          economic, psychosocial, and physical well-being.

     n	   There would be widespread distrust in the ability of the government and associated
          bodies or organizations to deliver the promised benefits of devolution and the oil
          and water discoveries in Turkana.

     n	   There would be a general disenfranchisement of youth and women in Turkana and a
          growing distance between political and social elites and Turkana’s other residents.

     n	   Structural and physical violence would be disproportionately manifested along the
          categories of gender and age, whereby women and youth would be more negatively
          affected by the systemic exclusion from participating in social, economic, and politi-
          cal spheres.




                                                                 Shopping in Mogadishu, Kakuma

The results of the social impact analysis allowed for the investigation of these expecta-
tions and the expansion of the analysis to include previously unconsidered variables,
including the role of dignity/indignity, which seems to significantly affect interactions
between refugees and their hosts.


Caveats and Study Limitations
Due to the sensitive nature of the questions and volatility of the research area, neither
the ethnographic nor the psychosocial surveys used random sampling methods. Both
data collection approaches utilized the researchers’ contacts with trusted participants
known for 2–7 years to engage new participants. Within-group bias was mitigated by
the fact that the prior contacts were drawn from a variety of ethnic, religious, social,
political, and economic groups, and responses were crosschecked within and between
groups. The data were collected in a semistructured and focus group interview format
based on specific predetermined questions. Interviews lasted at least two hours, and
many participants were interviewed repeatedly. Researchers engaged with participants
through food-sharing and friendship rituals before, during, and after the interactions,
ensuring room for variation and further discussion of their responses, including clarifi-
cations, verifications, explanations, and descriptions with specific examples.

The psychosocial stress and physical health assessments used a questionnaire-based
format in addition to anthropometric measurements to elicit the maximum amount of
data, followed by focus group interviews to contextualize the data with each group. We
are aware that by generally contributing to undernourishment and malnutrition, vari-
ous factors, including water, sanitation, and hygiene, effect nutritional status and hence
anthropometric measurements. This is due to chronic or recurring diarrhea and, impor-
tantly, a more recent condition known as tropical or environmental enteropathy, which
is significantly correlated with exposure to “large quantities of fecal bacteria” (Mahmud
and Mbuya 2016: 20; see also Humphrey 2009). The Turkana at all four sites live in
these types of environments because they practice ablutions in water holes and rivers
frequented by livestock and domestic animals. In Kakuma, the local Turkana forage for
water from the riverbed and share it with livestock and domestic animals, and with a
population density of more than 2,000 persons/km2, it is quite likely that water, sanita-
tion, and hygiene impacts nutritional health. However, because all four sites are in areas
with a high potential for fecal contamination—with Kakuma potentially being the most
contaminated—we would expect that the lack of water, sanitation, and hygiene would
dampen any nutritional benefits offered by the camp to the Turkana host community.

In the next chapter, we contextualize the refugee–host social economies and inter-
actions in the history of Turkana, especially over the last century.
           Historical Context of
3          Turkana County and
           Kakuma Refugee Camp

Turkana County is regarded as one of the cradles of human evolution, especially with
the recent discoveries of stone tools dating to about 3.3 million years ago—the old-
est in the world (Harmand et al. 2015). The region also boasts of some of the finest
technological development in subsistence, trade, and production in East Africa for the
past 12,000 years (Wright et al. 2015). History suggests that, prior to 1900, the ances-
tors of the current Turkana were the lords of their realm, with control over territory
that included Turkana County and large areas of bordering Uganda, South Sudan, and
Ethiopia, as well as areas within Kenya to the south and the east of the county (Broch-
Due and Hodgson 2000; Lamphear 1988). Nevertheless, the current state of social and
economic well-being in the county suggests that the people of Turkana are among the
most impoverished and marginalized communities in Sub-Saharan Africa and the
world (Anderson and Broch-Due 2000). The bewildering disparity between the well-
being of the Turkana in 1900 and their impoverishment in 2015 begs the question: How
did the conditions of the Turkana decline so dramatically?


Precolonial, Colonial, and Postcolonial Transitions:
From Rulers to Ruled, from Pacified to Excluded
Archaeological and oral history studies suggest that from 1500 to 1890 CE, the Tur-
kana pastoralists came from the more fertile areas of southeastern Uganda, specifically
the Karamoja Escarpment, which expands across the western basin of Lake Turkana.
Between 1895 and 1910 CE, the British colonial administration moved along with the
railroad linking the coast to Western Kenya, reaching Mt. Elgon by the late 1880s (Lam-
phear 1988; Wright et al. 2015). After the conquest of the Mt. Elgon region in 1895 CE,
the British began to expand northward toward Turkana, presumably to link their west-
ward expansion in East Africa to their southward expansion in the Sudan. The ferocity
of the Turkana people was the political justification used for military pacification to
“save” the Turkana from themselves and from growing Ethiopian imperialism, as well
as to protect the Luhya, Sabaot, Pokot, Luo, Samburu, and Rendille pastoralists from

16   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     Initially, the Turkana proved a real match for the British (1900–05), which led to a
     change in policies involving the punitive confiscation of livestock in order to “mitigate”
     its raiding. The most significant and crippling outcome of the British actions was that,
     even as the Turkana were forced into more arid areas west of Lake Turkana, they lost
     tremendous amounts of wealth due to the depletion of their livestock (Mburu 2001).
     Significant outcomes of the British–Turkana interactions include:

     n	   Changes in subsistence activity. Changes in subsistence patterns were driven by
          livestock depletion and, ironically, the intensification of pastoralism as a primary
          subsistence activity that conferred status, as well as a decline in agriculture and trade.

          –	 Livestock depletion. By 1900, the rinderpest2 epidemic across East Africa had
             significantly depleted Turkana livestock levels. The confiscation of livestock over
             the next two decades further depleted the herd sizes to levels below the asset
             threshold.3 This left the herd vulnerable to further attrition and depletion due to
             disease and catastrophes, particularly recurring droughts and famines.

          –	 Intensification of pastoralism. The depletion of livestock was correlated with
             greater investment in pastoralism as the primary and often the only subsistence
             activity deemed appropriate among the Turkana. Specifically, the ability to build,
             maintain, and maximize herd sizes became the determinants of status among
             Turkana men.

          –	 Decline in agriculture. Various areas in Turkana County, including the
             Lokichoggio area, the Tarach River, and the Turkwel River have long been centers
             of agricultural production for the Turkana. Agricultural activities are primarily
             conducted by the women who grow crops such as sorghum as well as forage for
             wild foods. According to the foundational Nayece myth of the Turkana as well as
             informants for this study, these processed and stored foods used to be the main
             sources of nutrition among the Turkana. The intensification of pastoralism and
             its associated status led to a decline in the status of women’s activities—such as
             agriculture.




     2. Rinderpest is an acute infectious disease among cattle caused by a morbillivirus among cattle.
     3. The asset threshold is a narrow range for calculating optimal herd size. It varies based on environment and political economy
     (Murphy 2014). If the herd size is above the asset threshold, then the rate of attrition among livestock through raiding, death,
     and/or disease is lower than the replacement rate. Herd sizes below the asset threshold usually indicates that the attrition rate
     is higher than the replacement rate.

     –	 Decline in trade. The Turkana were involved in trade networks at local and
        regional levels across the western Lake Turkana basin and where livestock, grain,
        weapons, tools, ornaments, clothing, and other goods were exchanged. The isola-
        tion and the militarization and/or supervision of the Turkana area in the colo-
        nial and postcolonial periods eroded these networks, leaving the Turkana overly
        dependent on external aid, on development initiatives, and on pastoralism. As
        stated by Wright et al. (2015: 357):

              “In the past, interdependent social networks evolved over vast areas
              to mitigate risk associated with the changing climate. However, as the
              local economy [became] increasingly dependent on outside resources
              [after the British incursions], there [were and] are fewer incentives to
              cooperate within the neighborhood and more incentives to fight a zero-
              sum game for primacy in controlling access to those resources.”

n	   Changes in social organization. Changes include the alteration in community
     structure and gender relationships.

     –	 Community and household structure. The emergence of the awi-adakar sys-
        tem, which continues to characterize the current Turkana settlement patterns,
        emerged in the colonial period.

       n	   Awi. An awi is an extended family headed by an older man who controls the
            awi’s herd with his brothers, sons, and nephews, with the (usually older) men
            practicing polygamy and maintaining multiple wives.

       n	   Adakar. An adakar comprises five or six awis belonging to one patrilineage
            that gather as a larger group to graze and water their animals at previously
            chosen sites. These annual gatherings also served as zones for communal ritu-
            als, marital alliance brokering, rites of passage ceremonies, and other cultural
            activities.

       n	   Alomar/arumrum. These are small hamlets consisting of 15–20 individual awi
            households or two to three adakars. As Turkana groups were forcibly settled,
            the residential patterns were disjointed with women living, raising children, and
            tending young animals in rural semipermanent hamlets of individual awis and
            men migrating around 200–500 kilometers (km) per year to graze their animals.
            Lorengo one of the sites in the psychosocial study, is an example of this.

       –	 Exchange relationships.

          n	   The creation of kinship exchange systems means that any progress made by
               an individual Turkana has to be shared across the larger extended kin group,
               including but not limited to help with money, food, jobs, and other benefits
               within the power of the individual family member.

          n	   Bond-friendships, a holdover from pastoral systems, involves a small “ask”
               that serves as the foundation for enduring relationships but which may be
               interpreted by outsiders as “begging” (Gulliver 1951, 1955; Ohta 2005).

       –	 Gender relationships. A number of factors significantly altered the sociopolitical
          landscape of Turkana, such as forced resettlement into small villages, transhu-
          mance (affecting men in particular), and the emergence of politically appointed
          headmen and chiefs, which led to a decline in many Turkana cultural institutions,
          including the ngimoruk (diviners), and then further led to erosion of Turkana
          cultural identity (Fratkin 2001).

          n	   Growth of a warrior culture. The depletion of average herd size along with
               the status-driven intensification of pastoralism led to an increase in livestock-
               raiding by groups of young warrior men (moran) and other militia activities
               (ngoroko). These served as efficient ways to quickly rebuild depleted herds and
               establish warrior status. Contrary to most depictions of East African pastoral
               groups, livestock raiding became a normative institution among the Turkana
               after the colonial encounter, as did the incipient violence between the Turkana
               and their neighbors.

          n	   Determination of status among men. As previously noted, pastoralism
               became one of few socially sanctioned activities that allowed men to gain sta-
               tus and recognition in their society. For younger men, status was determined
               by their achievements in raiding activities and in contributing to the awi’s abil-
               ity to pay bridewealth.
      3. Historical Context of Turkana County and Kakuma Refugee Camp                        19



     n	   Decline in the status of women. The forcible settlement of the Turkana also
          relegated women to gendered activities that offered no attached status, such
          as childbearing and rearing, raising of young livestock, practicing agriculture,
          and foraging. The primary concern for many young women to this day appears
          to be collecting enough beads in their neck jewelry to entitle them to a high
          dowry. One informant from Kakuma recounted the popular local understand-
          ing of the lower roles given to the women after the colonial period:

              “When the British fought the Turkana and they would round up
              everyone, they would lock up the women and children together in
              houses and send the men to work, to do hard labor. Women were just
              supposed to be at home and take care of kids. Maybe this made men
              come up with a psychology that women cannot do things and are like
              kids.” (KII 2015)

Ethnographic studies suggest that by the 1950s, there was a clear difference among
even neighboring groups with regard to type and specialization of subsistence practices
(Fratkin 1986, 1997; Gulliver 1951, 1955). The forcible settlement of the
Turkana destabilized pastoral movement pathways and forced the ethnic The forcible settlement of the

southernmost elements of the Turkana back to Turkana District presum-
ably to ensure the ethnic homogeneity of ‘traditional’ Samburu domain,” but in reality,
the aim was to send the Turkana back to the closed district that was excluded from
development and that kept them from participating in anticolonial movements. Super-
vision policies ranged from requiring passes to leave the Turkana district to mandatory
registration of anyone traveling with the police (Simpson 1996: 692). This gave rise to
the expression “naenda Kenya,” which literally means “I’m going to Kenya,” but which
really encapsulates the life of residents excluded from a nation that demands their loy-
alty while refusing them the rights and privileges of citizenship. The Turkana continued
to be categorized as a closed district, and the Turkana were barred from freedom of
movement until 1986, more than two decades after Kenya achieved its independence.

     The northern part of Kenya, including Turkana County, has suffered from increasingly
     severe droughts lasting for years, resulting in the depletion of grazing lands and water
     resources (Bush 1995). Combined with the lack of public infrastructure and services,
     droughts grow into famines with high mortality rates among humans and livestock.
     Because the ability of pastoralists such as the Turkana to manage their resources is
     closely linked to prevailing environmental conditions, notable famine events are often
     given names as they become part of the cultural folklore. Most of the informants in this
     study were very familiar with the names of the famines, the associated stories of suf-
     fering and resilience, and the impacts on their own families and herds. Major famines
     and droughts in Turkana that experienced high rates of livestock mortality (measured
     as percentage of deaths—see table 3.1) shows that between 1950 and 2008, there were
     12 droughts, five of which were moderate to extreme. The 2008 drought persisted until
     2011, growing into a vast famine that stretched from Turkana to Mandera, Wajir, Mars-
     abit, and Garissa, and by June–July 2011, into Somalia. The region has experienced two
     additional years of consecutive drought since then, in 2013 and 2014. These drought
     and famine events have recurred regularly for multiple years with small intervals of
     around 5–6 years separating them. The narrowness of the intervening periods without
     drought means that maintaining or replenishing livestock numbers after a drought or

famine is incredibly difficult. The six named droughts and famines show a high correla-
tion between livestock mortality and catastrophic malnutrition, forced displacement,
and human mortality.


Kakuma Refugee Camp, 1992–2015
The Kakuma area was formerly a watering and meeting hole for Turkana pastoralists
from surrounding areas. The name Kakuma means “the place of the giant tortoise.” (the
Turkana word for tortoise is akumurae). It was a seasonal communal meeting ground
for various adakars of the Turkana to water and graze their livestock during the wet
season. Prior to 1992, Kakuma was a culturally and economically significant location
for the Turkana pastoralists living within 200 km of the town; it grew into a small town
(population: 5,887) with a livestock market controlled primarily by the Somali traders.
It served as a rest-and-fuel stop for truck drivers on the A1 highway that links Kitale
in Western Kenya to Juba, which is now in South Sudan. Subsequently, Kakuma town
had restaurants, hotels, garages, petrol stations, and general stores. The large shops and
petrol stations were owned and operated by Somali traders, while the smaller shops,
garages, restaurants, and hotels were owned by Turkana and Meru traders.

The relationship between the few outsiders at Kakuma and the Turkana residents prior
to 1991 was built on over three decades of mutually beneficial interactions, particularly
with the Somali trading firms established in Kakuma since the 1960s (Oka 2014; Oka et
al. Under review). The firms operated as middlemen for two types of exchanges at the
livestock markets in Kakuma—between the rural producers and the Kakuma market
and between the Kakuma market and the ones in Lodwar, Kitale, and Eldoret. They
established wholesale firms—still active in Kakuma today—to supply other local and
regional business and customers with dry groceries and hardware (Oka et al. Under
review). Oral historical data suggest that the Somalis would

     “load up donkeys with sugar, tumbaku [tobacco], beans, leather/rubber slip-
     pers, metal plates [for arrowheads and spears], and clothing, and go into the
     bush. When they came back, they would be leading many livestock that they
     had traded for.” (KII 2010)

The Somalis were known for their honesty and for their love of the Turkana, making them
“blood brothers who would many times go raiding with the young men, for livestock.”

Kakuma Refugee Camp was formally established in 1992 on the A1 highway on the
northwestern bank of the Tarach River (map 3.1). The camp was built to accommodate
people fleeing the conflict in Sudan that lasted from 1985–2005 (Pérouse de Montclos

and Kagwanja 2000). Lokichoggio was the site of the initial UNHCR refugee welcom-
ing station and until 2005, the base of the United Nations (UN) South Sudan relief.
However, it was only 35 km away from the conflict zone and cross-border raids from
the Jie of Uganda and the Toposa of South Sudan along the Kenya–Sudan border—too
close for adequate refugee protection and services. After engaging in consultations
with the Kenyan government as well as local leaders and elders of the Turkana com-
munity, UNHCR chose Kakuma, 96 km to the southeast of Lokichoggio, as its new
center of operations. By the end of 1992 and 1993, the first group of refugees—the
Nuer—reached Kakuma, followed in 1993 and 1994 by the Dinka, Ethiopian Amhara,
Ethiopian Oromo, and some Somalis. This led to increasing panic among Kakuma area
residents, stemming from two main points of contention:

1.	 The Turkana were concerned that the people who were fighting each other would
    bring their conflict to Kakuma, particularly the Sudanese Nuer and Dinka. Accord-
    ing to an informant, recounting the events in 1992: “In Sudan, people are killing each
    other. We will not agree to letting dangerous strangers come and settle nearby” (Ohta
    2005: 229).

2.	The interactions of UNHCR and the Kenyan government with the local people
   mainly consisted of meetings with government appointed chiefs, so the voice of the
   local people was not heard. One informant, recalled:

        “I was 12 years old when the camp was built, but I remember when the
        refugees first came here, our people reacted and were angry, because they
        were going to occupy our lands. What will happen to our livestock? I
        remember them asking our elders.” (KII 2015)

	 Another woman said:

        “When the camp displaced the Turkana, no compensation was given to the
        people who were displaced. If it was given, then it went to government of
        Kenya, not to us. Mostly, it’s because the Turkana do not have title deeds.
        Among Turkana, the land belongs to the community, but people’s identity
        is tied to the land. We always know the first residents, we could call them
        the owners.” (KII 2015)

The Turkana were also upset about having to give up their annual meeting place on the
eastern and western sides of the Tarach River, which intersected with Kakuma town and
the A1 highway. The place had economic and political importance as a seasonal meeting
           24       Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



                    site for adakar gatherings as well as mythic significance (Lamphear 1988). However,
                    along with fear and anger, there was also conciliation, mercy, and anticipation of new
                    opportunities. One informant who said that people got angry when the refugees were
                    coming, added in the same interview:

                         “The government approached our leaders and asked our leaders, who said,
                         ‘Let’s welcome the refugees, let them stay, they’re suffering because of their
                         war. We’ll host them.’” (KII 2015)

                    Anthropologist Itaru Ohta reports that just before the camp was established, “Several
                    young men brought other news […] from Kakuma: they said that many people would
                    be employed in the construction work for the refugee camp.” One of them, who had
                    previously been employed doing road construction work told me excitedly, “We can
                    get a big job. We will be paid 50 shillings a day.” He asked [Ohta] for some scissors
                    to cut his hair, which was woven in the traditional style, in order to get a job. He was
                    wearing a shirt and trousers that day, although he usually wore only a sheet around his
                    body (Ohta 2005: 229). Within a year after the establishment of the Kakuma Refugee

                    as Mogadishu, Addis, and Hong Kong), numerous Ethiopian Amhara, Oromo, Somali,
                    and some Sudanese Nuer and Dinka refugees had set up retail shops, restaurants, and
                    barber shops, offering refugees and Turkana alike access to goods at retail prices. The
                    goods were mainly imported by three Somali firms in Kakuma town, who had by then
                    established reliable supply lines with suppliers in Kitale, Eldoret, Nakuru, Nairobi, and
                    Mombasa.

                    1,600,000 in 2016 (figure 3.1). The camp has taken in people fleeing conflicts from
                    Burundi, Congo, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Uganda. In 1997, after the destruction

(1) violence by Al Shabaab and the famine in Somalia (2011–13), when 45,000 Somali
refugees pushed the population from 85,000 to 130,000; and (2) the continuing violence
and lack of infrastructure in South Sudan between 2010 and 2011, which resulted in a
reverse flow of refugees back into Kenya and Kakuma (Oka 2014).

In December 2013, South Sudan erupted into violence, resulting in a full-scale con-
flict with a huge death toll and major displacement. The utter destabilization of South
Sudan’s reconstruction has displaced over a million people, scattered at internally dis-
placed persons (IDP) camps in South Sudan and at refugee camps in Uganda, Ethiopia,
Sudan, and Kenya, particularly Kakuma. Since January 2014, Kakuma has received
almost 80,000 South Sudanese refugees. Furthermore, the official counts at Kakuma
have systematically underestimated the actual population because of the concealed
populations of unregistered migrants living in the refugee camp seeking access to the
relief, medical, nutritional, and educational services. Estimates of this unofficial latent
subpopulation vary from 5,000–15,000, with at least one undocumented person per
family currently residing in the camp.

Between January and December 2014, almost 50,000 new South Sudanese refugees flee-
ing the ongoing violence were registered in Kakuma and given shelter, mainly in Kakuma
3 and 4 (new areas further to the north and west built in 2009 and 2010 to house the
incoming Somali refugees). The capacity of the various civic, relief, and development
organizations are being taxed to their limits, necessitating changes in the processes by
which relief and development services are managed and administered by the Kenyan
government, UNHCR, and other organizations. The increased refugee population in
Kakuma combined with the growing population of Kakuma town (urban population of
26   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     31,932 in 2009) also means that the active interactions and encounters between the ref-
     ugees and the Turkana hosts can only intensify—positively and negatively. This means
     that any proposed changes to relief and development policies in Kakuma that affect
     refugees and the Turkana must account for and accommodate the different experiential
     and narrative outcomes of these interactions, especially the negative ones that could
     lead to violence and conflict, as they have in the past. The next chapter explores and
     analyzes various categories of interaction, drawing on ethnographic and survey data
     collected between 2008 and 2015.




                                                                  The remains of repatriation
4          Interactions at Kakuma


The arrival of 35,000 refugees (1992–93) transformed the socioeconomic dynamics
of Kakuma town. By 2000, the town’s population had almost doubled to an estimated
9,000, as had the camp’s—to an estimated 80,000 due to the influx of 20,000 refugees
from Sudan, including Darfur; 15,000 from Somalia due to the closing of Utanga Bena-
diri Camp in Mombasa; and the rest from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea,
Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda. Even in 1998, when the official count was 58,000, the
population density of the occupied areas of Kakuma 1 and Kakuma 2 was roughly 400
persons/hectare (Montclos and Kagwanja 2000; Ohta 2005).

Along with the increased avenues for consumption of goods and services and growing
cosmopolitanism, the refugee presence also fundamentally altered the livestock herd-
ing and consumption system among the Turkana. The flood of cereal-based food aid
through Oxfam’s North Turkana Drought Relief Programme in Kakuma, Lokichog-
gio, and Kalokol (1992–94) led to a decrease in the pressure for slaughtering livestock.
This was paralleled by the high demand for meat among the (relatively)
cash-rich refugees passing through Lokichoggio to Kakuma who were                     Along with the increased
receiving money through remittances transmitted by hawala banks                    avenues for consumption of
and agents. (Practiced predominantly in the Middle East and Horn of           goods and services and growing
Africa, this system of value transfer is based on large networks of money        cosmopolitanism, the refugee
brokers.) According to Bush (1995: 257), the price of meat rose from K            presence also fundamentally
Sh 6/kg ($0.06 USD) in 1992 to K Sh 9/kg in 1993 and K Sh 22/kg in altered the livestock herding and
1994. This might have led to the development of an entirely new group of           consumption system among
Turkana brokers, the nimuchurus. The nimuchurus operate at two levels                             the Turkana.
with respect to the livestock marketing associations: (1) external: those
who travel to smaller markets or wait on the outskirts of towns seeking sellers with
animals; and (2) Internal: those who operate within the livestock marketing associa-
tion market yards. The external nimuchurus sell to the internal nimuchurus who then
trade among themselves until they reach a particular price ceiling, at which point the
animal/s are offered to the external buyers. The external buyers, mainly Somalis along
with some Ethiopians, Congolese, and Burundians, then negotiate the price with the
                                                                                            27
28   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     final nimuchurus. This system has left the small producers and herders entirely at the
     mercy of the brokers, buyers, butchers, and consumers.

     Some refugees began providing small jobs to the Turkana, including domestic labor,
     such as sweeping, dusting, washing dishes and clothes, fetching water, and process-
     ing food; casual and manual labor, such as construction of houses and fences, main-
     tenance of buildings and roads, and portage; and service jobs, such as restaurant and
     shop cleaners and sweepers. The UNHCR and other relief and development organiza-
     tions generated jobs in a number of areas, including security, such as watchmen and
     police; construction; maintenance; transport; clerical; and, occasionally, management.
     In addition to jobs provided directly by the refugees of the relief-development complex,
     the people of Turkana found opportunities in supplying basic necessities to the camp,
     including firewood and charcoal, fencing and housing materials (thornbushes and tree
     poles), and occasionally livestock in the form of trade with individual refugees.

     In addition to these economic interactions, the Turkana engage with the refugees in
     friendship and through marital alliances, especially with the South Sudanese Dinka
     and Nuer. As various informants noted, the Turkana acknowledge similarities between
                                          themselves and the South Sudanese, including
                                          that they are both pastoralism-centered cultures,
                                          that livestock management plays a primary role
                                          in terms of being a subsistence activity, and
                                          that they have a mutual understanding of the
                                          role of conflict and aggression in daily interac-
                                          tions. Engagement with other groups such as
                                          the Congolese, Rwandans, Burundians, Somalis,
                                          and Ethiopians usually consist of the Turkana as
                                          consumers or workers in the shops and homes
                                          of refugees. There are numerous examples of
                                          enduring friendships between individual fami-
                                          lies and people, usually formed and reinforced
                                          through regular meetings in public arenas, such
                                          as churches, bars, restaurants, cafes, teahouses,
                                          and sporting fields. Ohta (2001, 2005) sug-
                                          gests that the narratives of conflict and violence
                                          between the two groups serve to obfuscate the
                                          fact that between 1992 and 2005, the Turkana
                                          and the refugees established complex, mutually

beneficial, and enduring relationships. This study extends Ohta’s analysis by document-
ing positive and negative interactions between the Turkana and the refugees as reported
or observed by Turkana residents of Kakuma (n=150). The data extends beyond Ohta’s
research to suggest multiple outcomes of the complex interplay between experiences
and narratives that range from cooperation to conflict, and where individual interac-
tions are shaped by the larger narrative but also by the history of individual-level inter-
actions. The range of interactions between the Turkana and refugees is broad and varies
from positive to negative in terms of outcomes and perceptions that create narratives,
which in turn shape interactions.

Data from multiple sources suggest that narratives of conflict and cooperation are not
mutually exclusive. Rather, they bleed into each other, forming a metanarrative in which
the refugees and the Turkana alike simultaneously perceive each other through lenses of
compassion, friendliness, resentment, and enmity, but largely under the narrative of the
violent “other.” An analysis of the data sheds light on the complex processes by which
stories circulate, collective memories form, “other”-oriented narratives are shaped and
reproduced, and the lived social realities of the refugees and the Turkana diverge.

The analysis suggests that the refugee and Turkana groups largely coexist in a dynamic
landscape where distrust that has been reinforced by numerous narratives and experi-
ences of wrongdoing and aggression can occasionally explode into violence. However,
the analyses also suggest that violence and distrust is mitigated by individual and group
experiences of cooperation, collaboration, and mutual benefit, largely through the
exchange of labor, goods, and services, and aided by the presence of the local com-
mercial market.


Narratives
There are numerous narratives about refugees among the Turkana that emerged from
interviews conducted for this study. These narratives merge with others about the gov-
ernment; the political system; and external factors, such as climate/environment and
drought/famine. In an attempt to unpack these factors, narratives have been grouped
into subnarratives: (1) refugees are bad, (2) refugees are good, and (3) refugees are ben-
eficial; as well as metanarratives: (1) refugees are violent “others” or foreign usurpers,
and (2) the Turkana are neglected by the government and discriminated against by
“down-Kenyans” and that they are resilient—summed up by the expression “naenda
Kenya.”

     Subnarrative 1: Refugees are bad.
     One of the most dominant subnarratives emerging from respondents across the four
     locations visited in this study is that “refugees are bad.” Most informants either claim to
     believe this narrative or have heard it repeated in their presence or through interaction
     networks. There are variations in the Turkana’s negative perceptions of the refugees, but
     some common themes emerge, including:

     n	   Refugees display violence toward the Turkana. According to the Turkana infor-
          mants, this violence manifests itself both overtly and covertly. Overt forms of vio-
          lence include:

          –	 Open conflict and clashes with weapons that involve large groups of men from
             refugee and the host communities, remembered through mythicized histories
             and memories, such as the 2003 small-scale “war”;

     –	 Periodic communal clashes between refugees and hosts when reports or expe-
        riences of mistreatment by refugees among Turkana men, women, or children
        lead to small clashes that are usually sorted out through dialogue and external
        intervention; and

     –	 Daily interactions during which Turkana men, women, and children (usually
        older men and women and young children) experience abuse and are made to
        leave the camp due to quarrels with or complaints by refugees.

	 Covert means of violence include:

     –	 Occasional interactions during which refugees mistreat women and children
        working for them, with threats to halt further employment; and

     –	 Occasional interactions during which usually older men and women might be
        harmed.

n	   Refugees exploit the Turkana. Exploitation can occur in various ways, including:

     –	 Underpayment.

       n	   Many Turkana complain that the wages they receive in food or cash are insuf-
            ficient and unsatisfactory, even while acknowledging it provides enough to
            survive on a daily basis.

       n	   Some respondents complain that refugees try to negotiate prices down to a
            point that is “insulting” and that the Turkana sellers often have no choice but
            to sell at the offered prices.

     –	 Delayed or nonpayment for goods or services rendered.

       n	   Many respondents claim that some refugee groups delay payment for charcoal
            and firewood delivery as well as for domestic work.

       n	   When payments accumulate over time, some refugees refuse to pay the Tur-
            kana, often chasing them away.
32   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



          –	 Overworking.

            n	   Respondents mention various occasions when refugees overworked the Tur-
                 kana under their employ, making them carry heavy loads, such as water, food,
                 wood, and fencing material.

     n	   Refugees take resources from the Turkana. Accusations of theft and resource
          extraction take various forms.

          –	 Refugees take resources from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the
             United Nations, and the Kenyan government that should either go to or be shared
             with the Turkana; or

          –	 Refugees take land from the Turkana and cause the environmental depletion of
             Kakuma and the decline of herding and grazing land.

     n	   Refugees disdain the Turkana. Many respondents express their sense that the refu-
          gees think the Turkana are inferior and treat them with varying degrees of disdain.

          –	 Teasing. Refugees make fun of Turkana lifestyles, behaviors, and conditions.

          –	 Indifference. Many refugees treat the Turkana as though they are invisible and
             voiceless, ignoring their requests for support or money and often refusing to even
             acknowledge them.

     n	   Refugees bring crime, drugs, and alcohol into Turkana.

          –	 Crime. Refugees are involved in stealing.

          –	 Drugs and alcohol. Refugees trade in drugs and brew alcohol, which can be
             abused by the Turkana.

     Respondents from the five sites offer these narratives in decreasing order of frequency:
     most respondents refer to the refugees as violent exploiters and usurpers; only a few
     respondents from Kakuma mention more specific issues, such as disdain, discrimina-
     tion, crime, and substance abuse. General narratives about refugees as violent “others”
     or foreign usurpers are common across the sites. The Turkana of Kakuma offer more
     specific and detailed narratives, possibly because they interact more directly and fre-
     quently with refugees than do the Turkana of Lorengo, Lokichoggio, and Lorugum,

who more likely hear about these perspectives indirectly and therefore generate rather
generic narratives, unburdened by detail or experience. The narratives of the Turkana of
Kakuma are nuanced, reflecting the complex nature of their interactions, but their nar-
ratives also vary based on the ethnicity of the refugee and their expectations regarding
the outcomes of interactions. According to many study informants:

n	   Ethiopians and Darfuris are good, peaceful, will pay cash, and are fair;

n	   Somalis are peaceful and hire more Turkana than any other group, but they fre-
     quently do not pay on time and break promises;

n	   Burundians, Congolese, and Rwandans are good and peaceful, and they usually pay
     the agreed-on amount on time; and

n	   The South Sudanese are like the Turkana—they like to drink and are violent.

Subnarrative 2: Refugees are good (people).
This narrative is not commonly reported by the respondents across the five sites, but is
reported extensively and in detail by the respondents at Kakuma and Lorengo. Primar-
ily, the ethnographic interview data suggest that significant numbers of the Turkana of
Kakuma—and to some extent of Lorengo—report experiences of friendship and part-
nerships with refugees. These reports extend beyond the narrative of the refugees ben-
efitting the Turkana (see next section—subnarrative 3) through employment, exchange,
or the presence of relief and development organizations. This refugee-as-good narrative
can be divided into three categories:

n	   Refugee as friend and neighbor. Many of the respondents in Kakuma             Many report that refugees are
     report that the refugees provide help in the form of friendship and          generous people who help the
     support networks that can be drawn on in times of need, including          Turkana with gifts of food or cash
     cash and food transfers and other types of assistance, such as over-         even if there is no exchange of
     night stays and firewood or charcoal storage, as examples.                      labor, services, or products.

n	   Refugee as helper. Many respondents report that refugees are gen-
     erous people who help the Turkana with gifts of food or cash even if there is no
     exchange of labor, services, or products.

n	   Refugee as donor. Many respondents claim that refugees often give money to the
     Turkana who beg or who seem to be in dire need. Even though the amounts are
     small, the refugees are acknowledged for their generosity.
34   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     Similar to the analysis of “refugees are bad,” in Lokichoggio, and Lorugum, the nar-
     rative of “refugees are good” is uncommon, but the Turkana of Kakuma and Lorengo
     discuss it in detail—it is the dominant alternative to the “refugees-are-bad” narrative.
     It can again be argued that a greater number of interactions can generate more detailed
     and nuanced positive narratives of refugees among the Turkana living in close proxim-
     ity to the refugees in Kakuma.

     Subnarrative 3: Refugees are beneficial.
     The narrative that refugees are beneficial—that their presence brings benefits to the
     Turkana—is common across the five sites, especially in Kakuma and Lorengo, and
     to a lesser extent in Lokichoggio. Respondents acknowledged that the presence and
     activities of the refugees, such as in the marketplace and by providing employment, fill
     in gaps in development and relief resources provided by the Kenyan government and
     the other NGOs and relief organizations to the locals. The respondents suggest that
     they also benefit from the refugee presence through services offered to refugees that
     they themselves are also entitled to, including health and medical facilities at the main
     hospital. Respondents cite a number of specific ways that the Turkana benefit from the
     presence of refugees, including the following:

     n	   Refugees are good for trade.

          –	 Consumers of Turkana products. Refugees are the primary consumers of prod-
             ucts made and sold by the Turkana, including fencing material, construction
             poles, firewood, charcoal, cereals, and livestock.

          –	 Turkana as consumers of refugee products. The Turkana are able to access mar-
             kets and goods at lower prices inside the refugee camp than they can at other sites,
             including Kakuma town.

          –	 Refugees as sources of credit. The Turkana are sometimes offered credit by refu-
             gee-owned shops, enabling them to purchase goods that they could not otherwise
             access.

     n	   Refugees as employers.

          –	 Domestic work. Refugees provide the Turkana—mainly women and children—
             with work in return for food and/or cash, benefiting even the least educated with
             employment opportunities.
                                                          4. Interactions at Kakuma          35



     –	 Portage. In return for food and/or cash, refugees hire the Turkana to carry water
        from the boreholes and relief food from the distribution points to refugee homes.

     –	 Home construction. Turkana men and women are hired by refugees to construct
        fences, build houses, dig ditches, and engage in other construction activities.

n	   Distribution of relief food. Apart from employing the Turkana to carry relief food,
     respondents also mention that the presence of a black market where refugees sell
     their relief food results in cheaper prices at the refugee camp and in town markets
     for food grains and cereals, such as maize and sorghum.

n	   The presence of UNHCR, the International Rescue Committee, and other NGOs.
     The respondents acknowledge that the refugee camp is the primary reason for
     the presence of international development and relief organizations, including the
     UNHCR, as well as the Kenyan government. Reported benefits include:

     –	 The additional personnel in the District Commissioner’s Office due to the larger
        population of Western Turkana District increases accountability and improves
        engagement with the people.

     –	 Relief groups and programs, such as the Hunger Safety Net Programme, provides
        food and other needs to the Turkana during times of crisis.

     –	 The International Rescue Committee’s main hospital provides free health care to
        the Turkana, including diagnosis and treatment. Despite reported shortcomings
        in the provisioning of health care, most respondents note that the presence of the
        hospital is a primary and necessary benefit accrued to them mainly because of the
        presence of refugees.

The narrative of refugees as beneficial to the Turkana can also be parsed along the factor
of distance between a respondent’s residence and the camp and the number of interac-
tions that the respondent has had with refugees. The Turkana of Kakuma and Lorengo
benefit from the presence of refugees more than the Turkana of Lokichoggio, Lorugum,
and Lodwar. Interestingly, however, the Turkana of Lokichoggio refer to the refugees as
“beneficial” much more often than do those of Lorugum and Lodwar. It is possible that
the observable decline in the well-being of the Turkana at Lokichoggio began when the
UN and associated relief and development organizations left for Juba without leaving
behind an alternative source of jobs, employment, and support for the locals. Therefore,
the Turkana of Lokichoggio hold largely negative perceptions of refugees, but at the

     same time, as discussed in more detail below, acknowledge that the presence of the
     refugees is linked to benefits received from associated relief and development agen-
     cies providing services to the refugees: as a result of agreements between the Kenyan
     government and UNHCR, some of these services must be provided to the local host
     community as well.




                                                                 Fathers, brothers, and sons

Metanarrative 1: Refugees are violent “others” and foreign usurpers.
An analysis of the interface between subnarratives 1–3 suggest that, across the county,
the Turkana share a broad metanarrative of refugees as the violent “others” and foreign
usurpers of Turkana land and resources. However, as pointed out earlier, this metanar-
rative is quite general and largely without nuance, mainly comprising statements about
dangers posed by the presence of refugees. As expected, this larger metanarrative is
transmitted in its more general form across the county, and the further the distance
between Turkana residents and the refugee camp, the fewer the interactions between
groups and the less nuanced the reproduced version of the narrative.

The Turkana residents of Kakuma and Lorengo have a nuanced and more complex
metanarrative about refugees. The perceptions of refugees among most respondents
are still subsumed in the narrative of violent “other” or foreign usurper, but they are
also emphatic that they benefit from the presence of the refugees and that refugees
are people who range from “good” to “bad” and should be judged on an individual
basis. Among the Turkana of Kakuma and Lorengo, the metanarrative of the refugee
as violent “other” or foreign usurper is mitigated by interactions between individual
members of the host and refugee communities through pathways of social relation-
ships, such as friendss, neighbors, and marital alliances, as well as through the exchange
of labor, services, products, and even ideas.

Metanarrative 2: “Naenda Kenya”—We are marginalized, excluded, and
discriminated against.
The second metanarrative among the Turkana relates to a sense of marginalization,
exclusion, and discrimination from the overall political and social systems and struc-
ture of Kenyan society and governance. Aspects of the narrative include:

n	   The Turkana were systematically marginalized by the British and subsequently by
     the Kenyan government through:

     –	 Punitive military action and confiscation of livestock by the British;

     –	 The closed district administration and resulting isolation and policed supervision
        of the Turkana as individuals and as a society (1930–86);

     –	 A lack of purposeful development in Turkana County; and

     –	 Ongoing narratives among policy makers and political elites about the inability
        and/or unwillingness of the Turkana to participate in ongoing development efforts.
38   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     n	   The Turkana are excluded from mainstream Kenyan society. “Down-Kenyans” dis-
          criminate against the Turkana by:

          –	 Excluding them from jobs given to down-Kenyans even if they are qualified,
             unless they are low-paying, menial, or security-related; and

          –	 Socially discriminating against the Turkana, even as individuals, treating them
             poorly through exclusion and marginalization in Kenya and elsewhere.

     n	   The Turkana see their primary problem as neglect by the government. Respondents
          report that:

          –	 The government does not care about the Turkana and that even county govern-
             ment politicians are not concerned about their well-being.

          –	 The political experience is an exercise in futility, where politicians come, ask for
             votes, make promises, and then disappear—only to reappear during the next elec-
             tion cycle.

     n	   The systemic corruption across the political landscape makes it impossible for the
          benefits of any intervention to effectively and meaningfully reach the Turkana people
          themselves. This includes planned activities and changes such as:

          –	 Development efforts by the UN and other international bodies. Most respon-
             dents report that development efforts will be successful only if external actors
             directly speak with the people, going beyond the local leaders and politicians.

          –	 Natural resource extraction. Most respondents express cautious optimism that
             recent discoveries in oil and gas in the Lokichar area and the water aquifer in the
             Lotikipi plains will benefit the people of Turkana. Most think that any benefits
             from these industries to the local people will be minimal, such as:

             n	   Jobs for the educated. This narrative is given primarily by respondents who
                  complain that they will be excluded from benefits because they are not edu-
                  cated and that they will be relegated to menial labor in similar ways that they
                  already are.

             n	   Menial jobs for the Turkana. This narrative is primarily proffered by the edu-
                  cated Turkana respondents who feel that even the educated among the Tur-
                  kana would be hired as sweepers, cleaners, and security guards, and for other
                                                            4. Interactions at Kakuma           39



             menial low-paying jobs. They would not be given higher-level jobs despite
             their qualifications.

     –	 Devolution. Many respondents offer a mixed narrative about devolution, with
        most expressing hope tempered by a sense of cynicism about the government and
        its ability to deliver on the stated promises of transparency and accountability.
        Responses regarding devolution are of two main types:

        n	   If done correctly, devolution will help because the local government would
             have more autonomy and access to resources. The systems of accountability
             and transparency would hopefully mitigate the graft and corruption, which is
             seen as endemic in the political system.
                                                                                   Respondents report major
                                                                             concerns regarding the ability of
        n	   Even if the central government gives money to the county,
                                                                            the government and the political
             without a major change in the political system, the money
                                                                            system to transfer the benefits of
             might not be spent on the people.
                                                                              any intervention to the people.
Respondents report major concerns regarding the ability of the gov-
ernment and the political system to transfer the benefits of any intervention to the
people—whether it be natural resource extraction, development projects, or devolu-
tion—but this should be contextualized in the broader narrative about corruption and
graft. 	

The main points that emerge from the analysis of the various subnarratives and meta-
narratives include:

n	   Ideas and attitudes about the refugees are more nuanced among the Turkana of
     Kakuma and Lorengo than with the other sites, including the coexistence of positive
     and negative narratives that have been and continue to be shaped by proximity to the
     refugee camp and frequency of interactions between the groups;

n	   The Turkana of Lokichoggio hold nuanced ideas about refugees, ranging from the
     idea that refugees bring benefits to refugees and are violent usurpers, likely resulting
     from their experience with the sudden depletion of development and relief services
     when the relevant agencies and NGOs departed after 2008;

n	   Among the Turkana of Lodwar and Lorugum, perceptions of the refugees are more
     negative: they are more likely to subscribe to the general metanarrative of refuge as
     violent “other” and foreign usurper without being tempered by coterminous ideas of
     refugees bringing socioeconomic or other benefits; and
40   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     n	   The Turkana share perspectives of neglect and marginalization by their government
          and the rest of Kenya under the metanarrative of “naenda Kenya,” which is further
          tempered by the history of political violence toward and social exclusion of the Tur-
          kana within and outside Turkana County. This metanarrative is also shaped by issues
          of corruption and graft that contribute to the cynicism and negative perceptions
          regarding any intervention where local, regional, or national politicians could play a
          deciding or determining role.

     These narratives usually shape and are shaped by interactions and external factors, as
     explored in the following two sections.


     Interactions and Narratives
     Interactions between refugees and the Turkana of Kakuma are shaped largely by the
     narratives and experiences of satisfaction and dignity or dissatisfaction and indignity
     emerging from them (figure 4.1a–f). Interactions between refugee and host communi-
     ties can be divided into two main types:

     n	   Social interactions. These fall into two subcategories:

          –	 Benign, solidarity-building interactions. These include friendship, marital alli-
             ances, and networks of support between interacting individuals and families that
             rely on the Turkana concept of bond-friendship and the refugees’ own cultural
             logic of friendships and alliances. These interactions often take place in churches
             or other religious forums; through community organization groups; and at music
             festivals, weddings, cafes, teashops, and restaurants that are accessed by individu-
             als from both the host and the refugee communities.

          –	 Violent or fractious interactions. In these types of interactions, the Turkana feel
             threatened, exploited, or are physically and verbally attacked over disagreements
             regarding social or economic exchange, a cultural misunderstanding, or intoxi-
             cation/substance abuse. These interactions often take place at social gatherings
             in public venues, where a public argument can rapidly escalate into a commu-
             nal conflict. Even more often, however, these types of interactions occur within
             households due to differing cultural logic or assumptions about payment, refusal,
             work conditions, and entitlement to returns.

     n	   Economic interactions. They include:

          –	 Exchange of labor. In this circumstance, the Turkana work directly for the refu-
             gees as domestic servants, in construction, or in portage. These transactions often
             get conflated with social interactions and hence can be benign if both parties in
             the exchange can maintain dignity and satisfaction; but they can become violent
             over a misunderstanding or with accusations of exploitation.

          –	 Exchange of products. In these interactions, the Turkana provide needed items
             to the refugees, such as fuelwood, meat, and other livestock products. In turn,
             they are able to access markets established by the refugees. These interactions
             allow for the flow of goods, cash, and food between refugees and hosts, but dis-
             agreements over payments, accusations of theft, and the humiliation associated
             with bargaining can lead to quarrels and conflict.

As described above, many interactions are shaped by social narratives and ongoing
interactions that reinforce or modify how various narratives are manifested and used
by Turkana individuals and groups. Hence, the metanarrative of the refugee as vio-
lent “other” acts as a larger cautionary tale within which the Turkana of Kakuma and
Lorengo can negotiate what they might find to be a dangerous space with the potential
to be treated with indignity. Their caution is tempered by their dependence on the camp
for social and economic interactions and their understanding that the refugees bring
direct and indirect benefits to the Turkana and their families.

It should be noted that the refugees are only one of a number of concerns among the
Turkana. Other narratives emerge from the larger subsistence and political economies
of the Turkana in which they present themselves as the lords of their domain, as resil-
ient and successful people in the face of external and uncontrollable factors such as
drought, famine, climate change, and other environmental issues. These narratives are
described in the next section.


External Factors and Narratives of Suffering,
Resilience, and Dignity
The Turkana, who are predominantly subsistence pastoralists, are extremely concerned
with the availability of grazing land and water, factors that depend on annual and sea-
sonal rainfall and precipitation regimes. As explained earlier, the Turkana occupied
the western Lake Turkana basin starting from southeastern Uganda and the Karamoja
escarpment in the 16th century CE and then expanding out in the 19th century CE to
areas that include present-day Turkana County and beyond into other parts of Kenya,
Uganda, South Sudan, and Ethiopia. During this latter period, the Turkana became
pastoralists because it enhanced one’s status from only pursuing subsistence activi-
ties. Historical and archaeological records suggest that the Turkana followed diversi-
fied subsistence pathways, including hunting, foraging, and agriculture in addition to
pastoralism.

These narratives of a grand past are paralleled by other historical narratives of margin-
alization and exclusion by the British and Kenyan governments as well as narratives of
resilience in the face of environmental and climatic changes, especially droughts and
famines. The Turkana pride themselves on having successfully managed pastoralism
and other subsistence and status-building activities for centuries, and they have devel-
oped an extensive suite of local and regional narratives that combine stories of suffering
and resilience in the face of drought and famine. Memorized or recounted stories are
told of the suffering of the respondents themselves or their family members during
these famines and droughts, followed by stories of coping and resilience that include

                                  strategies of migration, foraging, and cooking famine foods as well as grief and mourn-
                                  ing. Respondents also relate narratives of birth, marriage, and regeneration of livestock
                                  and families during and after the famines.

                                  The narratives of famine and drought feed into the larger narratives of environmental
                                  and climatic change, where the respondents themselves report observations of both
                                  increasing frequencies of drought and lethality of famines, especially to livestock. These
                                  narratives occur more frequently among the Turkana of Lorengo and Lokichoggio than
                                  among those of Lorugum and Kakuma. It could be argued that the generation and
                                  reproduction of the famine narratives are directly related to the decline of regional and
                                  local networks among the Turkana.


                                  Perceptions as Outcomes
                                  The various interactions noted in the previous section are combined into categories
                                  of perceptions: general negative (nonviolent), negative (violent “other”), and positive
                                  (good and/or beneficial).

                                  General Negative Perceptions
                       Levels of negativity in the Turkana’s perceptions of refugees, excluding reports of vio-
                       lence and mistreatment, are generally equal across the four locations studied in the host
                       community (figure 4.2). There is a statistically significant difference between Kakuma
                       and Lorugum in this metric at the 95 percent confidence level (X2=5.08; p=0.024), but
                       not between Kakuma and Lorengo, with the second greatest difference in proportion

interviewed respondents suggest that the Turkana feel the most animosity toward the
political system and even toward UNHCR and other NGOs providing aid to refugees
in Kakuma, such as the Lutheran World Federation and the World Food Programme
(WFP). The Turkana often feel that these agencies are unjust in their distribution of
resources because the host community is also in need of aid and economic develop-
ment. They frequently cite the long history of marginalization they have experienced as
well as their traditional ownership of the land on which the refugee camp is located to
demonstrate that they deserve attention from international actors in the region. They
perceive these organizations to have vast resources at their disposal, and they tend to
believe that the decision to prioritize refugees over the Turkana is rooted in malice and
discrimination.

Perceptions of Refugees as Violent “Others”
In response to the question about the impact of refugees on their lives, 246 of the 601
Turkana interviewed (41 percent) report that they experience some combination of
mistreatment, economic malfeasance, and violence at the hands of refugees when they
enter the camp to trade (figure 4.3). Notably, the proportion of Turkana respondents
reporting these behaviors varies significantly by location.

In Kakuma, which is adjacent to the refugee camp, 50 of 150 respondents (33 percent)
report refugee violence and mistreatment. Interestingly, an even higher proportion of
respondents in both Lokichoggio (58 percent) and Lorengo (68 percent) report these
behaviors. While there is no statistically significant difference between Lokichoggio and
Lorengo with regard to the proportion of reports of
refugee violence at the 95 percent confidence level
(Χ2=3.23, p=0.072), both of these proportions are Figure 4.3. Proportion of Host Community
significantly higher than in Kakuma (comparing Members Reporting Refugee Violence or

                                decreases (figure 4.4). In Kakuma, there was actually a higher proportion of respon-
                                dents who note positive refugee impacts (49 percent) than violence or mistreatment. In
                                rural Lorengo, 45 percent of respondents report positive refugee impacts; statistically,
                                these proportions are not significantly different from one another (X2=0.482; p=0.488).

                                  In both Kakuma and rural Lorengo, a high proportion of these positive reports involve
                                  trading and other economic opportunities offered by refugees. Specifically, several
                                  respondents in both Kakuma and Lorengo report having friendships, or at least friendly
                                  relationships, with refugees. Others report that refugees offer employment opportuni-
                                  ties—primarily domestic work in refugee homes—and a few note that the host com-
                                  munity sometimes has access to aid and services from NGOs serving refugees. Similar
                                  to the overall positive sentiments, these specific reports decline with increasing distance
                                  from the camp. In Lorugum, far from Kakuma, no one reports benefits to the host com-
                                  munity because of the refugees or any other positive sentiments about them.
5            Measuring Impacts


Measuring Nutritional and Psychosocial
Well-Being Among the Turkana
As described in the methodology section, part of the social impact analysis was a large-
scale survey of the Turkana residents of Kakuma, Lorugum, Lorengo, and Lokichoggio,
which collected data on demographic factors (age, gender, number of livestock, and
number of children); anthropometric factors (height, weight, and skinfold thickness);
and psychosocial stress (listing of various causes of stress). These data were collected
from 600 individuals—300 male and 300 female, with 150 respondents from each of
the four sites. The height, weight, and skinfold measurements enabled the calculation
of two anthropometric variables that are considered significant indicators of nutritional
well-being among human populations: body mass index (BMI) and sum of skinfolds
(SSF). Both of these enable the calculation of the body fat percentage (BFP) of a human
or other living being, which is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass. Body fat
includes essential body fat and stored body fat. Essential body fat is necessary to main-
tain life and reproductive functions. While BMI is useful as an approximate indicator of
well-being, SSF is seen as a more accurate indicator of BFP, especially conducted among
ethnically and nutritionally similar groups. It is based on a skinfolds test, also known
as a pinch test, whereby a pinch of skin is precisely measured by calipers at several
standardized points on the body to determine the subcutaneous fat layer thickness. SSF
is a reliable measure of an individual’s energetic status because it enables reliable and
accurate measures of BFP (Campbell et al. 2005). The data were analyzed using various
procedures to:

n	   Establish a baseline for the nutritional and psychosocial status of the Turkana at
     Kakuma, Lorugum, Lokichoggio, and Lorengo;

n	   Examine possible impacts of the refugee presence at Kakuma on the host community
     by analyzing the BMI, SSF, BFP, and psychosocial stress profiles within and between
     the populations of the four sites; and

                                                                                             47
48   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     n	   Understand how gender, age, and location might affect the physical and psychosocial
          well-being of the residents of the four sites in Turkana County.

     Additional caveats to this study include the following:

     n	   Sedentary Turkana men would show higher measures of BMI, SSF, and BFP than
          nomadic or pastoral Turkana men. However, all the women in this study followed
          a more sedentary/settled lifestyle. The women in pastoral households were more
          sedentary, raising children and young animals, making charcoal, and collecting
          firewood. Some of the women in Kakuma and Lorugum, and to a lesser extent
          Lokichoggio, also mentioned office work, teaching, and domestic service.

     n	   SSF may vary based on body type and diet. Although this could be due to greater
          access to cereals and carbohydrates at Kakuma as opposed to the more meat- and
          milk-based diet among pastoralists of the more rural areas of Lorengo, the Turkana
          pastoralists are not as cereal-averse as usually assumed. In both their daily lives
          and their mythic tradition, plant-based foods, including sorghum, are regarded as
          staples, but cultural adaptations have taken place where older people eschew cereals
          so that younger people can get access, especially during droughts and famines—a
          practice confirmed by study respondents across all sites (Lamphear 1988; Wright et
          al. 2015). Furthermore, the Turkana of today include maize and beans in a large por-
          tion of their diet, a trend especially noted after the vast inflow of cereal-based relief
          food that arrived following the famines of 1990–92 (called Lokwakoyo/Akalkal),
          1999–2000 (called Logara/Empopo), and 2011–12 (Hunger Safety Net Programme),
          as well as during droughts and the periods between the famines. As Bush (1995: 249)
          noted, when traditional foods were depleted, the Turkana grew to “increasingly rely
          on commercial food (maize and beans) and, to a lesser extent, on wild fruits” leading
          to “higher consumption of [not local] food” and a greater “reliance on the market
          and, in turn, on agricultural production in distant farming regions.” We observed
          that sorghum, maize, and beans were staple foods across the four sites of this study.
          Therefore, differences in physical indicators (BMI, SSF, and BFP) between Kakuma
          and the other sites could be due to enhanced access to larger quantities of available
          cereals at Kakuma.

     n	   Regarding water, sanitation, and hygiene, it is clear from various studies that expo-
          sure to environments with high levels of fecal contamination is correlated with
          chronic malnutrition and undernourishment caused by recurring diarrhea and pos-
          sibly tropical or environmental enteropathy (Humphery 2009; Mahmud and Mboya
          2016). We would expect all the sites to have high rates of malnutrition related to
          water, sanitation, and hygiene due to the sharing of water sources with livestock
                                                                  5. Measuring Impacts              49



   and other domesticated animals, such as riverbed holes, rivers, lakes, and troughs
   from boreholes. Significant impacts to the population due to a lack of water, sanita-
   tion, and hygiene are likely in Kakuma because, in addition to having the highest
   population density among the sites (>2,000 persons/square kilometer), most of its
   host population is still meeting their personal and livestock water needs using holes
   dug in the bed of the Tarach River and local water holes, and the use of open spaces
   as latrines persists due to a paucity of pit latrines. As the results suggest, while water,
   sanitation, and hygiene may have an impact, the nutritional and energy status of the
   Turkana in Kakuma is higher than for those in Lorengo or Lokichoggio, most likely
   due to their greater access to energy-rich foods such as cereals.


Body Mass Index
Nutritional data on height and weight (mass) measurements were
used to calculate BMI [body mass (kg)/(height/m)2]. The results sug-       Table 5.1. BMI Across Four Locations

locations by age and gender (see table A.1). The differences in Source: World Bank survey 2015.
BMI between the men at the four locations were not statistically
significant. However, as table 5.2a demonstrates, the analysis of
the BMI from all the respondents—300 men and 300 women—suggest that both are
underweight.

In addition, the analysis of the proportion of population who are thin/undernourished,
normal, or overweight/obese was compared with the results of the Kenya Demographic
Health Survey (KDHS 2014). The results of both surveys are comparable, with a simi-
lar distribution of BMI for Turkana women across the three categories (table 5.2b). A
similar breakdown was not found for men, neither for the national aggregates nor for
Turkana-specific results, signifying a severely gendered gap in data. Nevertheless, the
results suggest that 45.3 percent of women and 58.9 percent of men in Turkana are
highly vulnerable to malnutrition caused by food insecurity.

The BMI data were further disaggregated by age—young adult (18–35), middle-aged
(36–55), and older adults (>56)—and then by age and gender groups. The BMI varia-
tion by age and gender are shown in tables 5.3a and 5.3b.

     As seen in table 5.3a and table A.1 (see appendix A) there is no significant difference in
     the BMI of the Turkana across all four locations among young adults, the middle-aged,
     and older adults, but there was a difference in some subpopulations when the BMI was
     disaggregated by age and gender (table 5b). Young adult females of Lorugum and, to
     a lesser extent, Kakuma have marginally higher BMIs than do those of Lorengo and
     Lokichoggio. The BMI analysis within gender and age categories showed small differ-
     ences across the four locations between women of Lorugum and Lorengo, and when
     further disaggregated by age and gender, specifically showed small differences between
     the young women of Kakuma/Lorugum and Lorengo/Lokichoggio. However, the over-
     all figures are worrying in terms of physical well-being and nutritional profiles of the
     Turkana because they suggest that undernourishment is a normal state of affairs in Tur-
     kana County, even in areas where residents enjoy proximity and relatively easy access to
     relief and development services and resources, such as in Kakuma and Lorugum. There
     is a greater presence of public services in Kakuma due to the presence of the refugees,

and Lorugum has benefited from almost 20 years of consistent attention and invest-
ment due to the Turkwel Hydroelectric Power Station, which has enabled engaging in
agriculture and more sustainable pastoralism.

A variety of studies suggest that BMI must be used in conjunction with other indicators
of nutrition because height and body mass (weight) do not accurately account for body
shape, body fat, or populations that tend toward particular body types, such as tall and
thin or short and stocky. The Turkana, like many East African pastoral groups, tend
to be tall and thin with low percentages of body fat. BMI measures often overestimate
measurements for taller individuals by 10 percent. But even when the overestimation of
BMI is factored in, Turkana respondents demonstrate high levels of less than optimal or
only minimal healthy nutritional profiles.


Sum of Skinfolds
Responding to concerns about the accuracy of using BMI alone to test nutrition levels
in a population, health researchers and professionals commonly use another variable—
sum of skinfolds (SSF). Results of the analysis of all skinfold measurements among
respondents from the four sites are shown in figures 5.1a, 5.1b, and 5.1c.

The higher average of the SSF values at Kakuma and Lorugum suggest that Turkana
residents in these locations have greater nutritional security and health than those of
Lokichoggio and Lorengo. While SSF findings for Lorugum suggest that the presence
of consistent development due to the Turkwel Hydroelectric Power Station has led to
greater food security, they also suggest increased inequality and even inequity through
the generation of economic classes. Similar conclusions could be drawn from the SSF
findings at Kakuma, which suggest that the Turkana of Kakuma have greater access to
food and hence nutritional security because of the presence of the camp.

54   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     BMI and SSF data were further analyzed to see if there were differences between popu-
     lations that interacted with refugees/development-relief activities and the populations
     who self-identified as pure pastoralists and hence did not interact with the refugees
     in Kakuma and Lorengo (or with development/NGOs in the case of Lorugum and
     Lokichoggio). Only 6 out of 150 respondents in Kakuma (3 female, 3 male) fell into the
     category of nonrefugee/nondevelopment-aided subsistence/livelihood, compared with
     28 in Lokichoggio (8 female, 20 male), 140 in Lorengo (65 female, 75 male), and 17 in
     Lorugum (6 female, 11 male). The results of an analysis of the differences in BMI and
     SSF for these groups, controlling for age and location, follows:

     n	   BMI

          –	 Women. The pastoralist women of Kakuma have significantly lower mean BMI
             (15.65, standard deviation 2.95) than the women of Lokichoggio (18.95, standard
             deviation 1.71, p=0.023), Lorengo (18.63, standard deviation 2.06, p=0.022), and
             Lorugum (19.31, standard deviation 2.16, p=0.023).

          –	 Men. There are no statistically significant differences in the mean BMI among
             pastoralist men across all four locations.

     n	   SSF

          –	 Women. There is no statistically significant difference (p=0.972) between the
             mean SSF among pastoralist women of Kakuma (15.73, standard deviation 3.84)
             and Lorengo (17.57, standard deviation 7.29). There are, however, significant dif-
             ferences between the means of SSF for the women of Kakuma and both Lorugum
             (45.17, standard deviation 22.39, p=0.004) and Lokichoggio (33.51, standard
             deviation 26.51, p=0.07).

          –	 Men. There are no statistically significant differences in the mean SSF among pas-
             toralist men across all four locations.

     These findings suggest that the bulk of the Turkana at Kakuma are engaged with the
     refugee and/or the relief development sector at Kakuma, with interactions ranging from
     exchange of labor and goods to begging, all of which provide access to cereal-based
     foods and hence higher nutritional status. It is particularly worrying that the relatively
     few men and (especially) women in the Kakuma area who self-identified as “pure”
     pastoralists have lower BMI and SSF than did self-identified pastoralists in the other
                                                                 5. Measuring Impacts                                           55



locations (see appendix A). This may be a result of the low sample size for both men
(n=3) and women (n=3) at Kakuma. However, in combination with the ethnographic
data on the loss of land, tree cover, water, and livestock market dynamics, the findings
stress the need for further study to explore whether the population of Kakuma that is
solely dependent on pastoralism is at greater risk and is more vulnerable than the pas-
toralists of other parts of Turkana. From a policy approach, the findings suggest a dire
need for immediate intervention and aid for the pastoralists of Kakuma in ways that are
not dependent on the refugee-host dynamics.

On the other hand, the overall findings indicate that engagement with refugee-related
activities and exchanges results in higher BMI and particulary SSF for the Turkana of
Kakuma. Specifically, results from the BMI and especially the SSF data, controlling
for the lower BMI and body fat content expected among pastoralists, suggest that the
energy status of the host community of Kakuma is better than
that of Lokichoggio or Lorengo and that results are similar to Figure 5.2. Average BFP Across Sites

56   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     More analysis is needed to ascertain this as fact, including a closer look at diets; water,
     sanitation, and hygiene; and other factors, but the presence of refugees at Kakuma
     appears to be filling a general gap, analogous to the development process at Lorugum. It
     is more highly correlated with a greater average of physical well-being among the host
     community, possibly resulting from increased access to high energy foods such as cere-
     als or cash in exchange for goods, services, and labor, as well as other services intended
     for refugees that are also available to or easily accessed by the host community.

     Results suggest that the Turkana of Kakuma have better nutritional access and sta-
     tus than those of Lokichoggio or Lorengo and similar access and status than those at
     Lorogum, which has experienced consistent development investment for over 20 years.
     However, the presence of the refugees may also lead to differences in psychosocial stress
     levels among the host community. Results are described in the next section.


     Psychosocial Stress
     The analysis of the psychosocial stressor data first examined the relationship between
     nutritional status and worries related to eight stressor categories: water, food, health,
     livestock, environment, economy, refugees, and transportation. To see how these stress-
     ors are distributed among locations when controlling for sample size within each group
     and within age and gender categories, the larger set of interactions is combined into
     four categories: positive, negative, neutral, and systemic. They are reported as the aver-
     age number of the types of interactions recounted by each respondent and the pro-
     portion of incidents reported within each of these four categories, disaggregated by
     age and gender. The results (see figures 5.3a–5.3d) provide a clearer picture and help
     contextualize the differences and variations among the Turkana of Kakuma in terms of
     their perceptions of refugees. On average and proportionally, Turkana men report more
     negative and fewer positive interactions with refugees than women do; they also report
     more systemic problems than the women (figures 5.3a and 5.3b).

     As demonstrated in figures 5.3c and 5.3d, young Turkana have more positive interac-
     tions with refugees, while middle-aged and older Turkana report a relatively lower num-
     ber of positive experiences with refugees but slightly higher proportions and averages
     of negative interactions. Middle-aged and older Turkana also report more significant
     issues with systemic problems and fewer problems with the systemic processes than do
     the young.

     Using SSF as a proxy for nutritional status, worry codes (appendix c) were placed into
     the above stressor categories, which were treated as dummy variables. A series of t-tests
     were used to assess whether the mean of the sum of skinfolds varied significantly between

Kakuma. Of all four locations, when age is taken into account, Kakuma has the great-
est variation in principal component scores. This variation is primarily loaded onto
PC03. Not surprisingly, older adults and young adults vary most dramatically. Among
women, thirst (code 11) and unemployment (code 50) appear to be the primary drivers
of difference between age-sets; in men, these same worries are driving age variation
but are more intensely felt. In both cases, young adults feel these worries more strongly
than older adults. For men in particular, the age variation appears to be driven almost
exclusively by worry about unemployment: a line drawn between the young adult male
and the older adult male points would be almost exactly parallel to the vector associated
with unemployment.

     Lokichoggio. In Lokichoggio, illness-related worries are driving the variation between
     older adult women and women of the other age-sets. Thirst and unemployment are the
     primary drivers of variation between men and women. Among men, variation is loaded
     almost equally between PC02 and PC03. Young adult men worry most about raids and
     personal illness; older adult men worry most about livestock illness; and middle-aged
     adults worry most about thirst and unemployment.

     Lorengo. Worries about livestock and family illness (codes 43 and 42, respectively); the
     lack of medical facilities (code 44); and drought (code 10) set Lorengo apart from the
     other locations, largely due to the nearly complete absence of public health facilities,
     such as clinics and veterinary services. Age-set variation at Lorengo is loaded almost
     equally onto PC02 and PC03. Among men, older adults differ the most from young
     and middle-aged adults, but among women, it is young adults who vary the most from
     the other two age-sets. Young adult women are most worried about unemployment
     and poverty (code 51), whereas older women are more concerned with livestock and
     family illness (codes 43 and 42, respectively). Older adult men vary from younger men
     primarily based on worries about hunger (code 30) and livestock illness.

     Lorugum. Lorugum overlaps significantly with Kakuma in terms of worry profiles.
     In Lorugum, however, the variation of worries is overwhelmingly accounted for by

age rather than gender. Additionally, variation is loaded primarily onto PC03. Unlike
Lokichoggio, older adults in Lorugum—men and women—are more worried about
raiding, middle-aged adults are worried about illness, and young adults—both men
and women—are worried about unemployment and poverty.

The analysis suggests that the Turkana of Lorugum and Kakuma have more worries
about jobs, unemployment, education, and school fees than those in Lorengo and
Lokichoggio—that is, worries that only emerge when such opportunities exist in an
area. The presence of development in both areas might explain why the residents of
Lorugum and Kakuma share these worries with other groups across Kenya. At the same
time, worries over illness and general health, thirst, and livestock illness, largely held
by older men and women across the four locations, disproportionately affect younger
and middle-aged men and women in Lorengo and Lokichoggio. The distribution and
intensities of worries in Kakuma and Lorugum can be explained by the presence of
refugees and relief or development investment, respectively; and in Lorengo, they can
be explained by the absence of any development efforts. But Lokichoggio presents an
interesting case. As the headquarters for the UN Sudan War efforts from 1988–2006,
Lokichoggio had an impressive public service infrastructure for health, education,
commerce, and other activities that are central to development. However, after the
UN headquarters moved to Juba between 2006 and 2007, Lokichoggio underwent a
drastic attrition of jobs among the Turkana and other Kenyan staff unable to move to
South Sudan. While the non-Turkana returned to find jobs in other areas of Kenya,
the Turkana were faced with the choice of staying in Lokichoggio amid the dwindling
resources and population. One man said:

     “The economy of this place is completely controlled by refugees. The UNHCR
     is here for the refugees and also most of the NGOs [nongovernmental orga-
     nizations]. Even the Kenyan government cares more for the refugees. Only
     workers who stay here are teachers, most other officers come from ‘down-
     Kenya’ and even they are being supplemented by UNHCR. Look at Loki
     [choggio], it was so busy, and then when the UNHCR left, it has become a
     White Elephant, so much building, and now nothing.” (KII 2015).

The story of Lokichoggio is a cautionary tale about development based on a single or
central activity. When the UN mission, which provided the bulk of the opportunities
and capital, left for Juba, Lokichoggio experienced decline within three years, achieving
the low levels of nutritional and psychosocial well-being that characterize small and
isolated rural settlements like Lorengo. One woman said:
62   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



         “If the devolution really gives money to the county and the county uses the
         money well, that would be good for Turkana. And for the educated and non-
         educated Turkana alike, there will be jobs from the oil project and the water.
         Like it was at Lokichoggio. When the UN mission was there, Loki was a good
         place, with jobs and growth. So it can be good, as long as those things, like
         devolution, like the Oil companies, they stay and treat the Turkana as part-
         ners, they see them as the people who own the land but are generously shar-
         ing so should be cared for.” (KII 2015)

     The concern is that development at Kakuma and Lorugum are, like Lokichoggio, depen-
     dent on a narrow range of activities; for Kakuma, the refugee camp, and for Lorugum,
     the hydroelectric power plant. A difference between the two areas is that the residents
     of Lorugum were able to diversify their subsistence activities, moving from only pas-
     toralism to include agriculture and other small-scale industry and manufacturing. The
     proposed development efforts at Kakuma should include investments in diversification,
     moving away from a reliance on a single activity to provide jobs and opportunities.
            Gender-Differentiated
6           Norms, Dynamics, and
            Constraints at Kakuma

Oral histories and archaeological evidence suggest that the Turkana once depended
heavily on food resources obtained through agriculture and foraging—activities now
considered the domain of women and girls. Hence, although the activities of men
as pastoralists and women as agriculturalists and foragers seem to follow generally
observed gendered dichotomies (Rosaldo 1974), the activities of women were exalted
in myth and function during precolonial periods (Lamphear 1988, 1992). However,
changes introduced by the British and Kenyan administrations from the 1900s to the
1980s resulted in significant systemic changes to this social organization. Women’s labor
shifted from its central role in the subsistence economy and in myth to being relegated
to a secondary role within the emergent awi-adakar system. Ironically, while women
continued practicing agriculture and foraging and taught younger generations the skills
related to food extraction, processing, and storage, as well as the care of young ani-
mals; their role and status within the larger society diminished. Pastoralism expanded
its significance beyond that of status and prestige, becoming the primary subsistence
practice associated with the Turkana. From 1930 to 1980, this change was paralleled by
the forced settlement of the Turkana into small settlements that became the boundaries
of the domestic realm for women.

Interestingly, prevalent narratives from informants confirm various studies on the
changes in the lifestyle of the Turkana, suggesting that the discrimination against women
and gendered inequities recorded as part of traditional Turkana culture by external
observers and development policy makers might in fact have been a response to colo-
nialism and more recent changes during the postcolonial period, such as the culture
of raiding (ngokoro and moranism) (Hendrickson et al. 1996; Oba 1992). The narrative
further suggests that their forced settlement, the downgrading of women’s labor, and
the restrictions of women’s activities to the domestic realm may have been internalized
by the Turkana as an adaptation to the changing sociopolitical system, intensifying the
investment in pastoralism as the primary subsistence activity and the continuation of
pastoralism as the primary culturally acceptable means of achieving status and prestige.

This also disincentivized investments in agriculture and foraging beyond subsistence
levels. These social changes were highly correlated with alterations in the economic
organization of Turkana County, particularly the decline of status-providing opportu-
nities for men and of agency and socioeconomic participation among women.


Gendered Vulnerability and Structural Violence
among Turkana Men of Kakuma
Over the past 20 years, disparities between the development of Turkana and the rest of
the country led to an upsurge of external development activities, which have increased
dependency but which also led to a decline in pastoralism and an increasing reliance on
women’s activities (albeit without status), such as low-energy agriculture (horticulture),
foraging, and operating small businesses. The men, however, view pastoralism as their
only viable activity, and as they experience its decline, their alternatives are unemploy-
ment or menial jobs for development agencies or other groups.

Turkana men are often relegated to menial jobs, such as fetching water and food for
refugees, digging ditches, working in construction, or providing security for relief and
development agencies under the general “naenda Kenya” narrative—a reinforced sense
that they are outsiders in their own country and that refugees get better services and
resources than they do. A lack of permanent jobs available to Turkana men within Tur-
kana—other than unskilled manual ones or pastoralism—also compounds the larger
issue—that many of these menial jobs have the potential for interactions of indifference
or mistreatment that create experiences and reinforce narratives of indignity (matharau
in KiSwahili and ng’imeny in Turkana). The cycle is further reinforced when groups
of Turkana men are seen sitting by the roadside in the towns. The emergent narra-
tives among external actors—relief and development workers as well as refugees in
Kakuma—is of Turkana men being “lazy” and generally “unable to be productive.” One
refugee man from the Oromo community explained both sides of the narrative:

     “When you see a Turkana man like that, sitting there, not doing anything, on
     his stool, holding his stick, you think, why doesn’t he work? But you know
     from looking at him that he has lost his herd. I am from a pastoralist com-
     munity myself. I know what he’s feeling. I lost my herds when the government
     accused me of being part of the OLF [Oromo Liberation Front]. I could not
     do anything. I felt that as an Oromo man, I lost myself. That man, there, he is
     broken. He is broken because when he lost his herd, his animals, he lost him-
     self. He may start drinking, start abusing drugs, get into fights, but the biggest
     problem is that he lost his herd, and he lost his pride, his status.” (KII 2010)
66   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     This quote is reinforced by other data from informants as well as by studies on the
     problems of men and the construction of masculinity in marginalized communities
     where being a “man” is increasingly determined by narrow factors—in this case, the
     ability to build and maintain large herds and for younger men, to participate in raiding
     (ngoroko or moran). By comparison, women who were interviewed reported engaging
     in a diverse range of livelihoods, including agriculture; foraging for wild plant food,
     such as edapal, elamach, edu, and acacia; making and selling charcoal; collecting and
     selling firewood; gathering thornbushes and poles for fence-making and house con-
     struction; constructing fences and walls in the camp; and working menial cleaning jobs
     in the homes of refugee as well as in the development and relief workers’ compounds.

     However, engagement with the refuge economy has become increasingly critical for
     household income, and women are often the central interlocutors—economically and
     socially—between the refugee and host populations. Turkana women engage refugees
     in trade for milk, firewood, and charcoal. They also perform a range of domestic tasks,
     including cleaning, washing clothes, cooking, mending fences, and fetching water.
     While these activities are crucial for earning an income for the home, they also facilitate
     regular interactions with refugees, sometimes leading to increased and lasting personal
     bonds. Many women have used the shops in the camp to buy goods to sell at retail prices
     in the settlements outside the camp; some have built small businesses selling tobacco,
     relief food, and other consumables to refugees and the Turkana alike. One particu-
     lar study explores the distinctive ability of women to foster relationships between the
     Turkana and refugees (Ohta 2005), noting that these relationships and networks also
     often lead to increased support from refugees in times of need, especially when Turkana
     women form friendships with refugee women, attend church and other social functions
     together, and are subsequently given shelter—and even food—in times of need.

     For Turkana women in particular, bearing increasing responsibility for providing for
     the home by engaging in income-generating activities as a matter of survival and sup-
     port—however marginal—creates a space for their empowerment and agency. At the
     same time, many of the Turkana—men and women alike—note the risk of assault when
     asking for payment or attempting to negotiate fees for work. Jobs such as domestic ser-
     vice in the camp, charcoal and firewood production and sale, and fence-making expose
     women to the risk of physical and sexual violence. And some women from the refugee
     and host communities engage in commercial sex work, the cause and effect of which is
     relative vulnerability.

     Turkana men have a more varied set of interactions with the refugees in that they ben-
     efit from providing labor to them and to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as
     construction workers and security guards, respectively. However, their primary services
  6. Gender-Differentiated Norms, Dynamics, and Constraints at Kakuma                        67



of providing goods, such as large quantities of livestock and charcoal, are controlled by
the nimuchurus, the brokers who prevent easy access to the men. The Turkana men are
more likely to engage in social interactions, with the refugees consuming the stimulant
miraa as well as locally produced alcohol, often resulting in violence. They are also more
likely than women to produce the narratives of the refugee as the violent “other.”

A significantly important finding in this study and a potential focus for further research
is that when the health data were analyzed using regression and controlling for worries
(total, economic, and health), the earlier differences in sum of skinfolds (SSF) and body
fat percentage (BFP) between Kakuma/Lorugum and Lorengo/Lokichoggio remained
significant for the women (appendix D.1), but were significantly lessened for the men of
Kakuma (appendix D.2), suggesting that the Turkana men of Kakuma, specifically older
and middle-aged men who report greater negative interactions with refugees, might
be experiencing a more profound toll on their psychosocial and nutritional well-being
than Turkana women.


Gender-Based Violence and Structural Violence
among the Turkana Women of Kakuma
Vulnerability acts as a multiplier for compounding gender-based violence, including
sexual and structural violence in the host community of Kakuma, leaving women in
liminal positions of social stigmatization and exclusion that affect them as well as their
families. According to women interviewed from both the refugee and host communi-
ties, the primary causes for both types of violence are discrimination on the basis of
ethnicity, language, and religion, manifested in health status and access to cash. The
women revealed that in the patriarchal system found among most groups in the refugee
and host communities, motherhood—usually seen as a status-enhancing factor—can
become a conduit for stigmatization and exclusion among single mothers and their
children. Corruption, graft, and discrimination experienced at the hands of develop-
ment and relief workers—a cause for concern—are among other factors mentioned.
Motherhood can also increase the risk of victimhood and/or exploitation because
women with children must bring cash or food home on a daily basis and therefore
might be less likely to report assaults or discrimination.

An important and recurring issue among male and female Turkana informants at
Kakuma was the treatment of women in the awi after the death of their spouses. The
majority of informants who reported the death of their fathers or husbands said that
they, along with their children, were excluded from the awi and often given minimal
control over the livestock in the herds. The interviews revealed a systemic gap in the
legal protection given to women in the case of divorce or death of a spouse and the way
68   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     women are actually treated. These issues become more dire in the context of a polyga-
     mous household where arguments between co-wives can cause friction and factional-
     ism within the awi and even within the adakar.

     Ethnographic data confirm that the issue of widowhood mentioned in the worry analy-
     sis is particularly dire for older women because in the event of the death of their spouse,
     they are left without any protection. Many single mothers either seek the protection of
     their husband’s brother and become a concubine or co-wife in the brother’s awi or, in
     the case of divorce or abuse, return to their father’s home, in which case the father’s awi
     might be asked to pay back the marriage dowry. Because life in the rural settlement is
     centered around the awi, and because it is the job of the woman to care for the shoats of
     the awi’s herds, single or abandoned women and their children often resort to moving
     into areas with more job opportunities, such as Kakuma, Lodwar, and Lokichoggio, and
     becoming part of the large low-income labor force. Many male and female informants
     stated that when they moved with their mothers, they also had to participate in those
     labor activities to contribute to the family’s income. However, many of the informants
     working at the camp had spouses who also worked there, and/or were unemployed/
     herdless and perceived working for the refugees as a contribution to or the primary
     source of household income. Interestingly, contributors to household income also
     included children as young as 8–10 years old working in the homes of refugees.

     The lack of legally enforceable protection for Turkana women affects single women
     because they can become targets of older men wanting them to become concubines,
     girlfriends, or co-wives. These arrangements are often financial agreements that involve
     the man providing a minimal allowance for the woman, predicated on the assumption
     that the woman would also work to supplement it. This supplementary income can
     come from a variety of jobs, including collecting and selling firewood and charcoal or
     working as a domestic servant in the homes of refugees or NGO offices. The larger issue
     of systemic violence remains a considerable problem. Violence perpetrated against Tur-
     kana women extends from a number of factors as noted below.

     n	   Structural realms.

          –	 In a patriarchal and patrilineal system, the social value of a woman is lower than
             that of a man beginning at birth;

          –	 Despite the diversification of labor and despite becoming sole or primary income-
             generators for families, the labor of women is undervalued compared with that of
             men;
     6. Gender-Differentiated Norms, Dynamics, and Constraints at Kakuma                     69



     –	 Diversification of subsistence and labor pathways generally exacts costs in terms
        of time, health, and emotional and physical well-being; and

     –	 Interactions with health, relief, and development workers are marked by experi-
        ences of exclusion and marginalization.

n	   Physical realms.

     –	 The combination of poverty and necessity frequently drive women to seek liveli-
        hood opportunities at high personal risk, leaving them vulnerable to exploita-
        tion, robbery, and assault while they collect firewood or charcoal, work in the
        fields, walk near the refugee camp, or withdraw money from banks and other
        institutions;

     –	 The correlation between thwarted masculinity with perceived low status stem-
        ming from unemployment or loss of herds and male drinking or other negative
        coping behaviors is commonly linked with intimate partner and domestic vio-
        lence, usually of women and children; and

     –	 Quarrels between refugees and the Turkana can explode into public, physical, and
        emotional abuse of Turkana women and children, within and outside of the camp.

The complex nature of the changes to the social, economic, and educational/knowledge
systems of the Turkana are compounded by a lack of protection for the legal status of
women in long-term relationships. Many of our informants noted that one strategy
men use to control women’s status and income is the threat of taking another wife.
Living under a consistent threat of men acquiring concubines, girlfriends, or co-wives,
and seeking to maintain their status within the household, many Turkana women say
that this threat serves as a subtle coercion to stay in abusive relationships. They also
reported that upon the death or divorce from a spouse, their dead partner’s relatives can
dispossess them of any assets. Many respondents said that women facing the death of
or abandonment by a spouse find their way to larger labor markets where they can find
low-paying jobs and often develop a suite of diverse livelihood activities to help support
their families, either by supplementing the family income or often by being the family’s
primary provider.

An analysis of the data suggests that the structural dynamics of gender among the
Turkana of Kakuma are highly complex. They are rooted in traditional gender roles
and mores, which are actually relatively recent but which are constantly reinforced,
70   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     sometimes by proposed solutions such as access to education—which requires cash—
     thus reinforcing investments in pastoralism. Investments in education that did not lead
     to employment left large groups of herdless men vulnerable to depression, disaffection,
     and a range of negative coping behaviors, such as substance abuse, and has left women
     vulnerable to gender-based violence and other forms of exploitation and exclusion. In
     the absence of alternative but culturally appropriate status-generating subsistence path-
     ways for men, the adaptive strategy has been to reinvest in familiar knowledge systems
     and production methods that can be controlled through the knowledge. The decline
     of men in this “lost generation” places the burden of provisioning for the family on
     women who continue to diversify their subsistence pathways with hard menial labor in
     exchange for low wages and with no resulting gain in their status. This dynamic process
     can be summarized as follows:

     n	   Women’s lower social status in the awi-adakar system leaves them vulnerable to
          abandonment or displacement.

          –	 They frequently seek out areas such as Kakuma, which have ample low-skill labor
             opportunities.

          –	 They develop multitasking and subsistence diversification activities specifically
             related to refugees, including collecting firewood, making charcoal, building
             fences, cleaning houses, washing dishes and clothes, and fetching food and water.

          –	 They earn K Sh 100–150/day (US$1–1.50) and frequently food as well for their
             activities in the refugee camp, which in turn supports their agricultural labor
             efforts (growing sorghum and vegetables).

     n	   Turkana’s recent history suggests that the correlation of men’s status with herd size
          and the idea that pastoralism is the only significant and legitimate activity for Tur-
          kana men leave them vulnerable to unemployment, exclusion, and substance abuse.

          –	 Men may try to find small jobs, such as in construction or as security guards, but
             with a view toward building their herds.

          –	 Many jobs are hard to get and usually involve some level of graft or connec-
             tions, and hence those without capital or connections may not find any means of
             subsistence.

          –	 According to this study, among many Turkana men, the lack of a herd and/or job
             is linked to depression, substance abuse, and lower health status.
  6. Gender-Differentiated Norms, Dynamics, and Constraints at Kakuma                     71



Although recent efforts in education outreach have transformed the attitudes of many
men that pastoralism is the only legitimate means of gaining status, this study dem-
onstrates that maintaining herds at Kakuma within a household unit or as part of the
awi remains the main pathway to marital alliances (dowry/bridewealth); contingency
investment; and quick access cash for medical, educational, or other socioeconomic
needs. Ironically, this reinforces the Turkana’s insistence on continuing to engage in
pastoralism, which, in turn, reinforces gendered manifestations of structural violence:
Turkana women are able to find opportunities and end up multitasking to feed their
children while, at the same time, Turkana men feel hampered by their need for herds
and might therefore be relegated to menial labor or, in the absence of even that, to
depression and substance abuse.
            Devolution, Oil, and Water:
7           Perspectives and Narratives
            on Underdevelopment,
            Recent Discoveries, and
            Structural Changes

Ethnographic and focus group interviews with members of the Turkana community
in Lodwar, Lokichoggio, Lorengo, and Lorugum suggest that the Turkana are aware
of inequities between themselves and refugees, but that they have generated a social
causation narrative in which the primary cause of underdevelopment is systemic cor-
ruption in the local, regional, and national political economies, where they are sub-
jected to bribery, graft, neglect, indifference, stereotyping, and discrimination. New
development efforts are understood through and subsumed by the narrative that any
potential benefits from recent changes such as devolution and the discovery of vast oil
and water resources are fully dependent on and are necessarily limited by low levels of
transparency and accountability and the differential interest shared by the rest of Kenya
and indeed the world regarding the resources on Turkana lands as opposed to the well-
being of the Turkana people.

Even among relief and development workers at Kakuma and other areas in Turkana, there
is a distinct and well-maintained hierarchy among Kenyan staff (“down-Kenyans”) and
the Turkana, with Turkana staff working in offices and doing the bulk of the menial tasks
occupying different social spaces than non-Turkana Kenyans. While overt discrimina-
tion against the Turkana is less obvious than the systemic and structural discrimination
they face, narratives of the backwardness of the Turkana are common among down-
Kenyans. This larger narrative of intransigence and violence in mainstream Kenyan
society ignores or dismisses various crucial factors underlying the present decline of
the Turkana. As noted earlier, these historical and structural processes have served to
generate a consistent narrative of indignity (ng’imeny), which emerges when outsiders
come to Turkana for business, employment, development, or to take up residence, or
when the Turkana go to other parts of Kenya—as they say, “wakati tumekwenda Kenya”


                                                                                            73

     (when we go to Kenya). In turn, the broader narratives of distrust, anger, and exclusion
     that the Turkana have generated about the political, economic, and social system that
     has marginalized them for over than a century shapes their perceptions and beliefs
     regarding any external development interventions.


     Narratives and Responses to Devolution, Oil, and Water
     There have been three major economic and sociopolitical developments that have
     affected Turkana County since 2009: the discovery of oil (2009–12); the discovery of
     water resources (2013); and the shift toward decentralized devolution across Kenya
     (2010–13), including greater political and economic investments in Turkana (2010–
     present). These developments are described briefly in this section and assessed regard-
     ing Turkana observations, beliefs, and perceptions of the projects’ projected benefits.
     Beginning in 2006, following the discovery of oil in Uganda, Mozambique, and South
     Sudan in the early to mid-2000s, the Kenyan government invested in oil and gas explo-
     ration. In 2012 and 2013, the British firm Tullow Oil announced the discovery of oil
     in the Lokichar areas of South Turkana County (Blocks 10BB and 13T) in sufficient
     quantities to warrant further investigation for commercial extraction. Since then, areas
     11A and 11B and 10A in northern Turkana are being examined because of their geo-
     logical similarity to the oil-bearing rocks of South Turkana County. It is hoped that the
     ongoing extraction efforts will create enough jobs for massive local employment among
     the Turkana at all levels, from management and technical staff to daily wage laborers.
     Job growth and an increase of capital and spending based on the new jobs in Turkana
     are expected to lead to the development of the service and secondary sectors, including
     trade, business, health, education, and other livelihood opportunities.

     In September 2013, in partnership with the Kenyan government and the United
     Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the firm Radar
     Technologies announced the discovery of a vast underground aquifer, now called the
     Lotikipi Basin Aquifer. This is the largest aquifer ever discovered in Kenya, possess-
     ing an estimated 200 billion cubic meters of fresh water and covering an area of 4,164
     square kilometers. According to estimates, if properly managed, the water would pro-
     vide fresh water to the people of Kenya for over 70 years. In an arid region like Turkana,
     this is especially welcome news, and there are currently a number of plans to extract
     the water for human use as well as for irrigation and livestock needs. The broad idea
     is to use the water to introduce extensive and intensive agriculture in Turkana. How-
     ever, an unverified study by UNESCO (see Avery 2014: 4-5) suggests that high salinity
     might make the water unfit for human consumption. The report was widely publicized
     in Turkana, generating public outrage and protests and bolstering ongoing narratives

The Kenya Devolution Act of 2013 marked a formal
change in the political system of Kenya, following
procedures agreed upon in the new Kenyan con-
stitution established in 2010, which pushed for
increased accountability and autonomy with regard
to resource spending and budgetary decisions for
local and regional areas. Policy makers view this as
one of the most significant and positive changes in
the Kenyan governance processes since indepen-
dence because it could give more power and voice
to local opinions, needs, and perspectives, espe-
cially in the northern marginalized counties such
as Turkana, Wajir, and Mandera. In principle, these
projects and developments are aimed at making
significant and positive changes for the people of
Turkana.

Respondents were asked to reflect on the role of
devolution and the discovery and extraction of oil
and water in their lives, at present or in the future. Source: Based on Avery 2014.
As expected from previous studies of marginalized
groups, the majority of interviewed respondents
among the Turkana (n=79) [Kakuma (n=55), Lokichoggio (n=12), Lorugum (n=3),
and Lodwar (n=9)] have views that fall within the aforementioned narrative of distrust
of and suspicion that the government (local and national) and external actors would
downplay any major benefits from the three developments. Some respondents (n=12)
initially suggested that devolution in particular, but also the discovery of oil and water,
might be good for the Turkana in strikingly similar ways to the eagerness with which
some young men in all four areas where interviews were conducted welcomed the news
that a refugee camp would be opening in Kakuma in 1993 (as reported by Ohta 2005):
Kakuma (n=5), Lorugum (n=3), Lokichoggio (n=3), and Lodwar (n=1).

The disparity between Kakuma, Lodwar, and Lokichoggio, where only 10–15 percent of
responses are positive, and Lorugum, where almost 50 percent were, can be explained
by the greater development benefits ushered in by the Kenyan government, which the
people of Lorugum have experienced over the past 20 years. While there is a variation
76   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     in the responses to the potential benefits of devolution and oil and water discover-
     ies, negativity arising from anger and frustration over years of being marginalized by
     the national government and corruption within the local government, are revealed in
     almost every interview conducted in Kakuma, Lokichoggio, Lodwar, and Lorugum.


     Feedback between Emergent and Previous Narratives
     The narratives of distrust about the potential benefits of devolution, oil, and water
     are compounded by narratives that blame not only the government systems but also
     down-Kenyans for taking opportunities and jobs that “should” go to the Turkana and
     for generating the mainstream narratives of Turkana backwardness and intransigence.
     However, some respondents differentiate between the Kenyan government, whom they
     accuse of neglectful policies, and the local government and politicians, whom they
     accuse of more harmful intentions linked to corruption that directly affect the people.
     The down-Kenyans who suggest that there will be more jobs for the people of Turkana
     when the oil and water extraction systems are built also express a note of caution and
     voice a narrative suggesting that the benefits to the Turkana will be limited.

     In many cases, the Turkana note that while employment in oil and water extraction
     is desirable as advertised, it is not easily accessible or beneficial to local residents. The
     few nationals in management are mainly surveyors, advisors, and engineers. “Skilled”
     employees are usually nationals, including welders, plumbers, electricians, crane opera-
     tors, assistant drillers, masons, group financial controllers, ecologists, and sociolo-
     gists—all mainly from other parts of Kenya. Unskilled workers are all nationals and are
     predominantly from the local community. Two years ago, hope and enthusiasm were
     evident at meetings regarding how the oil would be drilled; how it would be shared;
     and what other benefits it would offer to the local population, such as education and
     jobs. But the promised benefits have yet to accrue to the Turkana. While Tullow Oil,
     the agency contracted for oil exploration, is in place, there is real skepticism regarding
     the terms of the contract, including who has and who will benefit from the deals. For
     example, Tullow Oil provided education scholarships to the Turkana people that were
     channeled through political leaders and inequitably distributed.

     A related issue is the problem of education, presented as the primary pathway for success
     and encouraged by political and social leaders as well as development actors. However,
     there are numerous structural problems in the “education as panacea” argument, includ-
     ing the abuse of children; a lack of money for textbooks, uniforms, and examination
     fees; and the tremendous disparity between the number of primary versus secondary

and tertiary educational institutions. These narratives of suspicion and anger against the
political system and the corruption inherent in daily encounters are paralleled by nar-
ratives of frustration over the presence of the refugees, although they are balanced by
frequent acknowledgment of benefits received due to their presence. One man said:

       “In many ways we have literally become the clients and the servants of the
       refugees, and they are the patrons, they are the employers. Without them we,
       the local Turkana, would not be able to survive. Working as domestic ser-
       vants, to fetch water, to help them carry food, to be security and watchmen
       for the NGOs. Can’t we at least once [work] to get a Turkana in a good job?”
       (KII 2015)

Anger aimed at the refugees is mirrored by perceptions that the UNHCR and other
external actors have been ineffective at making any real difference. Many respondents
suggest that the efforts of the UN, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and other
external actors were often stymied by the local leadership and political system.

A final narrative emerging from the oil and water discoveries is that of theft and rob-
bery. Turkana respondents believe that not only would they fail to reap the incidental
benefits of oil and water, they would not even have access to those commodities and
resources. The Turkana coexist in an uneasy system of exchange with the refugees of
Kakuma and with various external development and relief organizations across Tur-
kana County, including the UN. However, these narratives of distrust and suspicion are
paralleled by narratives of the Turkana receiving benefits and help from the presence of
external actors and refugees.


Narrative Summary
The dominant narratives among the Turkana that emerged in areas such as Lokichog-
gio in the northwest, Lorugum in the southwest, Lorengo and Lodwar to the south of
Kakuma, and Kakuma are of distrust and anger at the political, economic, and social
system of exclusion, marginalization, corruption, and discrimination.

n	   The central administration of the Kenyan government is accused of neglect stretch-
     ing over 50 years, including deep memories of policies first initiated by the British.

n	   The larger Kenyan society—the “down-Kenyans”—treat the Turkana with disdain at
     worst and indifference at best, only showing interest in their natural resources.
78   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     n	   General stereotypes about the Turkana combined with nepotism among down-
          Kenyans reserve the good jobs for the non-Turkana, relegating the Turkana to menial
          jobs and casual labor.

     n	   The local political landscape is characterized by gross corruption and nepotism
          while the Turkana kinship exchange system demands that any progress made by an
          individual be shared across the larger extended kin group, including but not limited
          to help with money, food, jobs, and other benefits within the power of the individual
          family member to provide.

     n	   Educated and uneducated people alike fear being excluded directly by the down-
          Kenyans from opportunities arising from development or indirectly due to their lack
          of networks with local elites or capital to pay bribes to prospective hiring personnel.

     n	   These narratives generate a hierarchy of suspicion, distrust, and anger. Local politi-
          cians are held the most responsible for the lack of development and for the poverty;
          they are followed by down-Kenyans for excluding and discriminating against the
          Turkana; the government of Kenya for its indifference and neglect toward them; and
          finally, the UN, development organizations, and the refugees.

     Daily frustrations further reinforce this larger, complex narrative that seeks and finds
     multiple targets for the marginalization and impoverishment of the Turkana commu-
     nity. It is reassuring, however, that the Turkana do not see the refugees as a target but
     rather understand that the refugees are also in marginalized positions.
             Modeling the Pathways
8            of Interactions and
             the Complex Impacts
             of Refugees on Host
             Communities

A qualitative engineering model has been attempted to examine, understand, and
describe how narrative, interaction, and external factors between and within refugee
and host communities affect and shape each other. Specifically, the model showcases the
complex and dynamic pathway of coexistence in which general and specific narratives
held by the Turkana and the refugees shape and are shaped by interactions between
the groups and how the narratives of coexistence interface with external factors, such
as the climate/environment and drought/famine that generate their own narratives of
suffering, resilience, and dignity. Specifically, the analysis shows how the refugee camp
and the presence and activities of the refugees have complex effects on the Turkana host
community. These effects range from negative impacts that generate acts of violence
or indignity to mostly positive impacts, including enhanced social interactions and
networks; better access to markets; and higher indicators of health and physical well-
being compared with other sites in Turkana, particularly Lorengo and Lokichoggio.
The health and physical indicators of the Turkana of Kakuma are similar to those of
Lorugum, an area that exhibits more intense development investment.

Development investment levels in Kakuma are not as high as in Lorugum. Develop-
ment gaps in Kakuma—also seen in Lorengo and Lokichoggio—are filled:

n	   Partially by the presence of relief and development agencies in Kakuma, including
     access to health care; and

n	   Mainly by the presence of refugees resulting in enhanced access to food, cash, and

                                              Social and economic interactions are not distinct categories: economic transactions are
                                              embedded within social interactions, and the resulting experiences further shape the
                                              other, positively and negatively. Refugees and the Turkana of Kakuma generate narra-
                                              tives about one other as the violent “other”; as difficult, greedy, and irrational people
                                              with unreasonable demands for goods and resources to which they are not entitled;
                                              and as abusers of women and children. Both groups also generate counternarratives in
                                              which they see the other as good people, fellow sufferers, friends, and neighbors, and
                                              in which they seek to understand context, contingency, justice, and fairness. Actual
                                              interactions shape the perceptions of members of the host community living in and
                                              near Kakuma toward refugees in ways that are radically and significantly different than
                                              members living elsewhere. The emergent experiences of the interactions between indi-
                                              viduals then reinforce, modify, and/or reshape the subnarratives and subsequently, the
                                              metanarrative of the refugee as violent “other” or foreign usurper.

                       The metanarrative of the refugee as violent “other” or foreign usurper exists throughout
                       Turkana County, and although the respondents from all four sites in this study share
                       this dominant metanarrative, the Turkana of Kakuma and Lorengo (25 kilometers from
                       Kakuma) who actually interact with the refugees on a daily basis share positive per-
                       ceptions of the refugees—refugees are good and refugees bring benefits—and were far
                       more specific in explaining their narratives. Respondents from Lorugum and Lodwar
                       described the dominant metanarrative without nuance, with generic statements such
                       as “refugees kill the Turkana” and “refugees steal from the Turkana.” The Turkana of
                       Lokichoggio have experienced a decline in their living standards and their well-being
                       over the last 8–9 years since the UNHCR Sudan Relief operations moved its operations

are good” and subnarrative 3—“refugees are beneficial” among respondents is inversely
proportional to the distance of their homes to Kakuma Refugee Camp. This includes
ethnographic data from Lodwar, where two out of 10 informants reported positive per-
ceptions of refugees. The data here seems to suggest that the frequency of interactions
between host and refugee, which is directly correlated with distance from the camp, is
also correlated with the complexity of perceptions held by the host community. In other
words, the likelihood that a member of the host community has negative perceptions
of refugees does not significantly vary with distance, but the likelihood that a member
of the host community would have positive perceptions of refugees is negatively cor-
related with distance from the camp.

The findings demonstrate that it is feasible to transform the refugee camp into a sustain-
able settlement, as proposed by UNHCR, provided that the host community has a voice
in the planning and decision making and are themselves integrated into the new settle-
ment—refugees and the Turkana would live as neighbors. There are already Turkana
settlements at the outskirts of a number of blocks in the camp, and an entire Turkana
village lives alongside refugees in Kakuma 2 in a similar manner but for their status. The
first step toward establishing such a transformation is to understand the ways that the
various narratives, interactions, and external factors shape each other. The next section
presents a qualitative engineering model that highlights these interfaced relationships
and provides entry points for interventions.


Narrative-Interaction Model for Refugee–Host Relationship
As seen in the model in figure 8.2, narratives about refugees are driven by interactions
and the experiences emerging from them. Interactions are then shaped by internal-
ized narratives, which are modified by individuals as a part of their enculturation and
upbringing.

As anthropologist Itaru Ohta points out, the narrative of the refugee as violent “other”
was being generated even before the camp was built in 1992. As one older man expressed
it: “In Sudan, people are killing each other. We will not agree to letting dangerous strang-
ers come and settle nearby” (Ohta 2005: 229). However, Ohta also reported counternar-
ratives of “refugees as beneficial,” especially among young men who

     “… brought other news […] from Kakuma. They said that many people would
     be employed in the construction work for the refugee camp. One of them,
     who had been employed on road construction work before told me excitedly,
     ‘We can get a big job. We will be paid 50 Shillings a day.’” (Ohta 2005: 229).

     The metanarrative of refugee as violent “other” or foreign usurper and the counternar-
     ratives of refugee as good and beneficial have been interacting with each other for the
     past 24 years. The interface between narrative and interaction is clearly an extremely
     complex process with both affecting the other in a cyclical feedback pathway, as shown
     figure 8.2.


     Bringing It Together
     As previously mentioned, in addition to the somewhat contemporary metanarrative 1
     emerging out of Turkana County that refugees are violent “others” or foreign usurp-
     ers, there is an older, broader, and more dominant metanarrative 2: “naenda Kenya,”
     which speaks to a sense of general neglect, political corruption, and social discrimina-
     tion, which began during the British colonial period and persists to this day under the
     Kenyan government and among mainstream Kenyan society.

Finding 1: History, Experience, Narratives,
and Interactions Shape One Other
While “naenda Kenya” dominates conversations and generates anger, conflict, and
even violence among the Turkana, it is important to remember that similar metanar-
ratives exist in most of the northern counties in Kenya, including Wajir, Marsabit, and
Mandera. The metanarrative of rampant corruption and marginalization across social,
economic, and political forums at local, regional, and national levels is not unique, as
similar narratives exist in almost every nation and society in the world. However, this
particular metanarrative feeds into fears and concerns among the Turkana that their
leaders and down-Kenyans—political and economic elites and mainstream society—
would prevent them from benefiting from any developmental interventions and struc-
tural changes, such as the extraction of oil and gas in Lokichar, the discovery of water
in Lotikipi, or the devolution process. The interactions between the Turkana and their
political system, economic infrastructure, social landscape, and external development
and relief actors serves to further reinforce and reproduce this narrative and generate
an individual and communal sense of indignity (ng’imeny) in which the Turkana view
themselves as stuck at the bottom of the Kenyan hierarchy, deliberately excluded from
social mobility and well-being.

There are, however, other narratives emerging from external factors, such as the cli-
mate, the environment, and relief and development efforts, in which the Turkana view
themselves as people who endure, as people with a proud history and a glorious past,
and as people who know how to survive and outlast some of the worst adversities that
their environment and the climate have leveled at them, including receding water levels
in Lake Turkana; periodic and frequent droughts, especially in the last 50 years; and
famines emerging from many of these drought events. The indignities they suffer dur-
ing their interactions with external actors and refugees, including verbal insults, physi-
cal beatings, and indifferent treatment, can occasionally explode into violence between
individuals, groups, or communities. These incidents usually become internalized and
feed back into the subnarratives and metanarratives.


Finding 2: Complex Interactions 	
This study demonstrates that indignities are often mitigated by experiences with dig-
nity, such as friendship, support, bond-friendships, and generosity shown by refugees
and external actors, becoming pathways for the Turkana to maintain their resilience
and hope. Women are exposed to physical and sexual violence in their economic
84   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     interactions, but they deal with such dangers with incredible courage, overcoming their
     own fears and bearing great pain as they keep in mind their larger goal of feeding their
     children, sending them to school, and working toward a better future for them. Policy
     recommendations emerging from this study that draw on the resilience, dignity, and
     hope demonstrated by the Turkana and the refugee communities focus on positively
     changing the nature of interactions and narratives.


     Finding 3: Refugees Have A Net Positive Impact on
     Turkana Hosts at Kakuma
     Returning to the original expectations of this study, results show that while the impacts
     of the presence of a large number of refugees on the Turkana of Kakuma are both posi-
     tive and negative, the final analysis demonstrates a net positive impact in terms of food
     and nutritional intake and quality of interactions. The expected variation is found in
     the well-being of the host communities of Kakuma and the other study sites—Loru-
     gum, Lorengo, Lokichoggio, and Lodwar—with overlap between Kakuma, Lodwar, and
     Lorugum. The study also finds that Lorengo and Lokichoggio have the worst outcomes
     for social, physical, and mental well-being, potentially due to the absence or removal of

development and relief organizations, respectively. The well-being of the host commu-
nities in Kakuma follow different pathways than do the host communities at the other
study sites due to the impact of both the refugee presence and the daily interactions
between the refugees, hosts, and relief and development organizations. The presence of
the relief and development infrastructure and refugees is correlated with greater access
to jobs, wage labor, and other opportunities for the Turkana of Kakuma, but also with a
greater potential for conflict and distrust between the refugees and their hosts.


Finding 4: Variations Underlying Positive and Negative Impacts
The study notes that despite the greater access to jobs, wages, and development oppor-
tunities in Kakuma, there is wide variation in the well-being of Turkana living in
Kakuma. This variation was similar to but also greater than that measured in Lorugum
and observed ethnographically in Lodwar. It included worries about education, fees,
and other services that were not mentioned in Lorengo and Lokichoggio, also sug-
gesting that the presence of the refugees and development could be contributing to
underlying inequities between and within settlements. This is especially true among
the men of Kakuma, who do not fare significantly better in their measures of health
than do the men at other sites when controlling for other factors, such as worries.
Kakuma men also report more negative interactions with refugees than women do.
The ethnographic and survey analyses suggest that the level of development invest-
ment is a significant factor in understanding the differential trajectories of well-being
across Turkana County where it is directly correlated with social, economic, psycho-
social, and physical well-being.	


Finding 5:
Turkana Attitudes, Evaluations, and Hopes
A critical concern regarding projected development activities is a confirmation of the
study expectations about the perceptions of the Turkana regarding their local and
national government and regarding ongoing development initiatives. The vast major-
ity of the people interviewed expressed widespread distrust in the ability of their gov-
ernment and associated bodies and organizations to deliver the promised benefits of
devolution or the oil and water discoveries in Turkana. The study suggests that there
is a general disenfranchisement of youth and women in Turkana and a significant gap
between political and social elites and other Turkana residents. Structural and physical
violence were disproportionately manifested along the categories of gender and age,
whereby women are most negatively affected by systemic exclusion from participation
in the social, economic, and political spheres.
86   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     One of the goals of this study is to develop policy and operational recommendations
     for changes in structure and action that would benefit both the host and the refugee
     communities. Respondents suggest a pathway that would help alter the narratives and
     the interactions. The study reveals how narratives and interactions generate and repro-
     duce experiences and feelings of indignity (ng’imeny/matharau) or dignity (arimatoi/
     heshima) among the Turkana residents of Kakuma, and, going forward, another pair
     of useful words for shaping narratives and interactions is etic/aking’arakin. Both words
     are used by the Turkana to describe work or labor, but etic is used to indicate “working
     for non-Turkana” and aking’arakin is used to indicate “assisting fellow Turkana.” Many
     respondents explained the difference between the terms, including the implicit hierar-
     chy in the term etic, even in partnership relationships, and the implicit parity conjured
     by the term aking’arakin, even when applied to master and servant relationships. The
     narrative must be altered by changes in attitude from ng’imeny to arimatoi and by trans-
     forming the nature of interactions from etic to aking’arakin.
9           Conclusion


The findings of the study suggest that the narrative of refugee as violent “other” or
foreign usurper is nuanced. The Turkana of Kakuma and, to some extent, Lorengo,
give specific descriptions of positive perceptions, while those in other areas, such as
Lorugum, Lodwar, and Lokichoggio, remain largely negative and general. The findings
also demonstrate that the refugees of Kakuma have a significant positive impact on
the Turkana of Kakuma due to economic and social interactions that result in greater
access to food and nutritional well-being and the presence of relief services that serve
the Turkana in addition to the refugees. The counterfactual sites, such as Lorengo and
Lokichoggio, present significantly lower indicators of health and physical well-being.
The similarities between Kakuma and Lorugum regarding their health data and between
Kakuma and Lodwar regarding their ethnographic data suggest that while development
services might explain the higher indicators of physical and social well-being in Lodwar
and Lorugum, in Kakuma, they can be directly attributed to the presence and activi-
ties of the refugees, either indirectly through the UNHCR and other bodies or directly
through interactions with the refugees.

The Turkana believe that they have been neglected and discriminated against for the
52 years since Kenya gained its independence, and they have struggled with natural
and anthropogenic disasters and endemic structural violence stemming from their low
position in the Kenyan social, economic, and political hierarchy. Their sense of history
has led to a developed narrative in which they do not believe that their own leaders or
their fellow citizens in Kenya will help them or let them benefit from any development
effort. Even their attempts to enroll their children in educational programs is met with
a constant need of cash for uniforms, fees, books, transportation, food, and lodging,
required for both private and public schools. Ironically, this has led to reinvestment in
pastoralism out of necessity because livestock remain the primary source of immediate
cash for most people in Turkana County and the only means of livelihood for those who
are unable to attend school.

88   Refugee Impacts on Turkana Hosts: A Social Impact Analysis



     Yet, despite their sense of despair regarding the structure of society and the adversities
     of life, without exception, the men and women of Turkana who were interviewed for
     this study had hope for their children’s futures. They have not given up on going into
     the camp or into the bush, walking in known dangerous zones, seeking food and work,
     or braving indifference in order to provide food for their families and cash for their
     pockets. They deal with spouses and family members who suffer from illness, disability,
     and substance abuse, and many battle these conditions themselves.

     Many political leaders among the Turkana have been born into and have worked to
     conquer similar adversities. The people of Turkana who participated in this study want
     partnerships with their political leaders and want to engage in a socioeconomic and
     political contract. The recent processes of devolution and the discovery of oil, gas, and
     water offer the leadership and the community an excellent opportunity to embark on
     a renewed partnership based on transparency and equity, which could benefit the Tur-
     kana and decisively change the metanarrative of “naenda Kenya,” which sums up the
     systemic neglect and marginalization of the Turkana for more than 50 years. Such a
     partnership would enable the people of Turkana to continue to strive and work in the
     face of any adversity in order to participate in the general development of Turkana
     County and their own settlements and cities.

     The people of Turkana have been exemplary hosts to the refugees of Kakuma and when
     they live in close proximity have shown them the graciousness to develop nuanced nar-
     ratives about their goodness and the benefits brought by their presence. In return for
     this generosity, the Turkana want to engage the refugees and the larger relief process
     in a partnership to develop Kakuma as a sustainable and thriving settlement, to col-
     lectively move from etic to aking’arakin and to transition from ng’imeny/matharau to
     arimatoi/heshima.

     As the national and county governments make efforts to promote more integrated and
     sustainable development for the Turkana in partnership with the range of develop-
     ment and humanitarians agencies supporting the Kakuma refugee camp, the Kalobeyei
     settlement and the Turkana host community, it is critical to embed a set of key policy
     options emerging from this study in the planning, investment prioritization, and imple-
     mentation processes.

     Acknowledging the value and critical role of community land in the Turkana’s social,
     cultural, and economic realms, UNHCR and the Turkana County government engaged
     the Kalobeyei host community in earmarking and allocating land for the Kalobeyei
     settlement. Inclusive and participatory dialogue and consultations were organized with
the Kalobeyei community and the Community Dialogue and Development Committee
(CDDC), which represents them, along with the Turkana West opinion leaders, politi-
cal leaders, county government executive members, Department of Refugee Affairs,
and UNHCR.

Mechanisms for the transparent, meaningful, and active participation of communities
in the planning, prioritization, and allocation of resources is critical to ensure that the
Turkana feel included, empowered, and capable of making key decisions regarding
their lives, livelihoods, and resources. Communities have expressed a strong prefer-
ence for direct communication with the county administration and for other agencies,
including the UN and other international bodies providing developmental support. The
community understands the ambitious devolution process to be a well-intentioned and
promising institutional change. However, failure to strengthen the presence of the state
in Turkana County in a transparent and accountable manner could potentially exacer-
bate the existing marginalization, ethnic divisions, local grievances, and conflicts.

The increasing emphasis on education among the Turkana is an important opportunity
for increased investments by the government on quality education, motivating teachers,
and pedagogical skills to address the specific learning needs of the Turkana, along with
specific efforts at making education accessible and affordable—both key constraints
emphasized by the community. Culturally and socially appropriate options must be
explored, considering the predominantly pastoral and dispersed population. The lack
of skills and education among Turkana youth could be overcome through on-the-job
training schemes focused on the specific skills needed for the new jobs. Tailored pro-
grams for enhancing technical along with life skills as well as basic and financial literacy
would better equip them to seek employment in emergent areas.

The Turkana tend to invest in both the pastoralist economy and in more urban liveli-
hoods, each supporting their family in times of crisis, drought, or distress; the ability to
access either set of livelihoods serves as an insurance and coping strategy. However, the
Turkana’s traditional pastoralist lifestyle is increasingly threatened by various dynam-
ics, such as the degradation of grazing land, insecurity, and an increase in population.
The national and local government must ensure adequate support for pastoralism—a
key survival strategy for the Turkana.

Engagement with the economy among women, including those in the refugee camp,
has become increasingly critical to household incomes. This participation in income-
generating activities creates a space for a woman’s empowerment and agency. However,
women participating in income-generating activities within and outside the refugee
                                                                                               89
     communities in Kakuma are regularly exposed to physical and sexual violence as well as
     emotional and psychological abuse. Safe and remunerative livelihoods for women with
     improved access to input and output markets for agricultural and allied activities as well
     as the establishment of viable enterprises to augment family incomes, including capital
     and entrepreneurial training and inputs, must be supported.

     Opportunities for building on dimensions of local resilience include establishing the
     presence of the state; consolidating local institutions, such as traditional mediation
     mechanisms that maximize the role of local leaders among elders, youth, and women;
     and improving social, economic, and poverty outcomes for the Turkana. An integrated
     and sustainable development approach is crucial to ensuring steady economic growth,
     social inclusion, and peace and stability in Turkana.

E           The Future of Kakuma’s Youth—
            Opportunities and Challenges



Context, Rationale, and Methodology
Turkana West is characterized by a variety of internal and external pressures, including
insecurity, climate change, environmental degradation, and prior marginalization by
the state. These stressors have intensified in recent years, challenging the resilience of
people, land, and resources in such a way that have turned previously effective coping
mechanisms into more permanent adaptations (Huisman 2011). These varying means
of survival have had significant implications on how people see themselves, the roles
they play in society, and how they relate to others within and outside their communities.

Elders, the custodians of the traditional system and culture, have been unable to com-
prehensively respond to the evolving pressures. They and the customary laws they rep-
resent have conceded much of their authority to state institutions, such as the police
and formal courts (Carlson et al. 2012), severely undermining their power and continu-
ing to weaken their influence.

The distinct roles of men as pastoralists and women as agriculturalists and foragers,
divided into public and domestic realms, follow dichotomies that are almost universally
observed. In the past, women’s activities were exalted in myth and function. They were
acknowledged for their provisioning of food through their expertise in gathering and
processing wild plants and micro- and macrofauna and in growing crops such as sor-
ghum. However, from the 1900s to the 1980s, changes introduced during the British and
Kenyan administrations resulted in significant systemic changes to the social organiza-
tion. Women’s labor shifted from playing a central role in the subsistence economy and
in myths to being relegated to a secondary role within the emergent awi-adakar system.
Ironically, while women continued to maintain their agricultural and foraging practices
and to teach younger generations the skills needed for food extraction, processing, and
storage as well as how to take care of young animals, their role and status within the
larger society diminished. Pastoralism expanded in its central significance beyond sta-
tus and prestige, becoming the primary subsistence practice among the Turkana.

                                                                                             115

      The centrality of cattle to the status and livelihood of the Turkana people, their custom-
      ary institutions, and maintaining social cohesion poses serious challenges. A shortage of
      livestock undermines the give-and-take social compact that informs traditional cultures
      (Carlson et al. 2012). This has implications for youth when, for example, they want to
      marry. Most young men wait a long time before getting married because they are unable
      to provide bridewealth. In addition, a scarcity of cattle means the loss of a livelihood
      and an absence of economic security to provide for themselves and their families. Many
      youth, while acknowledging the importance of pastoralism as a way of life, admit that
      it is not viable. Education, which has been reinforced by the development narrative as
      the primary solution to this declining pastoral livelihood, is seen as the only alternative.

      However, according to the ethnographic findings, one unintended consequence of suc-
      cessful education outreach efforts in a context that involves structural issues regarding
      access was the creation of a “lost generation”—a large population of men across Kenya,
      especially Turkana County, who received a substandard education in a rural or low-
      income urban area. The drive was high to keep young children in school, but this transi-
      tion came at the expense of their learning traditional subsistence skills, such as farming
      and pastoralism. When their education failed to translate into jobs and livelihoods in
      urban or professional environments, these young men were left without the skills to
      generate a livelihood in their traditional environments either. Because of this, young
      men in Turkana compliment traditional pastoralist activities with other socioeconomic
      activities, such as casual labor, petty trade, road construction, and riding boda-bodas
      (commuter motorcycles), as examples. Unemployment pushes many male youth into
      idleness, smoking, drinking, stealing, or engaging in armed raids as a way to deal with
      rising poverty and hunger. This situation presents a challenge to customary institutions
      and to the social stability that these institutions are meant to protect (Carlson et al. 2012).

      Particularly among women and youth, coping strategies to migrate and pursue new
      livelihoods have resulted in an influx of new ideas and practices that challenge formerly
      established traditions. This may signal a more permanent shift away from the tradi-
      tional—something that has profound implications on the viability of the traditional way
      of life over the long term.

      The objective of this background paper is to assess the extent to which the peculiar
      situation of the Kakuma Refugee Camp and Turkana West, as well as the interaction
      between the two, offer opportunities or pose challenges to realizing young people’s aspi-
      rations of practicing or leaving traditional livelihoods.

ethnographic data collected for the social impact analysis and from other sources, such
as Kenya’s 2009 census. This myriad of information sources provides a broad cross-
section of perspectives, observations, and analyses. While most literature focuses on the
Turkana, a number of key documents discuss how similar dynamics affect other pas-
toral communities, such as the Karamoja and the Maasai. The insights remain relevant
because these populations share similar lifestyles, histories, cultures, environments, and
methods of production.


What is Youthhood?
When discussing youth in Turkana West, it is vital to first begin by defining what
“youthhood” means to the Turkana, mainly because the concept has a cultural under-
pinning that differs from other cultural practices and from the modern definitions of
“youth” as stated in official documents, such as the Kenyan constitution, which defines
it as all individuals of ages 18–35. The United Nations (UN) defines youth as persons
of ages 15–24.

Age-group systems are vital among the Nilo-Hamitic peoples. “Turkana boys are initi-
ated into full formal adulthood at an average age of 18. The age limits however vary
in practice between 14 and 20” (Gulliver n.d. 900). Unlike other Kenyan cultures, the
initiation ceremony does not include circumcision. Instead, this right of passage is sig-
nified by a boy spearing a castrated male animal—ox, camel, goat, or sheep—given to
him by his father at a communal ceremony. Afterward, the carcass is opened, and the
boys’ head and body is smeared with the undigested contents of the stomach by the
most senior elders of the area. The most senior men in the age-group play a critical role
in receiving the initiates into the system and passing on to them the attributes of strong
manhood and the idealized qualities of age-group membership (Gulliver n.d.).

Once initiated, a young man is able to wear a man’s mudded headdress and has the
right to hold a proper spear instead of the wooden sticks used by boys. A youth is
assigned to an age-group and thereafter participates in specific age-group activities,
such as feasting, dancing, and war-making. He is consistently guided by his affiliation to
that age group, which fosters general feelings of association and attitudes of assistance
and mutual support. The young man is allowed to marry, but in practice may not be
able to for several years depending on his position in the nuclear family and whether or
not the size of his family’s herds allow him to pay a bride-price. The average age for first
marriage4 among Turkana men is currently 31.8 years (Ohta 2007).

                                    2007). The daily temperatures range from 24oC to 38oC (GOK 1997) and, therefore,
                                    potential evapotranspiration rates in excess of 2,500 mm/year are typical (Ekaya 1998).
                                    The main economic activity in the region is nomadic pastoralism.

                             Increasing Environmental Vulnerability
                             Climate data confirms that Turkana West experienced a mean rainfall decrease of 13 mm
                             between 1973 and 2008 (Ogindo et al. 2009). The frequency and severity of droughts
                             have increased in recent decades, with episodes of moderate to severe drought occur-
                             ring more frequently (every 2–5 years as shown in table E.1) since the 1980s. Lodwar
                             experienced its most severe drought between 1980 and 1984. The 1990–95 Lokwakoyo/
                             Akalkal drought was equally severe (see table E.1), causing the loss of more that half of
                             the livestock (ILRI and VSF-B n.d.).

                             The setting up in 1992 of Kakuma refugee camp in Turkana West coincided with the
                             Lokwakoyo/Akalkal drought, and studies show that the camp has had a negative impact

which increased with distance from it. Trees near
the camp that had been an important source of
forage for livestock were cut down for burning charcoal and construction. The chop-
ping down of important trees such as Acacia tortilis denies pastoralists the tree pods
that serve as feed during the dry season, and the resultant bare soils are vulnerable to
wind and water erosion. Table E.2 also shows an increase in shrub cover as distance
from the camp increases. The need for fencing and building materials exerted the most
pressure on these shrubs.

The availability of forage lands in the area was also affected by changes in rainfall and
an increase in the population. The keeping of livestock around Kakuma throughout the
year meant that a range of resources was overutilized, exposing this fragile ecosystem
to erosion. Among the people interviewed, 65 percent kept their animals near the camp
throughout the year instead of moving them to other areas in search of forage, as is the
nomadic practice. The number of animals surpassed the availability of fodder, causing
further deterioration of the land.

Loss of Livestock
Livestock plays a central role in Turkana, not only as a symbol of status and prestige, but
also as the lifeline and identity of a Turkana man. One refugee man from the Oromo
community explained:

     “When you see a Turkana man like that, sitting there, not doing anything, on
     his stool, holding his stick, you think, why doesn’t he work? But you know
     from looking at him that he has lost his herd. … That man, there, he is broken.
     He is broken, because when he lost his herd, his animals, he lost himself.
     He may start drinking, start abusing drugs, get into fights, but the biggest
     problem is that he lost his herd, and he lost his pride, his status” (KII 2010).

Second, the value of livestock goes beyond the production of meat to the supply of milk
and blood for consumption. The exchange or sacrifice of animals underpins every cere-
mony and ritual and, as such, the customary judicial systems. Under customary author-
ity, animals are meant to be paid as compensation for wrongs committed, sacrificed as

                               a means of making amends, and exchanged in bonds of social reciprocity that secure
                               relationships, heal old wounds, and establish a guarantee of assistance during difficult
                               times in the future (Carlson et al. 2012). The loss of animals over time has rendered the
                               pastoral livelihood of the Turkana and many aspects of their customary law ineffective.

                               While livestock numbers in pastoralist areas are difficult to measure, table E.3 illustrates
                               the yearly change in Turkana County.

                               The data challenge the common assertions that pastoral livestock populations are either
                               exploding or imploding. There is evidence that livestock per capita increased in the late
                               1980s but crashed in the following years and that the average livestock per capita was
                               far below the recommended values for subsistence requirements (4.0–7.1 livestock per
                               capita) (Ebei et al. 2007).

                               Livestock numbers fluctuate considerably due to uncertain environments. Increases and
                               decreases of around 50 percent or more over a year or so are not uncommon—pastoral
                               livestock are highly prolific in the immediate aftermath of climatic shocks (Davis 2007).

Using average mortality rates of 50 percent for cattle, 30 percent for sheep, 24 percent
for goats, and 17 percent for camels, the estimated recovery periods are 10, 2, 1.5, and 4
years, respectively (ILRI and VSF-B n.d.). Such long recovery periods leave pastoralists
vulnerable because herd growth can be disrupted by subsequent droughts before the
recovery is complete (ILRI and VSF-B n.d.). Severity of droughts and their impact on
livestock production also translate into reduced purchasing power for pastoral house-
holds. Because of this, poverty levels in Turkana rose from an estimated 61 percent in
1999 (CBS and ILRI 1999) to 88 percent in the 2009 census (KNBS and SID 2013).

The ethnographic data collected suggest that the growing cultural investment in pas-
toralism as the primary activity among men, combined with declining herd sizes well
beneath the asset threshold necessary for resilience or to buffer against shocks, may
explain the sense of general despair experienced by many Turkana men who find
themselves without a purpose or status in their society. While the exclusion of many
men from generating sizeable herds and gaining status could open up other opportuni-
ties, the cultural insistence on pastoralism renders alternatives as lacking in honor or
respect. One man explains the problem of Turkana men who no longer have status
through successful herding:

     “Without animals, a man cannot be a Turkana man. It is not easy to build a
     herd from nothing. If you have sisters, you can get animals through dowry.
     But then you have to get enough animals for your own dowry…. Even the
     ones who have jobs, they buy animals so that when they retire, when they’re
     old, they can be pastoralists.” (KII 2011)

Increased Migration and Population
The setting up of Kakuma camp coincided with the Lokwakoyo/Akalkal drought. Many
people within and outside Turkana initially moved to the vicinity of the camp in search
of forage and water for their animals in addition to relief food for themselves, which was
available at the Kakuma Refugee Camp.

In 1989, before the creation of the camp, Kakuma was a small town of slightly more
than 2,000 people. Its population grew to more than 9,000 by 1999 (Ohta 2005). By
2009, the population in Kakuma ward was 33,539 people (KNBS and SID 2013) exclud-
ing the refugee community. A study conducted in 2004 found that 50 percent of the
locals living in Kakuma were born there and another 50 percent were from the sur-
rounding regions. The study also found that about 65 percent of the people who settled
in Kakuma came during 1990/95 drought (Okoti et al. 2004).

      Embracing Alternative Livelihoods
      According to oral histories, archaeological evidence, and the ethnographic data of this
      study, the pre-1900 social organization of the Turkana was closely aligned with the
      diversity of the subsistence pathways among the people. Activities of men as pastoral-
      ists and women as agriculturalists and foragers were divided into public and domestic
      realms following almost universally observed dichotomies. However, women’s activities
      were exalted in both myth and function as they were acknowledged for their provision-
      ing of food and for food security through their expertise in gathering and processing
      wild plants, micro- and macrofauna, and in growing crops such as sorghum.

      The changes introduced during both the British and the Kenyan administrations, from
      the 1900s to the 1980s resulted in significant systemic changes to this social organiza-
      tion wherein women’s labor shifted from playing a central role in both the subsistence
      economy and mythos to being relegated to a secondary role within the emergent awi-
      adakar system. Ironically, in this development, while women continued to maintain
      their agricultural and foraging practices and to teach younger generations skills of food
      extraction, processing, and storage, and also to take care of the young animals, their
      role and status within the larger society diminished. Pastoralism expanded in its central
      significance beyond that of status and prestige, becoming the primary subsistence prac-
      tice associated with the Turkana. This change was paralleled by forced settlement of the
      Turkana from 1930 to 1980 into small settlements, which became the boundaries of the
      domestic realm for women.

      Interestingly, the ethnographic data of this study shows contemporary Turkana women’s
      adaptability in diversifying their subsistence pathways and mirrors the actions of their
      ancestors in their continuing interest in farming and foraging, especially among the
      rural awis. The data also shows that Turkana women are the primary source for their
      household’s income and food security.

      At the onset of the camp, most locals did not have any other source of subsistence
      except their livestock, which accounted for 90 percent of employment and more than
      95 percent of family incomes and livelihoods. Because of the severe drought, families
      started looking for alternative sources of income.

      The women in the study reported a diverse range of livelihoods, including agricul-
      ture; foraging for wild plants such as edapal, elamach, edu, and acacia; making and
      selling charcoal; collecting and selling firewood; gathering thornbush and poles for

fence-making and construction; making fences and walls in the camp; working in the
homes of refugees; performing menial cleaning jobs in the development/relief workers’
compounds; and even engaging in commercial sex work. Many women have used the
shops in the camp to buy goods to sell at retail prices in the settlements outside the
camp where they live and have also built small businesses selling tobacco, relief food,
milk, and other consumables to refugees and the Turkana alike. These opportunities
have prompted host communities to remain around the camp.

From Prominence to Decline: The Role of the Elders
The possession of livestock plays multiple social, economic, and religious roles in pas-
toral livelihoods, such as providing a regular source of food in the form of milk, meat,
and blood for household members; as well as cash income to pay for cereals, education,
health care, and other services. In pastoral communities, livestock is also essential as
payment of a bride-price; compensation of injured parties during raids; a symbol of
prosperity and prestige; and a store of wealth and security against drought, disease, and
other calamities. Livestock is therefore a fundamental form of pastoral capital in addi-
tion to functioning as a means of production, storage, transport, and transfer of food
and wealth (Behnke 2008).

The decline of livestock as a result of drought and disease profoundly affected the gov-
ernance of elders, resulting in their having much less influence over or relevance to
people’s daily lives. This trend has impacted the functionality of customary practices
and removed the basic means for ceremony and ritual, as well as the basis for recon-
ciliation, compensation, external negotiation, and redress (Carlson et al. 2012). In the
absence of compensation in the form of a fine paid by the perpetrator, judicial rulings
lost their weight. Amends without a shared feast following an animal sacrifice lacked
the weight to mend rifts created by wrongdoings. Offerings of respect made by youth
to elders in the form of animals, which meant that elders had influence over the actions
of the youth, became less frequent. Therefore, the elders’ ability to shape, mitigate, or
manage the acts of young men began to shrink.

The transition into other modes of livelihood, such as casual labor and petty trade occa-
sioned by a significant loss of pastoral livelihood and the opportunities provided by the
refugee camp’s presence also proved extremely challenging to elders, mainly because
they did not historically exercise any ritualized authority over these new forms of liveli-
hoods (Carlson et al. 2012).

      Declining Social Network
      Pastoralist communities tend to have very high social capital6 because association is
      considered to be at the core of all livelihood strategies—even more than livestock. The
      society is therefore organized in a way that provides structural links (through gener-
      ation-sets and age-sets) and dynamic links (through kinships and friendships), cre-
      ating economic interdependencies and safety nets. These links are cemented through
      the horizontal exchange of livestock. Limited numbers of livestock therefore mean that
      people are less able to establish and maintain a larger social network of alliances and
      friendships that allow for the mitigation of vulnerability. The system is further inhibited
      by increased insecurity and sporadic theft of livestock (Carlson et al. 2012).

      From Cultural Raiding to Its Commercialization
      The creation of the refugee camp brought with it a high demand for meat among the ref-
      ugees, necessitating more frequent supplies of meat. Internal theft of livestock escalated
      to satisfy the demand. Cattle raiding—previously done for reasons such as articulation
      of hostility toward enemy communities, restocking of best livestock to replace animals
      lost during periods of drought or disease, expansion of grazing lands, gaining access to
      water and pasture resources, and increasing social status (Eaton 2008)—became more
      frequent to meet the increasing demand for meat.

      With the change in its purpose from cultural to market reasons, raiding moved from
      mass invasions comprising more than 100 raiders communally organized by elders (an
      adakar) to raids by smaller groups of people—mainly male youth under 30 years old
      (Schilling et al. 2012). A study conducted by TUPADO suggests that improved commu-
      nication enabled smaller groups of raiders to easily organize discreet raids, and therefore
      between 2006–09, the number of raiders decreased from 48 to 28 per attack (TUPADO
      2011). Raiders targeted large unprotected herds, especially those in the care of young
      boys. The raids, formerly fought with spears, bows, and arrows, were now fought with
      AK-47s acquired from neighboring countries experiencing civil wars, increasing the
      level of violence and fatal outcomes resulting from the raids (Krätli and Swift 2003).

      The increased integration of the pastoralist economy with the wider market economy
      therefore incentivized more violent, frequent, and well-organized raids. Raiding was
      undertaken with the explicit intention of selling livestock for immediate profit instead of
      restocking one’s own herds, as had previously been the case (Mkutu 2010). An increasing

urban population and improved infrastructural connectivity between arid areas such as
Turkana and the rest of the country further intensified the raids, evidenced by the fact
that Kenya’s drylands have over 50 percent of the country’s livestock population and
produce over 67 percent of the red meat consumed in the country (Davies 2007).


Drivers of Change and Their Resultant Effects
Changes witnessed in Turkana, and more specifically in Turkana West, are attributed to
the following key drivers.

Education
Education has been reinforced by the development narrative as the primary solution
to a decline in pastoral livelihoods. There is a saying that “education does not know
drought” (Carlson et al. 2012). The Turkana also recognize that education empowers
communities, links people to the broader world, and develops the human capital neces-
sary for sustainable development. Education is therefore pursued as an escape route
from pastoralism. It is perceived as a safety net or a way of accessing resources outside
the pastoral circuit. Education is also viewed as a way to decrease vulnerability and
supplement the family’s eroding source of livelihood due to drought, cattle rustling, or
other reasons (World Bank 2001). The rise in school enrollment over the last few years
(see figure E.1) is likely a testament to this fact.

However, while education is emerging as an adaptive response among Turkana West
youth to access new livelihoods, most cannot afford to pursue a formal education.

                                                                              levels of poverty in Turkana, and a
                                                                              severe shortage of facilities. Accord-
                           ing to CRA (2011), Turkana County has 202 primary schools and only 19 secondary
                           schools. While the national literacy rate for adults in Kenya is 87.4 percent, only 18.1
                           percent of Turkana County’s population can read and write.

                         The ethnographic data collected for this study shows that most respondents cited struc-
                         tural barriers that prevent many people from receiving the benefits of education. The
                         responses reveal that the lack of adequate educational infrastructure in Turkana is a
                         complex phenomenon, which includes:

                         n	   An overall lack of schools and educational institutions;

                         n	   A disproportionate number of primary schools compared with secondary and ter-
                              tiary educational institutions;

                         n	   Low numbers of qualified teachers at all levels; and

                         n	   Inadequate funding for public schools, resulting in lower salaries for teachers and a
                              lack of educational materials.

                         Public schools do not charge school fees, but students still incur some costs. A failure to
                         pay can result in a student being expelled or forbidden to attend schools until the debt is

paid. Private schools charge for materials, fees, boarding, and lodging. These structural
problems are summed up by one woman who said:

     “The children who are brought into town by parents, because leaders say
     bring them, even though the government is providing free schools, they have
     to pay exam fees, uniforms, books, food. But the teaching is a problem. Many
     of my friends who are teachers say that they get no support for teaching. So
     these young people end up on the street, and do jobs here and there, in town,
     in camp. They end up going the wrong way many times. So when the pasto-
     ralists see this, they say, that our herding, that is the good life. But they are
     stuck in that life. Now many of us are saying, let some of us get schooled and
     some do herding and pastoralism. […] I think that some education is good
     but maybe, now that so many people are exposed to business, and even do
     business among the Turkana, maybe that is what they need—business educa-
     tion. One man here—I’ll take you to him—he owns lorries, rental houses,
     hardware stores. He was a pastoralist and now is very rich. But he never went
     to school.” (KII 2015)

The ethnographic data also demonstrate an interdependent relationship between
pushing for education and maintaining close contact with rural kin. Almost all of the
respondents living in Kakuma town or near the camp have relationships with members
of their awi, which includes urban relatives giving commercial goods to their rural kin,
especially in times of drought, and the rural herders giving their urban kin goats or live-
stock if sudden infusions of cash are needed, especially to pay for school fees, uniforms,
books, and travel costs, as examples. In one woman’s words:

     “… people, the big ones, they keep telling us to send our children to school, I
     agree. But the schools should be better. Even though they are free, the children
     have to pay for uniforms, for books, and we sometimes don’t have enough to
     eat, so getting money for those things, we have to go to our relatives and get
     goats to sell. So even if we do what the government wants us to do, because
     we don’t have the money to do education properly, we need the pastoralism.
     But then they tell us not to do that. So where will we get the money to buy
     the things our children need to get a good education? This the leaders do not
     say. And if the pastoralists are neglected and they don’t have goats, because
     of drought or famine, they have sold them in the markets just for buying
     food, then what should we do? If the government wants us to go for education
     and schooling, then they should provide the services that make that possible.”
     (KII 2015)

      One man describes the process, especially in relationship to education:

           “… even though they say that herding is not good, that is not how it is here.
           […] The political leaders, the teachers, the [nongovernmental organization]
           workers. They say we must go to school and not do herding. But this is our
           way, when times are good, when we need money for school, for clothes, we go
           to our brothers and fathers, and mothers out there, who are herding the cattle
           and they give us goats to sell, to pay for our things. When things are bad, like
           food shortage and drought, we send food and other things to them. That is
           how we contribute.” (KII 2015).

      An educated population heralds a diversification of livelihood strategies, which could
      ultimately support pastoral livelihoods by decreasing pressure on animal resources, but
      older people believe that education erodes cultural identity and is sometimes antipasto-
      ral. These sentiments are confirmed by the data presented in table E.5, where the level
      of youth involvement in family livestock holdings decreases with increasing levels of
      education.

      In Turkana West, only 8.6 percent of youth with a secondary education are engaged in
      family livestock holdings compared with 16.5 percent of youth with a primary educa-
      tion and 48.4 percent with no education. This can be explained by the fact that the
      higher the education level among young people, the more likely they are to look for
      and acquire paying work. The fact that the average proportions of engagement with
      livestock in Turkana West are lower than those of Turkana County in general (55.4
      percent for those with no education; 27.3 percent for those with a primary education;
      and 15.3 percent for those with a secondary education or above) can also be attributed
      to alternative livelihood opportunities available in the camp or as a result of it. The
      data also supports the notion that young people with an education were more likely to
      acquire wage-paying employment than their uneducated peers.

      A considerable number of youth in the constituency with some level of education (15
      percent with secondary education and 22 percent with primary education) have no
      work. The Turkana, according to ethnographic data collected for this study, attribute
      this to the general discrimination against the Turkana by the rest of the Kenyan society
      and the less-than-minimal public infrastructure for education, which may leave Tur-
      kana youth in a position where they cannot gain status through salaried professional
      jobs within or outside Turkana County. As one man said:

           “The local schools are very bad, and do not prepare you for jobs in Nairobi.
           Even if we are qualified, we won’t be given the jobs, because we are Turkana.
           But those who went to school, they don’t know herding, so they come, and get
           small jobs, working for this or that.” (KII 2011)

      A woman said:

           “If our government can help us to increase our standards of living, to give
           the same services and help that the refugees get that will be good. I do not
           blame the refugees for what they get. They suffer hardship. But this is our
           home and we are neglected by our own people. Even good jobs here, they go
           to the down-Kenyans, the Kikuyus, and others. They build the shops here, the
           Somalis and Kikuyus and Luhyas. We deserve more than we have been given.”
           (KII 2015)

      One unintended consequence of increased enrollment and the structural issues in
      accessing education has been the creation of a “lost generation,” referring to men who
      received a substandard education. A lack of relevant skills combined with the failure
      of the system to translate education into jobs and livelihoods in urban or professional
      settings have left these young men without the ability to generate a livelihood, either in
      their more traditional lives or by establishing careers in the professional world. While
      this affects both men and women, the broad division between gendered spaces allows
      women to gain and maintain status through marriage, motherhood, and domestic
      housework (female domestic spheres), while men find it impossible to maintain or gain
      status without engaging in wealth-creation activities in the public sphere, either in the
      traditional realms of farming and pastoralism or in professional careers.

      These assertions about education and pastoralism concur with studies around the
      world, which suggest that although formal education may successfully prepare children
      for new forms of livelihood outside pastoralism, it is antagonistic to pastoral livelihoods
      virtually everywhere.

      The Constitution of Kenya and Its impact on Customary Laws and Practices
      Customary law encompasses the unwritten norms and practices of small-scale com-
      munities that pre-date colonial times but which has undergone a number of transfor-
      mations due to colonialism and capitalism. It is localized in nature and as diverse as
      the communities involved, although there is general consensus on certain fundamental
      principles: the central role of the family, the supremacy of the group over the individual,
      and the importance of kinship ties (Kamau n.d.).
                                                   E. Background Paper:
                                                                                                        131
              The Future of Kakuma’s Youth—Opportunities and Challenges



Customary laws and practices have an intricate link with the rights of young women.
This is especially true because traditional African societies are governed on the basis of
patriarchal structures under which the individual interests of women are subsumed by
those of the group. Practices such as gender-based violence and early or child marriages
are common among the Turkana. These practices not only negatively affect the health,
social welfare, dignity, and physical and psychological development of young women,
but they are also in contravention of the law as espoused in the Kenyan constitution
and international human rights instruments. Section 53(1)d of the constitution, for
example, provides that “every child should be protected from abuse, neglect, harm-
ful cultural practices, all forms of violence, inhuman treatment and punishment, and
hazardous or exploitative labour.”7 Section 55d stipulates: “the State shall take measures,
including affirmative action programmes, to ensure that the youth—are protected from
harmful cultural practices and exploitation.” And Section 45, subsection 2 specifically
stipulates: “every adult has the right to marry a person of the opposite sex, based on
the free consent of the parties.” The reference to “adult” presupposes that the individual
must have attained the age of 18, effectively outlawing marriage among minors, and the
reference to “free consent” outlaws forced marriages.

The conflict between the law and human rights practices with customary laws and prac-
tices necessitate change because the constitutional provisions are supreme.

Urbanization
Refugee camps are often perceived as transient settlements, reflecting the temporary
nature of the refugee phenomenon. Yet some camps, such as Kakuma—which has
existed for 23 years—can be compared to a virtual city given the size of its population
and demographic density (Kagwanja 2000). With over 160,000 refugees living there
in September 2016, the camp has emerged as an urban enclave. The establishment of
infrastructure and social amenities by NGOs and the UNHCR has been valuable for
economic development and has benefited both the refugee and local population.

Kakuma Refugee Camp contains kindergartens, primary and high schools, vocational
schools, a hospital, clinics, libraries, community centers, churches, and mosques. People
engage in business at restaurants, general stores, butcher shops, and vegetable stands.
Theaters show movies and promotion videos for popular singers, such as Michael Jack-
son. Several restaurants have satellite broadcast dishes so people can watch soccer games
taking place in Italy. There are telephones and remittance services with international

      capability. Boda bodas busily come and go on the roads of the camp, undoubtedly
      presenting many aspects of modernity to the residents. Because of the camp’s growth,
      Turkana West, which was initially merely a host region for refugees, grew into a large
      town (Kurimoto 2002).

      Introduction of a Cash Economy
      Trade, including the sale of wood for fuel, cutting and selling building poles and fenc-
      ing material, collecting and selling stones for construction, and selling milk and meat,
      in addition to employment opportunities, introduced the community to a previously
      nonexistent cash economy. In a survey conducted in 2004 (Okoti et al. 2004: 18), 95
      percent of respondents said they received market value for what they sold, and 77.5
      percent said they made a profit, although they could not define it in monetary terms.
      Profits were spent on food, clothing, medicine for their livestock, for themselves, or for
      their families, and restocking—something that used to be much more difficult to do.
      The price of livestock jumped as a result of the high demand for meat from the refugee
      community, further accelerating the spread of a cash economy among the Turkana.


      Effects of Changes on Youth Perceptions, Perspectives,
      and Aspirations
      The transformations in Turkana West that resulted from the presence of the Kakuma
      camp set in motion changes that affected the economic, social, and cultural setup of the
      local community (Okoti et al. 2004). It would seem that Turkana West youth have also
      changed to accommodate the new reality (Kamau n.d.). Some of the changes associated
      with the host youth are discussed below.

      Changing Perception of Pastoralism as a Sustainable Way of Life
      Mainstream society in Kenya represents pastoralism as a fundamentally flawed way of
      life. The public image of pastoralism painted in the media, in the education system, and
      in the public administration has created a public and institutional image that grossly
      misrepresents it (World Bank 2001).

           “At the core of the public representation of pastoralism is the idea that ‘pas-
           toralism’ and ‘modern life’ are mutually exclusive, as two successive stages of
           human development in a unique line that goes from nature to civilization,
           passing from sedentary life and agriculture. This frame offers no ground on
           which pastoralism and modern world could meet: one being thought to begin

     where the other is supposed to end. The discourse about pastoralists and
     pastoral development is therefore constructed along strings of oppositions:
     nature vs. civilization; nomadic vs. sedentary; traditional vs. modern; igno-
     rance vs. education; irrational vs. rational; dirty vs. clean; women’s subjuga-
     tion vs. gender sensitivity; group tyranny vs. individual freedom; prosperity
     vs. poverty; etc.” (World Bank 2001).

Young people in Turkana perceive their way of life as being inferior and thus shun it for
the “modern,” which is thought to be superior.

As indicated by the ethnographic data, there have been efforts to supplant the Turkana’s
ways of knowing with those of mainstream Kenyan society. During the late 1960s and
1970s, young Turkana boys and girls were forcibly removed to schools in down-Kenya,
punished for speaking the Turkana language, and given an education under stark and
often abusive conditions in an attempt to acculturate and reeducate the Turkana into
mainstream Kenyan society. These actions were paralleled by the continued enforce-
ment of the “closed district” policies of the Kenyan government. A young Turkana
woman whose father had been taken to down-Kenya explained:

     “My father was born in a pastoral family. But he was forced to leave the awi
     after independence, and [the government] wanted to change their life through
     education so they can be given jobs in ‘wazungu shambas’ [the white settlers’
     ranches]. About the forced settlement, my father said he is okay with the forc-
     ing now, but it was pretty bad then. The officers would come and take boys
     and some girls, and put them in schools in down-Kenya. And there were good
     things because he became a doctor, and most other people who took advan-
     tage at that time, they became politicians and teachers. But many resisted,
     and were harassed. Most of the people who did not accept, were beaten, many
     died in the schools. But those who were humble, they did well. [By humble, I
     mean] the ones who did what the teachers told them, who did not resist the
     officers, they did well” (KII 2015).

Such stories feed the larger narrative among the Turkana that their culture is considered
inferior by mainstream Kenyan society and that if they want to participate in the larger
society, they need to assimilate, minimizing their “Turkana behaviors” in their daily
lives and activities.

      Changing Perspective of Nomadism

      Because they are of pastoral origin, local youth used to be indifferent to borders and a
      sense of permanence. However, the harsh unsustainability of pastoralism and the new-
      found trade, education, and employment opportunities around the camp in Turkana
      West have compelled youth to settle in the area (Kagwanja 2000).


      Embracing of New World Views

      The gradual expansion of external influences, such as the refugee camp and people
      from other parts of the country, is an important factor in thinking about changes to
      traditional structures.

      Increases in migration and population size in Turkana West intensified interactions
      among the local community with the migrant community from other parts of the coun-
      try, aid workers, and refugees. Apart from expanding the networks of young people
      beyond their local area, the cosmopolitan make-up brought an inflow of new ideas and
      practices. While these did not automatically result in the erosion of customary author-
      ity (Carlson et al. 2012), they began influencing customary institutions to evolve. The
      interaction played a major role in challenging the sedentary lifestyle of pastoral youth.
      As observed by Betti (2010), generational change is a phenomenon pertaining to all
      cultures, and therefore there is nothing new about youth being different than the elders
      in thought, belief, and practice. However, because of changing circumstances, younger
      generations must resocialize in order to adapt to or make sense of the new world around
      them. While youth may seem to have drastically changed from their ancestors to fit into
      new social parameters and value systems, they are really just adjusting their strategies
      of behavior. For example, youth in Kakuma increasingly prefer to dress in jeans and
      modern clothes, which can be viewed as assimilation into the “global taste” (Kurimoto
      2002).

      Change in Gender Perspectives and Roles
      Turkana women have traditionally played a negligible role in decision making. How-
      ever, due to the decrease of animal populations and the corresponding decline in
      economic roles for men, most households have adopted a mixed strategy. One foot
      remains in pastoralism, mainly maintained by the men, while the other is planted in
      alternative livelihoods that are mainly taken up by the women. With the new role of
      women supporting their households through resource exploitation and petty trade—
      such as collecting firewood, burning charcoal, getting milk to sell at the camp, mend-
      ing fences at the camp, and providing domestic services to refugees—the gender biases
      embedded in customary law are slowly waning. Young women, backed by the formal

law, are challenging cultural practices, such as gender-based violence and early or child
marriages. This tension has been newly animated by the increased role of women in
economically providing for their households (Carlson et al. 2012).

However, this economic transition from traditional livelihoods, while welcomed by
young women, puts pressure on them to work “double shifts,” and while these new
opportunities may generate more household income or a better livelihood, they may
also disempower young women if they result in the women bearing additional burdens
and experiencing heightened vulnerability (Enns and Bersaglio 2015). According to the
ethnographic data collected for this study, changing gender dynamics have heightened
gender-based violence. However, while these new jobs do expose women to violence,
including sexual assault, assault, and robbery, the women view the violence as a part of
their lives, as a normal occurrence, and the risk as necessary.

As dangers mounted, refugee women were discouraged from leaving the camp, but the
increasing demand for firewood meant that local people had to supply the camp with
the necessary goods. However, taking over the market also included taking over the
associated risks because the gangs and militias were still around. While these activities
make women more vulnerable to physical violence and even health problems resulting
from carrying large quantities of food or water, they also provide a more stable means
of income for women, ranging from approximately K Sh 900–2,560 (US$10–25) per
month.

A Rise in Self Interest Over the Community Good
Young men used to be the community’s warriors, bestowed with the responsibility to
protect and acquire property for the community through mass raiding. Young men
usually acquired prestige by being brave and successful in predatory raids and by
accumulating large herds of animals. With the coming of a cash economy, young men
engage in violent raids for the sole purpose of selling the livestock to benefit themselves.


Lessening Respect for Elders

To fulfill individual responsibilities in accordance with customary law, each member of
the community had roles to perform—depending on age, sex, and group affiliation—that
maintained social organization and supported cultural norms and values (Carlson et al.
2012). Young men relied heavily on the decision making, knowledge, and governance
of the elders regarding systems of animal husbandry. As pastoral livelihoods dimin-
ished, the elders became less central to many young men who started engaging with the
new livelihoods that emerged to fill this gap. The youth are now operating beyond the
136   Appendixes



      management capacities of the elders, also decreasing their relevance in terms of cus-
      tomary authority. This presents a major challenge to the customary institutions and the
      social stability these institutions were meant to protect. Many elders unable to resolve
      this growing crisis are increasingly turning to state justice and security providers to
      manage the growing rift between male youth and elders (Carlson et al. 2012).

      A classic example is cattle raiding, which was traditionally sanctioned by the elders but
      which must now be left to the state authority to regulate. In some cases, elders order
      fines for reparations or transgressions to be paid in cash rather than in animals. Youth
      are frustrated with the elders’ inability to manage the economic well-being of their com-
      munities. They are disdainful of the merits of customary authority when their elders lack
      the power to strengthen the well-being of the community (Carlson et al. 2012).


      Change from Community Defenders to Community Attackers

      The socialization of Turkana youth to be brave, to raid, and to protect the community
      creates a lot of hostility in them. Many youth (especially young men) who are unem-
      ployed or underemployed resort to theft and armed raiding to deal with their poverty
      and hunger, thus becoming a source of insecurity in Turkana County, especially in the
      refugee camp.


      What New Opportunities Portend for Youth In Turkana West
      Devolution
      Given the growing political interest and awareness of rights, young men have orga-
      nized community-level youth groups to heighten their political participation locally
      while also increasing their efforts—peace-building or development—within their com-
      munities and across groups. Constitutional provisions, particularly devolution, have
      increased the involvement of youth in formal political processes, thus allowing them to
      increasingly exercise their autonomy apart from the elders’ authority. This is indicative
      of the interest and agency among male youth to move beyond the traditional power
      relations with elders (Carlson et al. 2012). The young men are also coming together to
      support their own needs for livelihood opportunities. The ethnographic data findings of
      the worry analysis for the Turkana of Kakuma confirm that men, especially those who
      are young and middle-aged, are concerned with formal employment and related issues,
      such as illness, medical facilities, and disabilities, while women are more concerned
      with issues of hunger and, in the case of middle-aged women—the most consistent pro-
      viders of income and food for the family—about their lack of money to pay school fees.
      Because middle-aged women have established a portfolio of diverse livelihood activities

ranging from domestic work in the camp to agriculture, collecting firewood and char-
coal, fence-making, and construction, they experience the lowest level of worries over
poverty and a hard life, even as they perform the bulk of labor in the camp and town.
Older men also exhibit a lower rate of worries about poverty compared with others,
probably because they either have a higher status and access to livestock or because
poverty is normative and therefore not expressed as a worry or concern. In sum, the
ethnographic and worry analyses, disaggregated by age and gender, reveals a variation
in the general underlying concerns and tensions faced by the Turkana on a daily basis
while they try to build lives in Kakuma, even as they adapt to the changing demograph-
ics and issues brought by the refugees and the relief and development organizations.

Discovery of Oil
There has been excitement around the emergent oil industry and what it portends for
youth in the region even though the country is at the preliminary stages of exploration
and therefore the industry has so far only offered a small amount of material benefit
to community members. Many youth look forward to being employed in the sector,
particularly young men, who see the sector as a promising opportunity to gain wage
labor and accumulate wealth in order to purchase material goods such as cell phones
and radios (Enns and Bersaglio 2015). The sector was seen by older women as a viable
way to “give youth hope,” meaning that the sector will help improve the quality of life
among those who get jobs in the sector.

While most youth in Turkana are not very well educated, they still express hope that they
will get high-ranking, formal technical employment in the extractive sector, particularly
because these companies provide training opportunities. Because they hail from the area
where the resources will be mined, the youth hope to be given preferential treatment.

The reality, however, as illustrated in table E.6, is that most director and management
positions are occupied by expatriates. The few nationals in management are mainly
surveyors, advisors, and engineers. “Skilled” employees are usually nationals, includ-
ing welders, plumbers, electricians, crane operators, assistant drillers, masons, group
financial controllers, ecologists, and sociologists—all mainly from other parts of Kenya.
Unskilled workers are all nationals and are predominantly from the local community.

Because the quality of employment matters in establishing whether the type of employ-
ment activity that an individual is engaged in will drive them out of poverty, it is highly
unlikely that the employment opportunities provided by the extractive operations in
Turkana will provide a large push out of poverty for residents. The resulting effects on
youth are discussed below.

      Reinforced Narratives of Mathharau

      The lack of permanent, unskilled manual jobs available to Turkana men within Turkana
      compounds the larger issue that many of these menial jobs have the potential for inter-
      actions of indifference or mistreatment that create experiences and reinforce narratives
      of mathharau and ng’imeny.


      Labor Migration and High Unemployment

      The existence of oil will trigger labor migration to exploration sites as well as high
      unemployment because many young people believe that being closer to sites of oil
      exploration will increase their chances of being directly employed by an oil company,
      especially for tasks requiring unskilled labor. The exploration sites are also thought to
      provide opportunities for entrepreneurial activities and better access to markets for
      products sold by youth. These mining areas are growing at shocking rates. According to
      the Economist, as cited by Enns and Bersaglio (2015), some towns have seen a popula-
      tion growth of 500 percent. Numerous studies have proved that the growth of urban
      centers with high unemployment rates (because of low education levels), no social ser-
      vices, and a young demographic will certainly have profoundly negative consequences
      on the development and stability of the region as a whole.


      Idle Youth Caught Up in Various Vices

      Because these youth have no relevant skills, education, or assets to compete for employ-
      ment opportunities, the cycle is further reinforced by groups of Turkana youth, mainly
      young men in the towns “sitting idle by the roadside chewing mirah, smoking cigarettes
      and shisha, and even consuming alcohol and drugs.” The emergent narratives among
      external actors, both relief and development workers and refugees (in Kakuma) is that
      of Turkana men being “lazy” and in general “unable to be productive.”

Social Stratification

As evidenced by the ethnographic data, social differentiation is also felt in relation to
access to jobs. Class, contacts, and the ability to access cash posed major barriers for all
the young men and women trying to secure these jobs. One man said:

      “Most businesses, they only hire if they know you or your family for the good
      jobs. For the menial jobs, the Turkana are cheaper. But incentive staff, that
      is something else. It does not pay as much, the Kenyans [non-Turkana] get
      much more for doing the same or even less work. But it is work. For that, you
      have to take courses, and sometimes, you have to pay hongo [bribe] to the
      person who is hiring, so that they will pick you. Other times, some people
      who get the jobs, they get it through leaders in the camp or town, so they have
      contacts. So that becomes a problem because not everyone has the contacts
      or the money.” (KII 2015)


Triggers of Conflict

Social stratification has bred competition for opportunities and rivalries among Tur-
kana youth but most intensely between Turkana and non-Turkana youth from other
parts of Kenya. As young people become more aware of how limited and competitive the
opportunities in the emergent oil industry are, past exclusion from formal development
processes is unearthing old wounds, and Turkana youth are becoming quite vicious.
There is a belligerent resentment of up-country populations who are seen as coming to
take the few opportunities that exist for the Turkana in this time of plenty—because of
the discovery of oil—and yet during their time of need, the Turkana were neglected; no
one wanted anything to do with them. Although conflict has been a constant feature of
life in Turkana, the existence of the extractive sector will change the nature of conflict
(table E.7).

                                            Other conflicts revolve around the complexi-

      has been a framework for groups to avoid zero-sum competition and instead focus
      on mutually beneficial land-sharing schemes (Carlson et al. 2012). Unfortunately, the
      discovery of oil and gas is already interfering with this system and contributing to the
      breakdown of these cooperative practices.

      In places where there is the potential for oil deposits, communities are being displaced
      without proper procedure or compensation mechanisms. Restricted access to grazing
      land and water resources at oil excavation sites are cause for concern among pastoral
      communities. The sudden fragmentation of land and new restrictions on mobility and
      resources are destructive to pastoral livelihoods, which depend on the ability to move
      and access resources in response to environmental stressors (Enns and Bersaglio 2015).

      Changing land-use patterns in Turkana are further complicated by the fact that it is
      extremely difficult to compensate for the loss of mobility and migratory routes. There is
      also no way of valuing community land, and therefore the potential for oil exploration
      efforts to undermine pastoral land use is leading some to question the compatibility of
      oil development and pastoral activities in Turkana (Enns and Bersaglio 2015). These
      issues have greatly contributed to unrest, mistrust, and conflict between groups, mainly
      involving youth.

      Concerns have also been raised around environmental issues, including the contami-
      nation of community resources such as water and grazing land due to oil spills. These
      risks have been cited as further challenges to the well-being and survival of pastoral
      households in Turkana. According to Enns and Bersaglio (2015), despite these worries,
      not a single youth they interviewed suggested that oil development should be stopped
      altogether.


      Gender Discrimination

      There is an inherent lack of opportunities for women in the oil mining industry as evi-
      denced in table E.6: only 9.4 percent of all employees in this sector are female. This is a
      concern for young women already facing cultural marginalization that makes it difficult
      to successfully diversify their livelihoods.

               The Future of Kakuma’s Youth—Opportunities and Challenges



Conclusion
There is evidence that the Kakuma refugee camp has offered opportunities to youth in
Turkana West in terms of introducing alternative livelihoods and increasing the stan-
dard of living in the area through increased household incomes, which according to
the ethnographic data has improved the nutritional status of the people in Turkana
West more dramatically than those from other parts of Turkana. It can therefore be
concluded that, at least in this regard, the presence of refugees has had a net positive
impact on Turkana.

However, the youth remain in limbo because the camp’s existence forces them to grapple
with a set of new dynamics. Some of the key challenges are:

n	   For years, the government has neglected its responsibility to promote develop-
     ment in Turkana. Because of this, while on one hand, the education sector is lauded
     as the solution to poverty among the local people; on the other, it is stifled by a lack of
     resources to support the necessary infrastructural development required to improve
     quality and completion rates. Access to education is minimal for most Turkana
     youth, resulting in high rates of unemployment, and youth who attend school do not
     learn traditional pastoral skills, creating a double-edged sword that cripples youth
     who end up not educated enough for professional careers and not skilled enough to
     succeed at pastoralism. This is why they are referred to as the “lost generation.”

n	   Changes in social and economic systems have introduced complex dynamics that
     require various groups of people in Turkana West to change in order to accom-
     modate new realities. Women, for example, have had to support their households
     through resource exploitation, menial jobs, and petty trade. However, while wel-
     comed by young women, this economic transition from traditional livelihoods puts
     pressure on them to work “double shifts,” and while these new opportunities may
     generate more household incomes or better livelihoods, they have also been a source
     of heightened vulnerability for women in terms of gender-based violence.

n	   New opportunities are changing power relations. Opportunities such as devolu-
     tion are introducing new forms of power relations that operate outside traditional
     norms. And the discovery of oil deposits in Turkana has unearthed old wounds of
     exclusion from the formal development processes, stirring up resentment in up-
     country populations. Turkana youth are exhibiting signs of growing belligerence.

F           Gender Dynamics in Turkana County
            and Kakuma Refugee Camp



Rationale and Methodology
Unpacking critical gender-differentiated norms, dynamics, and constraints within
and between refugee and host populations is critical. Understanding disparities and
factors of vulnerability that perpetuate inequalities and impede poverty reduction and
economic growth could ultimately identify enabling pathways and interventions to
improve asset bases and promote resilience across and between populations of concern.

The development challenges in Turkana are immense. Poverty and deprivation is
widespread, and education and health indicators remain among the lowest in Kenya,
particularly for women and girls. Despite statutory provisions protecting against dis-
crimination on the basis of sex, enforcement of human rights is a challenge, especially
in light of customary practices that predominantly favor men over women and persis-
tent cultural norms such as bridewealth and early marriage. Economic barriers for men
and women are significant, and without targeted attention, they threaten to undermine
efforts toward inclusive growth and broader regional stability. Gender-based violence
is a widespread and regular experience for Turkana and refugee women and girls, but
there is also evidence that men are being victimized. Child labor is evident, and men
and boys are subjected to various forms of targeted violence.

Appropriate consideration of key gender dynamics and relationships that influence
or feed into pervasive disparities across groups in Turkana County and the Kakuma
Refugee Camp is critical. In this context, this study examines gender dynamics across
multiple dimensions including: (1) transformations in gender-differentiated roles and
responsibilities in light of a range of stressors to household resilience and vulnerability;
(2) gender dimensions to protection challenges, including varying forms of gender-
based violence that confront both refugee and host populations; and (3) gender dynam-
ics tied to masculinity and male identity—notably, the decreasing ability of Turkana
and refugee men and male youth to realize exacting social expectations of manhood.


                                                                                               145

      In the context of this report, gender refers to socially constructed roles and relation-
      ships between women and men. These roles are influenced by variables such as age,
      race, class, and ethnicity. They are mutable over time, subject to learning and evolving
      contexts. Diagnosis and analysis of gender-based differences has important implica-
      tions for poverty reduction and sustainable development, particularly in the context of
      persistent instability. Identifying and understanding the unique barriers and opportu-
      nities that men, women, boys, and girls each confront helps ensure that interventions,
      project activities, and analytical work promote the equitable realization of economic,
      political, and social gains.

      This analysis builds on an extensive literature review, complemented by an analy-
      sis of data on social and gender issues emerging within and between Turkana and
      refugee populations. Study methodology includes semistructured, in-depth, quali-
      tative interviews and focus group discussions conducted with local host community
      members. It is important to note, however, that this paper draws from interviews with
      a select sample of stakeholders rather than from the full cohort of interviews conducted
      during the course of the social impact analysis.8


      Background
      Turkana County, the largest county in Kenya, is located in the northwest corner of
      the country and is home to over 1.2 million people. The environment is character-
      ized by a harsh arid and semiarid climate, limited access to water, and low agricultural
      potential. Turkana is among the five poorest counties in Kenya, reflective of a legacy of
      marginalization, underdevelopment, and neglect. Socioeconomic indicators are dire,
      with 87.5 percent of the population living below the poverty line (KNBS 2014). Poverty
      in Turkana is exacerbated by harsh environmental conditions, limited infrastructure,
      and minimal access to basic services (Opiyo et al. 2014). Turkana rates as one of the
      most deprived counties in Kenya across at least seven of the following variables: pov-
      erty, mean household expenditure, education, work for pay, water, sanitation, cooking
      fuel, access to electricity, and improved housing (KNBS and SID 2013).

      Only 39 percent of the population has access to improved water sources, and only 9
      percent has access to improved sanitation. There is a limited differentiation in access
      between male- and female-headed households (KNBS and SID 2013). One report sug-
      gests that on average, 75 percent of households walk 2–3 kilometers to access sources of
      safe water (Wawire 2003). Malnutrition and undernourishment indicators are among

the worst in the country; 23 percent of children are considered wasted,9 and 34 per-
cent are underweight for their age. National averages are 4 and 11 percent, respectively
(KNBS 2014).

At an average of 6.9, the total fertility rate is three points higher than the national
average of 3.9, and the county is growing quickly, with over 1.2 million people living
in the region and an expanding population, particularly among youth (KNBS and
SID 2013). Over 54 percent of families have more than seven children (Opiyo 2014),
and almost half of the population is under 14 years of age. Higher fertility rates correlate
with living in rural areas, deprivation, and low levels of educational attainment, and
they further align with a low prevalence of contraceptives (10 percent). Only 15 per-
cent of the population has achieved a primary-level education, and only 3 percent have
attended secondary school. Turkana County demonstrates some of the poorest health
indicators in the country, compounded by a limited investment in staffing, health sys-
tems, and infrastructure, and a largely mobile pastoralist population. Maternal mortal-
ity in the region is three times higher than the national average (Human Rights Watch
2015). Only 23 percent of women in the county were attended by a skilled provider
during delivery, and only 23 percent delivered in a health facility (KNBS 2014).

Traditional patriarchal practices persist, include polygamy, wife inheritance, and
early or forced marriage. This is evidenced even among respondents of qualitative
interviews: several of the interviewed women report having been married by the age
of 12 or 13. Men are ascribed the primary responsibility of protecting and providing
for the home while women attend to a range of domestic tasks in addition to activi-
ties to supplement livelihoods and household income. These divisions, however, have
evolved out of historical dynamics and continue to change as they are challenged and
transformed in the face of evolving external stressors.

The majority of households (55 percent) practice pastoralism, almost 16 percent
rely on agropastoralism, 8 percent on fishing, and just over 8 percent on urban or
periurban livelihoods (Opiyo et al. 2014). Households in Turkana confront a range of
challenges related to the impacts of climate change, with vulnerability extending from
diverse factors such as widespread poverty, food insecurity, recurrent droughts, land
degradation, inequitable land distribution, and overdependence on rain-fed agriculture
(IPCC 2012).

adequate nutrition. Wasting is often linked to illnesses such as diarrhea and deterioration in food supplies (KNBS 2014).

      Within this context of strained resources, poor infrastructure, and limited basic
      services, Kakuma refugee camp was established in 1992 with the arrival of a cohort
      of Sudanese young men commonly known as the “lost boys.” Kakuma refugee camp
      currently host over 160,000 refugees from 20 different countries (UNHCR 2016). South
      Sudanese refugees account for half of the population, with nearly 91,000 people reg-
      istered; Somalis account for 30 percent (just over 55,000); and Sudanese, particularly
      from Darfur, account for the next largest group, numbering just over 10,000.10 There are
      additional refugees from a wide range of countries, including Burundi, the Democratic
      Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Uganda. Unlike many other displacement
      settings where women and children account for the disproportionate share of the forc-
      ibly displaced, at Kakuma, there is a larger share (54 percent) of men and boys across
      almost all age ranges. The only exception is for individuals over age 60, of which women
      account for nearly 70 percent.11

      As in Turkana County, deprivation and human insecurity prevail as refugees have
      poor access to most basic resources. Encampment policies mandated by the govern-
      ment of Kenya restrict the movement of refugees outside the camp, their ownership
      of livestock, and their engagement in formal employment and income-generating
      activities. Refugees are allowed to engage “voluntarily” in wage-paying activities, for
      which they are paid low-level “incentive” fees. While a vibrant informal economy has
      developed within Kakuma (Oka 2011, 2014) in which both the Turkana and refugees
      participate, encampment policies have been criticized for rendering refugees depen-
      dent on humanitarian support by external actors and for exacerbating divisions with
      local populations.

      While basic needs in Kakuma are significant, the administration of the camp by the
      United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and a range of other
      development actors ensures the provisioning of some critical basic services, includ-
      ing education, health facilities, water and sanitation, and other resources. Insecurity
      remains a challenge, however, with refugees confronting domestic and community
      violence, violence within and between national refugee groups, and sporadic violence
      between refugee groups and host populations. Select interviews with refugee popula-
      tions reveal mixed feelings regarding the Turkana, with several respondents reporting
      individual experiences of physical and sexual assault, theft, robbery, and murder. The
      Turkana report similar incidents by the refugee population. At the same time, some
      refugees identified hostile dynamics with other refugees as more likely, particularly the
      Sudanese. The incidence of violence seems to vary by year. Some respondents claimed

that tensions have calmed recently and that the more serious incidents occurred in
years past. For example, two Ethiopian respondents noted heightened tensions between
refugee and Turkana populations in 2008, highlighting the outbreak demonstrations
by refugee community leaders demanding improved protection from Turkana raiding.


Gender Dynamics Among Populations
Pastoralist populations in Turkana are deeply patriarchal, upholding distinct and
differentiated roles for men and women in the household. A Turkana homestead, or
awi, is traditionally comprised of a man; his wives and children; and potentially other
relatives, such as his mother or other female dependents.12 Households are further orga-
nized into an adakar, or herding group, comprised of a loose confederation of families
who live and migrate together, thereby benefiting from collective protection from ban-
dits or other raiding groups. Families are primarily patrilocal, with wives moving into
the husband’s awi upon marriage. Current gender norms, which are relatively recent
but now constantly reinforced, underscore the primacy of men in the household hier-
archy, with women ascribed secondary and circumscribed status. As one respondent
describes:

       “With us, in our culture and tradition, women were treated as kids … back
       then, their job was to be in the kitchen, to be seen, to be sent to forced marriage.
       It was common to have girls of 10 married to men of 50 or more.” (KII, 2015)

There is evidence, however, that these norms reflect a relatively recent legacy of the
presence of the British military, and that women previously occupied more promi-
nent roles in household subsistence activities. Changes in social organization and
settlement patterns emerged in the early 20th century, extending in part from events of
severe livestock depletion compounded by skirmishes with the British military. In par-
ticular, British forces rounded up women and children and confined them into enforced
settlement groups of 10–15 awi households. Under these conditions, women and chil-
dren were forced to remain in homesteads while men were removed from homes, either
through forced labor, eviction, or forced recruitment into the army or police. These
artificial divisions may have contributed to shifts in household roles and responsibili-
ties. Turkana origin stories suggest that women previously occupied more prominent
positions maintaining household support through hunting, foraging, and agriculture,
but their forcible separation under British military rule may have contributed to the



12. However, this research, as well as another study, noted that at least initially, it is often difficult for a young man to set up his
own independent awi due to labor demands for managing livestock herds or if he is unable to afford dowry, which can range
from 50–300 goats (Ohta 2007).
150   Appendixes



      evolving dynamics and more distinct divisions of labor, with women becoming pre-
      dominantly responsible for the home (Vemuru et al. 2016).

      Under current structural dynamics of gender, men maintain normative roles as
      providers and protectors, responsible for activities related to livestock herding,
      household supervision, and decision making, as well as to household and commu-
      nal security. Women are responsible for domestic tasks related to cleaning and food
      preparation, child rearing, and firewood and water collection. Women also manage
      complementary functions related to livestock production, including providing water to
      herds, preparing for migration, milking livestock, and caring for small animals. In addi-
      tion, women tend to small ruminants and other animals, including goats, sheep, and
      poultry (Wawire 2003). Collectively, men and women are responsible for transmitting
      cultural values and systems and engaging in other activities to socialize young boys and
      girls, respectively, into their adult roles (Wawire 2003).

      Exposure to numerous and more frequent exogenous threats necessitate shifts in
      livelihood strategies. Households in Turkana confront a range of hazards that serve to
      exacerbate or magnify conditions of vulnerability, including shocks related to climate
      variability such as drought and flash floods, outbreaks of disease that affect livestock, and
      intercommunal conflict. These hazards, particularly climate-related stresses, result in a
      range of negative impacts, including food insecurity, loss of access to water and pasture
      resources, disrupted land-use patterns, and conflicts between and within households
      (Opiyo et al. 2014). In responding to these risks, men and women employ adaptive
      strategies to manage and maintain household welfare and security, such as increasing
      mobility; splitting herds; redistributing or diversifying livestock herds; accessing social
      security networks, including those with family and friends; and increasing reliance on
      alternate livelihoods, including farming, fishing (for those near Lake Turkana), collect-
      ing wild food, petty trading, and distributing food relief (Omolo 2010). Engaging in
      casual labor such as cleaning, washing clothes, construction work, and fence mending is
      common, particularly among Turkana populations involved with the refugee economy
      living near Kakuma.

      Adaptive strategies adopted by the Turkana are facilitated by transitions in house-
      hold responsibilities, with women playing more significant roles in support of their
      households. Men still bear the primary responsibilities for coping activities associated
      with livestock, including herd splitting and migration, but otherwise, traditional liveli-
      hood options for men have shrunk significantly in recent years. As a result, women
      have become central actors in adaptive strategies and alternative livelihoods for the
      household. Depending on environmental conditions, external stressors may increase

household reliance on agricultural production, which is predominantly carried out by
women. Female respondents in the study note that technical knowledge about agricul-
tural practices are primarily transferred by women to girls, although some respondents
say that if their sons were interested, they would teach them as well (FGD and KII
2015). Several women note that they had taught other women in their community as
well and highlight improved farming as a preferred area of intervention in the event
that additional development support is provided (KII 2015).13

Women are extensively engaged in the collection of wild foods, the making and sell-
ing of charcoal, the collection and selling of firewood, casual labor, and managing
small enterprises. As noted during one focus group discussion, women have organized
economic associations and cooperatives across a number of activities as a microfinance
mechanism for small business or activities related to livestock exchanges (FGD 2015).

Polygamy is a common practice with implications for adaptive livelihoods. Men
with multiple wives are responsible for the allocation of resources across wives and their
respective children. While polygamous families can demonstrate adaptive strategies
during conditions of drought, including shared allocation of resources and labor across
wives and children, these strategies are not necessarily sustainable over protracted peri-
ods (Wawire 2003). Of the respondents interviewed, 10 reported living in polygamous
households. Relationships with co-wives seem to vary. Some women report having
supportive relationships in which each wife shares the responsibilities for caring for
children and providing for the home. Others report definite divisions between family
members, including co-wives living in different homes. Indeed, one study notes that
the splitting of polygamous families is not uncommon, particularly during periods of
external stress, such as drought, when resources are limited. Women sometimes relo-
cate to their own homes during a drought. The study notes that tensions between wives
may increase during seasons of drought (Wawire 2003). Assessing current trends and
contributing factors requires more research.

Engagement with the refuge economy has become increasingly critical to house-
hold income, and women are the central economic and social interlocutors between
refugee and host populations. Among the Turkana living close to the Kakuma Refugee
Camp, interaction and engagement with refugee populations has facilitated a critical
means of survival through economic interactions and improved social cohesion. Social
interactions and personal ties are facilitated in part through economic activities and

largely on location, availability of water, and other environmental conditions.

      exchanges in the camp. Turkana men report regularly looking for jobs to perform within
      the camp, including small trade, construction, ditch digging, and other low-skill or
      menial labor for nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) or refugees. Turkana women
      engage with refugees in the trade of milk, firewood, and charcoal. They also perform a
      range of domestic tasks, including cleaning, washing clothes, cooking, mending fences,
      and fetching water. While engaging in these activities is crucial to earning an income
      to support the household, it requires regular interaction with refugees, sometimes lead-
      ing to deeper and lasting personal bonds. One study in particular notes the distinc-
      tive ability of women to foster relationships between the Turkana and refugees (Ohta
      2005b). These relationships and networks often lead to increased support from refugees
      in times of need. Several of the interviewed Turkana explain that even when work is
      unavailable in the camp, friends among the refugees offer food and other resources to
      help the Turkana in times of need (KII 2015).

      Engagement with the refugee economy in particular can hold both positive and
      negative implications for Turkana men and women alike. As mentioned, refugees
      provide a critical source of income and economic support for Turkana populations,
      leading many to note their near total reliance on the presence of the camp for household
      survival. For women in particular, as they bear increasing responsibility for providing
      for the home, engagement in income-generating activities, however marginal, as a mat-
      ter of survival and support for the home, creates a space for women’s empowerment and
      agency. At the same time, many Turkana men and women alike note the risk of assault
      when asking for payment or attempting to negotiate fees for work. As one respondent
      describes: “Three months ago, one mama went to get 250 shillings that one family owed
      her. They beat her so badly, that she had to be carried home by some men. She died in
      two days of the beating”14 (KII 2015). For women, engagement in certain livelihood
      activities, including charcoal firewood collection, increases their exposure to the risk
      of violence, including sexual assault. Some particularly vulnerable women reportedly
      resort to sex work.

      Proximity to the camp exacerbates vulnerabilities among Turkana children and
      youth. Child labor and exploitation, particularly among the Turkana, has been reported
      as a significant challenge as children seek to earn incomes, primarily from odd jobs
      within the camp. Framed as abuse during interviews, numerous respondents noted that
      children were not in school but were instead seeking to supplement their household
      income through odd jobs for refugee populations.


      14. Most respondents noted challenges with predominantly South Sudanese refugees, particularly with the
      Dinka and Nuer; several associated Somalis with an increased incidence of poisoning.

     “There is a high demand for child labor, so they get money. And they drop
     out of school. One boy told me ‘mwalimu, if you make me stay in school, how
     can I eat? I get only lunch in school, not dinner, not breakfast. If I don’t work
     in camp, how can I buy clothes, even uniform.’ Many young boys go to school
     and then come to work in the camp.” (KII 2015).

Several interviews highlight the potential for children to become vulnerable to exploita-
tion or recruitment into gangs or criminal activities by older youth; others highlight their
increased exposure to violence, subjecting them to the risk of physical assault (KII 2015).

Despite substantial contributions by women to the contemporary pastoral economy,
decision-making authority and power continues to reside with men. Several survey
respondents note that household decision making is shared by male and female mem-
bers, suggesting that as women’s contributions to household economies increase so too
might their participation in key household decisions. However, several studies note
that men continue to control the use and allocation of economic resources, investment
decisions, and migration plans (Omolo 2010). Women are still charged with managing
domestic tasks and the broader household economy despite their active engagement in
income-generating activities, making them bear multiple and time-intensive burdens
related to the care of the household as well as economic survival.

Household vulnerability to climate-induced stresses and other external shocks is
also distinctly gendered, with women being the most vulnerable. A recent microlevel
study of household vulnerability in the Turkana region revealed that the majority of
highly vulnerable households were headed by women or someone with a limited or no
primary education (Opiyo et al. 2014). According to this study, 75 percent of female-
headed households, accounting for 50 percent of the survey population, are more likely
to be vulnerable to climate-induced shocks, stresses, and variability than male-headed
households. Women’s vulnerability is likely linked to discriminatory norms and atti-
tudes that circumscribe a woman’s role in the community and in the home, limits her
access to educational and employment opportunities, and inhibits customary rights to
productive resources, including land, property, livestock, and other assets.

A myriad of key determinants further influence vulnerability. They include level of
education; age of head of household; size of household; number of dependents; marital
status, with higher rates of vulnerability among divorced or widowed persons; social
connections, influenced by amount of time spent in an area; and access to extension
services and early warning information. These findings further highlight the intersec-
tion between poverty and vulnerability, noting that the majority of households exposed
154   Appendixes



      to external stresses and shocks, such as droughts, will probably require some form of
      assistance in order to recover (Opiyo et al. 2014). In light of the increasing proportion
      of female-headed households in the arid and semiarid lands of Kenya due to death of
      a spouse, separation, or divorce, it is critical that resilience policies and programming
      specifically target these populations.

      Ethnographic data emerging from interviews conducted for this study highlight
      vulnerabilities confronting single and abandoned women, particularly widows. The
      death of a spouse or father leaves many women without legal, social, or economic pro-
      tection. Several informants relate experiences of being excluded from an awi along with
      their children. Women are granted limited access to or control over livestock herds,
      minimizing their opportunities to earn incomes. The worry analysis further relates deep
      concerns around widowhood that older women confront, with many seeking protec-
      tion as concubines or co-wives of their deceased husband’s brother. For women seeking
      protection by returning to their father’s awi, particularly in the case of divorce, social
      dictates sometimes require the return of any dowry paid by the husband’s family, which
      in many contexts serves as a deterrent to separation. In many instances, single or aban-
      doned women with children migrate to more urban environments, such as Kakuma,
      Lodwar, or Lokichoggio, in order to earn an income. These women and sometimes their
      children tend to become part of the larger low-income labor force, and interactions
      between female Turkana and refugee communities have reportedly increased.

      While not explicitly explored in the study, gender relations within refugee com-
      munities continue to reflect norms and dynamics of countries of origin. This study
      did not conduct ethnographic interviews to distill current gender dynamics within and
      across refugee communities, but there is evidence to suggest a replication of norms and
      relationships as transmitted from communities of origin. As in Kenya, refugees from
      South Sudan, Somalia, and other countries perpetuate uneven power dynamics and
      patriarchal patterns that contribute to persistent disparities between men and women
      and boys and girls. While humanitarian and development programming attempt to
      remediate disparities by paying particular attention to education and health program-
      ming, social and economic empowerment interventions, and peace-building initia-
      tives, women and girls continue to confront entrenched dynamics that minimize their
      autonomy, their voice, and their agency. As discussed in the proceeding section, female
      refugees frequently confront multiple vulnerabilities that expose them to a range of
      protection challenges with associated broader implications for their well-being.

Gender-Based Violence and Protection Challenges
Gender-based violence is a significant challenge in the region. It is often rooted in
entrenched norms and practices that perpetuate uneven power dynamics between men
and women. However, conditions of conflict and displacement—whether protracted or
acute—further exacerbate incidents of gender-based violence as manifested in varying
forms of physical, sexual, psychosocial, economic, and emotional abuse. Factors driving
the persistence include the breakdown of the rule of law, including security and justice
institutions, and the social and moral order that might otherwise have guarded against
it. Gender-based violence, particularly sexual and physical assault, has further been
used as a strategic tool of conflict, intended to disempower and humiliate opposing
groups, particularly men unable to protect their families and homes. Indeed a global
review of 50 countries highlighted significant increases in gender-based violence fol-
lowing major wars (World Bank 2011). In the context of displacement, human insecu-
rity prevails, particularly in camps comprising very small spaces with limited security
measures or other mechanisms of protection. Vulnerability acts as a multiplier across
multiple dimensions—social, economic, and legal—to the compounding effects of gen-
der-based and structural violence that extend out of women’s broader social margin-
alization and low social status. Psychosocial dislocation and trauma originating from
acute conditions of flight as well as broader conditions of marginalization and exclusion
often manifest themselves in harmful behaviors that can lead to aggression and violent
behavior, particularly among men.

The incidence of gender-based violence in Kenya is a significant challenge across
regions and socioeconomic conditions. The 2009 Kenya Demographic and Health
Survey reports that 45 percent of women aged 15–49 have experienced either physical
or sexual violence, and 14 percent have experienced both. Nearly half (47 percent) of
women who have ever been married have experienced emotional, physical, or sexual
violence. The likelihood of becoming the victim of violence increases with age (KNBS
2009).15 In particular, intimate partner (domestic) violence, is prevalent: 49 percent of
women report having experienced physical violence in the home (KNBS 2014). The
magnitude of the challenge is likely to be even greater given the sociocultural norms
that stigmatize survivors of violence, consequently contributing to underreporting and
deterring health or justice-seeking behaviors.



15. While a key indicators report is available for the 2014 Demographic and Health Survey in Kenya, these findings do not
include figures for forms of gender-based violence occurring outside the home. Thus, some figures included here reflect the
2008/09 survey report.
156   Appendixes



      Gender-based violence also constitutes a serious and prevalent protection challenge
      within Turkana County and in the Kakuma Refugee Camp. In-depth interviews and
      focus group discussions with respondents from Turkana reveal high and continuous
      exposure to varying forms of violence. There is a distinct intersection between liveli-
      hood insecurity and incidents of violence because women and girls engage in high-risk
      activities to earn incomes. They are particularly vulnerable to physical or sexual assault
      while collecting wood or other resources to support the home. Several female firewood
      collectors report a commonality of experience with regard to violence, especially rape.
      One woman discusses the money that could be earned mending fences, but notes that
      collecting raw materials for the process is dangerous, putting one at risk of being robbed,
      raped, or otherwise assaulted. Perpetrators are equally likely to include Turkana men
      and male refugees (KII 2015). The interviews provided insufficient information to link
      instances of rape with a particular tribe or ethnic group.16 Women have adopted mea-
      sures to protect against being assaulted, including traveling in large groups and carrying
      axes and pangas, but exposure to violence is practically ubiquitous.

      The impacts of assault can be multiple and severe. Women can contract HIV/AIDS
      and/or suffer from psychosocial distress. Stigma and shame deter reporting and health-
      seeking behaviors, leaving many to suffer alone or become more ill: “Many don’t even
      go to doctors, but they get sicker and sicker, the get depressed after the rape. They can-
      not tell anyone, they will get beaten and kicked out of their homes by their men. Many
      will even commit suicide.” (KII 2015). Stigmatization is further tied to rejection by both
      households and communities, which several individuals note could lead to even riskier
      behaviors for female survivors of violence, including resorting to commercial sex to
      earn an income. According to one man,

            “Because there is so much hunger and poverty, women have to feed their
            children, sometimes they are raped when collecting firewood, and they get
            scolded by the community, they are shunned. They then have to turn to pros-
            titution. The Turkana people don’t like that commerce but hunger speaks.”
            (KII 2015)

      Despite negative impacts on health and well-being, however, the economic imperative
      to earn an income and survive appears to overwhelm security concerns or fears around
      exposure to violence. As one woman put it:



      16. Several studies, for example, have noted prevalence of gender-based violence perpetrated by Somali men against refugee
      women.

                Gender Dynamics in Turkana County and Kakuma Refugee Camp



       “Please understand, that being raped here in Kakuma, is something that we
       all know, and we, some of us, have undergone at some point in our life. You
       can’t stop working just because something happens that is bad. You have to
       get the firewood, or the charcoal, or go back to camp to work for the refu-
       gees, because your children are home and they get hungry, they need to go to
       school. Maybe they can change things after they’re educated, but we need to
       do what we need to do. One bundle of firewood, if we sell it, even after a bad
       day, that is 100 shillings” (KII 2015).

Interestingly, during the interviews, despite the potential for stigmatization and
shame, for the most part, women were very open about their experiences of being
assaulted. During one focus group discussion, women related the commonality of the
experience and openly referenced their own experiences of violence.17 Women even
laughed openly during the discussions of their experiences. This may be indicative of
an adaptive coping mechanism to rationalize or normalize the experience (interviewer’s
note); the psychosocial impact is likely severe.

Distrust of state security institutions is high, which likely further contributes to
underreporting. Nearly all respondents relate frustrations and resentment toward local
and national leaders specifically and government structures more generally with regard to
insecurity and violence. Turkana men and women reveal high levels of distrust and fear
of the police. Respondents describe police as often dismissive of assault claims, blaming
survivors for their experiences of violence, and several note that the police are themselves
sometimes the perpetrators of physical and sexual assault. As one woman notes:

       “I feel safe in the camp, walking, working, even as a woman. But I feel scared
       of the police, they will not hesitate to beat you if you are [in the] camp late, if
       you are even 10 minutes late they can beat you badly.” (KII 2015)

The Incidence of gender-based violence among refugees in Kakuma is common.
Conditions of insecurity within the camp prevail, with a reported range of violations
that include community, domestic, intimate partner, and sexual violence (Horn 2010;
Mwangi 2012). Forced marriage, abduction, child labor, and sexual exploitation are
reported as significant challenges. A recent needs assessment jointly conducted by the
World Food Programme (WFP) and UNHCR reveal that female children are com-
monly used as salespeople for businesses, as laborers, and as transactional sex workers


17. In keeping with ethical guidelines, women were never asked directly to describe their experiences of violence, but many
raised the issue of their own volition. Men also raised the issue, reflecting its pervasiveness in the lives of many people.
158   Appendixes



      (WFP and UNHCR 2014). Studies highlight the vulnerability of newly arrived refugees,
      especially single females, to varying forms of violence, including rape, and the lack of
      access to basic needs increases the likelihood of a woman engaging in transactional sex
      for survival (Mwangi 2012). Reportedly, violations are common among South Suda-
      nese and Somali populations, but given tendency toward underreporting, the scope and
      extent of the challenge across groups is not known.

      Exposure to violence frequently results from efforts to fulfill domestic responsibili-
      ties and meet basic household needs. Like the women of Turkana, collecting firewood,
      water, or other key resources increases the refugee’s risk of exposure to violence, par-
      ticularly of sexual and physical assault. Incidents of rape have also been reported during
      the distribution of food rations. However, a recent study notes a disturbing shift in
      recent years from incidents of rape occurring while women were conducting domestic
      tasks far away from their homes to more direct attacks within homes (Mwangi 2012).
      There is anecdotal evidence of male experiences with sexual violence in Kakuma, but
      given the even more stringent social taboos around male rape, concrete data is virtually
      nonexistent (Horn 2010; Mwangi 2012). According to data from Lutheran World Fed-
      eration, out of 530 reported incidents of sexual and gender-based violence in 2011, 61
      were reported by men (HRC and UNHCR 2013). As in other contexts, incidence data
      are generally limited, and the information that does exist is likely an underestimation
      due to low levels of reporting.

      Intimate partner violence is a significant problem among the Turkana and the
      Kakuma refugee communities. This research does not include reference to incidents
      or drivers of intimate partner/domestic violence in Turkana, although it constitutes a
      serious challenge in regions and socioeconomic settings across Kenya. As indicated
      earlier, nearly half of women who have ever been married have experienced some form
      of emotional, physical, or sexual violence perpetrated by their partners. Most incidents
      are current, that is, they were committed within 12 months prior to the administration
      of the survey (KNBS 2009). As in many countries, social norms that tolerate or justify
      violence against women in the home persist in Kenya, and women are socialized to
      accept and rationalize their experiences of violence by a spouse or relative. Women bear
      the health and psychological burdens of violence in the home, with roughly one-third
      reporting incidents of physical or sexual violence resulting in some form of physical
      injury (KNBS 2009).

      Conditions of displacement often give rise to elevated rates of intimate partner
      violence. Global experience in displacement settings indicate that intimate partner
      violence is often the most frequent and widespread form of violence experienced by
      affected populations. A systematic review of relevant literature examining gender-based

                                                                                              159
            Gender Dynamics in Turkana County and Kakuma Refugee Camp



violence in emergency settings finds that rates of intimate partner violence are extremely
high across all studies—frequently higher than rates of wartime rape and sexual violence
(Stark and Ager 2011). Another study notes that intimate partner violence escalates
among displaced populations confronting restrictions on their mobility, inadequate
access to livelihood opportunities, and limited access to authorities or decision-making
processes. These challenges contribute to feelings of increasing frustration, dislocation,
and disempowerment, which manifest in negative behaviors, including violence in the
home. Consequently, intimate partner violence is recognized as the most common form
of gender-based violence in camp settings (Horn 2010).

Drivers of intimate partner violence in displacement settings are multiple and
complex. A recent report from the International Rescue Committee analyzing con-
ditions of displacement in Iraq, Kenya, and South Sudan demonstrates that intimate
partner violence, including physical, emotional/psychological, and sexual violence,
is one of most prevalent forms of violence confronting women and girls (IRC 2015).
According to this study, key drivers contributing to the perpetration of intimate partner
violence include: (1) rapidly shifting norms as women experience increased access to
opportunities outside the home while men’s ability to do the same diminishes, increas-
ing tensions in the home; (2) family separation, loss of social cohesion, and breakdown
of community structures that might have provided systems of protection and support;
(3) forced marriage, which may be sought as a mechanism for economic and social pro-
tection but which often exposes women and girls to extreme dependence and dramati-
cally imbalanced power relations—a significant challenge among the South Sudanese in
Kakuma where abduction and forced marriage is common (Horn 2010); (4) conditions
of extreme poverty, exacerbating tensions in the home; and (5) substance abuse as men
access negative coping behaviors to address feelings of stress, depression, and frustra-
tion that often emerge in the context of displacement (IRC 2015).

A culture of silence around intimate partner violence and other forms of gender-
based violence persist, driven in part by the associated stigma and shame and by
sociocultural norms that contribute to levels of acceptance, particularly for violence
in the home. This culture contributes to severe underreporting of gender-based vio-
lence, masking a clear understanding of its prevalence. In the context of the study, female
respondents spoke openly about sexual and physical assault experienced by women
outside the home. However, no comments were shared about experiences of violence
inside the home. A study in Kakuma found that most incidents of gender-based vio-
lence, particularly intimate partner violence, were not reported to UNHCR, to police,
to health providers, or to any other service provider (Horn 2010). In fact, respondents
for this study expressed disapproval of women reporting directly to agencies and NGOs
rather than working through existing community structures (Horn 2010).
160   Appendixes



      Within Kakuma, several agencies and organizations have attempted to respond
      to and reduce women’s exposure to gender-based violence. Core actors engaged in
      mitigation and response to gender-based violence include UNHCR, WFP, Jesuit Relief
      Service, and Lutheran World Federation, but survivors often prefer to work through
      community leaders and women’s support groups when seeking response or protection
      services (Horn 2010). These organizations have responded by providing response ser-
      vices to survivors, including medical and psychosocial support, and by establishing safe
      houses/havens for victims (HRC and UNHCR 2013).

      Mitigation and prevention programming seeks to address the issue of access to
      basic resources to reduce exposure to risks of violence. UNHCR, for example,
      adopted mitigation measures to reduce women’s exposure to violence through initia-
      tives addressing natural resource management and cooking fuels, albeit at a small scale
      (WFP and UNHCR 2014). Similarly, responding to protection challenges emerging
      from the collection of firewood for the home, WFP initiated a project in 2012 called
      Safe Access to Firewood and Alternative Energy (SAFE). The objectives of the project
      were to: (1) reduce refugee women’s risk exposure to violence through dissemination of
      fuel-efficient stoves and alternative fuels; (2) explore alternate energy technologies that
      could be applied to livelihood and protection needs; (3) promote the adoption of liveli-
      hoods that reduce women’s reliance on the collection of firewood for income; and (4)
      provide schools with fuel-efficient stoves to ensure that the cost of fuel does not impede
      school attendance (WFP and UNHCR 2014). The pilot in Kakuma was complemented
      by sensitization and awareness-raising activities around protection concerns and gen-
      der-based violence. Ironically, while these initiatives may have managed to reduce the
      incidence of violence among refugee populations to some degree, a Turkana woman
      noted that these initiatives have simply shifted victimization from the refugees to the
      Turkana because they are now the ones engaging in risky activities to bring services and
      resources like firewood to the refugees (KII 2015).

      Despite efforts to improve prevention and response mechanisms within the camp,
      the presence of these systems has not necessarily translated into greater protection
      for refugee women. One study notes that most survivors of violence remain unlikely to
      report incidents through formal channels (Horn 2010). Refugees are more likely to seek
      redress through community mechanisms that replicate or reflect customary institutions
      from their community of origin. Unfortunately, across communities, these structures
      emphasize reconciliation and community harmony, often at the expense of individual
      protection or rights. As such, these structures often conflict with international human
      rights principles, and determinations emerging from them can come at the expense of
      the protection of individuals or the provision of mechanisms for punishment or redress.

Among Somali refugees, for example, customary systems are oriented around mecha-
nisms of communal reconciliation as families seek redress through compensation
(diya). An emphasis is placed on the preservation of social cohesion and pacification
rather than on punishing perpetrators or protecting individual rights. Court determi-
nations are often carried out by male tribal leaders or elders and thus likely reflect and
uphold deeply entrenched patriarchal norms that ultimately disfavor women.

Findings from numerous studies further confirm that women are still not receiving
adequate protection from violence or responsive care, either because current mecha-
nisms are insufficient or because women are unable or do not choose to access the
available services (Horn 2010). Several studies have noted that efforts to provide protec-
tion to survivors through safe spaces and shelter models are often misunderstood by the
surrounding communities, which view them either as a punitive attempt to separate a
survivor from her family or as a safe space provided for prostitutes (HRC and UNHCR
2013; Horn 2010). These misconceptions likely influence the extent to which survivors
are able to access needed response services and underscore the critical need to improve
community awareness and understanding of them. Several Turkana informants also
noted experiences of marginalization and even corruption by relief actors, with reported
instances of discrimination against the Turkana and extortion in exchange for access to
services. These reports are of particular concern and if true may further contribute to
conditions of structural violence experienced by the Turkana and refugees alike.


Masculinities
Conditions of deprivation and protracted displacement in Turkana County and
Kakuma have likely contributed to an erosion of the markers of manhood and male
identity. Male identity—like female identity—is relationally coproduced between men
and women and between communities and the broader ecology in which individuals
operate. One study notes the range of masculinities in sub-Saharan Africa, emphasizing
that versions of manhood are: “(i) socially constructed; (ii) fluid over time and in differ-
ent settings; and (iii) plural” (Barker and Ricardo 2005). At the same time, certain com-
monalities prevail, particularly the primacy of the social requirement to earn an income
and achieve financial independence and to then marry and have a family as central mark-
ers of manhood (Ricardo and Barker 2005). Normative masculinities further designate
men’s roles as fathers, protectors, and providers. In Kenya, male power is predominantly
vested in patriarchal norms transmitted and reinforced through rites of passage, dowry
or bridewealth payments, and virilocal residence (Amuyunzu-Nyamongo and Francis
2006). In the Turkana region, livestock (abundance or lack thereof) play a determinant
role in a man’s status within his community and within the home.

      Since the 1980s, a range of socioeconomic, political, and cultural changes in Kenya
      have transformed gender relations, which has contributed to a reduction in the abil-
      ity of many men to achieve normative notions of manhood (Amuyunzu-Nyamongo
      and Francis 2006). Factors include depressed economic growth caused by corruption,
      mismanagement, declining global prices for cash crops, and other government failures;
      an expanding population; increasing vulnerability; unemployment; and declining access
      to basic services. Traditional livelihood systems in the Turkana region have eroded due
      to a range of adverse conditions, including drought, disease affecting livestock herds,
      desertification, and eroding natural resources, all of which impede pastoralist practices.
      As a consequence, men, but especially women, have diversified their livelihood activi-
      ties and engaged in adaptive coping strategies to provide for the home.

      Diminishing livelihoods in Turkana have contributed to the contraction in men’s
      economic opportunities. As mentioned, women are actively and significantly engaged
      in adaptive strategies and often bear a substantial share of the burden of both income-
      generating activities and attending to the home, making them seem better equipped
      to adapt to livelihood challenges. Conversely, men’s roles in livelihood and economic
      activities have contracted, reducing their contributions to the household economy
      and security. Relief activities targeting the needs of the most vulnerable are currently
      directed in part toward women, as evidenced by the Food-for-Assets program, which
      transfers cash grants primarily to vulnerable female-headed households. The proximity
      of the refugees and the attendant aid architecture available to address their needs high-
      lights the challenges confronting the Turkana and the absence of the state in addressing
      them (KII 2015). This accentuates perceptions among the Turkana of their margin-
      alization and neglect by the government as well as their feelings of resentment and
      powerlessness.

      Informant interviews emphasize a persistent narrative around notions of indig-
      nity—ng’imeny or matharau. Feelings of dependence, marginalization, and/or shame
      that arise from a reliance on refugee populations for an income, particularly in the
      face of emotional, psychological, or physical abuse, contribute to these experiences of
      ng’imeny, further compounded by perceptions of systemic exclusion by the state and
      other external actors. These notions emerge from historical and structural processes
      that are perceived to have begun with the arrival of outsiders to Turkana, whether for
      business, employment, development, or residence, and they are reinforced when Tur-
      kana go to other parts of Kenya. The broader narratives of distrust, anger, and exclu-
      sion that the Turkana have generated about the political, economic, and social system
      from which they have been marginalized for over a century shape their perceptions and
      beliefs regarding external development interventions.

                Gender Dynamics in Turkana County and Kakuma Refugee Camp



For refugee men, conditions of forced displacement can present significant chal-
lenges to identity markers of manhood and male identity, often with negative impli-
cations on broader social cohesion and stability. In the context of Kakuma Refugee
Camp, restricted mobility combined with a lack of access to livestock or opportunities
for otherwise earning an income contribute to men’s frustrations with life in the camp,
and bring with them associated impacts on psychological and emotional well-being. As
articulated in one study:

       “The condition of waiting and living at the mercy of the relief, repatriation
       and relocation process is a debilitating experience that leads to frustration,
       ennui, lethargy, self-victimization or a culture of victimhood, and in certain
       cases, to anger and outright violence.” (Oka 2011)

Dislocation and disempowerment among men in displacement settings contribute to
feelings of depression and aggression or even acts of violence, including an increased
incidence of domestic or intimate partner violence as well as interethnic and intergen-
erational conflict at the individual and group level (Horn 2010).

Feelings of marginalization and disempowerment are further compounded by devel-
opment actors, who often adopt gendered approaches to interventions—specifically
targeting women and girls at the perceived exclusion of men and boys. Interventions
advancing more gender-equitable norms and responses through distribution activities
targeted at women or women’s empowerment programming can be interpreted by men
as disempowering and as a further affront to their masculinity. The blurring or dis-
solution of boundaries between men and women can further contribute to feelings of
marginalization and resentment as well as to violence in the home as men attempt to
reassert dominance and enforce more traditional male and female roles (Dolan 2003).

Male youth in Turkana and in the Kakuma Refugee Camp confront significant chal-
lenges. Normative associations between employment, marriage, and masculinity reflect
important pathways, not just to manhood, but to adulthood. In the absence of oppor-
tunities to work or earn an income, to get married or to achieve other markers of man-
hood—such as receiving an education, owning land, or building a home—many men,
particularly the young, perceive themselves as socially, culturally and/or, politically
marginalized, and even entrapped as “youth” (Interpeace 2014).18 In Kakuma, refugees
are not technically allowed to own livestock while among the Turkana, diminished live-


18. Like masculinity and male identity, notions of youth are ascribed to a range of identifying markers, not just age, such as
gender, marital status, kinship networks, profession, educational attainment, class, and other variables (Interpeace 2014).
164   Appendixes



      stock assets impede payment of bridewealth requirements. Unable to pay a dowry or
      to fulfill other traditional requirements, many young men experience frustration at not
      being able to get married or to facilitate alternate transitions to manhood.

      Frustrated masculinities are manifest in a range of negative behaviors. Thwarted
      ambitions and disaffection are commonly channelled into negative coping behav-
      iors, including drug, alcohol, and khat addiction; aggression; violence; and crime. Inter-
      generational conflict and tensions are prevalent (Interpeace 2014). Although several
      Turkana respondents noted a general absence of enmity between Turkana and refugee
      populations, most acknowledged occasional incidents of violence between and across
      communities, especially recurring strife between the Turkana and the South Sudanese,
      including the Dinka and the Nuer. As one Turkana man noted:

           “Many people, many men, they drink a lot because the job is hard, and there
           is a lot of abuse, when you are insulted in the street. Many times, they don’t
           do that to us, because we are men and we can fight. But we see that happening
           to our women, to children, to old babas and mamas. We see young boys and
           girls chased by the refugees, chased away from their shops or homes. And it
           feels very bad. But most times, we can’t do anything” (KII 2015).

      Thwarted masculinities, particularly among Turkana youth, are probably connected
      to increased engagement in banditry and opportunistic cattle raiding in the region.
      Raiding activities among the Turkana have changed in recent years, partly influenced
      by conditions of deprivation and economic stagnation characteristic of the Horn of
      Africa region. Raiding, once an important cultural practice and mechanism for wealth
      redistribution, has shifted into a predatory activity where wealthy, commonly external
      actors pay male youth to engage in raids to acquire cattle intended for immediate sale
      rather than as a store of future wealth (Omolo 2010). The introduction and prevalence
      of small arms and light weapons has rendered the practice more lethal, and this has led
      to more frequent and lasting hostilities with neighboring tribes and increasing casual-
      ties involving women and children (Omolo 2010).

      The widespread inability among men to pay bridewealth has given rise to alternative
      marriage practices and informal partnerships, particularly between male refugees
      and Turkana women. Confronted by increasing deprivation and diminishing liveli-
      hoods, both Turkana and refugee men are increasingly unable to meet bridewealth
      requirements, which has partly contributed to shifts in marriage practices, especially the
      rise in informal marriages and elopements. While traditional practices have a space for
      these types of informal unions, particularly in Turkana culture, payment requirements
                                                  F. Background Paper:
                                                                                           165
           Gender Dynamics in Turkana County and Kakuma Refugee Camp



persist when children are born, creating opportunities for tensions within and as
interethnic marriages have emerged, between communities (Ohta 2005a). One study
points out the potential for intergroup conflict between refugee and Turkana families
emerging from a refusal or inability to pay the prescribed livestock payment upon the
birth of a child (Ohta 2005b). However study respondents still emphasize the normative
primacy of bridewealth among the Turkana and the impact of rising pressure on male
youth to pay it (KII 2015). One informant noted a shift in marriage preferences with
young women wanting to marry young rather than older men who might be better able
to provide a dowry. This trend intensifies pressure on male youth and increases the
potential for men to go into debt to enable marriage (KII 2105).

Another study explores the emergence of the informal economy and its influence
on household economic welfare as well as on the emotional or psychosocial dimen-
sions of well-being (Oka 2011). In numerous interviews, refugees illustrate the extent
to which informal commercial activities and increased consumption foster a sense of
dignity or “normalcy” by enabling them access to and agency over their daily lives in
the camp. Goods purchased through informal market networks enable wider social
engagement, the establishment of social and kinship networks, and the opportunity for
individuals to (re)construct social existence. As one Somali man described,

     “When I invited you to my house, I offered you tea, with milk, sugar, cloves,
     I bought cake, [sweetbread] as I should, you are my guest. I welcomed you as
     I would in Somalia. When I do this, I feel like a Somali man, I feel normal.”
     (Oka 2011)

The study further noted that enhanced feelings of well-being and normalcy have con-
tributed in some measure to the maintenance and sustainability of relief activities that
otherwise fall short of addressing the needs and overarching stability of the camp. This
finding underscores the critical need to investigate or pursue programming for both the
Turkana and refugee populations to improve their economic welfare, their psychosocial
well-being, and notions of dignity (arimatoi/heshima).


Conclusion
Men, women, boys, and girls in the refugee and Turkana communities alike con-
front numerous challenges in their daily lives, which are further compounded by
a range of external stressors, including poverty, climate change, environmental
degradation, political marginalization, poor infrastructure, and limited access to
basic services. The findings that emerge from this analysis emphasize the complexity
166   Appendixes



      of structural dynamics between men and women in Turkana, rooted in “traditional”
      notions of gender, which are actually relatively recent but which are continuously rein-
      forced. Although recent efforts in education outreach have transformed the attitudes
      of many men about legitimate pathways for earning an income or gaining social status,
      this study shows that maintaining herds, either within the household unit at Kakuma or
      with the larger awi, remains the primary pathway for incomes and livelihoods as well as
      communal notions of masculine identity. Livestock herds continue to be seen as central
      to enabling access to marital alliances through a dowry or bridewealth, as a contingency
      investment in the event of environmental or climatic shocks, and as a quick means to
      access cash for socioeconomic needs. The loss of livestock herds continues to detrimen-
      tally affect the economic resilience of communities as well as notions of ng’imeny and
      psychosocial dimensions of health and well-being. Alternate livelihood opportunities
      often lie in interactions with refugee communities, however, many of these opportuni-
      ties are informal, hard to obtain, and involve some form of graft or connections; and
      hence those without capital or connections may not find any access to subsistence
      opportunities. Reliance on refugees for an income further serves to entrench feelings of
      ng’imeny or matharau among the Turkana.

      Turkana women continue to occupy a circumscribed status in the awi-adakar sys-
      tem, and household vulnerability to external shocks is distinctly gendered, with women
      among the most vulnerable to abandonment, displacement, and other forms of struc-
      tural or physical violence. At the same time, diminishing livelihoods have necessitated
      women’s increased participation in and diversification of income-generating activities,
      particularly working in the refugee economy. Subsistence activities include a range of
      low-skill but sometimes intense labor, including collecting firewood, making charcoal,
      building fences, cleaning houses, washing dishes and clothes, and fetching food and
      water. Women participating in income-generating activities within and outside refugee
      communities in Kakuma are regularly exposed to experiences of physical and sexual
      violence as well as forms of emotional and psychological abuse. At the same time,
      women’s engagement with the refugee economy has become increasingly critical to
      household incomes, and women serve as the central economic and social interlocutors
      between refugee and host populations. Again, while a woman’s participation in income-
      generating activities can create a space for her empowerment and agency as she bears
      increasing responsibility for providing for the home, she also risks exposure to varying
      forms of gender-based violence that continue to be a prevalent challenge among both
      refugee and Turkana communities.

Context and Rationale
As a semiarid, desolate environment with poor development outcomes, minimal infra-
structure, and an inadequate state presence, Turkana County has long been one of the
most marginalized areas of Kenya. It is significantly affected by protracted conflict:
from 1997 to 2014, the northwestern subcounties registered the highest rate of fatali-
ties due to violence in the country.19 In 1992, Turkana County began to host refugees,
most of whom were fleeing the war in Sudan. The Kakuma Refugee Camp in northwest
Turkana County subsequently expanded to accommodate people fleeing conflicts and
disasters from 20 different countries in Central and East Africa. Recent crises in Soma-
lia (2010–11) and South Sudan (2013–ongoing) doubled the number of refugees living
in the camp, with the current estimated population to be over 160,000. Interactions
between the refugees and host community have been positive and negative, resulting in
incidents of conflict amid a general, overall coexistence.

This background paper explores the dynamics between the host community in Tur-
kana County and refugees at the Kakuma Refugee Camp; drivers of conflict that can
potentially threaten peace and development; and the possibility of emerging socioeco-
nomic changes, such as devolution and natural resource extraction, to exacerbate such
drivers. The historical marginalization of the host community surrounding the refugee
camp, communal and ethnic violence, and protracted displacement have shaped social
organizations, norms, behaviors, and interactions between refugees and their hosts.
Causes for concern include increasingly frequent and severe acts of violence that may
escalate with the impact of devolution in counties with low institutional capacity and
the discovery of oil and water, which involves an increased presence of external actors,

      such as multinational corporations, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). These
      anticipated development changes have the potential to either aggravate or mitigate
      existing conflicts. They represent opportunities and challenges to social structures and
      norms among host and refugee communities. Sustainable development in the region
      will require effective resilience and peace-building mechanisms.


      Methodology
      This paper builds on an extensive literature review followed by an analysis of qualita-
      tive and quantitative data on demographics, psychosocial concerns, and the perceived
      impact of refugees and hosts on one another. A brief exercise on data disaggregated
      by geographic proximity to the Kakuma Refugee Camp was conducted to determine
      if perceptions and concerns varied based on the respondent’s distance from the camp.
      Qualitative and key informant interviews were carried out with local host community
      and refugees that provided insights into social structures, community organizations
      and institutions, and conflict and violence. This paper examines existing social struc-
      tures and their vulnerability and resilience in relation to drivers of conflict and violence,
      oil and water extraction, and devolution. Additionally, it describes the mechanisms and
      opportunities for coping and the resilience needed to maintain peace as development
      initiatives continue to be carried out in Turkana County.


      The Turkana Host Community
      Turkana County is one of the cradles of humanity, with consistent and recent discover-
      ies showing that the Turkana region has been a center of biological and cultural evolu-
      tion for at least 3.5 million years. Part of the Nilotic pastoral population moving up and
      down the Rift Valley for the past 6,000 years, the Taker people, inclusive of the Turkana,
      have settled in Turkana County for over 1,000 years. Enduring the tests of time and
      hardships, the Turkana people have developed a rich system of traditions, beliefs, prac-
      tices, economies, and sociopolitical structures that define their presence in the region
      and frame their interactions with competing local groups.20

      With 855,399 inhabitants, Turkana County is the second largest county in Kenya.21 It
      is located in the Rift Valley Province, bordered by South Sudan in the north, Uganda
      in the west, and Ethiopia in the northeast. It is among the driest counties in Kenya,

and dryer, and the short rainy season has become longer and wetter. Overall annual
rainfall remains at low levels (HRC 2015). In this way, the desolate, semiarid climate
and unpredictable environment significantly contribute to the instability of the region
and the lifestyles of its population, most of whom predominantly practice nomadic pas-
toralism. The Turkana’s movement is limited to their subareas. The Turkana of Kakuma
follow a path between the plains and the hills, travelling about 200 kilometer (km) per
year within a 70–80 km radius. Only when climate disaster strikes or others push them
out do the Turkana and other pastoral groups make long sustained movements away
from the area (McCabe et al. 1999).

The Turkana, a large ethno-linguistic group, reside in housing settlements that season-
ally disperse and aggregate. These settlements have recently become more sedentary,
resulting in more frequent interactions and engagement with the local community,
civil society organizations, and NGOs. Many organizations aim to improve health and
education in this setting, where development indicators are the poorest in Kenya. For
example, only 15 percent of Turkana residents have a primary level of education, only
2 percent use electricity as their main source of lighting, only 39 percent use improved
sources of water, and no Turkana residents have homes with concrete roofs.22 NGO
intervention efforts aimed at alleviating years of systemic government neglect have
been limited. The Turkana remain one of the most marginalized communities in Kenya,
setting the stage for their interactions with other native and foreign populations such as
the Pokot, the Samburu, the Karamojong, and refugees (Mburu 2002).

Social Groups and Institutions
There are key distinctions between social groups in Turkana society, and the types of
interactions and forms of conflict associated with men, women, and youth differ. Elders
play important roles as initiators and mediators of conflict. As members with their own
herds and families, elders are in positions of traditional power and are often interested
in expanding access to resources, facilitating commercial activities, and promoting
security (Krätli and Swift 1999). They also play a crucial role in tempering conflict
and controlling the behavior of youth participating in violent activities, such as cattle
rustling.

Women engage in important social functions as they provide for families, produce milk
from livestock, care for children, and sometimes engage in trade. Although it is rare
for women to use firearms, it can occur when men are away from home and there is a
need to drive back raiders. In addition, women sing war songs prior to raids, which is

      an important motivator in encouraging youth and men to fight for the sake of building
      and maintaining reputations. Women also have value in informal contexts, as some
      do not fully sever ties to their families after marriage. These connections are useful if
      women are abducted or marry into rival groups, serving as communication channels
      (Krätli and Swift 1999).

      Turkana youth are a dynamic and highly vulnerable social group. Once initiated into
      adulthood around age 18, youth are able to engage in activities such as war, marriage,
      and the accumulation of livestock and wealth. In addition, while being an “elder” was a
      social construction that represented an aggregate of age, political power, and economic
      success, these factors now take on independent significance. For example, young men
      who have great wealth or political authority acquired through traditional or modern
      means can exert similar authority as “elders” (Krätli and Swift 1999). Furthermore, core
      principles among youth change as opportunities for income-generation diversify. With
      this in mind, local development projects can generate modern forms of employment
      and cash income that lead to behavioral changes in youth, creating a space for conflict
      among peers as well as between older and younger generations.

      Other prevalent groups in the region include: (1) civil society organizations and NGOs
      with the potential to drive and mediate conflict through their delivery of aid, especially
      food and basic social services; (2) politicians (Members of Parliament and councilors)
      and administrators (county commissioners, deputy county commissioners, and chiefs)
      through direct involvement or by abstaining from intervening; (3) non-state security
      forces, often hired by the extractive industry to ensure the success of initiatives, which
      have become notorious for abusing and harassing local people; and (4) arms dealers and
      cattle sellers who profit from activities that produce and are fueled by conflict (Krätli
      and Swift 1999).

      Traditional Conflict
      Some conflict has always been a part of the Turkana pastoral lifestyle, but the motivations
      for engaging in conflict have evolved from the traditional ones. Among historical sub-
      sistence pastoralist populations, conflict is primarily manifested in the form of livestock
      raiding, a tradition of “light violence” (Unruh 2005). Often inaccurately believed to be the
      result of resource deprivation (Hendrickson et al. 1996), the Turkana travel along migra-
      tion routes that frequently move them across district boundaries and sometimes across
      country borders in search of water and feed for their herds. In these instances, while they
      compete with other groups for resources in fairly harsh environments, they also develop
      friendships and alliances. These relationships and social networks serve to rebuild herd

                                                                                              173

strength and are key to famine recovery. Raiding is also associated with marriage agree-
ments, rites of passage, wealth, and individual and community social status.

As multidimensional and social events, raids begin with preparatory expeditions
that gather intelligence on the location of livestock and the ammunition and human
resources needed to execute the mission. Elders give the blessing to ensure success,
while women carry out the appropriate rituals (Bollig 2000). Because livestock can
be used as currency for social transactions, raiding is one of the few traditional ways
to increase wealth, especially for youth who seek to garner prestige and earn income
independent of their family. Livestock is also frequently used as a dowry for marriage
and is reportedly a strong motivator among young men (Hendrickson et al. 1998). In
semiarid and desolate areas where economic opportunities are minimal and resulting
assets derived from such opportunities are constantly at risk, social and symbolic capi-
tal is vital to survival (Hendrickson et al. 1996). For a population with limited access to
employment opportunities and basic services, raiding represents an important chance
to rebuild herds, especially following an environmental crisis. Politically, raiding serves
as a medium for maintaining the separate identities of groups that engage in herding
within close proximity to one another (Bollig 2000).

New Forms of Violence and Drivers of Conflict
Following the colonial period, the livestock economy was weakened by pacification of
the region and by increased physical insecurity linked to geopolitical conflict. Preda-
tory raiding, a form of raiding that starkly contrasts with raiding based on balance and
reciprocity, emerged. Based on criminal logic, predatory raiding by outsiders in the
form of cattle rustling has increased in frequency, largely driven by armed militias or
bandit groups in Kenya and surrounding states. The primary goal of these groups is to
acquire mass numbers of cattle to sell in the commercial market (Hendrickson et al.
1998). In addition, weaponry associated with raiding has increased in sophistication,
shifting from spears and machetes to traditional and modern firearms accessed as a
result of nearby conflicts and the regional arms trade (McCabe 1990).

Several concurrent factors drive conflict and violence in Turkana County. First, minimal
or absent state presence and general marginalization of the Turkana people significantly
contribute to increasing conflict and violence. Without the government of Kenya’s sup-
port and administration of core functions at the local level, Turkana County would
lack the capacity to implement initiatives that could be accessed or taken advantage
of by local residents. Security responses, criminal justice institutions involving police
and judicial processes, and job growth with an emphasis on youth employment are key
174   Appendixes



      areas of neglect, which when addressed could be highly beneficial to local residents.
      Land disputes, land grabbing, and communal claims over rangeland also remain major
      underlying causes of conflict.

      Ethnic clashes with regional groups within Kenya, such as the Pokot and Samburu,
      and from other countries, like the Toposa of South Sudan, the Dassenech of Ethio-
      pia, and the Karamojong of Uganda, have increased. The increase is associated with
      interim periods or transition periods between scarcity and abundance (Hendrickson et
      al. 1998) and with pastoralist groups being pushed further toward the borders of their
      countries, resulting in increasing interactions in regions already burdened with high
      levels of conflict. The motives for raiding have also diversified, which is both a cause
      and consequence of exclusion from the market economy due to poor infrastructure and
      mobility as well as the ongoing arms trade in East Africa and the Horn of Africa.

      Refugees and Protracted Displacement
      Kakuma Refugee Camp has experienced a frequent and large influx of refugees as a
      result of its geographical proximity to neighboring states undergoing intensive periods
      of conflict and instability. Currently, according to UNHCR, refugees from South Sudan
      and Somalia represent the majority of refugees in the camp. The increasing population
      and ethnic diversity in the camp are a reflection of the government of Kenya’s policies
      to concentrate refugees at two main sites: Kakuma (Northwest) and Daadab (East).
      Kakuma Refugee Camp comprises four settlements (Camps 1, 2, 3, and 4) and is man-
      aged by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) under the
      jurisdiction of the Department of Refugee Affairs. The government of Kenya is expected
      to gradually assume its full management. There are also ongoing discussions for a new
      camp site in Kalobeyei.

      Since the establishment of Kakuma Refugee Camp in 1992, the refugee population has
      surpassed the number of local inhabitants exponentially. UNHCR estimates that, as of
      September 2016, the camp is host to over 160,000 refugees, whereas as of 2009, the town
      of Kakuma had approximately 36,875 inhabitants.23 Some researchers have pointed out
      that, over the years, the Kakuma Refugee Camp has developed into a town within a
      town, exhibiting key features of urban settings such as high population density, basic
      infrastructure, and nonagricultural activities as the primary means for income genera-
      tion (Ohta 2004; Oka 2011; Agier 2002).

Drivers of Conflict
The ethnic composition of Kakuma Refugee Camp is an important driver of conflict.
Ethnographic studies (Aukot 2003; Newhouse 2015) have documented how tribal ten-
sions shape the political ethos of the camp. For instance, the South Sudanese Dinka-
Bor and the Dinka-Bahr-el-gazal have shifted away from their traditional antagonism
against each other to partner against the Sudanese Nuer in order to gain control over
the Sudanese community. Tensions often triggered by low-level events have escalated
into incidents of violence. Similarly, the historical marginalization of ethnic groups
within their own nations, for example the Somali-Bantu or Barawa, extends into camp
politics by generating continued discrimination and marginalization within the camp.
This microdynamic of tribal divisions also permeates governance within the camp
because members from influential tribes and clans are actively engaged in informal
leadership structures that mediate conflict. Testimonies collected for this study high-
light that leadership positions are rumored to be lucrative because leaders can extract
regular payments from business owners in their blocks or areas.

Another risk factor for violence in the camp is the growing number of unaccompanied
minors and youth ages 14–24 who are unemployed or outside the labor market and
not enrolled in school or vocational training. Despite existing activities targeting youth
and the availability of low-cost education, many refugee youth in Kakuma drop out
of school. This group lacks representation in the larger refugee community. Refugee
leaders, who usually assume a role in conflict resolution, have expressed concern about
reaching out to these marginalized youth, who tend to ignore advice from elders (Som-
mers 2002).

Finally, the psychological and emotional well-being of refugees is critical for mitigating
or exacerbating the daily frustrations of life in Kakuma Refugee Camp. The region’s pro-
tracted insecurity, political instability, and frequent occurrence of drought with resulting
persistent famines frustrate the local population, as the time spent in limbo frustrates
the refugees. There is a high prevalence of individuals spending most of their lives con-
fined to an isolated camp. The situation is even more precarious because vulnerable
populations, such as children and young men, constitute a large share of the refugees
(Økland 2014). Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are increasingly
observed among refugees, especially among new arrivals from South Sudan fleeing the
ongoing conflict there, indicating that poor mental health, if not already a pervasive
issue, may increasingly become one. Some studies reveal epidemic levels of intimate
partner violence and other forms of violence against women and girls as contributors to
poor mental health (Horn 2010).

      Refugee–Host Dynamics and Their Impacts on Social Structures
      and Organizations
      Kakuma Refugee Camp and its surroundings exist in a harsh and arid environment
      coupled with poor infrastructure and limited access to basic services. As nomadic pas-
      toralists, the Turkana host community depends mainly on livestock for survival. With
      their lifestyle weakened by livestock disease, famine, and ethnic clashes with neigh-
      bors—mainly the Pokot and Karamojong—a large presence of refugees in a marginal-
      ized area with a limited presence of state institutions is a critical challenge for both the
      host and refugee communities.

      The presence of a refugee camp affects the host population positively and negatively
      (Jacobsen 2005; Crisp 2000). The impact of refugees varies according to gender, class,
      and the host community’s regional and generational characteristics. Therefore, context-
      specific analysis is needed to determine who benefits, who loses, and why (Whitaker
      1999; Las sailly-Jacob 1993). An important feature of the Kakuma context is that the
      refugees in Kakuma Refugee Camp do not have any type of sociocultural affinities with
      the host community in Turkana, which differs considerably from many camps of recent
      decades located in bordering areas in Africa where refugees had close ethnic and social
      relations with their hosts (Horst 2001). Furthermore, the marginalized and isolated
      condition of Turkana communities circumscribed their sociocultural interactions and
      development opportunities to within their own country.

      The Turkana’s attitude toward the refugee camp has been ambiguous and contradictory
      (Ohta 2004). Since the initial phase of the camp’s establishment, the host community
      was apparently aware of the benefits, mostly economic, from the presence of refugees
      and international humanitarian assistance (Oka 2014; Jansen 2008). However, there
      have also been complaints about the insecurity and environmental damage caused by
      the camp. For example, a restriction on collecting environmental resources has not been
      established, which has enabled violent confrontations between hosts and refugees. As
      a marginalized group in Kenya, the Turkana have actively worked to maintain control
      over environmental resources in the area around the camp, partly through negotiations
      and partly through the use of violence.

      The economic interactions between displaced people and their Turkana hosts have
      multiplied and range from employers and employees, partners in petty trade, and bond-
      friendships arising from the exchange of gifts or marital-like relations. These practices
      have evolved over the years, with local elders playing a key role in using customary law
      to mediate disputes between the Turkana and refugees. In this regard, UNHCR and
      the Department of Refugees Affairs have been instrumental in guiding and advising
       G. Background Paper: Implications of a Changing Social Order and
                                                                                            177

refugees on conflict resolution through traditional leaders. Economic activities have
greatly influenced the interaction between and even interdependence of refugee and
host. Given their pastoralist tradition, many Turkana have entered into contracts with
refugees regarding livestock. In some cases, locals have herded cattle owned by refu-
gees, with refugees acting as brokers between locals and butchers at the camp (Ohta
2005). Certainly, the economic dynamics of the Kakuma Refugee Camp have impacted
local institutions and relationships as many Turkana women, young boys, and girls are
involved in informal and petty-trade activities, ranging from housekeeping, to collect-
ing firewood and charcoal, to selling milk in the camp. This dynamic has changed the
nature of income sources for host households as women and children have become
important providers for their families. Nevertheless, the informal nature of the econ-
omy within and around the camp also negatively affects the conditions of a new and
unprotected labor force.

Similarly, communities have become dependent on the exchange and resale of the aid
rations received by refugees (Keen 1994; Newhouse 2015). Several researchers have
documented how the Kakuma ration resale market operating near food distribution
centers not only shapes the everyday lives of refugees and survival mechanisms, but
also how they coexist with host communities (Oka 2014). Another form of socioeco-
nomic interaction widely examined in ethnographic studies is the bond-friendship—a
customary practice among the Turkana in which two individuals, together with family
members on both sides, establish a close relationship through the exchange of gifts. The
relationship begins with the exchange of small gifts, such as tobacco, and continues with
each party regularly visiting the other’s homestead and the giving of a goat or a sheep,
which is a typical way of extending a cordial reception. Eventually, an interdependent
relationship is built, which is very important for the Turkana (Ohta 2005). Bond-friend-
ships have proliferated between refugees and hosts, creating new ties based on custom-
ary practices. At the same time, economic interactions have influenced local culture,
especially for young Turkana women involved in domestic work and petty trade. Some
have become multilingual, including learning KiSwahili,—a lingua franca—in the camp.

Social relations have been strengthened through intermarriage between the Turkana
and refugees, usually involving a Turkana woman marrying a refugee. While this is
a positive aspect of the complex interactions at Kakuma Refugee Camp, some con-
flicts have arisen related to the emergence of “spontaneous marriages,” or marriages
not grounded in traditional practices in which, following extensive discussion, two
extended families reach an agreement over the dowry of the bride. For some refugees,
there is a reluctance or limited economic capacity to follow traditional dowry rules. To
a certain extent, conflicts are caused by the refugees’ lack of knowledge and acceptance
of local norms as well as their perceptions of living in a temporary status despite the
                              178          Appendixes



                                           fact that most are living in protracted conditions. Therefore, new mechanisms have
                                           emerged to mediate conflicts associated with marriage relations, usually through local
                                           elders and camp officials. Other studies have also mentioned that sexual exploitation
                                           of women and girls has increased due to the presence of refugees and foreigners, with
                                           serious consequences for the social fabric and cultural bonding of the communities
                                           (Mwangi 2012).

                                           New Dynamics between Refugees and Hosts
                                           Quantitative data was collected from the host population, sampled across four loca-
                                           tions: the towns of Kakuma, Lokichoggio, Lorengo, and Lorugum. Kakuma town is
                                           closest in proximity to Kakuma Refugee Camp (4.4 km); Lorugum is the farthest (171
                                           km); and Lorengo and Lokichoggio are in the middle at 25.5 km and 97.6 km, respec-
                                           tively. Disaggregated by proximity to the camp, the data reveal that there are key differ-
                                           ences and similarities among sampled sites with regard to psychosocial concerns and
                                           perceptions of refugee impact.

                                           Many of the positive impacts were observed in relation to economic opportunities and
                                           service delivery (figure G.1.). However, supplemental qualitative data show that eco-
                                           nomic interactions are complex due to their informality and their tendency to override
                                           fundamental Turkana values of balance, reciprocity, and trust. Participants surveyed
                                           in the town of Lorengo, followed by those in Kakuma town, most frequently reported
                                           that the presence of refugees were good for trade. It was also noted, most frequently by
                                           Lorengo and Kakuma town residents, that refugees cheat the local Turkana in trade,
                                           which highlights the complex nature and nuance of everyday economic interactions
                                           between host and refugee communities.

Congruent with the literature, the most common economic interactions are related
to the trade of food aid, youth and female employment in domestic work, and cattle
herding. These interactions are not necessarily negotiated on the basis of reciprocity
and trust (figure G.1). Although the economic dynamics are presumably based on
interdependence, the Turkana tend to be in a more vulnerable and dependent situ-
ation because their economic opportunities from other sources, including extractive
industries, is marginal. The refugee economy represents their main source of income
and service delivery.

Many Turkana, primarily those in Lorengo, feel that refugees rob and indirectly steal
from them through the taking of land and water, by using resources from the Kenyan
government and UNHCR, and by underpricing labor and production. The belief that
refugees receive resources that local Turkana deserve was stronger in Lorugum than
in any other location despite the fact that it is the farthest distance away from Kakuma
Refugee Camp and therefore only minimal daily interaction of its residents with refu-
gees can be assumed. The belief that refugees receive an undeserved amount of services
is most likely based on perceptions rather than reality because for over 20 years, Loru-
gum has been the recipient of sustained agricultural and pastoral development associ-
ated with the Turkwel River Power Project (Oka 2014).

The negative impacts perceived by hosts were more related to sociocultural issues
associated with the presence of refugees (figure G.2). Overall, hosts perceive refugees
as good neighbors, but this seemingly positive relationship includes several contra-
dictions. For example, hosts frequently reported a sense that refugees kill and harass
local Turkana. Other studies show that refugees feel the same about their hosts. In fact,

      there have been many incidents of community violence around the camp over the last
      decade, with small, low-level tensions rapidly escalating into large community and eth-
      nic clashes. For example, a problem related to a cattle transaction between a Turkana
      and a refugee can easily develop into a violent fight. Given the ethnic composition of
      the camp, conflict can be even more complex and build on preexisting rivalries among
      specific groups, such as the Sudanese Dinka and the Somali-Bantu.

      Additional key social impacts are related to sexual exploitation and informal, marriage-
      like relations, which do not align with traditional marriage institutions and associated
      economic relations, such as dowries. These issues affect gender roles because the more
      informal relations undermine the economic function of marriage. In this regard, refu-
      gee–Turkana “marriage” relations are weak, due not only to different sociocultural val-
      ues, but also to ideas of transition and settlement status among refugees. Some refugees
      do not willingly assimilate because of their denial regarding the protracted nature of
      their displacement or because they are forbidden to settle down for fear of losing their
      status as transitory refugees. As many hosts have noted in focus group interviews, “they
      [refugees] are not Turkana, and they didn’t come to stay.”

      Surprisingly, high levels of substance abuse is reported. The increased use of drug and
      alcohol use is an important risk factor for the mental health and psychosocial well-being
      of refugees and hosts. This issue should be examined in further detail, because it is also a
      risk factor for multiple forms of violence, including intimate partner violence. With new
      opportunities for employment and economic growth emerging, potential beneficiaries
      may find it difficult to access or persist in meaningful opportunities if they have poor
      psychosocial health as a direct or indirect result of experiencing drug and alcohol abuse.

      A psychosocial stress analysis in conjunction with nutritional indicators demonstrate
      that the number of listed stress factors are correlated with nutritional status. Hence, the
      almost identically high rates of nutritional status in Kakuma and Lorugum correlate
      with high and low stress indicators, while the similarly low rates of nutritional status
      in Lokichoggio and Lorengo demonstrate a middle range of psychosocial stress factors
      with a smaller standard deviation (figure G.3).

      We interpret this finding to suggest that while the presence of refugees at Kakuma adds
      to the stress of the host community, it also enables improved nutritional access through
      labor and exchange and through development. Lorugum, which has had sustained
      development for over 20 years, has a high rate of nutritional status, but with a lower
      rate of reported stresses and concerns. Interestingly, the overlap of concerns between
      Kakuma and Lorugum seems to be related to issues such as education, the economy,
      and employment opportunities.

The psychosocial stress felt by the Turkana in Lokichoggio and Lorengo is corre-
lated with a middle range of concerns, which includes hunger, drought, and water
for animals. Feelings of resentment toward the government resulting from a sense of
being continually disadvantaged and marginalized (matharau) is usually the primary
concern of host community members. Economically, their key concern is related to
hunger and drought (figure G.2), indicative of the limited resources available for their
survival—directly in the form of food supply and indirectly in the form of livestock
maintenance.

Host communities have historically used conflict tools such as livestock raids to renew
their supply of livestock after loss due to famine, drought, or raiding. With increasingly
available information on climate change, environmental stressors may drive conflict
even further into Turkana as resources such as grazing land and water become scarce.
Although refugees are not involved in this predicament, limitations on supply derived
from pastoralist lifestyles may exacerbate or contribute to low-level tensions associated
with the presence of refugees and could escalate into serious incidents of conflict and
violence.

Other expressed concerns include thirst, underemployment, illness, and lack of medi-
cal facilities. Thirst reflects either a low availability or limited access to a water supply,
including bore wells in and around Kakuma Refugee Camp, which qualitative data sug-
gest is associated with instances of conflict. Concerns about thirst are higher in Kakuma

      town than in any other sampling location. Underemployment was high in Kakuma
      town and Lorugum and present in Lokichoggio and Lorengo. Illness is a key issue in
      Kakuma town, Lokichoggio, and Lorugum, but not in Lorengo.

      Data from Lorengo on the perception of refugees as being good for trade may signify
      that residents of Lorengo are better equipped economically and thus experience illness
      at insignificant levels. Illness was more frequently reported as a concern in Kakuma
      town, but corresponding reports of concerns regarding a lack of medical facilities were
      few; the opposite was true for Lorengo.

      A detailed principal component analysis allows us to disaggregate concerns that vary in
      frequency between locations from ones that were either very rarely reported or ubiqui-
      tously reported. In this way, the analysis offers a quantitative and visual representation
      of the concerns experienced by residents from each location, allowing us to focus only
      on those in the sample that vary significantly.

      Figure G.4, which plots PC01 against PC02, shows a cluster of concerns that are rarely
      or sporadically reported and several others that are more frequently reported. Although
      it may appear that hunger (concern code 30) is an important concern to consider due

to its frequency, it is in fact reported so ubiquitously in each location that it does not
tell us anything meaningful about how the locations vary. Based on this P, the follow-
ing concerns are salient factors to consider (concern codes in parentheses—details in
appendix C): drought (10), general illness (40), illness of children/family (42), illness
of livestock (43), lack of medical facilities (44), unemployment/underemployment (50),
poverty/difficult life (51), lack of school fees (52), and raiding (60).

Figure G.5, which plots PC02 against PC03, draws out important differences between
locations. In this plot, it is important to note that line vectors represent the degree
of association between particular concerns and the various locations in the sample.
Based on the covariances that the principal component analysis reveals, it is possible to
narrow down the concerns further by lumping together concerns that closely co-vary
in both PC01/PC02 and PC02/PC03 plots. Two clusters of concerns fit these criteria:
(1) illness of children/family, illness of livestock, and lack of medical facilities; and
(2) unemployment/underemployment and poverty/hard life. We can refer to the first
cluster as concerns about other-oriented health as opposed to the generalized illness
concern that does not co-vary with this cluster. The second cluster can be classified as
economic hardship concerns. We now have a list of seven concerns that are statistically
meaningful for the analysis:
184   Appendixes

      2.	 Thirst (11)
      3. 	General Illness (40)

      5.	 Economic hardship (50, 51)
      6.	 Lack of school fees (52)
      7.	 Raiding (60)

      Importantly, figure G.5 reveals several key differences between Kakuma and Lorugum
      that do not appear in figure G.4. Economic hardship concerns are most frequently
      reported in Kakuma, as is thirst, but only slightly more frequently than in Lorengo.
      Drought and other health-oriented concerns appear to be most salient in rural Lorengo.
      Lack of school fees and general illness are the primary concerns reported in Lorugum.
      However, illness is also a significant concern in Lokichoggio, and its close proximity to
      the South Sudanese border makes raiding the greatest source of concern at this location.

      Understanding the Narrative of Distrust, Violence, and Uneasy Coexistence
      Beyond quantitative data, qualitative analyses and discussions with the Turkana and
      refugees on perceptions of the other with regard to violence and conflict evokes many
      salient themes. In individual and small group interviews, refugees, primarily from
      Ethiopia and Somalia, report being fearful of the Turkana. Two refugees interviewed
      for this study report the following incidents:

           “Turkana men stole bags, a bicycle, and food. Police arrived on the scene
           after one and a half hours and provided minimal support. Unguarded gates
           and minimal protection have led to organized patrol groups to carry pangas
           [machetes] and stones as defense. Demonstrations by refugees related to the
           lack of protection have further escalated into tensions with the police.

           I live in fear every night that someone will attack, because women are being
           raped. Sometimes people are not injured if no one resists. There is no police
           response, and no arrests are made, going so far as to deny evidence of Turkana
           identity. People are supposed to keep quiet and have no protection, except to
           shout to neighbors, throw stones, and try to keep lights on. No one knows and
           understands their suffering.” (KII 2015)

      In focus groups, refugees reveal that violence is mostly a problem at night. The minimal
      resources available to use for protection and self-defense is a strong concern among
      attacked groups. Some refugees report feeling sympathetic toward the Turkana, while
          G. Background Paper: Implications of a Changing Social Order and
                                                                                                        185
                                    Structures for Peace and Development



others view the Turkana as uncivilized. One refugee, reflecting the views of many, illus-
trates the high incidence of reported theft, both in their homes and in the marketplace.

      “Initially [they] were okay with host community. Killings began in 1994 when
      local Turkana would come into the camp at night to rob refugees. Most vio-
      lence was associated with robbery and looting.” (KII 2015)

Some refugees express a lack of sympathy toward the Turkana despite recognizing their
poverty and paucity of resources. But some refugees hold the opinion that if the rela-
tionships are carefully handled, the Turkana are not “all bad,” and many are “good” for
trading and supplying meat. “We normally hold them like eggs,” says one Ethiopian ref-
ugee about their careful interactions with local Turkana and how they cultivate positive
relationships with their host community. Lastly, the majority of refugees interviewed
recognize that at least to some degree, the camp has helped the Turkana, with a few
suggesting that increases in income and reduction in hunger has resulted in decreased
levels of violence.

Interestingly, the views of the local Turkana were often quite similar. Reflecting on how
the level of conflict easily escalates, one says, “We are afraid of the refugees because they
like fighting. If you hit someone by accident with your bicycle, you might be beaten by
a mob.” Another participant agreed, remarking that, ‘’A small incident will cause a big
fight, but the refugees can also be very good to you because they give us business and
we get cheap stuff at the camp.” Another participant blamed miscommunication as a
frequent cause of conflict, remarking:

      “When conflicts start, they start from misunderstandings on a fight or mur-
      der. That’s how they start. It’s always something small. And there is so much
      ng’imeny, matharau24 that it builds up. Even the refugees have their own sense
      of matharau. So everyone has lots of things to be angry about.” (KII 2015)

Many Turkana hosts recognize that the problem does not lie with refugees but instead
with their ability to access services, such as health and education. One refugee com-
ments on the neglect from the government of Kenya by saying:

      “The main problem is that the host community has been suffering from con-
      flict and neglect by the Nairobi government, so their plight is like that of the
      refugees. But the host community does not enjoy the same access to health
      and education. This causes many problems.” (KII 2015)

24. A sense of resentment and of generally being dismissed that is experienced by many local Turkana.
186   Appendixes



      The issue of minimal food and water and the difference in treatment between refugees
      and host communities is mentioned by a Turkana man: “Mostly there was no problem,
      our people would complain about the lack of food and water because the refugees were
      given for free.” Thirst, an issue that was reported with high frequency in the quantitative
      data, is repeatedly cited as a clear illustration of the government’s neglect of the Turkana
      people:

           “The refugees get water from UNHCR, and use that water to grow their veg-
           etables so they do irrigation and agriculture in their backyard. We have faulty
           pipes, broken pumps, and generators that break often. When I see that the
           refugees are getting water and I am thirsty, it doesn’t feel good. But I don’t
           blame them. I feel bad because I have to pay a huge price for one jerry can of
           water. But many of the refugees are good, you can make friends with them,
           and they will help you.” (KII 2015)

      Others continue to emphasize that systemic neglect by the government of Kenya and
      inequity in receiving resources from the government, UNHCR, and donors are signifi-
      cant factors contributing to matharau. One local host remarked: “How can I think that
      this is my country when as a host, I am begging the refugees for survival? I am a guest
      in my own country, the country belongs to the down-Kenyans.”

      Access to food is another main concern. During an interview, one participant empha-
      sized the fact that “the Turkana people do not like commerce, but hunger speaks,”
      which illustrates both a reluctance and need to interact with refugees. Food represents
      an important advantage for families. Addressing the economic value of food versus
      money, one Turkana claimed:

           “Food is much better than money, because we can keep some to eat, I can
           manage food well, nine bowls of sorghum last week I still have leftovers. But
           100 shillings, it goes like that, very quickly.” (KII 2015)

      Many Turkana participants pointed out that hunger—or just a general need for food—as
      well as periods of conflict or coexistence are strong drivers of interactions with refugees.
      One explained, “Refugees, the people we work for, treat us well. Sometimes, even when
      there is no work, they’ll give us food. Some are good, and some are bad. Some harass
      us a lot.”

Emerging Socioeconomic Changes in Turkana
With experiences of conflict and marginalization that predate the arrival of the camp,
the Turkana have limited access to development resources, including humanitarian aid
and assistance to refugees. However, new development opportunities are emerging in
Turkana County, namely the extraction of oil and water and the devolution of national
government authority, including funding to the local county. If local governments can
manage these new opportunities and transparently provide adequate services, they may
be able to mitigate rising conflicts.

Extractive Industries
As frequently illustrated in the history of modern Africa, extractive industries have a
significant impact on the development of poor nations. Many countries with an abun-
dance of nonrenewable wealth, such as minerals and fuel, experience minimal economic
growth and poor development outcomes. This “resource curse” or “paradox of plenty,”
can be the result of government mismanagement of resources or weak, ineffectual
institutions. Therefore, understanding the role of the extractive industries in Turkana
and the impact they have on the current state of fragility and the devolution process is
essential. In Turkana, extractive industries present a challenge for host communities for
multiple reasons. In many cases, Turkana have noted that while employment in oil and
water extraction is desirable and advertised, it is not easily accessible or beneficial to
local residents. One Turkana remarked on the management of employment opportuni-
ties for Turkana, saying:

     “I feel sorry for the wazungu, who sit in these NGOs. Then they think that we
     are poor because we are not smart, because we are old-fashioned pastoralists.
     But we are smart enough to know when things do not work out because the
     wakubwa (big ones) have consumed any benefits that could come to us.” (KII
     2015)

With the oil industry creating tension among Turkana’s subcounties, there is mounting
concern regarding tenders and jobs, including growing perceptions that employment
opportunities are not benefiting locals as expected in terms of quantity and quality of
jobs. One focus group participant explained:

     “Devolution is a good thing, but only if leaders are not corrupt. We could get
     jobs for the oil companies, construction, but I find it risky. What if I go there,
     to find a job, and they only hire people they know or people who can pay?”
     (FGD 2015)
188   Appendixes



      A constricted job market, which has limited the Turkana to unskilled labor positions
      and prevented them from attaining management roles in processes and programs
      directly affecting them, has generated frustration among local residents:

           “I was there in Lokichoggio at the time. The management of these compa-
           nies—look at the names, from the top to middle or even the clerks. You won’t
           find Turkana there. You’ll find them as watchmen, cleaners, or road marshals.”
           (KII 2015)

      Because the Turkana can only acquire low-level positions, many do not see an oppor-
      tunity to or the benefit of fully transitioning from traditional pastoralism to modern
      forms of employment, as the Kenyan government encourages. An estimated half
      of oil company employees are local to the area, and their participation is mainly in
      unskilled and semiskilled labor activities. This can be explained in part by lagging edu-
      cation indicators and limited citizen participation in negotiations related to resource
      extraction concessions, including jobs, social services, and infrastructure that benefits
      communities.

      Additionally, potential conflict over the extraction of nonrenewable resources may be
      linked to limitations of physical space for herding livestock. With the government’s offi-
      cial announcement of the existence of viable quantities of oil for commercial purposes
      in Turkana, Tullow PLC/Africa Oil in northeast Turkana and CEPSA in south Turkana,
      the main companies operating in the county have stopped exploration and are planning
      extraction. A preliminary analysis of the impact of current oil activities on communi-
      ties (Mkutu and Wandera 2015) reveals that investments or oil installations frequently
      displace pastoralists from important grazing sites, migratory routes, and water sources.
      This development-induced displacement has sparked community violence and reani-
      mated historical rivalries between pastoralist tribes in northern Kenya, particularly
      among the Turkana and the Pokot, which could rapidly evolve from livestock-raiding
      conflicts into a more complex border and land conflict. As one Turkana notes, “the inse-
      curity in South Turkana right now is not because of cattle, it’s because of oil,” illustrating
      that development-induced displacement may be a larger threat than the traditional,
      routine “light-violence” of livestock raiding.

      Similarly, water discoveries not only suggest a wealth of new opportunities for local
      people, but also many challenges requiring sensitive management of the exploitation of
      national resources in order to fulfill the expectations of locals regarding benefit-sharing.
      One local Turkana resident commenting on the importance of water and its vital role
      for employment and well-being, says:

     get enough water, we will be able to do a great job with agriculture. But I
     remember that even though our field was a small field, it was enough to feed
     the family, to welcome the in-laws, and even buy animals.” (KII 2015)

RTI/UNESCO has reported that while the Turkana aquifer water resources could serve
as a water reserve for the national population of 41 million for 70 years, fears are wide-
spread that the newly discovered resources are destined to be removed from the area, as
happened with the Turkwel Dam’s hydropower. These fears are manifest as demonstra-
tions and local unrest, fueled by narratives that the power plant has diverted power to
other parts of Kenya and away from local beneficiaries. The historic marginalization of
Turkana County and its people and their mounting frustration over the lack of response
from local and national authorities with respect to extraction-related revenue allocation
are constant drivers of conflict, and will remain so until effective local management is in
place. Local residents note that misinformation is a big problem:

     “After water, the leaders are the biggest problem. They are the largest con-
     straint on us, even if we get water. Even right now, there is a county budget
     with money for everything, but nothing is happening. There is a lack of infor-
     mation, people don’t know their rights. That is the actual reality.” (FGD 2015)

Building the capacity of institutions in the context of the devolution process should also
focus on addressing potential grievances from distribution of revenue from resources;
which could mitigate against these perceptions.

Devolution
In addition to a dynamic interplay between host and refugee and important challenges
associated with emerging economic opportunities, Kenya’s devolution is one of the most
ambitious institutional reforms in the world, involving political, fiscal, and administra-
tive decentralization (World Bank 2014). The 2010 Constitution of Kenya created 47
counties, each with an elected governor and a county assembly with public finance and
service-delivery mandates. The constitution’s strong emphasis on citizen participation
and transparency is very important for social accountability. The legal framework for
devolution includes multiple provisions requiring national and county governments to
engage citizens in policy making, planning, oversight of public resources, and acces-
sibility of information to the public. The constitution further stipulates a greater role for
parliament and an independent judiciary.

      Kenyan society has embraced devolution as a vehicle for achieving the country’s devel-
      opment objectives, including the delivery of health, urban, and agricultural services. In
      interviews with local residents, one Turkana notes the following:

           “I really want the [government] to help us with agriculture. If I can grow
           enough to feed my children, and also to buy clothes, uniforms, pay fees, then
           I don’t have to go to the camp anymore, don’t have to suffer from ng’imeny
           when I implore the refugees to buy my charcoal because my children are
           starving at home.” (KII 2015)

      While governors have become central actors working to fulfill this promise and have
      carried out multiple initiatives to deliver tangible results, they face serious institutional
      challenges. A lack of coordination and clear division of functions among county and
      national governments is affecting the devolution process, as is the uneven distribu-
      tion of human capacity and financial resources across counties. Additionally, several
      social groups, particularly youth, perceive that devolution as it has been implemented
      so far will only work in counties with effective management, and other counties will lag
      behind (World Bank 2015). Some local Turkana residents mention a lack of account-
      ability and county neglect as key obstacles to successful development programming:

           “Well, devolution does not mean that we get better leaders. Yes, the county
           will have more autonomy, but now with less accountability from the center.”

           “The refugees are far more helpful than our government. When they give us
           food, we wonder why it is that our own government neglects us.” (KII 2015)

      Other express concerns include a lack of participatory mechanisms to ensure engage-
      ment—not only of youth but all citizens—in planning and overseeing resource alloca-
      tion to counties. The development of more inclusive and accountable policy-making
      instruments is critical to sustainable devolution.

      Another important aspect related to decentralization is that historically marginalized
      counties around arid and semiarid areas like Turkana face the greatest opportunity and
      at the same time the lowest institutional capacity to benefit from devolution dividends.
      While the largest per capita transfers correspond to marginalized counties because of
      their low population density and lack of resources, they also have major needs for invest-
      ment, including roads, transport, human development, and resource management.
      Technical support and tailored interventions aimed at improving institutional capacity
      in marginalized counties will therefore be essential in helping these lagging regions take
      advantage of the devolution process and reach average national development levels.

Despite recently garnered authority and funding from the national government, local
institutions are unable to effectively manage county resources, which could trigger an
increase in the frequency and severity of conflicts.

Conflict and violence are critical challenges to devolution in marginalized counties,
several of which are in bordering areas affected by protracted conflict and displace-
ment, such as the Karamojong cluster in Uganda. A 2008 Small Arms Survey in Tur-
kana revealed that nearly half of all respondents had witnessed a violent event in their
lifetime (McEvoy and Murray 2008). According to ACLED data, most fatalities related
to violence in Kenya from 1994–2014 have been registered in the northwestern county
of Turkana (1,233 out of 8,500 nationwide) with a downward trend after 2000.25 The
County Police Authorities (CPAs) created by the National Police Service Act will serve
as an important interface between counties, communities, and the National Police Ser-
vice (Mktutu and Wandera 2014), and they are expected to improve the management of
security services at the local level. However, new forms of violence, including organized
crime, trafficking, and violent extremism, stress formal and traditional institutions of
conflict mediation and community peace-building.

Anecdotal evidence demonstrates that ethnic tensions resulting from competition for
resources, cultural practices, and contested political representation are approaching
crisis levels with devolution, which can partly be explained by the culture of politi-
cal patronage and marginalization within counties. Devolution in Turkana County
has reportedly made people more aware of the historical injustice and marginalization
that their ethnic group has experienced (Mktutu and Wandera 2014). This perception
influences their relations with the national government, constraining the constituency
of emerging multiethnic governance structures. Because this region is host to a large
refugee population, including those at Kakuma Refugee Camp, understanding the
impact of devolution on refugee policies and programs is vital. The Danish Refugee
Council (ReDSS and Samuel Hall 2015) explains the discourse at the county level on
refugees reflects varying views: on one hand, counties want to be engaged in refugee
affairs because they must deal directly with the consequences of hosting refugees. On
the other hand, county authorities feel that refugees are a burden and that the national
government or UNHCR should compensate the county for its responsibility and man-
agement of refugee issues. Discussions regarding the role of local authorities in finding
durable solutions to displacement through territorial development are incipient, and
additional efforts are needed to develop planning and budgeting capacity throughout
the devolution process.

      Local Resilience and Conflict Prevention
      County governments in Kenya are well placed to prevent conflict and violence (Agade
      et al. 2014). They already support initiatives that have demonstrated positive results in
      mediating conflict and interrupting the perpetuation of violent cycles and have estab-
      lished peace committees to address insecurity within and among counties. Similarly,
      peace agreements, such as the Lokiriama Peace Accord signed between the Turkana
      and the Karamojong, are structures that can help counties strengthen coordination
      with the national government. A peace ambassador was recently appointed in Turkana
      to coordinate stakeholders and organize mediation efforts.

      Conflict resolution interventions have been increasingly supported by UNHCR and
      other organizations. Some programs have focused on security, such as the implementa-
      tion of community policing to promote improved dialogue between communities and
      the police and the creation of mobile courts to ensure access to justice and protection
      of refugees. Other actors support the participation of women and youth in leadership
      structures as a way to prevent community violence. There are currently youth groups in
      the camp jointly led by male and female representatives elected under the supervision
      of the Department of Refugee Affairs. In addition, there are youth forums aimed at pro-
      moting peaceful coexistence that include the host community (UNHCR 2015). These
      new constituencies have the potential to lead to more inclusive and intergenerational
      leadership to mediate social tensions and work toward durable solutions to displace-
      ment through community resilience.

      Youth-led peace-building initiatives have recently emerged, particularly “Peace Cara-
      vans”—local programs led by young men and women from pastoralist communities,
      including the Turkana, the Pokot, and the Samburu, who recognize the neglectful state
      presence in northwest Kenya and who seek to resolve violent disputes through com-
      munity dialogue. Youth travel as a cohesive unit to areas of conflict and high tension
      to provide communities with a space to vent their frustrations and search for amicable
      solutions. Their efforts, supported and assisted by the Kenyan government, have con-
      tributed to the cessation of violence between historical rivals (for example, the Pokot in
      Baringo East and the Turkana in Turkana South). These peace-builders have even devel-
      oped partnerships with local elders, women’s groups, community-based organizations,
      and local administrative institutions to implement peace agreements. For example, a
      Turkana member of the Laikipia Peace Caravan helped draft the “13 Commandments”
      for fighting cattle rustling, which were included in a 2010 peace agreement, enabling
      rival communities to share water and pasture resources and reduce conflicts related to
      resource-scarcity.

Conclusion
Extensive literature and data support the notions of Turkana County as a territory that
is extremely marginalized, fragile, and underdeveloped. Poor development outcomes,
minimal infrastructure, and a neglectful state presence are critical challenges that
must be addressed to prevent an increase in the severity and frequency of conflicts
and violence. The protracted nature and large size of the influx of refugees are signifi-
cant aspects of the Turkana landscape, and an understanding of them is vital. Since the
establishment of Kakuma Refugee Camp, the refugee population has exponentially sur-
passed the number of local inhabitants: UNHCR estimates that as of September 2016,
the camp is host to over 160,000 refugees, whereas as of 2009, the town of Kakuma had
approximately 36,875 inhabitants.26

Interactions among the host community and refugees have been positive and negative.
Since the initial phase of the camp’s establishment, the host community was aware of the
mostly economic benefits of the refugee presence, but many complained of insecurity
and environmental damage caused by the massive and continuous influx of refugees.
Data disaggregated by proximity to the camp reveal that there are key differences and
similarities among sample sites in terms of perceptions of the impact of the refugee
presence. Of the Turkana interviewed at four locations—Kakuma, Lorengo, Lokichog-
gio, and Lorugum—41 percent claimed that when entering the camp to trade, they have
experienced a combination of mistreatment, economic malfeasance, and violence at the
hands of refugees. In Kakuma town, adjacent to the refugee camp, 33 percent reported
refugee violence and mistreatment. As distance from the refugee camp increases, the
proportion of people who believe that refugees have a positive impact on Turkana
decreases.

The Turkana do not believe they have been able to fully exploit the economic oppor-
tunities offered by their interactions with refugees, which range from partners in petty
trade to bond-friendships to employers and employees, because of their poor access to
education, limiting them to unskilled labor positions. Feelings of resentment resulting
from an experience of being continually disadvantaged and marginalized—marathu—
are among the most frequent worries faced by the host community. One interviewed
Turkana explains: “How can I think that this is my country when as a host, I am begging
the refugees for survival? I am a guest in my own country, the country belongs to the
down-Kenyans.”

      While the ambitious devolution process is a well-intentioned and promising institu-
      tional change to transform historical marginalization, it is still seen as a distant promise
      in contexts of low capacity for administering and managing recently allocated funds and
      authority. Furthermore, if devolution is not fully developed and if it does not strengthen
      the presence of the state in Turkana County in a transparent and accountable manner,
      the existing marginalization, ethnic divisions, local grievances, and conflicts could be
      exacerbated.

      Tensions between the national and local governments could also impact the contradic-
      tory and dynamic relations between refugee and host because historical marginaliza-
      tion constrains the host community’s access to and participation in benefits from new
      development opportunities. Extractive industries bring with them a potential source of
      conflict that could threaten the stability of the region, especially if local authorities and
      industry vendors lack mechanisms for the transparent, meaningful, and active partici-
      pation of communities in the negotiations and allocation of revenues.27 Land disputes
      and communal claims over rangelands that result from the presence of external com-
      mercial actors also pose threats to social and economic stability.

      Ongoing discussions regarding extending Kakuma Refugee Camp into Kalobeyei is a
      key issue requiring close examination. It is important to strengthen local consultation
      structures in refugee and host communities to ensure participation in the planning and
      development of the new camp, including a clear explanation of the economic and social
      risks and opportunities associated with the protracted nature of displacement and a
      potentially enlarged presence of refugees in the area.

      Drivers of conflict in Turkana County range from host–refugee interactions to the
      changing nature of nomadic pastoralism, and from climate change to interlinked forms
      of violence and protracted conflict in neighboring areas. Opportunities for building
      on dimensions of local resilience include consolidating local institutions, such as tra-
      ditional mediation mechanisms that maximize the role of local leaders among elders,
      youth, and women, and improving the presence of key justice and security institutions.
      A territorial development approach is crucial to ensuring steady economic growth,
      social inclusion, and peace consolidation in Kenya, as well as stability and peace-build-
      ing efforts in the region.




      27. Monitoring the role of vendors will be an important part of preventing future conflict because in the past, they have been
      associated with harassment and abuse of local residents and what is often referred to as the “resource curse.”

Context, Rationale, and Methodology
Turkana County has been hosting refugees from neighboring countries since 1992; its
current population is an estimated at over 160,000—15 percent of the county’s popu-
lation. An increase in the interaction between refugees and their local hosts has led
to positive and negative outcomes, including employment opportunities for the host
community, increased economic opportunities for both, intermarriage, and occasional
confrontations between the communities over land or other issues.

The impact of the presence of a large number of refugees in Turkana is both positive
and negative. Their prolonged stay in the arid area of Kakuma has had many negative
impacts on the local population, especially in terms of increased demand and cost of
firewood and wood-burned charcoal, among other items. However, the Kakuma Refu-
gee Camp has provided a large market for host community commodities and increased
economic opportunities for traders in Kakuma town. The businesses operating in the
refugee camp collectively produce an estimated US$350,000–400,000 in monthly sales
(Oka 2014). Apart from anecdotal evidence, a systematic assessment, disaggregated by
gender and age, of sustainable livelihood opportunities available for local host com-
munities and refugees beyond pastoral livelihoods (for the host community) in farm-,
nonfarm- and skills-based livelihood sectors, including entrepreneurship, has not been

This paper specifically explores the potential positive contributions of the refugees’

      and refugee communities that have emerged from or that are related to the presence of
      the refugee camp and the intersection of refugee and host economies. Zones for inter-
      vention and growth that would benefit both communities are examined.

      This study builds on an extensive literature review, followed by an analysis of data on
      livelihoods currently being pursued by refugee and host community members, disag-
      gregated by gender and age group to discern trends, opportunities, and constraints.
      Qualitative intensive interviews and discussions were carried out with key informants
      comprising local host community and refugee members engaged in agricultural and
      pastoral livelihoods, entrepreneurs, aspirants, and business-owners, and those seeking
      skills-based jobs in the marketplace. The study looks broadly at the range of livelihoods
      being pursued by host and refugee communities, the scale of these activities, contribu-
      tions to household income, constraints to maintain current levels and/or scaling up,
      scope for diversification, understanding of the local refugee camp and regional input
      and output markets, and access to financial services and skills training.


      The Turkana People
      The Turkana people emerged as a distinct ethnic group sometime during the early to
      middle decades of the 19th century. According to history and oral tradition, the “origi-
      nal” Turkana were part of the Ateker language group of the eastern Nilotic linguistic
      family known as the Central Para-nilotes (Lamphear 1992). Oral history suggests that,
      prior to A.D. 1500, the ancestors of the Ateker language group lived somewhere in the
      southern Sudan and most likely subsisted as hunter-gatherers.

      At the beginning of the 18th century, the ancestral Ateker people began a southern
      migration and split into segments that were to form distinct linguistic groups, including
      the Karamajong, the Dodos, and the Toposa. Oral history suggests that a group called
      the Jie seceded from the Karamajong people and that the Turkana then separated from
      the Jie and expanded their territory by establishing themselves in the region near the
      Tarach River in what is now Turkana District. By the beginning of the 19th century,
      Turkana cattle camps began to push down the Tarach in search of new pastures for graz-
      ing their animals. As they moved westward, the Turkana encountered other pastoral
      groups, some of which herded camels (most likely the Rendille and Borana). As the
      Turkana expanded eastward, they began to assimilate and disperse other groups. They
      first pushed to the north and east to Lake Turkana, and then to the south, crossing the
      Turkwel River. They captured large numbers of animals during their expansion, includ-
      ing Boran Zebu cattle and many camels.

They also serve as a powerful reminder to protect the Turkana lifestyle from outside

Turkana perceptions of their origins and ties to their land and lifestyle when planning
interventions and projects.


Livelihoods of the Turkana People
Livelihoods in Turkana are constrained by an arid environment; remoteness from the
capital and other urban, industrialized, or agriculturally rich areas in the south; poor
access to services; and other underlying causes of poverty also experienced elsewhere
in Kenya. In Turkana County, 3 percent of residents with no formal education, 10
percent with a primary education, and 29 percent with a secondary or higher level of
education are working for pay. The incidence of work for pay is highest in Nairobi at
202   Appendixes




      49 percent—20 points above Turkana among those with secondary or higher level of
      education. The rest of the population depends on agropastoralism (20 percent), fishing
      (12 percent) and casual and formal labor (8 percent) in urban and periurban areas
      (FAO 2007). Crop production is carried out along the Kerio and Turkwel Rivers and on
      the arable flood plains; it is rain-fed and irrigated. The main cultivated crops are maize,
      sorghum, beans, and cassava.

      The Turkana practice nomadic pastoralism with livestock, including cattle, goats, cam-
      els, donkeys, and sheep. It is highly gendered activity—men and young boys are primar-
      ily concerned with herding and tending juvenile and adult animals. Women and young
      girls share in the pastoral labor by tending to and raising young animals from birth
      to the time that they can graze with the larger herds. In addition to being a primary
      source of livelihood, livestock constitute a central aspect of Turkana culture and social
      structure, functioning as sources of milk and meat as well as a form of currency for
      bride‐price negotiations and dowries. Grazing land is a critical asset for the Turkana
      people because they are pastoralists. In the Turkana County, the general nature of land
      tenure, as elsewhere among Kenyan pastoral communities, is that land is communally
      owned. Land rights are reserved to communities rather than to individuals, and land is
      an undivided part of the social system in which rightful use is determined by affinity,
      common residence, and social status. In Turkana, land tenure is a mixture of formal,
      customary, and community/group ownership. Formal tenure refers to land allocated
      by the state through a legal title. There is no standard size for formally allocated plots.

      In recent years, communities have had to diversify their livelihood activities to supple-
      ment pastoralism because it is insufficient in meeting the full range of economic and
      social needs. The bulk of this diversification has been undertaken by women who, along
      with helping to raise animals, are invariably trained in horticulture and the gather-
      ing and processing of wild plants and other foods, while continuing their practice in
      agriculture. Other diversification activities undertaken primarily by Turkana women
      include selling fish from Lake Turkana; weaving mats and baskets from the Doum
      Palm; collecting and selling aloe, gum arabic, honey, wild fruits, and firewood; and the
      production and sale of charcoal and alcohol (Watson and van Binsbergen 2008b). There
      is currently an increased emphasis on the processing and sale of skins and hides.

      Pastoralism and Pastoral Livelihoods
      According to Blench (2000), approximately 70 percent of the human population inhab-
      iting Turkana is nomadic or seminomadic and dependent on pastoralist livestock pro-
      duction for their survival. Five species of livestock are managed: cattle, camels, donkeys,
      goats, and sheep. Livestock, especially Zebu (humped) cattle, are very important in
          H. Background Paper: Opportunities for Sustainable Livelihoods                      203




Turkana culture. Their value goes beyond the production of meat: it is based on the full
set of services they supply: milk, meat, blood, and hides; their asset value as a form of
savings used as traditional currency to negotiate for brides and dowry payment; and
their cultural symbolism. Because of this, abandoning pastoralism—even if it becomes
climatically, environmentally, or economically nonviable—would be difficult if not
impossible for the Turkana people (ILRI 2006). Evidence from the field suggests that
the Turkana see pastoralism as their special area of knowledge; assert that they have
weathered various climatic, environmental, and economic crises before; and believe
that their judicious use of pastoralism in conjunction with agriculture and foraged
foods help them mitigate these types of crises.

The traditional strategy of pastoralists is to move to areas with more rain and then
return to traditionally drier areas when the rains arrive there so both pasture and foliage
is renewed. Studies done in the 1980s and 1990s in north and south Turkana County
suggest that the maximum movement of the Turkana ranged between 150–200 km
in a circular route (McCabe et al. 1999). While the Turkana may have ranged further
prior to and since colonialism, several factors continue to severely compromise the
long-distance movement of livestock, such as the establishment of national frontiers,
increased frequency of droughts, growing human and livestock numbers, insecurity,
and encroachment into traditional dry season pasture by agropastoralism. In addi-
tion, the sedentarization, rapid population growth, fragmentation, and privatization
of formerly communally used pastures, the spread of wildlife conservation areas, and
the increasing importance of agriculture are all factors that strain land resources, both
within and across communities.

While the tendency of pastoral households to accumulate livestock has been attrib-
uted to cultural factors or common property tenure arrangements, there is growing
awareness that herd accumulation is a rational self-insurance strategy to follow in an
uncertain production environment (box H.2). Assuming that periodic herd die-offs
are inevitable in this production environment and expected postcrisis herd size is an
increasing function of precrisis herd size, herd accumulation is an effective risk man-
agement strategy that pastoral households follow. Various cross-cultural studies among
pastoralists suggest the presence of an asset (herd size) threshold above which the herd
size is both resilient and robust across multiple crises/disasters, but below which herd
sizes rapidly decline with each disaster (Murphy 2014). Ultimately, larger herds ex ante
provide an effective, albeit costly, means of insuring sufficient herd size ex post (Watson
and van Binsbergen 2008a). The acquisition or addition of livestock occurs through
bridewealth, exchanges, gifts, payments, and begging—an important contributor to
herd buildup in addition to births within the herd (de Vries et al. 2006).

                        rights to access land, resources, and other assets (Omolo 2010).

                        Livestock raiding among northern Kenya’s pastoralists has changed profoundly over the
                        last few decades. Raiding has transformed from a quasi-cultural practice with impor-
                        tant livelihood enhancing functions into a more targeted predatory activity. Predatory
                        raiding occurs on a very large scale, is extremely violent, and is sponsored by actors
                        with criminal motives from outside the pastoral sector (Hendrickson et al. 1998). Tur-
                        kana herders, especially along the northern, western, and southern borders of Turkana
                        County, are at constant risk of being violently dispossessed of their livestock. With their
                        mobility already constrained by generalized insecurity, the impact on livelihoods is dev-
                        astating. According to Grenier (2013), fought with modern weaponry and often with
                        extreme violence, raiding is increasingly enmeshed in politicized claims over adminis-
                        trative boundaries, struggles for exclusive access to land, and attempts to establish or
             H. Background Paper: Opportunities for Sustainable Livelihoods                                            205



safeguard an ethnically homogeneous electoral base. These conflicts are part of Kenya’s
troubled politics of decentralization, and as such they must be viewed in the context of
wider political developments in the country.

Turkana County is characterized by persistent incidents of local-level conflict and vio-
lence. Contestation over dry-season pastures has been a central focus of land-related
disputes among transhumant populations and between villages, sublocations, and
tribes.28 Climate change and a rise in the frequency of droughts have further contrib-
uted to resource-based clashes between communities. The proliferation and availability
of illegal firearms and pervasive sociocultural factors such as the warrior culture of
moranism, in which young people are expected to raid livestock from neighboring com-
munities in order to be qualified for marriage or praise, have further exacerbated violent
conflict (ADB 2009). The actual rituals and behaviors regarding the preparation, prac-
tice, blessing/sanction, and act of raiding, called ngingoroko, are a relatively recent part
of Turkana culture, ideology, and cosmology, but this ritualized system of raiding has
now been subsumed into a larger “cash market-oriented enterprise” (Eaton 2008). Some
recent observations, including the current study, suggest that many of these raiding
excursions are sponsored by members of the local trading community who supply cash
and weapons in return for a cut or commission. Many of these “raided” livestock are
taken over the border and sold in distant markets, a trend seen throughout this region
(Hendrickson et al. 1998; Mulugeta and Hagmann 2008). One woman interviewed for
the study says, “we women always know that there was a raid when we see a lot of cattle
or livestock suddenly in the market.” Field data suggest that some nimuchurus (brokers)
in the livestock market associations are also involved in predatory raiding, serving as
gatekeepers into the markets and getting a commission for their participation.


The Sale of Livestock

The pastoralists of Turkana usually sell animals only when they must in order to meet
urgent households needs, such as food (maize and maize flour), tobacco, bread, medi-
cal and school fees, shoes, or clothing. Most of these cash needs can be covered with
the sale of a few goats or sheep. Larger stock, particularly cattle, is hardly ever sold or
marketed unless there is a dire need for cash. Camels are an important source of milk.
Buying and breeding them is very expensive, and they have a high cultural value, so
pastoralists avoid selling female camels at any cost (Watson and van Binsbergen 2008a).
However, recent famines and droughts have made camel milk a premium commodity.
One old man laments:

28. Other tribal communities include the Didinga, the Jie/Dodoth, and the Toposa from South Sudan; the Nyangatom who
migrate between South Sudan and Ethiopia; and the Dassanech from Ethiopia.
206   Appendixes



           “But one food that has completely disappeared is edodo, dry milk, dry camel
           milk, that was [our] main source of local milk. The Somalis eat the camels, so
           the number of camels has gone down, and there is no edodo anywhere. You
           make edodo by taking camel milk, putting it in a big gourd until it separates,
           and then taking the curdled milk out to boil it. Once the curdled milk has
           boiled down, you put it outside to dry in the sun. Then you put it in a bag.
           When you want to cook, you take the powder, mix it with oil and milk. It
           expands and you eat it. It is very good.” (KII 2015)

      Sheep are occasionally slaughtered at home—mutton is considered a delicacy, employed
      as a “treatment” for human ailments, used for traditional rituals, and given as gifts.
      Sheep have another value: they are stores of fat. One young woman says,

           “If I could get 50 goats, no actually, 25 goats and 25 sheep. Even if drought
           comes and takes half, we still have 25–30 animals to rebuild the herd. Out of
           the 25 goats, I would have 5 male and 20 female goats, and out of 25 sheep, 5
           rams and 20 ewes. The advantage of sheep is that if you slaughter sheep, you
           get a lot of fat that can be rendered and stored, it is used instead of oil, that you
           have to buy, for cooking, eating.” (KII 2015)

      Herders and livestock traders in northern Kenya, including Turkana, operate in unpre-
      dictable circumstances—risk and uncertainty is ubiquitous. Formal contract law to
      protect against business fraud does not exist. Trade is enabled by the existing network
      of relations based on kinship and ethnic values and by local institutions, such as the
      dalaal or middlemen. For the cattle traders of northern Kenya, insecurity is disguised
      in numerous ways and manifests itself in several forms, including ethnic conflicts, high-
      way robbery—also called banditry or shifta—and theft of livestock (Mahmoud 2008).

      Equal access to trading activities is limited because the entire import economy of
      Kakuma is controlled by 5–11 key players with contacts in Nairobi, Kitale, and beyond.
      As a cartel, it can strangle anyone who is not part of the network. The livestock markets
      are also controlled by brokers working together as a cartel inside and outside markets.
      They negotiate with the livestock holders and sellers, but in the market, they only sell
      to each other. While a big goat sells for K Sh 5,000 (US$50), they might only pay K Sh
      200–500 (US$2–5) to the owner—a tenth of the actual price. The same equation would
      be applied to a cow worth K Sh 15,000–20,000 (US$150–200). The small producers and
      pastoralists are always disadvantaged, even if they are aware of the market price because
      they are often selling under duress for items such as medicine or food. Producers are,
          H. Background Paper: Opportunities for Sustainable Livelihoods                       207



however, able to demand better prices if they travel to the Lokangai temporary market
rather than the Kakuma and Lodwar markets because local and outside brokers com-
pete there.

Other Livelihoods
There is anecdotal evidence of pastoralists starting businesses and owing lorries, rental
houses, and hardware stores. Some drive boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis), and a few have
found work in local restaurants in Kakuma town as cooks and cleaners.

Due to low levels of educational achievement, most of the jobs available for locals are
low-skill and low-wage, such as domestic servants, construction workers, watchmen,
drivers, and unskilled laborers. However, because of the poor quality of schools and
teaching, the youth continue to drop out of school at high rates. While this situation is
undesirable, the communities around the camp have more options for both education
and jobs and are likely better off than others in the county (KII 2015). Opportunities
for basic education is very limited for the locals, and as a result, pastoralism remains the
mainstay livelihood and safety net. But government efforts to sustain pastoralism are
inadequate, including poor veterinary services, water points, and security from preda-
tory raiding (KII 2015). In the words of one Turkana local:

     “We have always had cattle, goats, camels, and donkeys. We usually go by best
     number, and try to maintain that number. We sell some, get some, by bride-
     wealth or exchange, to replace. When we know we have to pay bridewealth,
     we try get as many as possible. Now we are more tied to market, we sell more
     and sometimes, now more, we buy calves and small goats.” (KII 2015)

Some families collect small stones from the laga (dried riverbed) for construction,
an extremely time-consuming activity. The stones are usually purchased by Somali
builders.

Livelihoods of Women
Gender-differentiated roles between men and women delineate responsibilities for key
livelihood activities. Men frequently engage in livestock trading, fishing, carpentry,
construction work, long-distance hawking, and the provision of security services. They
take advantage of comparatively more remunerative-waged employment than women
(which often involves labor migration) and sell poles, rent buildings, and own shops
(Watson and van Binsbergen 2008b). Women tend to engage in the petty trade of milk,
208   Appendixes



      porridge (uji), buns (mandazi), and vegetables; collect firewood, thornbushes, wooden
      poles, and wild fruit; process and sell fish, animal skins, charcoal, firewood, alcohol,
      and weaved mats and baskets; and offer their services to fetch water and do house-
      hold chores in the refugee camps. Women bear additional responsibilities for domestic
      tasks, including childbearing and raising, sourcing food, and caring for children and
      the homestead (ADB 2009). Women from areas near Lake Turkana, such as Kalokol, are
      engaged in wholesale fish businesses or sell dried fish fillets to markets in Lodwar; some
      also contract with hotels in Eliye Springs.


      Agriculture

      A large part of the administrative area in Turkana is rural. The dominant activity is
      subsistence farming, which is entirely dependent on the rainy season. Available data
      show that the rains are spread over very few days in the season. Returns on subsistence
      farming are poor due to very low land productivity, insufficient rainfall, poor soil qual-
      ity, and cultural issues. In Turkana, it is mainly the women who grow crops, including
      sorghum, maize, and vegetables, usually near the river. As one woman expressed: “We
      all learned agriculture from our mothers, sisters, aunts—it was like an apprenticeship”
      (KII 2015). Agricultural productivity was better in the past when there was plenty of
      water, plenty of forest, and fertile land. A Turkana woman explained: “When there is
      rain, I can get 12 bags of sorghum, 50 kg each, from 1 acre of land. I sell two out of these
      12 bags in the market” (KII 2015). Traditionally, Turkana women have been agropasto-
      ralists, growing vegetables and sorghum and taking care of calves and baby goats. Some
      women have engaged in livestock rearing, but not pastoralism, including one woman
      in the Turkwel area west of Lodwar who maintained 20 cows, 500 goats, 15 camels, and
      five donkeys.


      Small Ruminants 	

      Local women employ a strategy to increase the size of a herd of goats “by either increas-
      ing the birth of new goats or by reducing the selling of the goats in the markets. Mostly,
      you should try to do both. During the wet season, the goats start giving birth, you have
      at least 10 to 20 animals, females giving birth to three to four small kids” (KII 2015).
      Selling of livestock is seen as a real problem that leads to the slow death of a herd, and
      it takes four to eight years to rebuild a herd (box H.3). In addition to firewood, goats
      represent liquid cash and are often sold during times of famine for food or medicine.
      Goats are usually sold in town through nimuchurus who approach livestock owners
      when they receive reliable information that large animals are being sold, but who let
      owners reach out to them for selling smaller animals.

Charcoal Production and Sale
                                                         Box H.3. The Rise and Fall of Herd Size

locals in Kakuma. The Ethiopians and Somalis buy
charcoal; others buy firewood. Discussions with
women reveal that:

     “Charcoal gives hotter flame and is more expensive but it also takes longer to
     prepare. So there is not that much difference between charcoal and firewood
     in terms of profit. Both are hand-to-mouth businesses, especially for the local
     women-mamas” (KII 2015).

Locals either sell firewood or exchange firewood for maize, cereal, and oil. For example,
firewood is sold in 10–15 sticks per bundle for K Sh 120–150, or it is exchanged for
bowls of maize or cereal, which is preferred, because grains have a higher value than
cash. One basin of charcoal sells for K Sh 150 in the camp and typically one family
carries and sells about two basins of charcoal at K Sh 300 per week and earns about
K Sh 1,200 per month. In place of money, locals are given three bowls of food for one
basin of charcoal, which is worth K Sh 180–200 in the camp and K Sh 200–230 in town.
Charcoal is mostly sold to the Somalis, followed by the Ethiopians.

There has been a recent ban by the government on cutting trees based on environmen-
tal concerns due to large-scale deforestation. However, charcoal and firewood is being
brought from as far as Lopur, 25 km northwest of the camp; Lokang’ai, 25 km to the
east; Namon, 70–80 km to the east; and Letea, 50 km to the west. The charcoal and fire-
wood is transported by boda-bodas or piki-piki (motorcycle taxi), which has impacted
their sale by women.

      Work in Refugee Camps

      According to the local women, the refugee camp is the most reliable way to get cash and
      food. Many local women are engaged in daily labor at the camp, such as washing dishes
      and clothes and carrying food for the refugees during distribution. In exchange for
      carrying around 26 kg of food, women are given 1–2 bowls of food, usually maize and
      (wheat) flour or sorghum, which can be sold for K Sh 100–200 (US$1–2); this option
      is preferred to wages, which would amount to K Sh 50 (US$0.50). Sometimes, women
      are given used clothes as wages. Some women wash clothes for wealthy refugees and
      earn K Sh 200–300 (US$2–3) per month. Many wash dishes, sweep the compounds,
      fetch water for the refugees, and carry food from the distribution centers in the refugee
      camps. Some mend fences: one fence-mending job can take a week to complete and
      fetches an income of K Sh 1,000 (US$10). The building of a new fence, including the
      collection of shrubs for the fence, carting it to the site, and building the fence, fetches an
      income of K Sh 3,000 (US$30).


      Small Business

      The refugee camp offers a market for milk, meat, firewood, and charcoal for the locals;
      it also offers a market for a range of products such as pots and pans, cooking utensils,
      bedsheets, mattresses, and even beds for the locals and Somali business people. Women
      are mostly involved in small businesses focused on food-related products (box H.4).

      The small activities undertaken by women include food kiosks, butcheries, milk kiosks,
      etc. These are considered culturally appropriate income-generating opportunities for
      women—within the culturally accepted roles and functions of women in the Turkana
      community (box H.5). The major constraint women face with expansion of current
      activities or setting up new enterprise relate to lack of micro-finance and credit facilities
      for women centered and oriented micro enterprises; in a context where women cannot
      provide collateral.


      Exploitative Livelihoods

      Poverty is abject among certain sections, and sexual exploitation of women and girls
      for food and money is not uncommon. There are jobs that locals find in the camp that
      are exploitative. Survival sex due to poverty is reported among single women with few
      options to feed their children, and some rape victims who earn a living from commer-
      cial sex. Begging, especially by older men and women, is reported in the camp.

  Box H.4. Profile of a Small Shop Owner
 A small shop owner in the local area sells oil, sugar, charcoal, and other consumable
 items. When she has the money, she uses K Sh 6,000 (US$60) to buy unga (maize
 flour), rice, spaghetti, and sugar from the Ethiopian wholesaler who gives her a good
 price—a kilo of sugar for K Sh 100 (US$1). She then packs these into smaller quanti-
 ties. A kilo of sugar is made into 15 packets each sold at K Sh 15 (US$0.15), providing
 a profit of K Sh 50 (US$0.50) per kilo of sugar sold. A similar approach is adopted for
 oil. Of the products bought, some is used for own consumption and the rest is sold.
 The sourcing of the different products is illustrative of the interconnected nature of
 markets. Typically sold items are sugar, oil, beans, maize, tea leaves, and salt (pur-
 chased from Ethiopians); charcoal (purchased locally); and baby formula, milk pow-
 der, sweets, matches, and other items (purchased in town from Somalis) (KII 2015).

The Children of Kakuma
Although education is purportedly free in Kenya, a major constraint to educating chil-
dren in Kakuma is the inability of many locals to afford the exam fees, uniforms, books,
and food. Another important challenge is the unavailability of schools at the awi, forc-
ing children to move to towns to attend them. Some children find work at the camp in
the afternoon on school days and all day on weekends and holidays, earning around
K Sh 1,500 (US$15) per month and sometimes getting fed. Children who obtain an
education have opportunities such as joining the army, teaching, or working with the
local Catholic diocese, as examples.

                                                         (Avery 2014). This is seen as a real opportunity for the
                       Turkana because the limited availability of water for irrigation has constrained the cul-
                       tivation of land that otherwise has some potential.29 However, there are reports that
                       the water is not fit for human consumption or for agricultural use due to high salinity
                       levels. Locals are very suspicious of the reported results. And the idea that the discovery
                       of water will bring a wealth of new opportunities to the local people may not be realistic
                       because while private property is protected by the Kenyan constitution, water resources
                       are considered national property. In this context and to allay fears among the local Tur-
                       kana, careful management of the water resources is needed to ensure positive impacts

                       29. Intensive irrigation usually results in the accumulation of salt and minerals in the soil, which must be washed away
                       every season, resulting in diminishing returns and ultimately collapse, according to studies about systems reliant on heavy
                       irrigation.
          H. Background Paper: Opportunities for Sustainable Livelihoods                       213



on the local community and a mutually favorable benefit-sharing arrangement. In addi-
tion to the provision of water for irrigation, thorough attention to soil considerations in
Turkana is critical because soil in arid lands is vulnerable to salinization, which destroys
its agricultural potential. Further, while it may be possible to significantly increase the
irrigated areas of Turkana County, massive financial investments would be required to
set-up and maintain the irrigation system. Therefore, the potential for benefits accruing
from the water in the near feature seems remote.

Oil
The main players regarding oil exploration in Turkana are currently Tullow PLC/Africa
Oil and CEPSA. A planned oil pipeline and road network known as the LAPSSET
corridor will traverse Turkana and link Kenya’s coast with South Sudan, Ethiopia, and
Uganda, connecting it with a port at Lamu, Kenya, already under construction. There
is suspicion among the local population that attention is being given to Turkana only
because of the newly discovered oil reserves and that the Turkana people might not
benefit from the oil revenues. Many blame rising insecurity on the oil, especially in
southern Turkana, rather than on pastoralism or cattle raiding. The communal land
that is held in trust for pastoralist communities by the county has been allocated to oil
blocks and investment; and oil installations can displace pastoralists from important
grazing sites and migratory routes. The current operations are probably already restrict-
ing the livelihoods of the local population (Mkutu and Wandera 2015). Apprehension
regarding the loss of water resources and environmental impacts is often voiced.

Most locals are aware of the discovery of oil in the county, but many report high levels
of exclusion: there are no Turkana in management positions for the companies han-
dling the oil exploration contracts. They do not even work as clerks—only as watch-
men, cleaners, and road marshals. Two years ago, hope and enthusiasm were evident
at meetings regarding how the oil would be drilled; how it would be shared; and what
other benefits it would offer to the local population, such as education and jobs. But
the promised benefits have yet to accrue to the Turkana. While Tullow Oil, the agency
contracted for oil exploration, is in place, there is real skepticism on the terms of the
contract and who has and will benefit from the deals. For example, Tullow Oil provided
education scholarships to the Turkana people that were channeled through political
leaders and inequitably distributed. The lack of job opportunities in the industry has
fuelled inter-clan conflicts among the Turkana, particularly as local politicians or elites
secured opportunities for themselves. According to area police records, from January
2012 to April 2015, 14 demonstrations, road blockages, and attacks have occurred in
Lokichar town. In October 2013, violent attacks on the company’s site forced managers
to suspend operations for three weeks and to evacuate non-local staff members. Issues
214   Appendixes



      around oil and gas exploration have inflamed existing cross-border intercommunal
      rivalries and border disputes between the Turkana and the Toposa on the Kenya–South
      Sudan border and the internal Turkana–Pokot border.

      The Petroleum Bill of 2015 contains provisions about a community’s right to informa-
      tion and education and to compensation for displacement, for loss of a revenue source,
      and for environmental damage. It provides for a revenue-sharing formula of 20 percent
      to the county and 5 percent to locals, but the bill has still not passed. The locals who
      understand some of the bill’s provisions are more skeptical about whether or not any of
      the provisions will ever be translated into action or real benefits. The Land Act of 2012
      provides for the designation of community land, such as that collectively owned by
      pastoralists and held in trust by the county. The Community Land Bill of 2015 provides
      detailed and complex steps for communities to register in order to secure their interests,
      but this process might be out of reach to many communities with low literacy rates
      and might benefit well-connected community elites. According to the Land Act, land
      may be forcibly acquired “in accordance with the law, for a public purpose, and upon
      prompt payment of just compensation to the person or persons, in full,” terms which are
      rather vague and which could be easily interpreted to suit the interests of the national
      government and investors. Compensation is not covered in any greater detail in the
      Community Land Bill, raising questions about who should be compensated (Mkutu
      and Wandera 2015).

      Devolution
      The Turkana County Integrated Plan prioritizes economic development programs that
      highlight key links between the refugee economy and aid delivery to potentially inte-
      grate refugee and host communities through sectoral priorities. Since the devolution
      process began in 2015, Turkana County has received the second highest share of the
      government’s budget (after Nairobi); most funds are spent on development projects.
      County authorities planning the economic development of Turkana recognize that
      refugees are an asset and see themselves becoming more active in the management of
      refugee affairs. They generally view refugees as having talents, resources, and connec-
      tions that the county can tap into for its own economic development (ReDSS and Sam-
      uel Hall 2015). Significant resources have improved infrastructure, notably for health
      and education, which the local population recognizes. Some affirm that devolution has
      led to benefits like increased jobs and medical and educational services. Doctors are
      being posted to interior places; schools are being built, including mobile schools to
      serve pastoral and nomadic communities; teachers are being employed, and famine
      relief is being provided under the Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP). Turkana has
      experienced an improvement in health indicators since devolution along with better
              H. Background Paper: Opportunities for Sustainable Livelihoods                215



equipment and functioning hospitals. Before devolution, the immunization rate among
the Turkana was only 47 percent; it is now 72 percent. But everyone is not certain of
the intentions or capacity of the county administration to effectively use the additional
funds that are flowing due to devolution.

Investments
There was a boom in the local rental market and consequently in the construction sec-
tor created by the devolution process in Turkana South and Lodwar, by the discovery
of oil in Lokichar, and by the increased presence of refugees in Kakuma. Local families
earning around K Sh 50,000 per month are able to save more than half that amount,
which is then invested in buying land and building rental homes for outsiders working
for various nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other service providers in the
refugee camp. It is the outsiders who can afford these rental houses.

Local land leasing and home and hotel room prices have reportedly risen rapidly. Some
in the local population have benefited, but the poorer among them cannot afford these
prices. The demand for meat has risen, boosting some pastoralists’ income; others are
abandoning pastoral livelihoods or leaving school in pursuit of new opportunities.
Cultural changes are noted, such as a cash economy over a cattle economy, increased
alcohol consumption, and men and women staying away from their homes to work at
the oil camps (Mkutu and Wandera 2015).

Other investments include cable television, Internet access through smartphones, and
sending children to good schools. Savings are used to buy beads that are used by women
to increase their bridewealth: “a girl with a lot of beads will get more in bridewealth.”
Others buy animals, mainly goats (a good size is 30–50 goats per awi), possibly sheep
(10-15 because of the wool and the rendered fat), and some donkeys.


Refugees at Kakuma Refugee Camp
The Kakuma Refugee Camp, which hosts over 160,000 refugees,30 is one of the largest
refugee camps in Africa. The refugee population is 15 percent of the county’s total pop-
ulation.31 Established in 1992 for Sudanese refugees, the camp is now home to refugees
from about 20 countries, particularly Ethiopians, Rwandans, Burundians, Congolese,
Eritreans, Somalis, and Sudanese, including Darfurians. From an estimated population
of 50,000 at the height of voluntary repatriation in January 2008, the camp population

      rose to over 170,000 by August 2014, with most families spending an average of ten
      years as camp residents.

      The ecosystem of the Kakuma Refugee Camp is described as a place where people
      of different nationalities and ethnic identification who speak multiple languages live
      (Ohta 2005). Their cultural and religious backgrounds also differ. The camp contains

      restaurants, general stores, and butcher and vegetable shops.

      In terms of income generation in the camp, despite the Kenyan government’s policy of
      encampment,32 2 percent of the population has access to in-camp employment as incen-
      tive workers, and 5 percent run their own businesses. Some of the population receives
      remittances from abroad, and 100 percent of the population depends on humanitarian
      aid. There are a number of constraints to the self-reliance of refugees, including limited
      employment opportunities and access to markets. Some refugees arrive with agricul-
      tural knowledge and business experience, among other skills, but lack opportunities
      to utilize their skills for livelihood purposes, contributing to their level of frustration.
      However, a number of vibrant economic and livelihood activities do exist that respond
      to the needs of camp residents.

      As part of this study, all of the stores in Kakuma town and Kakuma Refugee Camp
      were mapped; and in-depth interviews of camp traders and consumers were conducted,
      building on Oka’s previous work (2011, 2014). Kakuma 1 has four markets: Ethiopia,
      Mogadishu, Somalia Back, and Hong Kong; Kakuma 2 has two markets: Phase 1 and
      Phase 2; Kakuma 3 has three markets: Bantu, Darfuri, and New Market; and Kakuma 4,
      the newest section, has one market. Kakuma Refugee Camp has more than 2,150 shops,
      including 14 wholesalers. On the other hand, Kakuma town has 232 shops along the
      main road and in the alleys on either side of the road (figure H.1a–b).

      Buying from local shops on credit or borrowing from friends and neighbors to access
      food and other items is common among refugees. Food borrowed from relatives and
      neighbors is paid back in-kind after receiving rations from the World Food Programme
      (WFP) or in cash to local shopkeepers. Typical Dinka activities include the making
      and sale of beer out of sorghum (chang’ga) and the selling of tobacco. Most refugees


      32. The Kenyan government implements an encampment policy mandating that refugees, once they have completed the
      status determination process, remain in a camp until more durable solutions are developed. This policy subsequently prevents
      refugees from owning cattle, cultivating, moving about freely, working, or integrating with local populations. As such, this
      policy has been criticized for rendering refugees entirely dependent on humanitarian support and for exacerbating divisions
      with local populations.

sell their food rations in the market to buy the goods they need. Refugees of various
nationalities run their own shops, including the Somalis, Ethiopians, and Sudanese who
own eateries; the Oromo who sell meat; and the Congolese, Burundese, and Rwandese
who grow local vegetables in their backyards and sell them.

      Refugee women bear multiple responsibilities. In addition to caring for children,
      cooking, cleaning the house and compound, and washing clothes, women undertake
      income-generating activities, such as cooking and selling food (common within the
      camp) and managing small shops, and assume community roles, such as providing
      counseling services or participating in local politics. Older and younger women prepare
      food and sell it to restaurants and small hotels; some sell the food out of their houses. The
      most common type of food they prepare is the Ethiopian injera, chapati, and maandazi.
      Other income-generating activities include tailoring, domestic cleaning services, and
      fetching and selling firewood. Overall, women seek more diverse income-generating
      activities to supplement camp-provided assistance compared with men. While women
      have found alternative ways to earn incomes, men tend to express the sentiment that “it
      is difficult to find work.”

      Activities undertaken by refugee men include operating small- to medium-sized busi-
      nesses; working as drivers, traders, mechanics, and carpenters; and serving in commu-
      nity roles, such as block leaders and food advisory committee leaders. Some young men
      have jobs as incentive workers at the camp; others provide skilled labor as mechanics,
      electricians, and carpenters. Some young men are involved in the transport business
      as taxi or boda-boda drivers. Older men are more likely to be involved operating a
      grocery, meat, or stationery shop. Business opportunities available to men and women
      at the camp include milk trading; operating a grocery, clothing, or shoe store; running
      a telephone or electronic shop; or operating a restaurant or cafe.

      Movie theaters at the camp play movies and promotion videos of popular singers like
      Michael Jackson. Several restaurants have satellite broadcast dishes where residents can
      watch soccer games taking place across the globe. Business such as copy services, inter-
      national telephones, and international remittance services are open to serve to refugee
      population. Motorbike taxis buzz by on the bustling roads in the camp.


      Retailers of Kakuma
      Retailers in Kakuma operate from established shops and kiosks or, usually seasonally,
      in open air shops. Traders with established structures must obtain a license from the
      county council and pay the same annual fee required of Kenyan traders. The process
      usually takes only a few days. The allocation of space in the market by the market com-
      mittees poses one potential challenge in opening a new business. Open-air retailing is
      usually less regulated than in the established shops and kiosks. With the exception of
      livestock and to a lesser extent cereals and pulses in Kakuma, the role of wholesaling
      in the camp is limited. Most camp retailers are Somalis who benefit from a kin-based
             H. Background Paper: Opportunities for Sustainable Livelihoods                                           219



resource transfer system—the Somali hawala,33 which has roots in the “franco-valuta”
system of the 1980s, in which local middlemen integrated into clan-based patrimonial
networks exchanged foreign currency received from Somalis living abroad for shillings
and delivered funds to their families (Sexsmith 2009).

Retailers at the Kakuma camp get most of their cereal and pulse supplies from large
traders at the camp or wholesalers in Kakuma town. The most significant supply source
outside the camp consists of wholesalers in Kitale. Meru and Kikuyu merchants bring
fresh produce in from Kitale, the central source for fruits and vegetables. Wholesalers
located in Kakuma town are a secondary source for produce, especially if road condi-
tions challenge the main supply from Kitale. Fruits and vegetables are often sold in
shops, kiosks, and in open-air shops. The number of traders fluctuates according to
the seasonal availability of certain produce and supply problems due to transport con-
straints during the rainy season.

There are several supply arrangements working in the camp: (1) producers sell directly
to consumers in the camp; (2) retailers buy from producers in the outskirts of the town
or camp and sell to consumers; (3) transporters serving as middlemen travel to nearby
producing villages to collect milk and then either sell it directly to consumers or to
open air retailers at the camp— the only form of wholesale trading in the milk market;
and (4) women from the producing villages organize transport and make arrangements
with retailers at the camp to receive the produce, with payments being made through
the transporters (WFP 2014).

Milk is sold at the camp and in town exclusively by female open-air retailers who do
not sell any other products. The number of open-air retailers decreases during the dry
season. In Kakuma, eggs are most commonly supplied from traders in Kitale to whole-
salers in Kakuma town who subsequently source retailers in the camp; to a much lesser
extent, they are also supplied by large-scale traders to retailers at the camp. They are
sold in shops and kiosks as well as in open-air outlets by traders selling nothing else,
except possibly packaged milk. Eggs are sometimes found in kiosks selling fruits and
vegetables. The number of traders decreases during the rainy season. Fish is consumed
mostly in its dry variety at the Kakuma camp. It is supplied to wholesalers and retailers
in Kakuma town from Lake Turkana through Kalokol and from Lake Victoria through
Kisumu and Kitale. Retailers in the camp get their supplies from the wholesalers in
town. Fish is mostly sold in shops; kiosks; and, to a lesser extent, open air markets. The

including the Lebanese, the Yemeni, the Sindhi, the Gujarati, the Marwari, the Bohri, the Khoja, and the Chinese.

      already significant number of retailers operating in the market increases during the dry
      season (WFP 2014).

      According to WFP (2014), key informants report that an important constraint to trade
      is the road conditions and associated high transport costs, especially between Kitale
      and Lodwar, but also between Kakuma town and the camp. Local traders and wholesal-
      ers use the Turkwel road via Lorugum into Uganda when the Kitale-Lodwar road is
      blocked. The wholesaler networks are affected when a seasonal river (laga) between
      Kakuma town and Kakuma 3 floods during the rainy season and transport is halted for
      one or two days, particularly affecting deliveries of perishable products. Other difficul-
      ties include refugee traders having to obtain travel permits to make purchases outside
      Kakuma (placing them at the mercy of the wholesalers). The movement restrictions are
      mentioned as an important trade deterrent. Other reported constraints to trade include
      a lack of trucks, poor access to credit, insecurity on the roads and at the camp, and high
      government taxes.


      Host–Refugee Community Interactions
      Interactions and economic activities between the refugee and host communities are
      expanding. Economic activities within Kakuma Refugee Camp and Kakuma town can
      be divided into eight categories (adapted from Oka 2011):

      n	   Formal relief redistribution. Food and other relief goods.

      n	   Formal commerce. Wholesale and retail traders supply goods and services to Tur-
           kana residents and to relief workers and agencies in Kakuma.

      n	   Formal-informal commerce. Wholesale traders supply goods and services to refu-
           gee wholesalers and retailers within Kakuma Refugee Camp.

      n	   Formal and informal banking and remittances. Four banks as well as mobile money
           systems enable cash and credit to be transferred from relatives outside Kakuma to
           the refugees.

      n	   Formal and informal employment. Refugees seek employment with relief agencies
           or the traders in Kakuma.
            H. Background Paper: Opportunities for Sustainable Livelihoods                   221



n	   Informal overt commerce. Refugee wholesalers and retailers supply goods and ser-
     vices to refugee consumers within Kakuma Refugee Camp.

n	   Informal relief commerce. Refugees sell portions of relief food packages to black
     market traders.

n	   Informal covert commerce. Various actors are involved in the flow of drugs, weap-
     ons, and other extra-legal or illicit activities within Kakuma town and Kakuma Refu-
     gee Camp.

The refugee camp provides a market for livestock, fish, firewood, and charcoal for host
community traders. Refugee and host communities trade food items and other com-
modities with one another. Remittances from family members and friends of refugees,
including former refugees who have resettled in countries such as the United States,
Canada, Australia, and Europe, increase the purchasing power of refugees in the camp
and create a market for local businesses (Oka 2011, 2014). The camp acts as an impor-
tant link between the refugee and the host population, with refugee traders providing
a connection between the refugee camp economy and wider national and international
markets. These links provide refugees with trading opportunities and exchanges with
Kenyan producers and traders from the vicinity or from distant supply locations.

To a great extent, Kakuma’s economy has been defined by the refugee economy, which
has also contributed to the development of local economic architecture (ReDSS and
Hall 2015) through:

n	   Well-established economic networks. Strong business networks, predominantly
     run by Somali and to a lesser extent Ethiopian traders, recruit employees from within
     the camp and from their extended kin networks. They manage the flow of capital and
     credit within and between subcamps by offering small-scale retail credit for banking
     and remittances services.

n	   Remittance economy/bringing cash to the local economy. Four banks within the
     Somali trader network have been identified through which remittance transfers are
     conducted, including Dahabshil, Amel, Dalson, and Iftin.

n	   Black market and relief traders. The black market in Kakuma provides a mean
     for refugees to gain cash by selling their own goods and buying other goods and
     services.
222   Appendixes



      n	   Taxation and licensing issues. The deputy at the Department of Trade and Tourism
           confirmed that refugees are given licenses each year. Department officers provide
           this service in the camp as refugees cannot leave Kakuma. It is estimated that refu-
           gees in Kakuma contribute around K Sh 1.1 million in taxes per year.

      n	   A market for host community businesses. According to market assessments con-
           ducted by the World Food Programme (WFP), refugees spend an average of 60–70
           percent of their disposable income on food and nonfood items provided by refugee
           and host community businesses.

      n	   Major source of employment for the local community. The presence of the refugee
           camp is also a major source of employment for the local community—from menial
           jobs provided by cleaners and housekeepers to local contractors who undertake con-
           struction of refugee facilities in the camp.

      n	   Purchase of livestock. Because of the high demand in Kakuma, livestock prices are
           higher there than in other parts of Turkana.

      Benefits from the Camp
      Refugee camp markets are used by the refugee and host communities alike. Most of the
      customers are refugees from the same or nearby subcamps, followed by members of
      the host community from nearby villages. The access to food from the refugee camp is
      reflected in nutritional data based on skinfold measurements (figure H.2.) that suggest
      that the host community of Kakuma has better nutritional access and status than that
      of Lokichoggio or Lorengo and similar access and status to that at Lorogum, which has
      benefitted from consistent development investments for over 20 years.

      For the most part, refugees shop at camp markets, but if commodities are unavailable
      there, they sometimes resort to the town market. Host community members make
      some of their purchases at the camp despite its distance from town because prices are
      lower. The price differential is attributed to the fact that most services are provided for
      free at the camp, which serves as a subsidy for retail businesses. Most of the traders in
      the camp are refugees, but the camp is not closed to local traders, and a limited number
      do operate there.

      However, the local community is emphatic that a closure of the camp would take with
      it most income sources and that the Kakuma town survives only because of the camp.
      Kakuma did exist as a town before the camp, and it is widely acknowledged that the
                      H. Background Paper: Opportunities for Sustainable Livelihoods                            223



camp has played a major role in the lives of the local people in terms of jobs and liveli-
hoods. The presence of the camp has definitely brought in more trade, and the local
population has benefited from the relatively lower prices at the camp shops. Those who
work in refugee (predominantly Somali) households, are able to access small amounts
of credit when needed.

      Goods in Kakuma town are less expensive than in Lodwar, and even less expensive in
      the refugee camp.

           “People prefer to come to camp to buy goods because it is cheaper, sometimes
           even 30 to 40 shillings cheaper than in town.”

           “The shoes I bought in camp, just cost me 1000 shillings. In town, in Kakuma
           town, they will go for 2,000. I can get a kilogram of rice in camp for 90–100
           shillings, but in town it will be 120 shillings. I make a profit of 20 shillings.”
           (KII 2015)

      The products available in the camp include solar panels at K Sh 7,500 as opposed to K
      Sh 9,000 in the town.

      Uneasy Relations
      There is an uneasy relationship between refugees and the local population. The sale of
      food by refugees in places where local people are begging for food is often cited as a
      source of ire among the Turkana. Mistreatment of refugees by locals is reported, such
      as when the local “mamas” (older Turkana women) who sell charcoal (makaa) at the
      camp compound are not compensated and are sometimes even beaten when asking for
      money—especially common when a large amount is owed. As one informant described:
      “While beatings are not too much, the refusal to pay is common” (KII 2015). Some local
      women are involved in survival sex and are at risk of physical and sexual violence.

      Camp officials can stop a local person from selling firewood and charcoal in the camp,
      but with the payment of a bribe—sometimes as small as 50 shillings—the official often
      allows the local person to sell their products. But this level of bribe would constitute an
      entire day’s profit for a “mama” or mzee (old man)—an enormous challenge that holds
      the locals back. By paying a bribe and cornering the market, the brokers are draining
      local livelihoods.

      There is disappointment among the host community regarding the limited opportu-
      nities offered by the camp in terms of jobs. The Turkana people who have low levels
      of education, status, and wealth and who are largely neglected by the government are
      only hired for menial jobs at the camp, such as watchmen and cleaners. Many have
      started businesses, combining nomadism and business. They interact with the market
      by selling goats and buying food. The constant struggle for basic services, food, and jobs
      contributes to the high stress levels among the Turkana. Although the presence of the
      camp has ensured the Turkana access to food, it is also a psychosocial stressor. Kakuma

 Conclusion
 The Turkana, a predominantly pastoral community, has witnessed transformation in
 livelihoods as well as economic organizations due to years of conflict and drought,
 and with the pastoral system being augmented over the years by agriculture, hunting,
 gathering, processing wild fruit, and fishing. The loss of cattle and other livestock has
 also redefined the role of women. While pastoralism continues to define the social and
 cultural identity for Turkana men, and cattle remain the go-to option to meet urgent
 household needs such as food (maize and maize flour), tobacco, bread, medical and
 school fees, shoes, and clothing.

 The Kakuma refugee camp offers alternate opportunities for employment and wage
 earning for both Turkana men and women. Low-end jobs for men include working
 as domestic servants, construction workers, watchmen, drivers, and unskilled labor;
226   Appendixes



      women are engaged in collecting firewood and burning charcoal, as well as providing
      daily labor in the camp, such as washing dishes and clothes and carrying distributed
      food for the refugees. There is anecdotal evidence about Turkana starting many small
      and some large businesses, but for the most part, they find it difficult to challenge
      the established cartels with better access to capital and networks. The entire import
      economy of Kakuma is thought to be controlled by 5–11 key players with contacts in
      Nairobi, Kitale, and beyond.

      A major constraint to accessing better jobs for the Turkana, especially those emerging
      from the discovery of oil and water or the process of devolution, is poor educational
      levels. However, the opportunities for basic education remain limited due to the poor
      quality schools and teaching in local public schools and high costs of exam fees, uni-
      forms, books, and food. It is not uncommon for Turkana children to find work in the
      camp, mainly fetching water, cooking, sweeping, cleaning, washing clothes, fetching
      water, and cleaning dishes.

      The refugee camp remains the major economic mainstay for the Turkana in Kakuma.
      Locals remain emphatic that the closure of camp could jeopardize most income sources
      and means of survival. However, concerted efforts are needed by the county authorities,
      development agencies, and nongovernmental organizations to ensure that:

      n	   Educational opportunities are enhanced for Turkana children by improving the
           quality of schools and teaching and, importantly, by making them both accessible
           and affordable for the locals. Culturally and socially appropriate options will need to
           be explored given the predominantly pastoral and dispersed population.

      n	   Youth need support with tailored programs for enhancing their technical skills along
           with training for life skills and basic and financial literacy so that they will be better
           equipped to seek employment in emergent areas.

      n	   Women’s livelihoods need to be supported, including improved access to input and
           output markets for agricultural and allied activities, as well as support, including
           capital and entrepreneurial training and inputs for establishing viable enterprises to
           augment family incomes.

      n	   Pastoral livelihoods remain central to the identity of Turkana men. Better support
           services, including veterinary care, are critical to enhancing resilience among the
           pastoralists. Support for livelihood diversification is also essential.

Introduction
Established in 1992 in the marginalized county of Turkana in northwestern Kenya,
Kakuma Refugee Camp is the epitome of a protracted displacement situation (Crisp
2002). Yet a closer look at the interactions between refugees and the host community
surrounding the camp brings to light a range of dynamic economic interactions that
point to an ironic situation where the host community has grown increasingly depen-
dent on the camp for its own survival.

Increasingly, the literature acknowledges the need to go beyond a representation of
refugees as a passive group lacking economic agency (see for example, Betts et al. 2014),
and Kakuma stands out as a particularly interesting case study. The common views of
a refugee camp as economically isolated or as an economic burden to the host commu-
nity do not explain the complexity of impacts that a vibrant community of more than
160,000 people34 has had on its surrounding environment for the past 24 years.

Kakuma Refugee Camp was originally established for the Sudanese fleeing the conflict
in their own neighboring country. It was set up very close to the town of Kakuma and
has experienced succeeding influxes of refugees, including the arrival of Ethiopian refu-
gees in 1994–95 and a significant group of Somalis from 1997 onward (Oka 2011: 229).
The area has witnessed back-and-forth movements among Sudanese and South Suda-
nese refugees following the chaotic evolution of the newly formed country. A recent
example was in the spring and summer of 2014, when violence in South Sudan brought
a sudden influx of about 40,000 South Sudanese refugees to Kakuma (UNHCR and
WFP 2014: 29). The population of the camp has fluctuated, including a low in January
2008 of only 30,000 refugees (Oka 2011: 229). According to the latest data from the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the current population at
the camp is over 160,000. Two communities dominate in terms of their numbers: South

      Sudanese, comprising about half the population (50.1 percent), and Somalis, compris-
      ing 30.3 percent.35

      The World Bank’s social impact analysis, which includes this background paper, was
      designed to unpack the nuanced impacts of the refugee presence and provide recom-
      mendations to policy makers and developmental and relief agencies about how to foster
      positive socioeconomic interactions between the refugee and host communities. The
      objective is to go beyond the humanitarian canvas that currently frames interventions,
      including taking stock of the main factors that limit the socioeconomic development
      of Kakuma and its surroundings to assess what might be holding it back. This analysis
      seeks to verify a series of factors—some structural and related to the county’s history
      of marginalization, and some more directly related to the nature of the relationship
      between the refugees and hosts—that limit socioeconomic opportunities in Kakuma.
      These factors are reviewed based on qualitative and quantitative data collected dur-
      ing May–June 2015 for this research in addition to the existing literature. The data
      set includes a range of in-depth interviews and focus group discussions conducted
      with refugees and members of the surrounding host community in Kakuma, Lodwar,
      Lorogum, and Lokichoggio in Turkana County. The study also relies on quantitative
      data from a psychosocial stress and health survey of the host community surrounding
      the refugee camp.


      Structural Factors Shaping the Social Economy of Kakuma
      The story of the refugees at Kakuma and—perhaps even more—of the Turkana whose
      community surrounds the camp is of hardship and survival, including severe food inse-
      curity, irregular incomes, fragile livelihoods, and various forms of intra- and intercom-
      munal violence. These sentiments were clearly expressed during in-depth interviews
      conducted with members of these communities.

      Aridity, Drought, and Survival
      Several structural factors are important to consider when looking at the current socio-
      economic dynamics at play in Kakuma and in the county of Turkana more broadly. The
      county is located in an arid and semiarid area of Kenya, characterized by rainfall levels of
      200–500 millimeters per year, irregular rain patterns, and frequent droughts (IFAD 2000).

      Reid and Ellis (1995) showed that Turkana County experienced multiyear droughts
      every five years on average. Episodes of multiyear drought are particularly lethal for
      livestock, which can usually only survive a one-year drought. Many of the Turkana

interviewed for the present study have vivid memories of severe droughts over the past
decades that decimated their herds and brought them to the verge of famine. In an
environment mostly unfit for cultivation due to its short growing periods, local Tur-
kana communities are composed of pastoralist tribes that rely on mobility to ensure
that their livestock can access grazing lands during dry seasons. Most studies estimate
that approximately 70 percent of the Turkana population is nomadic or seminomadic
(Watson and van Binsbergen 2008). As Hendrickson et al. notes:

       “The Turkana, like the majority of pastoralists in Africa, have traditionally led
       a lifestyle geared towards subsistence. Though precarious at the best of times,
       it is well suited to the harsh, dryland environment they inhabit. Drought and
       famine are constant hazards….” (Hendrickson et al. 1996: 18)

While the Turkana pastoralist lifestyle has always been vulnerable to severe weather
variations, a common theme emerges from the literature and interviews about the envi-
ronment becoming increasingly harsh over the last few decades due to more frequent
droughts and decreasing average rainfall levels. Issues surrounding the direct impacts
of climate change on an environment like Turkana are extremely complex and require
nuanced assessment, but several trends that directly impact the county’s environment
are worth noting because they will make it more difficult for the population to sustain-
ably adjust:

n	   Increase in the county’s population. The population of the county has significantly
     increased over the past decade, and county authorities estimate that the current
     annual growth rate is 6.4 percent, according to a recent Human Rights Watch report
     (HRW 2015: 49). There are currently more than 1.2 million inhabitants in the county,
     a significant increase from the 165,000 population reported in 1969 (Hendrickson et
     al. 1996). The density of the county’s population is still quite low, but its growth has
     put pressure on the county’s very limited resources and has degraded the environ-
     ment, further threatening the sustainability of pastoralist livelihoods.

n	   Land degradation and concentration of livestock:

          “Unsustainable human activities in already fragile areas of northern
          Kenyan [arid and semiarid areas] have aggravated the conditions arising
          from natural disturbance such as drought or flooding leading to land deg-
          radation and desertification. … In Kenya, 78 percent of the land is threat-
          ened by desertification.” (Pragya n.d.: 33)
232   Appendixes



      	 The increase in the population and the high levels of violence among pastoralists,
        including the practice of cattle raiding, have led to a contraction in the amount of
        grazing land accessible to Turkana tribes. The violence has also led to a degrada-
        tion of traditional grazing lands and water points in areas no longer in use due to
        insecurity. At the same time, the concentration of livestock in safe areas has caused
        ecological degradation there (Pragya n.d.: 10).

      n	   Development projects impacting Lake Turkana on the Ethiopian side of the Omo
           River. As Avery studies in detail, the hydrological consequences of the man-made
           projects up the Omo River, which feeds Lake Turkana, are significant. The researcher
           estimates the current project will “require over 30 per cent of the Omo flow as a
           minimum … the potential reduction of inflow to Lake Turkana is therefore huge,
           and far greater than previously reported” (Avery 2013: 34).

      Furthermore, the Turkana’s pastoralist lifestyle has been challenged for decades by
      conflict, intertribal violence, and cattle raiding, which have decreased their capacity
      to adjust to drought (Avery 2013: 18). Several authors note that cattle raiding evolved
      from a cultural practice to a more predatory form, characterized by increased levels of
      violence and criminal activity. This change has further destabilized the traditional life-
      style of the Turkana who, as their mobility was increasingly constrained, experienced a
      significant impact on their livelihoods (see for example, Hendrickson et al. 1998).

      Aridity makes agricultural production difficult and irrigation necessary in the county.
      And Turkana men do not consider it proper to engage in agriculture, posing a cultural
      barrier to the practice. Turkana women, on the other hand, show a refined knowledge of
      their environment. Skills are passed from one generation of women to the next, and agri-
      cultural products provide a welcome additional income or in-kind revenue for Turkana
      families. All of the female respondents interviewed on the subject noted that the absence
      of water and aridity were the main obstacles to increasing their production capability.

      The combined impact of land degradation, insecurity, and repeated droughts leaves
      Turkana pastoralist populations on the very edge of survival. The living conditions in
      this difficult environment have been further complicated by decades of political mar-
      ginalization by national authorities.

      The County’s Historical Marginalization
      To understand the current situation of Kakuma, it is critical to appreciate Turkana
      County’s history of marginalization. The county has long been neglected by the Kenyan
      government, which considers it to be remote and backward due to its pastoralist
     I. Background Paper: Socioeconomic Mapping and Analysis of Kakuma                         233



traditions. Most interactions between the Turkana and the state have involved efforts
that clash with the pastoralist lifestyle. Two vivid examples in the collective memory of
the Turkana are the campaign of forced schooling for children and the general disar-
mament of Turkana tribes. The opposition to pastoralism by the government persists:
authorities consider pastoralism to be an obstacle to development. Interviews with
authorities conducted for a study on the impact of the devolution process on Kakuma
illustrate the point:

      “Pastoralist lifestyle is a challenge: trying to improve the lifestyle of pastoralists
      is very difficult as they keep migrating. Trying to improve services for them is
      very difficult.”— Ministry of Devolution and Planning (Samuel Hall 2015: 18)

General neglect by the central government has seriously impacted Turkana’s develop-
ment. First, it has translated into very poor infrastructure:

      “Mandated support for such essential infrastructure as holding grounds,
      watering facilities, roads … is Spartan, if not completely absent. For example,
      the only good road in Turkana is the one between Lodwar and Lokichoggio.”
      (Watson and van Binsbergen 2008)

The ongoing devolution process should help advance development in the county, but
significant efforts will be needed to fill the development gap that decades of neglect
produced. Access to basic public services, including health, education, and road infra-
structure is quite poor among the Turkana; and the level of education in the county is
low. According to the Kenyan National Board of Statistics, “only 3 percent of Turkana
County residents have a secondary education … as many as 82 percent of Turkana
County residents have no formal education.” (KNBS 2013). Another study focused on
analyzing the socioeconomic context of areas surrounding Lake Turkana noted: “the
average distance to a health facility in Northern Kenya is 52 kilometers, compared to a
national norm of 5 km” (quoted by Avery 2012: 85).

It is not surprising that, according to the government of Kenya, Turkana is the least
developed of all Kenyan counties. Based on 2005–06 national statistics, 92.9 percent
of the Turkana population is considered poor, a striking figure when compared to the
then-national poverty rate of 46.6 percent.36 The marginalized situation of the county
population compared to the rest of Kenya remains troubling: the Human Poverty Index
of Turkana is 0.613 compared with a national average of 0.291 (Samuel Hall 2015: 36).

      This low level of development and the harsh environment have very clear consequences
      on the malnutrition levels of a population always on the edge of survival. A psychoso-
      cial and health survey conducted among the Turkana population found that a majority
      was underweight, with a body mass index BMI of less than 18.5, and that 24 percent
      of the respondents suffered from moderate or acute malnutrition (BMI < 17). While
      this survey did not include children, past studies found that malnutrition was com-
      mon among Turkana children as well.37 Malnutrition has a proven long-term effect on
      development. As noted by the World Bank,

            “... the effect of under-nutrition on young children (ages 0–8) can be devas-
            tating and enduring. It can impede behavioral and cognitive development,
            educability and reproductive health, thereby undermining future work pro-
            ductivity.” (World Bank 2015)

      Local Governance
      The incapacity of local authorities to respond to the needs of the Turkana population
      is both a cause and consequence of the county’s history of marginalization. A general
      feeling of defiance among the Turkana toward the national authorities in Nairobi and
      toward their own local leaders was palpable during the qualitative interviews conducted
      for this assessment:

            “People who need shelter should be received as guests, and I am glad that the
            UNHCR is doing things for them, but we are angry at our government, local
            leaders, and the big politicians in Nairobi, who treat us like garbage and have
            not paid any attention to us.”
                                 —Teacher and member of the Turkana community (KII 2015)

      This quote captures a general and somewhat common sense of frustration toward local
      and national elites, but qualitative data confirm that this feeling is deeply grounded and
      born out of the daily experience of Turkana communities. For example, water manage-
      ment is a key issue for the host community, whose members pool money to pay for the
      maintenance of its water pumps, but local dysfunction directly impact their lives and
      subsistence: “We have to pay 300 shillings per month for maintenance. We always pay
      to a committee but the committee, they eat the money. The pumps only last two years
      and then they get damaged.” (KII 2015)

Kakuma’s Economy and the Impact of the Camp on Turkana Communities

In this context of historical marginalization, the establishment of the Kakuma Refugee
Camp—ironically represented a lifeline that many in the Turkana community were
ready to accept. The qualitative data collected for this study clearly shows that many
Turkana households have reorganized their livelihoods around the presence of the
camp. The camp created the environment for interesting—if strikingly unbalanced—
economic relations to emerge between refugee and host communities.

Legal Framework for Refugee Management in Kenya
A review of the impact of devolution on Kakuma and Dadaab noted that the recent
movement toward devolution does not directly impact refugee management because
that responsibility is increasingly being centralized rather than devolved (Samuel Hall
2014). Refugee management remains at the national level under the portfolio of the
Department for Refugee Affairs. The 2006 Refugee Act is the main legal instrument
for refugee management, even though most stakeholders, including the government
of Kenya, agree that it does not comprehensively cover the issue nor does it adequately
protect refugees. A new bill was drafted by the government, working with civil society
partners, but it has not yet passed into law. Because the management of refugees is being
increasingly securitized, the Department of Refugee Affairs has been reinforced as a
central institution for refugees, confirming the national ownership on the issue. County
authorities have only peripheral responsibilities with regard to refugees, usually linked
to sectors under their direct responsibility, particularly the provision of public ser-
vices—such as health, road infrastructure, and education. Despite the nationalization of
the refugee issue, counties will likely gain an increasing voice at the table, especially as
they are gaining control over a sensitive issue for refugees—land (Samuel Hall 2014: 8).

The practical consequences of this evolving legal framework are “the lack of coherent
provisions for refugee management and protection” (Samuel Hall 2014: 11) in a context
where at least five key legal texts partly or exclusively address the issue of refugees. In
practice, however, Kenya still implements an encampment policy that does not grant
freedom of movement to refugees and does not give them access to employment out-
side the refugee camp. Kenya does not recognize local integration as one of the durable
solutions available for refugees living on its soil even though much of the population
already lives in and is integrated into the economic life of cities, including Nairobi.
The practical consequences at the camp level are that refugees are restricted in their
movements outside the camp: they need authorization to leave and a curfew forbids any
person who is not a refugee to be inside the camp after 6:00 p.m.

      Inside the Camp—A Relief-Oriented but Dynamic Economy
      Past research has highlighted the vitality of the camp economy. Pérouse de Montclos
      and Kagwanja (2000) describe Kakuma refugee camp as “a market town,” adding that
      the “trading networks of the camps supply the surrounding areas as far away as the refu-
      gees’ countries of origin. … Each community has its own patterns of trade.” Qualitative
      interviews showed that host communities had noticed the impact that various refugee
      communities had on the overall economy of the camp and its surroundings, pointing at
      the Somali and Ethiopian communities as particularly active.

      As part of the present study, the research team conducted an assessment of the refugee
      camp’s businesses and found 10 medium- to large-sized markets in the camp and a total
      of 2,382 businesses located in the camp or in Kakuma town. Many businesses specialize
      in trading key goods and services (figure I.1).

      This assessment reveals a variety of businesses and economic activities that characterize
      Kakuma Refugee Camp. Patterns of trade are based on and complement the free aid
      received by the refugees, as studied in detail by Oka in his 2011 paper that showed the
      extent to which the refugees have operationalized the aid they receive and make use of
      to buy goods and commodities that they cannot access through the relief food package,
      thereby sustaining various types of businesses at the camp (Oka 2011). Oka noted that
      many refugees sold part or all of their food rations to get cash to buy other goods. By
      doing so, refugees reaffirm a sense of agency over their household patterns of consump-
      tion despite the general system of relief and assistance. In addition to selling relief goods
    I. Background Paper: Socioeconomic Mapping and Analysis of Kakuma                       237



as sources of cash, refugees rely on remittances and, to a lesser extent, salaries from
employment:

     “Minimal estimates of cash inflow from employment (66,000 USD), remit-
     tances (200,000 USD), and the black market (89,000) total 355,000 USD per
     month that circulates through and out of the refugee camp through the camp
     traders.” (Oka 2011: 249)

Positive Economic Impact for Host Communities
The socioeconomic consequences of the presence of the refugee camp on the lives of the
host community are diverse, but several respondents note that the camp is one of the
main livelihood providers for the Turkana population. Others note that their survival
is inextricably linked to the camp, pointing to the ambiguous nature of the relationship
between the two communities.


Charity and Survival

While Turkana communities usually depend on cattle for their survival, many respon-
dents note that Kakuma Refugee Camp now represents an important component of
their survival strategy. Charity and begging in the camp are common activities for Tur-
kana living around it. A 28-year-old mother of seven children notes that due to her lack
of education, begging or asking refugees for charity is one of the few coping strategies
available to her when the situation is critical and she cannot feed her children. Several
Turkana working in the camp claim they have established relationships with refugees,
so positive that they would receive small gifts and support, usually in the form of food
surpluses or a provided meal.


Cheaper Goods Available

Another important consequence of the camp’s presence on the daily lives of the Tur-
kana is the availability of less costly goods. Turkana communities use the camp to pur-
chase necessary items at cheaper prices. The availability of free food and other needed
commodities drives prices down at the camp, to the benefit of the Turkana. The host
community also benefits from the availability of a broad range of products imported
by refugee traders and their business partners. A package of flour that sells for K Sh 40
(US$0.40) in the camp would reportedly cost K Sh 60–80 (US$0.60-0.80) in town; and
one kilogram of rice would cost K Sh 90 (US$0.90) in the camp or K Sh 120 (US$1.20)
in town. Luxury goods are accessible in the camp: one Turkana man reports having just
purchased a pair of shoes for K Sh 1,000 (US$10)—double the estimated price in town.
238   Appendixes



      He also explains that solar panels were available in the camp for K Sh 7,500 (US$75) as
      opposed to K Sh 9,000 (US$90) in town.


      Menial Jobs

      The camp provides a number of job opportunities for Turkana men and women, mostly
      unskilled, irregular, and low-paying, but they do represent an important source of
      income for the host community. Male and female Turkana often combine a variety of
      menial economic activities—inside and outside the camp—to meet their family’s needs.
      Activities vary based on the demands in the camp, but Turkana women engage in
      activities such as carrying food for refugees, fetching water, washing dishes and clothes,
      mending fences, and collecting and selling firewood or charcoal. Some activities bear
      significant risks, especially sex work—called “survival sex” in the camp, which brings
      with it a high risk of HIV transmission and gender-based violence. Turkana children
      often work as servants in the camp, either in addition to attending school or as a full-
      time activity.

      Men find irregular employment in construction or in transporting material into the
      camp. Several Turkana note that they could not access skilled labor opportunities in the
      camp, mostly of which are provided by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and
      international organizations, either because their level of skills and education were too
      low or because the positions were awarded through nepotism or bribery, which blocked
      their access to these lucrative opportunities.

           “I went two days ago to the camp, and made a fence. For that, I got 1,000 shil-
           lings in cash. I also carried food for people, for a family of three. That was 50
           shillings per person, so 150 shillings and two bowls of food. So I came back
           with 1,150 shillings and two bowls of maize. Two days before that, I got 1,000
           shillings for mending four fences. Mending and making fences is seasonal,
           and there are so many people to build fences that they cannot hike prices.”
                                               —35-year-old Turkana woman (KII 2015)

      The refugee camp therefore has a direct impact on the Turkana’s access to food, income,
      and improved nutritional status, as demonstrated by the nutrition data collected for
      this study. This survey provided sum of skinfolds measurements, which demonstrated
      that the Turkana living in Kakuma have a better nutritional status than the Turkana of
      Lokichoggio or Lorengo.

Limited Access to Financial Services for Both Communities

In the Camp

There are only limited options for refugees to access formal banking services, including
loans and credit. Equity Bank opened a branch in Kakuma, which offers schemes of
revolving loans for a small number of refugees.

Yet a less formal banking system is active in the camp that fills in the gaps of the formal
system. To access credit and funds, some of the refugees can use Somali and Ethiopian
traditional systems of hawala. These services are usually only accessible to members
of these communities, which excludes the rest of the camp population. Four main
hawala providers operate within the camp’s Somali business community: Dahabshil,
Amel, Dalsan, and Iftin (Oka 2011: 244). This system allows refugees to access signifi-
cant amounts in remittances, either from the diaspora or from relatives in the region.
Oka estimates that the total international remittances reaching the camp amount to
US$100,000–150,000 per month (Oka 2011). The other main channel of funds acces-
sible for refugees is M-Pesa, a mobile-based system for transferring money. Refugees
can use M-Pesa to receive remittances or to conduct transactions within the camp. A
similar amount is sent to the camp through M-Pesa: about US$200,000 per month (Oka
2011: 245).


Outside the Camp

Local community access to formal banking and credit is also limited and actually partly
depends on the refugee presence. In focus group discussions, Turkana woman expressed
their defiance toward the formal banking system as a savings institution:

     “A goat is our bank. … Banks are not controlled by us and not by God. Men
     run banks, down-Kenyans run banks. If we give money to them and they
     disappear, what shall we do?”

     “The problem is that we are afraid of banks and the people who work there.
     We get afraid of making mistakes. But we have bank accounts. When we get
     HSNP [Hunger Safety Net Programme] money, we put it in there. We also
     have M-Pesa but that is not savings.” (KII 2015)

Formal banks are perceived as institutions run by outsiders, and low financial literacy
levels among the Turkana makes some uncomfortable with using the formal banking
system.
240   Appendixes



      The Turkana seek small amounts of credit to buy food and other goods from the Somali
      shops in the camp or sometimes from the shops in town. Their level of access varies
      and is limited to the members of the community known for having reliable sources of
      income, such as a full-time job with an NGO in the camp.

           “Somalis sell goods cheaper, they know customer relations, they also give
           credit. If you work for an NGO and they know you, you can even get up to
           100,000 shillings credit. As long as you keep paying back.”
                                                  —26-year-old Turkana man (KII 2015)

      The Turkana, however, are often forced into giving credit to their refugee clients at the
      camp. Many report being asked for their goods on credit, particularly firewood and
      charcoal, and then must chase down their clients for payment, which often sparks ten-
      sions and disputes. This illustrates another facet of the unbalanced relationship between
      the refugee and host communities.

      3.5 Structure of Investments in Both Communities

      Refugee Communities

      The investment structures of the Turkana and refugee communities are very different
      and shaped by the socioeconomic context in which they both developed. As noted
      above, refugees have invested significantly in the business architecture of the camp,
      filling the gaps of development assistance with a large range of services and distribution
      of goods.

      The camp’s Ethiopian and Somali communities have been particularly active in devel-
      oping businesses as a form of short- and long-term investment characteristic of the
      transient situation of refugees. Somalis and Ethiopians established long-term wholesale
      and other large businesses requiring a significant investment in permanent construc-
      tion, sometimes with the support of local Kenyan Meru and Kikuyu communities.
      These investments respond to long- and short-term strategies because most refugees
      plan to sell their businesses when they leave the camp, and a major objective of starting
      a business is to have cash for resettlement. Equally important, most refugees do not
      expect to leave in the immediate future and are therefore constantly reinvesting in their
      businesses, making them simultaneously think in both the short- and long-term. The
      Ethiopian and Somali communities at the refugee camp invest in their countries of
      origin in addition to their proposed places of settlement, such as the United States, the
    I. Background Paper: Socioeconomic Mapping and Analysis of Kakuma                        241



United Kingdom, and Australia. Balancing between short-term strategies at the camp
and the longer-term objective of resettlement is characteristic of the sense of “transient
permanence” or “static transience” among refugees stuck in the limbo of protracted
displacement (Oka 2011: 233). Meanwhile, they actively contribute to the overall devel-
opment of the camp and its transition into a quasi-town.


The Turkana Community

For the most part, the Turkana engage in strategies of survival and subsistence, which
does not leave much room to make investments. A socioeconomic survey conducted
for this study showed that 45 percent of Turkana respondents worried first and fore-
most about hunger. The Turkana economy has only recently become cash-based, and
some business interactions with refugees are still made in kind, further limiting avail-
able investment options.

Qualitative interviews show that beyond mere survival, Turkana “invest” in three main
ways, expecting a different type of return for each and with varying levels of confidence
in their strategies, as outlined below.


1. Education and School Fees

Second to food, education is a major expense for the Turkana. These pastoralist families
noted that needing to pay school fees (or a bride-price) was one of the few reasons
a household would agree to sell some of its livestock. Turkana children can receive
free education in public schools, but the expenses related to education—such as books,
transportation, and uniforms—are not negligible for these very low-income households.

Qualitative interviews confirmed the significance of education expenses in Turkana
household budgets:

     “We have 25 goats. We had more, around 60, but many have gone to pay
     school fees for children. … If the people, the big ones, keep telling us to send
     our children to school, I agree. But the schools should be better. Even though
     they are free, the children have to pay for uniforms, for books, and we some-
     times don’t have enough to eat, so to get money for those things, we have to
     go to our relatives and get goats to sell.”
                                         —28-year-old Turkana woman (KII 2015)
242   Appendixes



           “They keep on telling us ‘send your children to school, educate them’. …
           Where is the money to send the children to school? They say, you don’t have
           to pay school fees. But what about exam fees, uniforms, books, all that costs
           money. So does the transport to school.… I have tried but always we run out
           of money and our children are chased from school.”
                                                  —76-year-old Turkana male (KII 2015)

      The Turkana are ambivalent toward education. On one hand, education is increasingly
      seen as one of the only strategies available to get out of poverty. On the other, it is seen
      as something imposed upon them by local and national leaders who are opposed to the
      pastoralist lifestyle that characterizes Turkana communities. Still, the fact that families
      are ready to spend a significant part of their household income on education is evi-
      dence that it increasingly represents a viable investment for Turkana households. These
      investments in education are linked to an acknowledgment among the Turkana that
      in their current situation, they are only able to access menial and unskilled jobs, even
      in their own county. Some respondents made this observation in anger; others simply
      acknowledged that the low level of education among the Turkana overall limited their
      ability to access jobs requiring skilled labor.

      It is a positive development that the Turkana community increasingly views educa-
      tion as a viable strategy, but if they do not receive any benefit from it, an important
      opportunity will have been missed. Several respondents noted that the quality of edu-
      cation is poor and that teachers regularly beat the children. Furthermore, corruption
      and nepotism often play roles in the attribution of skilled or salaried jobs, increasing
      frustration among the local community and decreasing incentives for them to investing
      their meager capital into education.


      Support to Extended Family

      Another important expense for Turkana households is the support they give to extended
      groups of relatives for general expenses like education or in the event of particular dis-
      tress, such as drought. These expenses often prevent households from saving money,
      and yet this kind of support given to extended family can be considered an insurance
      strategy because it is reciprocal among members of the awi who have left to “the city”
      as well as the rest of the awi who take care of the livestock. An individual with a job is
      not only expected to share with their immediate family—their wife, children, brothers,
      parents, and sisters—but also with distant relatives who might ask for money to pay
      tuition or uniforms, which makes saving difficult.
    I. Background Paper: Socioeconomic Mapping and Analysis of Kakuma                           243



This relationship is reciprocal in the sense that the Turkana can turn to their pastoralist
awi if an unexpected event such as an illness or death puts them in a difficult financial
situation. In such cases, the awi is expected to give them goats in return.

     “It is up to them. If they refuse, we come back empty-handed. But this does not
     happen often. Droughts come frequently and, if they refuse too much, so can
     we. And it does not help the family at all.”
                                              —26-year-old Turkana man (KII 2015)


Investing in Livestock

In line with their pastoralist lifestyle, most Turkana respondents aspire to invest in cattle
and livestock should they get enough savings to do so. The Turkana explicitly compare
their herds with banks: they consider livestock to be a more reliable savings system than
formal banks. The rationale is clear and often well articulated. The Turkana understand
that they have the necessary skill set to take care of livestock and to manage their herds.
Importantly, it is something that they have control over, unlike bank accounts man-
aged by non-Turkana. Even women interviewed for this study who owned small busi-
nesses are adamant that if they made enough of a profit from their activities, they would
invest in livestock. The first aim of businesses and small income-generating activities
is to meet the basic needs of the household and then seek to save enough money to
invest in livestock. There is no real business development strategy or investment in
business activities because they are seen as a step toward a goal rather than as ends
in themselves. Despite frequent droughts, livestock remains the most trusted form of
investment among the Turkana, and this limits their ability to invest in other types of
productive activities or to further diversify their livelihood strategies. In the current
context of repeated drought, their lifestyle may prove difficult to sustain. Due to the lack
of infrastructure and investment, the county does not have the capacity to support the
traditional livelihoods like agriculture and pastoralism that could respond to the food
needs of its growing population (Avery 2014).

Yet, these various forms of livelihoods—traditional and more “urban” forms related
to the refugee camp—are compatible, just the same way as education and a pastoralist
lifestyle are. It is clear from interviews that the Turkana are developing more symbiotic
relations between these two sets of livelihoods. While their lifestyle is still characterized
by survival and resilience, they have developed strategies of coexistence and balance in
order to benefit from both lifestyles at the level of the awi.

      Social Relations: Positive Interactions and Forms of Violence

      Emergence of New Social Interactions Around the Camp

      Qualitative interviews demonstrate that relationships between the refugee and Turkana
      communities are complex. On one hand, many describe an array of “positive” relation-
      ships between these communities, including friendships, acts of hospitality, and inter-
      marriages. These connections can provide mutual support in situations of distress. The
      lack of resentment toward refugees among the host community is striking. Many say
      that the refugees should be welcomed and hosted. The presence of the camp, a multieth-
      nic and multilingual space located in a remote area, means that the Turkana have been
      exposed to an unprecedented level of multiculturalism, which translates into various
      aspects of their daily lives. Exposure to multiple languages is one obvious consequence,
      and the Turkana who work in the camp have learned multiple languages in order to be
      able to communicate with the refugees living near them, particularly the Sudanese. One
      teacher notes that her Turkana students are now multilingual, speaking Somali, Dinka,
      and Amhara.

      Various forms of sociability have taken root, linking the communities together. Several
      respondents note that they had developed friendships at the camp. This was especially
      true for the women who spend a lot of time there and who regularly interact with the
      same families. Young people are also influenced by this proximity to various cultures.
      As the same teacher notes: “The life of Turkana has changed a lot, for good and for
      bad. Turkana tend to copy outsiders, their culture, the music, to drink bhang, to smoke
      sheesha” (KII 2015).

      Intermarriage is an important aspect of the social interactions between refugee and
      Turkana communities. Ohta analyzed this dynamic in 2005 and noted many cases in
      which Turkana women married or had relationships with refugee men, although the
      opposite scenario appears to have been much less common. For the most part, inter-
      marriages do not raise problems, except the payment of the bridewealth, which is neces-
      sary for the Turkana to recognize a union as official and that sometimes raises tensions
      between communities (Ohta 2005). Negotiations usually take place in the presence of
      community leaders who try to mitigate the conflict and have the parties come to an
      agreement. Ohta’s analysis is confirmed by qualitative research conducted for this study.
      Turkana respondents mention the fact that Turkana women are increasingly having
      sexual relationships with or marrying refugees. According to the Turkana, marriage tra-
      ditions have rapidly evolved due to the contact with the refugee camp. Turkana women
      sometimes prefer marrying earlier in the camp over waiting for a Turkana man to be
      able to afford their dowry.
    I. Background Paper: Socioeconomic Mapping and Analysis of Kakuma                         245



Violence and Tensions

Positive social relationships between communities are built through daily interactions
that take place in and around the camp, but violence is also present and visible in a
number of forms.

Symbolic violence. When the Turkana come to the refugee camp, they are often visibly
“inferior”—they beg for work and sometimes for food and support. Many members
of the host community are so destitute that they feel dependent on the refugees they
host. This symbolic violence is manifest in economic interactions controlled by the
refugees who benefit from strong bargaining power against a local community desper-
ate for work and income, and it is present in daily interactions between the Turkana and
refugee communities: many women describe being insulted and harassed when at the
camp. The perception that refugees are wealthier and more powerful than their hosts
has bred feelings of frustration, anger, and helplessness among the Turkana, fueled by
the fact their communities already feel despised in their own country.

     “The worst abuses are the instances of matharau, na’imeny. The insults they
     call out. Most refugees don’t do that, only some of them. But they are the
     loudest.”
                                         —58-year-old Turkana woman (KII 2015)

Gender-based and physical violence. Interactions between communities are charac-
terized by more direct forms of violence as well, including gender-based violence and
open conflict.

Women from the Turkana and refugee communities are at risk in and outside the camp.
Focus group discussions highlight the fact that sexual harassment is common in the
vicinity of the camp. Women are at particular risk when they go to collect firewood
along the river or when they stay too late in the camp. It is important to note that
women from both refugee and host communities are victims of gender-based violence
at the hands of both communities and that the issue crosses the boundaries of the camp.
The various accounts by respondents indicate that the brutality of these forms of vio-
lence is acute and visible. Claire Mwangi analyzed the forms of gender-based violence
in the camp, but only found a very high occurrence of rape. She cites the monthly sta-
tistics of the Lutheran World Foundation, which recorded 23 rapes just for the month
of July 2012. According to Mwangi, it is likely that these statistics largely underestimate
the number of rapes because many women are reluctant to report this type of incident
(Mwangi 2012: 27–28.). This phenomenon is particularly worrying in a context where
HIV/AIDS is prevalent: rape seriously weakens HIV/AIDS prevention strategies.

      Violent intercommunity confrontations happen on a regular basis, although actors
      noted that their frequency has decreased since 2010. The most significant and frequent
      conflict is between the Turkana and some of the South Sudanese refugees, particularly
      the Dinka. Violence is usually sparked by small-scale incidents at the camp that quickly
      escalate, potentially resulting in a high casualty rate among communities that are mili-
      tarized and have access to weapons.


      Devolution and New Resources: Factors of Change?
      The recent discovery of natural resources in the county, particularly oil and water, along
      with the benefits that the county may get from the ongoing devolution, could be seen
      as promising factors of change for the host and refugee communities. But preliminary
      assessments show that many obstacles will need to be removed before local communi-
      ties can truly benefit from these developments.

      New Resources for the County

      Water

      The discovery of natural resources has led to cautious optimism about the development
      of Turkana County. Underground water was discovered and assessed by RTI Interna-
      tional and UNESCO in 2013. In his assessment, Avery noted that the RTI/UNESCO’s
      report on the Lotikipi Basin Aquifer claimed that it “could provide water for Kenya for
      70 years” and could open significant prospects for agricultural production in the area
      (Avery 2014: 1). While boreholes have been built to tap into this resource, the positive
      impact on local populations is slow in manifesting. Initial optimism has faded since
      subsequent assessments of the water reserve raised doubts about its potential for human
      consumption: “The dissolved salt level of this water sample is 10 times the permissible
      level for rural and community water supply, and 4 times the absolute limit, hence would
      not be suitable” (Avery 2014: 4–5).

      Still, in the frame of Kenya’s National Water Master Plan, these resources are good
      news for the county and will be key for developing irrigated agriculture in Turkana and
      more broadly, across the county. But without a strong and responsible water manage-
      ment system, the sustainability of newly discovered water reserves will be endangered
      (Avery 2014: 3). Furthermore, the type of investments and infrastructure needed to
      harness the benefits from the water reserves will take several years to be established and
      bear fruit. Important investments are needed in terms of infrastructure and resource
      management and planning to avoid future land degradation and the unsustainable use
      of Turkana’s water.

Oil

Oil was discovered in 2012 in Kenya, and Turkana is the focus of current oil exploration.
As noted by Cordaid in their recent assessment of community perceptions about oil in
the county: In 2010, Tullow Oil, a British company, acquired rights on the exploration
of Turkana, Marsabit, and Baringo Counties. It made its first discovery of oil in Turkana
in 2012. Since then, the company has drilled 11 wells in the county, with an estimated
600 million recoverable barrels of crude oil. This discovery accelerated the develop-
ment of large infrastructure projects, including, the Lamu Port–South Sudan–Ethiopia
Transport Corridor (LAPSSET), which includes significant investments in transport
infrastructure. Expectations around the economic consequences of this discovery are
extremely high (Cordaid 2015: 10).

Cordaid’s assessment precisely reflects perceptions among the Turkana interviewed for
this study, highlighting their cautious hope that they will benefit from the discovery and
the crucial need for a more constructive and inclusive dialog with local communities
already feeling left out (Cordaid 2015: 8). Local populations already expressed their
concern that their resources—as well as revenue—would fall in the hands of “down-
Kenyans” and foreigners. Distrust for local elites was at play here: respondents believed
that the revenue would end up in the hands of local leaders and not be shared with the
local community. According to Cordaid, the local community has raised a number of
concerns, including:

n	   Lack of access to employment opportunities for the Turkana in this new sector, aside
     from low-level jobs;

n	   Procurement, tendering, and contracting processes characterized by nepotism and
     corruption;

n	   Poor or nonexistent community consultation; and

n	   The potentially negative effect of oil exploration on grazing land and land access,
     especially because the Turkana are known for their collective ownership of land
     (Cordaid 2015: 8–10).

The presence of natural resources does seem to have at least some impact on the capacity
of communities to organize and their willingness to raise concerns as an engaged, col-
lective group. A focus group discussion respondent notes: “The Turkana people need to
learn from the past to not take things lightly. Last year, when they said that the water was
not good, Turkana people got angry. They protested. This is what is needed” (KII 2015).

      Devolution and the Benefits for Turkana County
      Turkana is one of the counties in Kenya that should benefit the most from the current
      devolution process. Given its size and its low level of development, the county receives
      the largest share of the overall national budget, second only to Nairobi county, Turkana
      county received K Sh 10.2 billion (US$102 million) in July 2015 (Samuel Hall 2015:
      38). For development expenses, the county budget for 2015/16 will be broken down as
      illustrated in figure I.2 (Republic of Kenya 2015).

      While the 2013/14 budget put an emphasis on infrastructure, especially roads (15 per-
      cent) and water and irrigation (12 percent), the 2015/16 budget shows a clear focus
      on education, which comprises 19 percent of the development budget. Planning and
      governance expenses have decreased significantly in terms of share of the budget
      from 25 and 8 percent in 2013/14 to 11 and 2 percent, respectively, accompanied by a
      significant increase in the share of public services, decentralized administration, and
      disaster management from 4 to 19 percent. The county budget is in line with the major
      needs of Turkana population, especially regarding the delivery of basic public services,
      such as education (19 percent) and roads and transport (9 percent). However, it is not
      clear that the allocation of only 3 percent of the budget for the pastoral economy and
      fisheries really takes into account the particular socioeconomic profile of the Turkana
      population.

It is noteworthy that the increased budget allocation dedicated to the county and the
development opportunities offered by devolution did not raise the hopes or expectations
among the Turkana. Most of the respondents do not expect devolution to produce any
actual positive impact on their lives due to doubts about effective implementation in the
absence of efforts at strengthening of capacities and accountability of local authorities.

      “Well devolution does not mean that we get better leaders. Yes, the county will
      have more autonomy but it is the same leaders and now with less account-
      ability from the center.”
              —36-year-old member of the host community at Kakuma (KII 2015)


Conclusion: The Way Ahead for Kakuma
A review of the factors that limit the socioeconomic development of Kakuma points
to a number of structural factors related to the degradation of the environment of the
Turkana and refugee communities and the history of marginalization and antagonism
between the central government and the Turkana. The Turkana’s traditional pastoralist
lifestyle is endangered by various dynamics, such as the degradation of grazing land,
insecurity, and an increase in population. An analysis of the relationship of the Turkana
with the refugees demonstrates that they have developed new livelihood strategies that
take into account the presence of the camp and the economic opportunities it offers.
Interestingly, at the level of the awi, the Turkana tend to invest in both the pastoralist
economy and in more urban lifestyles related to the camp, including access to education
for their children. One side of a family supports the other in times of crisis, drought, or
distress, and the ability to access either lifestyle is itself an insurance and coping strategy
for extended families.

n	   There is no doubt that the establishment of the refugee camp has upset the local
     balance, but for most part, it has been positive, as Turkana households increasingly
     reorganize their livelihood strategies around the camp. Social and economic interac-
     tions between refugees and host communities are complex but mostly cordial—if
     not friendly. There is, however, a level of symbolic violence emanating from the
     refugees’ economic domination over the area and the paradoxical situation of the
     Turkana host community being dependent on the refugees. Physical violence, some-
     times brutal, also exists in various forms, including gender-based violence within
     and outside the camp and harassment of Turkana women and children when they
     are at the camp.

      n	   Recent developments should lead to significant changes for Turkana County. If man-
           aged correctly, the exploitation of natural resources—particularly oil and water—
           could have large-scale economic consequences for the local population in terms of
           access to employment and new economic activities, including irrigated agriculture.
           The context of devolution should lead to more substantial investments in public
           services, addressing one of the key factors currently holding Kakuma back. But the
           benefits of these promising developments will only reach the Turkana and possibly
           the refugees if they are properly managed by local authorities who are competent
           and accountable. At present, expectations among the local population are low.

      n	   A discussion of key factors holding Kakuma back highlights some entry points for
           development interventions that would benefit host and refugee communities:

      n	   There is a need for local and central authorities to go beyond their general opposi-
           tion to the Turkana’s pastoralist lifestyle. It is not helpful to simply reject their way
           of life as backward when, to the contrary, it is actually a key survival strategy. The
           government’s disregard is evident in the county budget, in which only 3 percent is
           allocated to the pastoral economy and fisheries. Local populations would benefit
           from more significant investments in these sectors.

      n	   The increasing investment in education among the Turkana is an important oppor-
           tunity that should be exploited. If the community does not see any benefit from their
           investments in education, economic priorities will dominate. A particular focus should
           be put on the quality of education, the motivation of teachers, and pedagogical skills.

      n	   Gender-based violence is a worrying trend that cuts across communities. It bears
           significant risks for the psychological and physical health of Turkana and refugee
           women alike. A lack of police protection and incentives to report gender-based vio-
           lent crimes is particularly concerning. Mechanisms to report gender-based violence
           that are currently in place at the camp could be made available to Turkana women.
           Prevention campaigns and an increase in the police force should be considered for
           dangerous areas.

      n	   The community’s engagement around questions of local governance, including
           devolution and natural resources management, should be significantly enhanced.
           Mechanisms are needed to ensure the meaningful participation of the Turkana com-
           munity regarding oil exploration and extraction as well as projects related to water
           management. The lack of skills and education among the Turkana could be over-
           come through on-the-job training schemes focused on the specific skills needed for
           both ventures.
