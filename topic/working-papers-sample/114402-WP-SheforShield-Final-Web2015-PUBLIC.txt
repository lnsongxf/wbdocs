                                The insurance industry shows promising signs of growth in emerging economies. Yet,
                                the industry has largely overlooked a key consumer segment: women.

                                Women in emerging economies are beginning to enjoy rising incomes and purchasing
                                power. Their risk-mitigation needs, accordingly, are growing. By 2030, for example, the
                                insurance industry is expected to earn up to $1.7 trillion from women alone — half of it
                                in just 10 emerging economies.

                               That’s what we found in a ground-breaking study we conducted with AXA and
                               Accenture, the results of which are presented here. At IFC, we believe that women
                               are an important force for development — as consumers, employees, leaders, and
                               entrepreneurs. We know from our experience working with banks that expanding
     access to finance for women-owned enterprises goes hand-in-hand with bank profitability.

     We wanted to explore the possibility of achieving similar results in the insurance sector. That’s why we decided to
     conduct the first-of-its-kind research on the business case for focusing on the women’s insurance market. This
     report is very much in line with IFC’s overall commitment to developing gender-smart solutions with our clients
     — so they can improve their businesses by strengthening women’s roles in the private sector.

     In our research, we asked how women can be better equipped to mitigate risks so they can live healthier and
     wealthier lives, protect their families, and grow their business. We also examined the prospects for women to buy
     more insurance. We found that women — unlike men — tend to buy insurance policies not only for themselves
     but also for their families. Women tend to be more alert to risks that confront their children and parents.

     To forgo this key market segment, therefore, is to forgo significant revenue opportunities — and to miss an
     opportunity to drive economic growth. This report highlights a variety of ways for insurance companies to reach
     the women’s market: by creating customized products, by leveraging the power of mobile technology, and by
     creating partnerships to educate women on their insurance options. We are confident that the findings can help
     plant the seeds for a thriving women-focused insurance market — enabling women to better protect themselves,
     their families, communities, and societies.

                            Women hold up half the sky, or so the Chinese proverb goes. This has been true
                            since the beginning of time. But today they are increasingly doing so with one hand,
                            continuing to care for both their parents and children, and becoming breadwinners
                            with the other, contributing to the development and growth of their economies.
                            Women are the largest growth opportunity in the world, will soon represent more
                            than half the university students worldwide, and by 2028 will control 75 percent of
                            discretionary spending globally.1 What is more, they are at the heart of significant
                            global demographic and economic tectonic shifts, be it with regards to the aging of the
                            population or the emergence of a massive middle class across high growth markets.

                             Yet more often than not, women continue to act behind the scenes. They feel — and
                             are — vastly both undervalued and underserved, despite the remarkable strides
in market power and social position they have made, even if at uneven speeds, across both developed and
emerging economies. Few industries have taken into account the demands made on women’s time due to
conflicting priorities stemming from their work, their homes, their families. With regards to insurance, this report
demonstrates that the industry has overlooked the fact that women, who are more risk-aware, are driving a
shift in spending patterns, focusing more on things such as education, health, savings, and overall the holistic
protection of their households. They are also risking the entrepreneurial leap and creating their own businesses.
This grows their protection needs faster than those of men, and insurers have a genuine interest in filling in this
growing protection gap. But women lack awareness and understanding of what is available, as well as access to
relevant insurance products and proper advice — advice by women and men who understand their specific needs
as women, but also as income earners and decision-makers.

As they will increasingly fuel tomorrow’s growth, emerging markets are and will continue to be a strategic priority
for AXA. One of our key ambitions is to contribute to their economic development through better and more
wide-ranging risk-sharing, protection, and prevention. Protecting women is one of the key building blocks of this
ambition, as we believe it will contribute to sustaining growth by bringing women into the workforce and raising
the overall level of human capital, productivity, and wages.

This research comes at a critical time. There have been limited global resources allocated to better understanding
women’s attitudes towards insurance, their needs and expectations. This is true for the developed world but even
more strikingly for the emerging one, which is why we decided to join forces with IFC and put our complementary
heads together in order to improve the collective understanding of how insurers can best support and protect
women. How we can empower the business owners, give the home-makers peace of mind, anticipate the needs
of all. And by so doing, society as a whole.

By looking to fill this gap, we aim to further push the borders of insurability, thereby ultimately contributing to a
more sustainable future that welcomes the world’s transformations with open, prepared arms.

I hope the critical insights and recommendations offered in this report will help the wider industry but also all our
partners and stakeholders at large further contribute to better catering to this half — to better protect the whole.

     Accenture

                                Accenture is proud to have partnered with the International Finance Corporation
                                and AXA on SheforShield: Insure Women to Better Protect All, a comprehensive
                                report on the state of the women’s insurance market in developing markets. This
                                report explores the size and importance of the opportunity that the uptake of
                                insurance among women represents for the insurance industry and the development
                                community.

                            Insurance companies have long played a leading role in society — investing in the
                            wellbeing of communities, helping individuals and families thrive in the face of
                            uncertainty, and catalyzing innovation through businesses by offering products and
                            solutions that fit the marketplace. Insurers once again have the opportunity to do
                            good, and thus to do well — to transform the commercial and employment power of
     women in emerging markets and help them become a financially viable and vital customer base and workforce.

     This report presents compelling evidence that women’s consumer needs must be addressed in order to capitalize
     on the incredible growth potential in emerging markets. As individuals, they represent a multi-faceted customer
     base, with growing financial means that they are ready to invest in products that meet their life needs.

     Women can play an important role in explaining and selling insurance products across customer segments, and
     especially to other women. Across the value chain, from the rural sales agent to the corporate executive, including
     women in the creation, marketing, and distribution of insurance products will help insurance companies sell
     solutions to meet the needs of their new customer base.

     Clearly, the women’s market in these countries — and in other emerging economies — represents an enormous
     opportunity for insurance companies. The report estimates that women’s individual spending on insurance
     premiums will grow to three times its current size, to $1.4 to $1.7 trillion, by 2030. Women entrepreneurs are now
     one-third of the world’s business owners, and they are looking for ways to expand their businesses and contribute
     more to the wealth and security of their families. Despite this, relatively few insurers are targeting the women’s
     market and positioning themselves to share in the success of these entrepreneurs.

     Opening up this large potential market will require investment and partnership across organizations and sectors.
     It will require an understanding of women’s needs before developing products, and the transformation of single
     products into multi-layered solutions with wrap-around services and clear whole-family and business protection.
     By providing the right products and the right information, by expanding the role of women in their salesforce, and
     by providing the tools, training, and structure to help women sell effectively, insurers can foster economic growth
     while helping improve the lives of women around the world. Insurers that take this path can also open up new
     avenues for their own continuing, profitable growth.

     We encourage all actors across the private, public, and development sectors to consider their role in furthering
     the advancement of women in the insurance sector — and watch as women cultivate, grow, and innovate both
     within their communities and globally with the support of the risk assurance community.

4. Executive Summary

T
           he insurance industry plays an important role in the growth and stability of the
           global economy, providing individual, family, and community level protection
           against economic, social, and environmental shocks. Women are half of the
world’s population. They also represent more than half of all global graduates and
increasingly participants in the workforce. When it comes to insurance — both uptake
and distribution — and the protection it provides, women are therefore an essential
market to target. Furthermore, women play a multi-faceted role in society which
enables them to act as a conduit for social change and economic progress making them
an increasingly important part of the population to protect. Yet to date, limited research
has been done on the women’s market. This report is the first of its kind to provide
an understanding of how much growth the women’s market alone represents for the
insurance industry, and what women want and need from insurance products and
services in particular in emerging markets. It also provides recommendations on how to
attract and retain women as vital clients.

socioeconomic advancements made by women in
these markets are expected to further increase the
need for insurance to protect their growing assets and
independence. In addition, insurance growth in these
markets is outpacing growth in developed markets.

7.2 ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT 	
EVERY WOMAN
In order to realize the growth opportunity presented in
this report, insurers must abandon the one-size-fits-all
approach, and instead identify and target segments of
women who share common needs and constraints.

The following section identifies five segments of women
based on their socioeconomic bracket, dependents, and
income status. This section will discuss the demographics,
needs/preferences, and constraints faced by each
segment. A more detailed analysis is required to address
these segments in each market, because segment
characteristics and sizes vary across markets.

A
           mutually beneficial relationship exists between insurers and entrepreneurs.
           Insurance reduces entrepreneurs’ exposure to shocks, gives them more financial
           independence, and enables them to embark on higher-risk and higher-return
activities.108 For insurers, entrepreneurs represent a growing sub-segment of commercial
lines with needs for asset, loan, and business protection. Enterprises also require insurance
for their employees, and can serve as a conduit to a larger and potentially high-growth
customer base for insurers. By enabling risk-sharing, insurers become a key path to
business innovation and progress and an important driver for economic growth.

9. So What Now?

A
         comprehensive strategy involving market research, product and service
         development, and distribution is needed for insurers to unlock the potential of the
         women’s market. There is no “silver bullet” solution to meet the varying product,
services, and distribution needs of women across segments and geographies; rather,
insurers need to tailor these recommendations to the characteristics of their individual
markets. The recommendations are grouped into three categories.

  Step 1:                                Step 2:                               Step 3:

B — More Than a Top-Up, a Wrap-Around
Service that Enhances Product Value

Women, particularly mothers and retiree segments,
are looking for trusted services to help them balance
commitments and enhance their mobility. This
recommendation is especially relevant in Brazil, Colombia,
Mexico, and Thailand, where the demand for wrap-
around services is high.

Wrap-around services are common in some Latin
American markets. For example, in Colombia, some
motor insurers offer services to drive the policyholder
home after dark or after a social event. This type of
service is particularly valuable for women who are not
comfortable driving at night. The insurance provides
the policyholder with a clear value beyond accident
protection, while also preventing drunk driving and
reducing the risk of claims.

economic activities they can participate in. The face-to-

cultures, since women agents have to interact with
potential and existing clients of the opposite gender.148

B
       y 2030, the projected retail insurance premium opportunity for women in Brazil is expected
       to grow to $79 billion – $122 billion,1 approximately eight to 12 times the estimated retail
       premium of $10 billion2 spent by women in 2013.2

In 2030, the women’s life insurance market is expected to be between $41.8 billion – $64.5 billion,
while non-life is expected to be between $27.7 billion – $42.3 billion, and health is expected to be
$9.4 billion – $14.8 billion. The women’s market in Brazil is the second largest market opportunity
among the 10 emerging markets of focus.3

                                        Women entrepreneurs lack access to credit. Women entrepreneurs,
                                        particularly in Brazil, have expressed the need for an insurance product
                                        that facilitates access to credit. Maria, the head of the women’s
                                        entrepreneurship association in Sao Paulo, stated, “I see a lot of women

SETTING THE SCENE: THE BUSINESS CASE



B
       y 2030, the insurance premium spend of women clients in China is expected to reach between
       $375 billion and $575 billion, approximately six to nine times the estimated premium of $65
       billion spent by women in 2013. About $205 billion – $315 billion is expected to come from the
life insurance sector, while non-life is expected to account for $152 billion – $232 billion. The health
segment is expected to grow to about $18 billion – $28 billion. China represents the largest women’s
insurance market out of the 10 focus countries due to the already large base of women clients.

SETTING THE SCENE: THE BUSINESS CASE



T
       he Colombian market for women’s retail insurance has the potential to increase to
       $16 billion – $25 billion,2 approximately five to eight times the estimated premium of
       $3 billion spent by women in 2013. Life and non-life segments are expected to grow from $1.1
billion (life) and $1.7 billion (non-life) in 2013, to $5.7 billion – $8.8 billion and $9.9 billion – $15.2
billion respectively in 2030. Across all product lines, non-life insurance growth will be driven by
women’s increase in purchasing power which will give them access to assets. The health market is
expected to grow from $0.04 billion to $0.2 – 0.3 billion.

SETTING THE SCENE: THE BUSINESS CASE



B
       y 2030, the annual women’s insurance market in India is predicted to be between
       $22 billion – $35 billion, approximately two to four times the estimated premium
       of $10 billion spent by women in 2013.

In 2013, women spent $0.05 billion on health insurance premiums; by 2030, this can reach
$0.1 billion – $0.16 billion per annum. Life and non-life segments are expected to grow
at similar rates, from $8.6 billion (life) and $1.1 billion (non-life) in 2013, to $17.7 – $27.6
billion and $4.4 – $6.9 billion respectively in 2030.

           professional and personal                 entrepreneurs frequently lack insurance coverage, due to insufficient
           demands, may be married, and              awareness and poor targeting by insurers. A major issue for women
           may have children.                        entrepreneurs is the lack of formal access to finance, resulting in a lack of
                                                     collateral and start-up capital. Women entrepreneurs struggle with non-
                                                     credit needs such as cash management and insurance, and lack access to

         2. LOW-INCOME CUSTOMERS                     Women in the lower income segment lack access to insurers’ sales
                                                     channels. Despite urbanization accelerating in recent years, 68 percent

                                                     Women see the cost of insurance as too high and often cannot

SETTING THE SCENE: THE BUSINESS CASE



O
          verall, the Indonesian insurance market has shown tremendous growth over the last 10 years. The
          sector is poised to record further growth through a large and relatively untapped market of almost
          250 million people and an expanding economy. By 2030, the insurance premium spend of women
clients in Indonesia is estimated to be $9 billion – $14 billion, approximately 10 to 16 times the estimated
premium of $0.9 billion spent by women in 2013. The projected growth rate in the women’s insurance
market in Indonesia is the fastest of all the focus markets,3 reflecting the rapid growth expected in the
insurance industry overall.

The women’s health insurance market is expected to grow from $0.002 billion in 2013 to $0.016 billion –
$0.025 billion by 2030. The women’s life insurance market is expected to grow from $0.7 billion in 2013,
to $7.0 billion – $11.0 billion in 2030, while the non-life insurance market is expected to grow from $0.2
billion in 2013 to $2 – $3 billion.

The rapid growth in the women’s insurance market can be partially attributed to the currently low
representation of women as clients in the insurers’ portfolios. Interviews with several local insurance
companies in Jakarta, Indonesia, revealed that women clients represent only between 8 percent-12 percent
of total policyholders. Women make up a higher percentage of health insurance clients (25-50 percent), and
less of life insurance clients (less than 10 percent). As women’s socioeconomic progress is reflected in their
purchasing habits, it is expected that they will become a much bigger portion of insurers’ portfolios.

SETTING THE SCENE: THE BUSINESS CASE



T
        he women’s retail insurance market size is projected to grow to $26 billion – $40 billion by
        2030; approximately six to 10 times that of the estimated $4 billion insurance premium spend
        by women in 2013. Given the vast and growing protection gap for women, life insurance premium
spend is expected to grow from $2.0 billion in 2013 to $11.7 billion – $18.1 billion by 2030, while non-
life premium spend is expected to grow from $2.0 billion in 2013 to $13.6 billion – $20.9 billion in 2030.
Health insurance is expected to grow from $77 million to $433 – $669 million.

SETTING THE SCENE: THE BUSINESS CASE

        he Moroccan insurance industry is one of the largest in the Arab region, and the second-largest
        in Africa, after South Africa.1 By 2030, the potential size of the women’s retail market is
        estimated to reach $50 million – $77 million in premium spend, approximately two to four
times greater than the $20 million women spent on insurance in 2013. Across product lines, the
women’s life insurance market is expected to grow from $7.5 million in 2013 to $16.2 million – $24.8
million by 2030. The non-life insurance market is expected to grow from $10.0 million in 2013 to
$27.5 million – $42.1 million by 2030, while the health insurance market is expected to grow from
$2.8 million in 2013 to $6.6 million – $10.2 million by 2030. Focus group discussions and interviews
provided evidence that there is a clear need and willingness among women to pay for the benefits that
insurance can provide.

        he insurance premium spend of women clients in Nigeria is predicted to reach $5 billion – $8
        billion by 2030, approximately nine to 13 times the estimated premium of $0.6 billion spent
        by women in 2013. After Indonesia, Nigeria represents the second fastest growing women’s
insurance opportunity out of the 10 focus markets, thanks to the rapid increase in income experienced
by women.2

The biggest driver of growth is expected to come from non-life products. In 2013, the non-life product
line was valued at $0.56 billion, which represents 80 percent of women’s total insurance premium
spend. This segment’s willingness to spend on non-life products makes this a high-potential growth
area for insurers. Women’s overall financial situation is expected to improve, as the rising middle
class’ ability to grow their assets will require more non-life protection, while the compulsory liability
insurance for entrepreneurs is another driver for growth. In 2030, the women’s non-life insurance
market is projected to be $4.6 billion – $7.1 billion. The life insurance market is projected to grow from
$76 million in 2013 to $621 million – $952 million by 2030, while health insurance is expected to grow
from $0.2 million to $2 million – $3 million.

SETTING THE SCENE: THE BUSINESS CASE



T
        he Thai insurance market can be characterized as being in a state of steady growth. By 2030, the
        insurance premium spend of women clients in Thailand is predicted to be $5 billion – $8 billion
        or approximately five to eight times the estimated premium of $1 billion spent by women in
2013. A similar growth rate is expected across all product lines; the women’s life insurance market is
expected to grow from $0.69 billion in 2013 to $3.6 billion – $5.4 billion by 2030; the women’s non-
life market is expected to grow from $0.19 billion to $1.1 billion – $1.6 billion; and the women’s health
market is expected to grow from $0.1 billion to $0.52 billion – $0.81 billion.

Key Segments

1. RETIREES                          Pension and retirement planning are not sufficient to prevent
                                     poverty in the future. Market discussions with Thai women revealed

                                     Women demand wrap-around services for themselves and aging
                                     spouses. Women’s retirement needs will go beyond payments by
                                     insurers, and they will require additional support to comprehensively
                                     plan for their aging and related healthcare needs. These types of services
                                     are particularly valuable for elderly women, as they usually take on more
                                     of the household tasks, but may not be physically strong enough to

2. WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS               Women entrepreneurs lack understanding of the risks they face

                                     Women entrepreneurs need access to funding and risk mitigation
                                     options for their business ventures. One of the key issues for women
                                     entrepreneurs in Thailand is access to sufficient funding, and the fear of
                                     running an unprofitable business, which is not directly addressed by any

T
        he women’s retail insurance market in Turkey presents the third largest opportunity out of the 10
        focus markets. By 2030, the potential size of the women’s individual insurance market is estimated
        to reach $31 billion – $47 billion, approximately eight to 12 times the estimated premium of
$3.7 billion spent by women in 2013. The non-life product line is expected to dominate, growing from
$3.2 billion in 2013 to $26.7 billion – $40.4 billion by 2030. The life insurance market is expected to grow
from $0.5 billion in 2013 to $4.4 billion – $6.7 billion by 2030, while the health market is expected to grow
from $15 million in 2013 to $122 million – $189 million.

         he women’s insurance market is poised for growth. Globally, the women’s premium
         spend is expected to grow by up to two times its current size to $1.45 trillion to

business owners, are looking for financial solutions to expand their business and seek
protection. Insurers who invest in understanding and targeting the women’s market will
have a first mover advantage in capturing this growth.

Annex C: Detailed Methodology

T
         he market sizing presented in this report is global in scope, but focuses on 10
         emerging markets (Brazil, China, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Morocco,
         Nigeria, Thailand, and Turkey). These markets were selected based on rapid
growth experienced by both the women’s and insurance markets. The socioeconomic
advancements made by women vary by market, but trends indicate an increased need
in the future to protect women’s assets and independence in the future. In addition,
insurance companies’ rate of growth in these markets is rapidly outpacing growth in the
developed markets. A recent study by McKinsey & Company noted that though developed
markets accounted for 84 percent of insurance premiums, developing markets drove more
than half of the global premium growth.158 In particular, projections indicate that global
insurance growth will be driven in large part by the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China)
markets, as well as parts of North Africa, Asia, and Latin America.


Primary and secondary research were used to gather quantitative data on women’s insurance purchasing behavior — i.e.
the uptake of insurance within the women’s market. Qualitative data was also collected to inform analysis on the trends,
challenges, and opportunities in the women’s insurance market, as well as to validate and test assumptions. Data was
collected over the course of eight weeks beginning January 2015. See Figure M1 for an overview of the methodology.

A key finding from the data collection process is the limited amount of publically available gender disaggregated
quantitative data on women’s purchasing behavior in the insurance industry, specifically on the number of women
insurance clients and the total insurance premium spend per woman. Hence, qualitative data from interviews were used
to make logical assumptions and test trends in these areas.

1. Primary Research

174 interviews and surveys were conducted across 10 markets with the following stakeholders:

•	 Senior insurance, reinsurance and bancassurance representatives: What is the current status of women as both
   customers and members of the salesforce in the insurance markets, and what initiatives are currently in place to
   increase women’s involvement in insurance?

•	 Insurance brokers and agents: What benefits and challenges are faced by women in the salesforce?

•	 Women consumer focus groups (from various demographic brackets, including entrepreneurs): What are their
   perceptions, needs, and usage of insurance products in their markets?

•	 Insurance associations: What are the current products and services offered by insurers, and are they relevant and
   meeting the needs of women customers?

•	 Insurance regulators: How do public policies and programs currently provide opportunities and barriers to involving
   more women in the insurance sector?

•	 Universities: What are the trends in male vs. female engagement in insurance related fields (e.g. business
   management, engineering, actuarial sciences)?


2. Secondary Research

Desk research was also conducted using the following sources (see Figure M2 right):

•	 Literature Review: Review of existing reports on gender, insurance, and development from academics, international
   development organizations, and insurance industry authorities to understand and learn from existing initiatives on
   women in insurance. This secondary research complemented data collected through primary research.

3. Identifying Causal Factors that Influence Women’s Purchase of Insurance

A statistical exercise was carried out to determine what economic, behavior or socioeconomic factors have the greatest
influence on women’s uptake of insurance. This required identification of a data set to represent women’s insurance
uptake (the dependent variable) to test various economic, behavior, and socioeconomic causal factors (independent
variables) against.

Identification of a data set to represent women’s insurance uptake (dependent variable selection)

The data assessment found that data on female insurance penetration is sparse. Personally paid for health insurance
(percentage age 15+) for 2011 was selected as the proxy to represent women’s insurance uptake as it was available across
all markets.

Identification of causal factors that influence personally paid health insurance purchase (independent variable
selection)

A regression analysis was then carried out to test which economic, behavioral or socioeconomic factors most influenced
women’s propensity to personally pay for health insurance. The regression was conducted across 137 markets.

Upon analysis of the Personally Paid for Health Insurance data set for men and women, findings show there is a high
correlation between male and female insurance penetration (see Figure M3).




                                                                                                                            161

The variation between countries is explained by general macro-economic factors such as GDP per capita, but offers little
insight into what might be affecting the behavior of women in particular.

To understand drivers of women’s insurance buying behavior, focus was shifted to the difference between men’s and
women’s insurance penetration. The gap between men and women is smaller in some markets than others (see Figure
M4), so a deeper understanding was needed on what market factors lead to greater parity between men’s and women’s
insurance purchase rates.

Using a cross sectional regression model, 197 data series were tested for their correlation with the gap between the rates
of men’s and women’s personally purchased health insurance. These data sets range across demographic, education,
employment, financial behavior, fiscal position, regulatory, and healthcare categories.

Through the regression, individual wealth (GDP per capita), fertility rate and women’s labor force participation rate were
found to have the biggest influence on the gap between men’s and women’s health insurance purchase rates. These
relationships were measured with a high degree of statistical confidence.

Countries with higher rates of individual wealth and women’s labor force participation tend to have a smaller gap
between men’s and women’s health insurance penetration. Hence, these variables were identified to have the strongest
influence in closing the gap between men’s and women’s insurance purchase rates.

Although these three variables were found, statistically, to have the strongest influence on the gap between men’s
and women’s insurance purchase rates, market interviews with insurance specialists identified that individual wealth
and labor force participation are the most relevant factors in influencing women’s purchase of insurance, due to
their increased ability and willingness to spend on insurance. Hence, only individual wealth and women’s labor force
participation were used as inputs for the market sizing exercise. Fertility rate is reflected in the qualitative findings of the
report as the number of dependents women have, a factor used to segment the women’s market.


4. Sizing the Women’s Insurance Market Opportunity

The size of the women’s insurance market is defined as the annual individual premium spend by women retail clients,
including spend by those who are self-employed. The market size does not include commercial lines (e.g. women
covered under employer plans), insurance spend by women on others (e.g., spend on children), or insurance purchases
women may have influence over or public spending on insurance for women.

Given the complexities of calculating and forecasting the premium volume opportunity within the insurance industry,
particularly at a global scale, these projections should be taken as indicative.




                                                                                                                                     163

Description of variables and calculations

i.	     Female labor force participation: As identified in the cross-section regression analysis above, labor force participation
        is an important variable that influences women’s insurance purchase rates. Interview findings substantiated that
        women who work will be more likely to purchase insurance due to access to income. Hence, female labor force
        participation was used as a basis to estimate the number of women who purchase insurance.159

ii.	    Percentage of women in the labor force who purchase personal insurance: Not all women in the labor force will
        purchase individual insurance. To the percentage of women who did, the percentage of the adult working
        population (15+) who purchased insurance160 was multiplied with the total adult population (male and female
        15 – 65)161 to get an estimate of the total number of insurance clients in each market. The percentage of women
        retail clients in select insurers’ portfolios was then used to determine the total number of women retail insurance
        clients in a market. This was then calculated as a percentage of the total female labor force.

iii.	 Female population 65+: Women who retired from the labor force also purchase individual insurance. The population
      of retired women was assumed to be all women over age 65.162

iv.	 Percentage of female population 65+ who receive a passive income: It was assumed that only women who earn a
     passive income (e.g. through pension)163 will be able to purchase insurance when they are retired.

v.	 Percentage of women who receive a passive income who purchase personal insurance: It was assumed that when
    women retire, a lower percentage will be willing to purchase personal insurance (compared to the percentage of
    employed women who purchase personal insurance — variable ii) given their decrease in income. The percentage
    of pensioned women who purchase insurance was estimated to be 70 percent164 of the percentage of employed
    women who purchase insurance.

Description of variables and calculations

vi.	 Total aggregate consumer insurance spend: Total aggregate value of consumer insurance spend within the market.165
     This includes life, private health, and property and casualty spend by individuals and self-employed, and does not
     include commercial lines insurance (e.g. does not include insurance provided by employers).

vii.	 Total aggregate consumer spending: Total aggregate value of all consumer spend within the market.166 For the
      purposes of calculating the market sizing, it was assumed that the total consumer spend represented the total
      income.

    Gender disaggregated data on total consumer insurance spend and total consumer spend was not available;
    therefore, it was assumed that men and women spend the same percentage of their consumer spending on
    insurance in 2013. However, women were projected to having a higher willingness to spend in 2030.

viii.	 Income per woman: Estimated earned income per woman at purchasing power parity.167 Pension income was
       calculated by applying a net pension replacement rate defined as the individual net pension entitlement divided
       by net pre-retirement earnings.168 Net pension replacement rate was assumed to be the best indicator of pension
       income earned by retired women.

Scenarios

In predicting the market size for 2030, a range of values is provided as two growth scenarios were considered:

1.	    Baseline growth (lower boundary of the range): Growth in the number of women customers and premium
       spend per customer due to improvements in the socioeconomic factors of women, with no changes to any other
       variables. This is the growth assuming that no efforts are made to target more women and/or to upsell/cross-sell to
       more women.

2.	    Opportunistic growth (upper boundary of the range): In addition to the socioeconomic improvements listed
       above, assume successful efforts in targeting more women to purchase insurance products (increasing the number
       of women who purchase insurance) and in upselling/cross-selling products to each woman (increasing the
       premium spend per woman).

Assumptions Made


 Assumption Type        Assumption Description

 Calculation            “Current Women’s Insurance Market Size” was calculated using premium data from 2013177
 Calculation            The women’s insurance market size for each product line was calculated by taking the ratio of
                        product line premium value to total premium volume for the total insurance industry,178 and applying
                        the ratio to the total women’s insurance market size. For example, the market size for the women’s
                        life insurance market was determined by calculating the ratio of the life insurance premium value to
                        the total insurance premium value for the entire insurance industry, and applying this ratio to the
                        total women’s insurance market size.
 Calculation            Due to limited data availability, the size of the non-life market was calculated by subtracting the size
                        of the life and health market from the overall market size
 Calculation            The growth rates (CAGR) for women’s labor force participation, women’s income, insurance
                        premium, insurance density, and percentage of the women’s population who purchase insurance
                        were applied consistently to the calculations for all product lines and for the overall market size
 Data                   Most recent data was used, with datasets ranging from 2010 – 2013.



Limitations:

Given the novelty of the topic, there are a number of data limitations in calculating the market size:

•	 Limited data was collected on the insurance needs of women in all income brackets and geographies (e.g., rural,
   urban) due to time constraints in the research. More research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of each
   segment’s needs and wants.

•	 No data was available across the markets on the total personal premium spend (across all product lines) by women
   on insurance, so insurance spending as a percentage of total consumer spending was identified as the most
   representative variable for each market. Note that insurance spend as percentage of total consumer spend is for 2013
   is not gender-specific (i.e., it is assumed that in 2013, men and women spend the same percentage of their income on
   insurance); however, women are projected to spend a higher percentage of income on insurance in 2030.

•	 Limited information was available on the percentage of women who hold insurance in each country, so projections
   were made based on financial inclusion reports and select insurers’ portfolios.

•	 Extrapolating the global insurance premium market size for women required averaging the values across many
   different markets, so care should be taken when making direct comparisons between the focus market and the global
   market.
