Abstract
This paper makes several contributions. First, it presents a “Guidance Note” on the framework for Social
Registries, anchoring the definition of these systems in their functions along the Delivery Chain and their social
policy role as inclusion systems, while clarifying terminology in a manner that is consistent with IT standards in
the discussion of their architecture as information systems. Second, it illustrates the diverse typologies and
trajectories of country experiences with Social Registries with respect to their (a) institutional arrangements
(central and local); (b) use as inclusion systems (coverage, single or multi-program use, static or dynamic intake
and registration); and (c) structure as information systems (structure of data management; degree and us of
interoperability with other systems). These patterns primarily derive from a review of Social Registries in a
sample of 20 countries), (Azerbaijan, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Djibouti, Georgia,
Indonesia, Macedonia, Mali, Mauritius, Mexico, Montenegro, Pakistan, the Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone,
Turkey, and Yemen). The paper also draws on experience in other countries (Kenya, Rwanda, Nigeria, Egypt,
Jordan, Vietnam, India, Estonia, Belgium, the US, Canada, Australia, and others) to illustrate specific points.
Third, this paper develops a basic “Assessment Tool” covering the core building blocks of Social Registries using
a “checklist” style of questions. Given the wide diversity of Social Registries in both their role in social policy and
in their architecture, the approach is not prescriptive: it does not advocate for any specific model or blueprint
for Social Registries. Any diagnostics or recommendations that emerge from use of this Guidance Note and
Assessment Tool will be country specific. Some key take-away messages include: (a) the importance of
recognizing both the role of the “front lines” for outreach, intake and registration (Social Registries as inclusion
systems) and the “back office” functions of Social Registries as information systems; (b) the potential power of
Social Registries as integrated and dynamic gateways for inclusion; (c) the recognition that Social Registries are
generally part of end-to-end systems for specific programs, integrated social protection information systems,
and/or even “whole-of-government” approaches; and (d) there is significant diversity in the typology and
trajectories of Social Registries across countries and over time.

Executive Summary
Many countries offer a myriad of social benefits and services to meet the diverse needs of their populations.
Examples of social benefits include cash transfers (conditional or unconditional) or in-kind benefits. Examples
of services include activation or social services for children, youth, parents, or the elderly; labor and activation
programs, and so forth. Although these programs may seem quite different, they usually pass through common
phases along the delivery chain, including: (a) determining potential eligibility, via outreach; intake &
registration; assessment of needs and conditions; (b) taking decisions on enrollment and the benefits or service
package; and (c) carrying out the implementation cycle of transactions (payments or service provision) and active
case management (including counseling, conditionalities monitoring, accompanying measures, grievance
redress, and so forth).

Social Registries support the first phase of this delivery chain. Specifically, Social Registries are information
systems that support outreach, intake, registration, and determination of potential eligibility for one or more
social programs. They have both a social policy role, as inclusion systems, and an operational role, as information
systems. While there are many technical aspects involved in designing and implementing Social Registries, their
role in social policy is actually quite simple: to provide a “gateway” for potential inclusion of intended
populations into social programs.

•   For individuals, families or households (“citizens”), this typically means knowing when and where they can
    register for potential inclusion, what is the process, what information and documents they will need to
    provide, how they can check on the status of their application or file a grievance, and when they will be
    notified of eligibility and enrollment decisions. It also means knowing when and where to update their
    information, and whether or not they can register at any time – particularly if their situations worsen. If
    multiple programs require separate applications, then citizens will have to navigate the bureaucratic maze
    and provide similar information and documentation multiple times – often at different locations. If multiple
    programs use common intake and registration “gateways” (as “Integrated Social Registries”), citizens can
    potentially gain access to a broad array of benefits and services, with far fewer transactions costs.
•   For Administrators, key functions include reaching out to intended populations to inform and reach them
    for intake and registration, collecting information and documentation from citizens (usually via application
    questionnaires taken in person or online, interviews, and possibly home visits), entering and managing the
    information, cross-checking for consistency and accuracy (including with other information systems),
    assessing potential eligibility against program-specific eligibility criteria, managing complaints and
    grievances, and so forth. These processes can be costly, particularly if social programs carry them out
    separately. Harmonizing expensive steps, such as intake and registration, can generate efficiencies and cost
    savings when multiple programs use an Integrated Social Registry – even if they each use program-specific
    eligibility criteria. Data validation and verification, oversight and controls, and interoperability can also boost
    information quality and accuracy.

In addition to supporting registration and eligibility functions, the data produced by Social Registries are also
used by countries for other purposes, such as calculating benefit levels, validating information collected through
other methods or sources, assessing potential demand for interventions, planning and costing interventions
depending on projected coverage rates, monitoring and evaluation, or other analytics purposes.

As inclusion systems, Social Registries can serve as a gateway to one program – or many programs. When
multiple programs us a common Social Registries (or “Integrated Social Registry”), they can play an important
social policy role in helping coordinate efforts to reach intended populations, thereby facilitating synergies
across programs aiming to deliver complementary benefits and services to common groups. In fact, Social
Registries can serve as a powerful platform that can extend well beyond social assistance programs. Many
countries use Integrated Social Registries to support determination of potential eligibility for a range of other
                                                                                                               iv
interventions, some targeted, some universal in nature. Examples include: subsidized health insurance, social
energy tariffs, education and training vouchers, subsidized child care, financial inclusion services, pro bono legal
services, and so forth. The advantages of using Integrated Social Registries for multiple programs can be
significant, in terms of reduced transactions costs and increased access for citizens, cost-savings and efficiency
for user programs, and coordination of social policy. Key ingredients for Integrated Social Registries include
inter-institutional coordination, common eligibility concepts and a shared intake questionnaire, and capabilities
for information sharing and data exchange.

Social Registries can also serve as “dynamic” gateways for inclusion of the poor and vulnerable, meaning that
access to registration is open and continuous, usually with on-demand applications combined with active
outreach to vulnerable populations. This dynamism is closely related to the human rights agenda and the
progressive realization of universal social protection, whereby anyone who needs social protection can access it
at any time. Despite the significance of the principle of dynamic inclusion, many countries operate registries
with “fixed lists” of registrants and beneficiaries. These systems are most common in developing countries,
where social assistance programs are rather new, coverage is small, fiscal space is constrained, and
administrative capacity limited. A typical approach is to conduct registration through waves of en masse data
collection (often called “census sweeps”), which are usually carried out every 4-5 years, with registration (and
updates) closed during the interim years. One of the reasons that many countries operate “fixed list systems”
is that many of the key ingredients for implementing dynamic inclusion systems remain elusive, including:
(a) fiscal space and flexibility; (b) political will to remove those who no longer qualify to make room for those
who do; (c) flexible eligibility criteria that can accommodate and signal changing circumstances; and (d) limited
administrative capacity, including a permanent and widespread network of access points for citizen interface.

Operationally, Social Registries are information systems. Information is the core input and output of Social
Registries. The main “inputs” to these systems include various types of information needed to determine
potential eligibility for social programs, which typically includes identifying information, socio-economic
information, information on housing and assets, and other types of information depending on the purpose of
the Social Registry. The main “outputs” of Social Registries are data that have been transformed into
standardized formats, indices, or aggregations that permit assessment of needs and conditions against program
eligibility criteria. This information is managed via information systems that intermediate between citizens,
programs, and institutions. The basic architecture for these information systems includes (a) data & information
(data intake, data exchange, data protection); (b) software applications to support both front-office and back-
office functions; (c) database management and interoperability; and (d) ICT infrastructure.

It is important to note, however, that Social Registries don’t operate in isolation – and are usually part of a much
larger information system supporting social programs. First, Social Registries are distinct from beneficiary
registries (or information systems that support management of specific programs) in their purposes, population
coverage, and functions. Whereas Social Registries include information on all registrants (applicants) and
support the “gateway” functions of intake, registration and determination of eligibility, Beneficiary Registries
include information only on those enrolled in specific programs to support beneficiary and benefits
administration. Second, both Social Registries and Beneficiary Registries are typically developed within a
broader information system – either to support a specific program or as part of an integrated social protection
information system for multiple programs. Other elements generally include benefits administration systems,
grievance redress systems, case management systems, unique identification systems, business intelligence and
analytics, interoperability framework, and so forth.

Interestingly, many countries, such as Brazil, operate Integrated Social Registries to support a common
“gateway” for potential inclusion in many programs – but then lack Integrated Beneficiary Registries to monitor
and coordinate “who receives what” across programs. Other countries, such as Kenya, operate an Integrated
Beneficiary Registry to coordinate beneficiary and benefits administration, but lack an Integrated Social Registry
                                                                                                                  v
to provide a common gateway for potential inclusion in various social programs. Some countries, such as Chile
and Turkey, have combined these approaches to create Integrated Social Protection Information Systems, which
can serve as powerful tools for assessing the “demand” for social programs by profiling specific needs and
conditions of various groups of the population (via Integrated Social Registries), monitoring and coordinating the
“supply” of social programs (via Integrated Beneficiary Registries), assessing gaps and duplications in coverage
of key bundles of benefits and services that could be tailored to the typical needs of profiled groups. When geo-
referenced, these systems can also facilitate crisis and disaster response.

Analysis of Social Registries in 20 countries (Azerbaijan, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic,
Djibouti, Georgia, Indonesia, Macedonia, Mali, Mauritius, Mexico, Montenegro, Pakistan, the Philippines,
Senegal, Sierra Leone, Turkey, and Yemen) reveals considerable diversity in the typologies and trajectories of
these systems with respect to their (a) institutional arrangements (central and local); (b) use as inclusion systems
(coverage, single or multi-program use, static or dynamic intake and registration); and (c) structure as
information systems (structure of data management; degree and us of interoperability with other systems).

•   Institutional Arrangements for managing and operating Social Registries at the central level vary
    significantly across countries. Several models are observed: (a) Social Registry hosted, managed, and
    operated by a “central social agency,” such as a social ministry (examples include: Azerbaijan’s VEMTAS,
    China’S RHPR, Chile’s RSH, Djibouti’s RSU, Georgia’s TSA Registry, Macedonia’s CBMIS, Mauritius’ SRM,
    Mexico’s SIFODE, Philippines’ Listahanan, Senegal’s RNU, Sierra Leone’s SPRINT, Turkey’s ISAS, and Yemen’s
    SWF Registry); (b) Social Registry hosted and managed by central social agency, but implemented by
    separate “operating agency” (examples include Brazil’s Cadastro Unico, Mali’s RSU, and Montenegro’s
    SWIS); (c) Social Registry managed and operated by other central agency (examples include: Colombia’s
    SISBEN, Dominican Republic’s SIUBEN, and Indonesia’s UDB); and (d) Social Registry managed and operated
    by a specific social program, but serving other agencies (e.g., Pakistan’s NSER). There is even more diversity
    in the “local” institutional arrangements for managing citizen interface. Among countries using on-demand
    application methods, all except Azerbaijan accept applications at local offices, although the jurisdiction may
    vary: (a) some use deconcentrated offices of the central social agency (e.g., China (provincial and local
    offices), Georgia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Mauritius, and Turkey); (b) others use offices of local municipal
    governments (e.g., Brazil, Chile, Colombia); and (c) others use a common application that can be submitted
    via intake and registration methods for numerous social programs (e.g., Mexico). Several countries in our
    sample also use electronic applications via digital service windows (e.g., Azerbaijan, Chile, Turkey). Among
    countries using en masse registration methods, (a) many use contracted field teams (Philippines, Colombia,
    Dominican Republic, Yemen); (b) others use communities and contracted field teams (Djibouti, Mali,
    Senegal, Sierra Leone); (d) some outsource to contracted firms (Pakistan) or NGOs (previously in Dominican
    Republic); and (e) one uses the field teams of the national statistics office for collection of registration data
    (Indonesia).
•   Coverage of Social Registries varies across countries. Some Social Registries have near universal coverage
    (Chile, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, Colombia). Others cover between one third and
    one half of the population (Brazil, Georgia, Indonesia, Mexico, Montenegro, and Turkey), with self-selection
    likely playing a role in deterring higher-income individuals or households from applying in those with on
    demand systems. Finally, others operate on a much smaller scale, either because they have been
    implemented in specific geographic areas before expanding to national coverage (e.g., China (rural areas
    RPHR), Djibouti, Mali, Senegal, Yemen) or because the programs they serve are very narrowly targeted (e.g.,
    Azerbaijan).
•   Most countries in our sample use Integrated Social Registries as gateways for multiple programs. Some
    use Social Registries for just one program (Azerbaijan, Yemen); others for a handful of programs (Senegal,
    Djibouti, Sierra Leone, Mauritius, Indonesia, Dominican Republic, China). Still others use Integrated Social
    Registries for dozens of programs (ranging from over a dozen in Georgia and Turkey, to around two dozen
    programs in Mexico, Macedonia, Montenegro, Brazil, and Colombia, and many more in the Philippines,
                                                                                                                   vi
    Pakistan, and Chile). All of the countries in our sample use their Social Registries for cash transfers (either
    conditional or unconditional), usually targeted to the poor, vulnerable, or low-income groups. Beyond cash
    assistance, many use Integrated Social Registries to support a wide range of benefits and services, some
    “targeted” and others “universal.” Examples include social pensions; health insurance or health care
    subsidies; utility & transport subsidies; education and skills; labor and employment programs; housing
    programs; sustainable livelihoods; agriculture, land, or environmental conservation; emergency assistance;
    in-kind benefits, social services; legal services; war veterans benefits; and a range of sub-national programs
    (often including similar types of benefits and services). Essentially, these Integrated Social Registries can
    serve as a powerful “multi-sided platform” across sectors, agencies, and programs. Generally, the larger the
    number of social programs that use the registry, the larger the coverage.
•   Some – but not all – countries in our sample operate Social Registries that support dynamic inclusion,
    meaning that anyone can register into the Social Registry at any time. Examples include: Azerbaijan’s
    VEMTAS, Brazil’s Cadastro Unico, Chile’s RSH, Georgia’s TSA Registry, Macedonia’s CBMIS, Mauritius’ SRM,
    Mexico’s SIFODE, Montenegro’s SWIS, and Turkey’s ISAS. Generally, on-demand methods for intake and
    registration lend themselves more to dynamic inclusion. In contrast, in those countries that rely primarily
    on en masse census sweeps, registration is typically open only infrequently, usually only every 4-5 years
    (e.g., in Pakistan’s NSER, the Philippines’ Listahanan, Dominican Republic’s SIUBEN, Indonesia’s UDB,
    Djibouti’s RSU, Sierra Leone’s SPRINT, Mali’s RSU, Senegal’s RNU, and Yemen’s SWF. En masse registration
    may be more feasible for countries that are “just starting out” – or with limited front-office capacity or severe
    data constraints. They can also be effective in specific regions with high rates of poverty. However, for
    those with long-standing Social Registries, a key question arises as to whether it makes more sense to
    continue with infrequent nationwide registration waves (which can be quite costly), or whether to invest
    resources in building capabilities for dynamic inclusion, particularly the network for citizen interface, that
    permit people to register and update their information at any time.
•   Finally, the architecture of Social Registries as information systems varies significantly in terms of the
    structure of data management and the degree of interoperability with other administrative systems. Some
    countries operate “self-contained” systems with little-to-no interoperability with other systems. Examples
    include: Yemen’s SWF, Djibouti’s RSU, Mali’s RSU, Senegal’s RNU, Sierra Leone’s SPRINT, Indonesia’s UDB,
    and the Listahanan in the Philippines. This approach is generally more feasible in countries with limited
    capacity or those “starting from scratch.” However, the challenges can involve stale data and limited means
    for verifying or validating data for errors. Other countries operate “centralized” data store with little-to-
    some interoperability. Examples include: Dominican Republic SIUBEN, Brazil Cadastro Unico, Pakistan NSER,
    China’s RPHR, Macedonia CBMIS, Georgia’s TSA Registry, Mexico’s SIFODE, Mauritius’ SRM, Azerbaijan
    VEMTAS, Colombia’s SISBEN, and Montenegro’s SWIS. This approach is more feasible in countries that have
    some existing capacity and are improving their ability to support more advanced information systems
    implementation, including interoperability capabilities. In addition, two countries in our sample operate
    centralized data stores, but with considerable interoperability: Chile’s RSH / SIIS and Turkey’s ISAS. This
    model is more feasible in countries that have built in-house capacity and have strengthened their ability to
    support more sophisticated information systems, with interoperability and integration frameworks.
    Advantages include improvements in updating, validation and verification of data and other efficiency gains.
    Finally, other countries operate “virtual” Social Registries using data virtualization technologies within an
    agile and highly interoperable framework for whole-of-government. Although none of the countries in our
    sample have adopted this model, countries such as Jordan and Egypt are experimenting with this approach,
    which is already being used in Belgium’s Crossroads Bank for Social Security (CBSS).

Clearly, the typology of Social Registries varies significantly across countries – and these systems are all evolving
over time along diverse trajectories. The “starting points matter” and no single model would fit every country’s
context, structures, capacities, and needs. Nonetheless, there are basic building blocks that are common across
most Social Registries, and these can be assessed using a “checklist” style Assessment Tool found at the end of
this paper.
                                                                                                                   vii
Chapter 1: Introduction

     A. Setting the Stage

Many countries offer a myriad of social benefits and services to meet the diverse needs of their populations.
Social benefits can include cash transfers (conditional or unconditional) targeted to poor and vulnerable families
or individuals (e.g., women, children, disabled, elderly), near cash transfers such as food stamps, subsidized
health insurance, subsidies (transport, utilities), in-kind benefits (such as nutrition supplements, school supplies),
in-work benefits, unemployment benefits, caregiver allowances, and so forth. Services can include family
services; intermediation counseling and psycho-social support services; ECD, child care and child protective
services; services for at-risk youth; training and skills programs; active labor market and activation services;
financial and productive inclusion services; legal services; social and long-term care services, and so forth.

Many of these benefits and services involve Social Protection and Labor (SPL) programs that help buffer people
from shocks and equip them to improve their livelihoods and create opportunities to build a better life for
themselves and their families. SPL programs generally include social safety nets, social insurance and pensions,
and labor market programs and services. SPL systems and programs evolve in complexity over time – and the
mix of instruments greatly depends on the country context and “starting point.” 2

In this context, a key question is “how?” How and where do people register for potential inclusion in these
programs? How is eligibility determined? How do programs make enrollment decisions? How are cash benefits
channeled to beneficiaries? How are services provided? These are all critical implementation phases for social
programs, with citizens, institutions, and information systems interacting all along that delivery chain.

One key aspect involves access: how to manage intake, registration, and determination of potential eligibility in
ways that promote inclusion (coverage and equity), efficiency (for people and providers), accuracy, and
transparency? This is the function of Social Registries, which are the focus of this paper. Social Registries 3 are
information systems that support outreach, intake, registration, and determination of potential eligibility for
one or more social programs. While there are many technical aspects involved in designing and implementing
Social Registries, their role in social policy is actually quite simple: to provide a “gateway” for potential inclusion
of intended populations into social programs.

•    For Citizens, 4 this typically means knowing when and where they can “apply” (register) for potential
     inclusion, what is the process, what information and documents they will need to provide, how they can
     check on the status of their application or file a grievance, and when they will be notified of eligibility and
     enrollment decisions. It also means knowing when and where to update their information, and whether or
     not they can register at any time – particularly if their situations worsen. If multiple programs require
     separate applications, then citizens will have to navigate the bureaucratic maze and provide similar
     information and documentation multiple times – often at different locations. If multiple programs use

3 The terminology for Social Registries varies across regions and the development community. Some other names include: registration
and eligibility systems, single registries, unified registries, “social cards,” beneficiary systems, household targeting systems, “SP
databases,” management information systems (MIS), and so forth. In this paper we seek to clarify this terminology, defining Social
Registries according to their functions, and overcoming “terminology confusion” by aligning with terminology on information systems
that is consistent with the IT world.
4 In this paper, we use the term “citizens” not to refer to nationality status, but rather to refer to people (individuals or families) in a

country. This is consistent with the terminology used in the “citizen-centered” service approaches that have been adopted in many
countries. When citizens (people) register in Social Registries, they can be called “registrants,” “applicants,” or “potential beneficiaries.”
When they are enrolled in specific programs, they care called “beneficiaries.”
                                                                                                                                            1
    common intake and registration “gateways” (as “Integrated Social Registries”), citizens can potentially gain
    access to a broad array of benefits and services, with far fewer transactions costs.
•   For Administrators, key functions include reaching out to intended populations to inform and reach them
    for intake and registration, collecting information and documentation from citizens (usually via application
    questionnaires taken in person or online, interviews, and possibly home visits), entering and managing the
    information, cross-checking for consistency and accuracy (including with other information systems),
    assessing potential eligibility against program-specific eligibility criteria, managing complaints and
    grievances, and so forth. These processes can be costly, particularly if social programs carry them out
    separately. Harmonizing expensive steps, such as intake and registration, can generate efficiencies and cost
    savings when multiple programs use an Integrated Social Registry – even if they each use program-specific
    eligibility criteria. Data validation and verification, oversight and controls, and interoperability can also boost
    information quality and accuracy.
•   For Social Policy more broadly, common gateways (Integrated Social Registries) can help coordinate efforts
    to reach intended populations, thereby facilitating synergies across programs aiming to deliver
    complementary benefits and services to common groups. In fact, Social Registries can serve as a powerful
    platform that can extend well beyond social assistance programs, supporting determination of potential
    eligibility for other interventions, such as subsidized health insurance, social energy tariffs, education and
    training vouchers, subsidized child care, financial inclusion services, pro bono legal services, and so forth.
    Social Registries can also promote inclusion, by providing access to social programs by poor and vulnerable
    populations, giving them access to a broader set of social benefits and services that may not otherwise be
    accessible for those on the bottom of the economic distribution. When Social Registries allow for continuous
    registration at any time, these “dynamic gateways” can facilitate progressive realization of universal access
    to social protection. Indeed, many core features of Social Registry can be designed in compliance with
    human rights standards, including the principles of non-discrimination, transparency and access to
    information, and accountability.

In addition to supporting registration and eligibility functions, the data produced by Social Registries are also
used by countries for other purposes, such as calculating benefit levels (e.g., for health insurance subsidies or
cash transfers), validating information collected through other methods or sources, assessing potential demand
for interventions, planning and costing interventions depending on projected coverage rates, monitoring and
evaluation, or other analytics purposes.

    B. Objectives, Basic Premises, and Value Added of this Paper

This paper has three main objectives: (a) presenting a “Guidance Note” on the framework for Social Registries;
(b) illustrating the diverse typologies and trajectories of country experiences with Social Registries; and (c)
developing a basic “Assessment Tool” covering the core building blocks of Social Registries using a “checklist”
style of questions, recognizing that there is no single model or blueprint and that these systems evolve over
time.

Although the paper is focused on Social Registries for “social assistance,” it emphasizes that they have been used
for multiple benefits and services that extend well beyond social assistance in many countries. This social policy
role also pivots, however, on the ability of Social Registries to serve as “dynamic gateways” for continuous
inclusion.
This paper builds on existing literature (see bibliography) plus “live case” knowledge of, or direct involvement
in, a diverse array of Social Registries in numerous countries – by the authors or fellow World Bank staff, working
closely with registry administrators. It builds on three key basic premises:

(a) The definition of Social Registries is anchored in their functions along the Delivery Chain for social programs,
    highlighting their role in supporting the implementation phases of outreach, intake & registration, and
                                                                                                                  2
    assessment of needs and conditions to determine potential eligibility for inclusion in selected social
    program(s);
(b) We clarify terminology that is consistent with both social policy and with IT standards , thus overcoming the
    significant “terminology confusion” that has plagued social protection experts and the development
    community, both within and among themselves and in working with IT professionals for the development
    of these information systems;
(c) We recognize that there is considerable diversity in country experiences with Social Registries, and thus a
    broad range of typologies and trajectories in terms of their social policy roles, basic architecture, and
    institutional arrangements.

With those basic premises, this paper brings value added to the knowledge base on Social Registries by:

(a) Elaborating on the social policy role of Social Registries as inclusion systems, and as their operation as
    information systems;
(b) Illustrating the diverse typologies and trajectories of country experiences with Social Registries in terms of
    three key features: (i) central and local institutional arrangements; (ii) characteristics of their role as inclusion
    systems: coverage, integration for use by multiple programs, and dynamic inclusion for access to intake,
    registration and updating by anyone at any time; and (iii) characteristics of their architecture as information
    systems: degree of interoperability with other systems and structure of database management.
(c) Developing basic guidance on the “nuts and bolts” aspects of, and core questions for assessing, Social
    Registries, recognizing that there is no single model or blueprint and that these systems evolve over time.

    C. Delineating the Boundaries of this Paper

As information systems that support registration and determination of potential eligibility for social programs,
Social Registries have important links to “upstream topics,” such as the design of eligibility criteria, and
“downstream topics,” such as the management of social benefits (payments administration, case management
and so forth). It is beyond the scope of this paper, however, to get into depth in either of these topics.

Upstream Topics: “Targeting” & Eligibility Criteria. Eligibility criteria for social programs vary, and are program
specific. Programs can be universal, such that the entire population is eligible. Programs can be geographically
targeted, such that the entire population living in a selected area is eligible. Programs can be categorical, such
that anyone with certain characteristics as age, gender, or disability status are eligible. Programs can be
“targeted” according to the “welfare” of an individual or of a family/household, which can be measured in
monetary terms (as income or consumption) and/or non-monetary terms (as assets index, possession of certain
goods, or other socio-economic variables). When social programs are targeted, formal eligibility criteria are
established, using some form of means testing (when they can be measured and verified), hybrid-means testing
(when income information is complemented with an estimation assets or other for non-verifiable welfare
measures), proxy means testing (PMT, when welfare is estimated via a combination of proxy variables, due to
high levels of informality or prevalence of non-verifiable measures), multi-dimensional poverty indices, or other
measures of socio-economic status that can be correlated with welfare status. Social programs can also combine
eligibility criteria, for example, channeling benefits to the poor elderly (combination of categorical plus targeted
criteria) or to the poor living in a particular area (combination of geographic plus targeted criteria).

As inclusion systems, Social Registries are useful tools for supporting intake, registration, and assessment of
needs and conditions against program-specific eligibility criteria. The literature on the design and effectiveness
of these different criteria is extensive, and this paper does not dive into analysis or discussions of those topics. 5

Rather, it takes the eligibility criteria for specific programs as given, and focuses instead on the “how-tos” of
Social Registry systems. Given the pre-defined selection of eligibility criteria, Social Registries do involve building
and operating business rules and logic to incorporate these criteria for the assessment of needs and conditions
in order to determine potential eligibility for social programs in practice. Beyond this paper, one potential
direction for future research would be to examine how the design of these eligibility criteria could be influenced
by improvements in capacities and technology used in Social Registries.

Downstream Topics: Benefits administration and Integrated Social Information Systems. Social Registries
support the processes of outreach, intake and registration, and assessment of needs and conditions for the
determination of potential eligibility for social programs. As such, the information included in Social Registries
covers the population of all registrants (applicants), not just those selected as beneficiaries for a particular
program. Conceptually and functionally, Social Registries are thus distinct from “Beneficiary Registries” or
benefits administration systems, which support the processes of payments transactions, service delivery, or
program case management. Clearly, these systems are linked – and they are not always developed separately.
In fact, when a Social Registry is designed to serve just one program, it may be developed as a core module of
the broader information system used to manage that program – albeit with the population included in the Social
Registry covering all registrants (applicants), whereas the population included in other modules of that
information system covering just selected beneficiaries. When an Integrated Social Registry serves multiple
programs, information on potential eligibility for specific programs would be channeled to the specific
information systems used for managing those programs.

Many countries have developed Integrated Social Protection Information Systems, which integrate functional
modalities for Social Registries (supporting intake, registration, determination of eligibility), Beneficiary and
Benefits Administration, Payments Administration, Case Management (including conditionalities monitoring),
Grievances and Appeals, Business Intelligence, and Interoperability with other systems. While it is beyond the
scope of this paper to discuss these systems in depth, this paper does illustrate how Social Registries would
interact with Beneficiary Registries, and how they would be situated within these broader Integrated Social
Protection Information Systems.

    D. Road Map to the Paper

This paper is structured in three broad parts:

•   Part 1 (Chapters 2, 3, 4) presents the framework for Social Registries. Chapter 2 reviews the basic concepts
    and terminology around Social Registries. Chapter 3 dives deeper into the functioning of Social Registries as
    inclusion systems, and reviews the social policy role of “Integrated Social Registries” to serve as common
    “gateways” for multiple programs, as well as the role of Social Registries in supporting dynamic inclusion of
    the poor and vulnerable, highlighting the relevance to the human rights agenda and the progressive
    realization of universality of social protection, which holds that anyone who needs social protection should
    be able to access it at any time. Chapter 4 discusses the architecture of Social Registries as information
    systems, and their role within the context of broader Integrated Social Protection Information Systems. In
    this section, country examples are included to illustrate specific points, such as processes or structures,
    either through boxes or passing references.
•   Part 2 (Chapters 5 and 6) reviews cross-country experience with Social Registries, reviewing the
    framework “in practice.” This section draws on direct World Bank staff experience with “live case” country
    engagements and primary reference materials from numerous countries. Although the study focuses
    primarily on the Social Registries in 20 countries, including: Azerbaijan, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, the
    Dominican Republic, Djibouti, Georgia, Indonesia, Macedonia, Mali, Mauritius, Mexico, Montenegro,
    Pakistan, the Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Turkey, and Yemen, it also draws on the examples of Social

                                                                                                                     4
     Registries in other countries are also included to illustrate specific points (e.g., for Kenya, Rwanda, Nigeria,
     Egypt, Jordan, Vietnam, India, Estonia, Belgium, the US, Canada, Australia and others). Building on this
     experience, Chapter 5 illustrates the diverse typologies and trajectories for Social Registries, in terms of:
     (a) institutional arrangements (central and local); coverage; (b) coverage (c) social policy roles; and
     (d) degree of interoperability with other systems. Chapter 6 gives a brief overview of the types of costs that
     may be involved in developing and operating Social Registries. Annex 1 serves as an anchor for these
     chapters on cross-country experiences, with an overview of each of the Social Registries in each of these
     countries.
•    Part 3 (Chapter 7) presents the Assessment Tool. Specifically, Chapter 7 presents guidance on the basic
     building blocks of Social Registries, as well as a “checklist” style set of questions for assessing these nuts and
     bolts. Given the wide diversity of Social Registries in their role in social policy and their architecture, the
     Assessment Tool is not meant to be prescriptive, nor is it advocating for any specific model or blueprint for
     Social Registries. Moreover, the checklist is not meant to be exhaustive – and not all questions will be
     relevant for all systems and contexts. Any diagnostics or recommendations that emerge from its application
     will be country specific.

It is important to emphasize that these Social Registries are highly diverse across countries. Moreover, these
systems evolve over time – and the “starting points” matter. As such, the paper presents information on country
cases using the latest information available at this point in time, usually covering the most recent structures
from the period circa 2015-17. Inevitably, these systems will continue to evolve, and as such, the country
examples will gradually become “out-of-date.” As such, they are included primarily to illustrate specific aspects
of Social Registries (in Chapters 3 and 4) or cross-country patterns in these typologies and trajectories (in Chapter
5). Their illustrative value will hopefully remain, however, in terms of the specific processes and patterns being
explained. Moreover, the overall framework of the Guidance Note and Assessment Tool would be expected to
have longer shelf-life, as the functions of outreach, intake, registration, and determination of eligibility have
always been part of the delivery chain for most social programs and their supporting systems.

Chapter 2: Terminology: What are Social Registries?
So, what are social registries? What do they aim to do? How does this relate to delivering social programs and
services? How do they operate? How are they structured? Succinctly, Social Registries are information systems
that support outreach, intake, registration, and determination of potential eligibility for one or more social
programs. They have both a social policy role, as inclusion systems, and an operational role, as information
systems. This Chapter seeks to clarify the definition and concept of social registries on two these levels.

     A. Social Registries are Inclusion Systems

In terms of their core social policy function, Social Registries are inclusion systems. 6 They provide a “gateway”
for people (individuals, families) to register and be considered for potential inclusion in one or more social
programs based on an assessment of their needs and conditions. That assessment usually takes into account



6 Interestingly, although the objective of Social Registries is to promote inclusion of intended populations, the driving force behind the
development of some of these systems was actually the need to curb corruption or reduce inclusion errors and exclude those who should
not be receiving benefits. This emphasis on excluding unintended potential beneficiaries (and thus reducing errors of inclusion) is more
prominent with Social Registries that support a single program that is narrowly targeted to specific groups. However, as many Social
Registries have shifted towards supporting multiple programs, and even interventions that tend to be universal in nature (such as
subsidized health insurance and others), the coverage of Social Registries has expanded greatly to support their role as inclusion systems.
Moreover, since enrolment decisions are taken by user programs according to their own criteria (shown in the pink shaded section of
Figure 1), those “targeting decisions” are not specifically in the purview of the Social Registry.
                                                                                                                                         5
measures of socio-economic status, categorical factors or a combination of both, which are often factors used
by programs in prioritizing eligibility for benefits and services.

More specifically, from a functional perspective, Social Registries are information systems that support
registration and determination of potential eligibility for social programs. Along the “Delivery Chain,” they
support the phases of outreach, intake & registration, and assessment of needs and conditions to determine
potential eligibility for inclusion in selected social program(s) (the blue shaded panel of Figure 1). Social
Registries can serve one or multiple programs, as discussed in more detail below. These functions require
structures and processes for citizen interface, for example via mobile teams, at local offices, or via digital service
windows. They also require clear legal and institutional arrangements, including designation and capacity of the
“host agency” for developing and operating the Social Registry, as well as for agencies managing the user
programs. Finally, as information systems, Social Registries intermediate as a bridge between citizens on the
one hand, and institutions (Social Registry operators, social programs) on the other hand.

In terms of population covered, social registries contain information on all registrants, whether or not they
are deemed eligible for, or enrolled in, select social programs. In this paper, people (individuals, families,
households) that are registered in Social Registries are referred to as “registrants” or “applicants.” A key feature
of social registries is that they maintain information on all those who register – whether or not they are
determined eligible for social programs. This feature is important for many reasons. First, it allows for the Social
Registry to serve multiple programs, which may have different eligibility criteria or thresholds. Second, it allows
for transparency and social accountability in the determination of eligibility and record-keeping. Such
information is needed to allow people to file appeals or grievances and support eventual reviews of their
potential eligibility for social programs. Third, these data support the use of the Social Registry for policy
analytics, such as monitoring inclusion, planning and costing of interventions, assessing potential demand for
social programs, program monitoring and reporting, analytics, and so forth. In other words, the population
covered by Social Registries includes all potential beneficiaries of SPL programs defined as the intended
population to be treated under the system.

Importantly, Social Registries are distinct from “Beneficiary Registries,” both in function and in population
coverage (Box 1). Both Social Registries and Beneficiary Registries are related components of broader
                                                                                                                           6
information systems for managing social programs, as discussed further in Section 4.B below. Yet the two are
distinct in several ways, and it is important to not confuse these terms. In terms of purposes, Social Registries
have the function of registering individuals, families or households (called “registrants” or “applicants”) and
determining potential eligibility for social program(s), as shown in the blue shaded panel of Figure 1. In contrast,
Beneficiary Registries track information on beneficiaries and benefits to support program management and
implementation (payments, case management, conditionalities monitoring, grievance redress; see pink and
purple shaded sections of Figure 1). In terms of population coverage, Social Registries gather and retain
information on all registrants (applicants), whether or not they are eventually enrolled in social program(s) since
there is no guarantee that application or registration in the Social Registry would provide any entitlement to a
program. In contrast, Beneficiary Registries maintain information only on beneficiaries of specific program(s).
As such, by definition, Beneficiary Registries would not be used for “targeting decisions” or determination of
(potential) eligibility for programs because they only contain information on people or households who have
already been deemed eligible for, or enrolled in, the program. 7

However, it is important to note that Social Registries are not necessarily developed as “separate entities”
from broader information systems for social programs. As shown in Figure 1, Social Registries support key
“upstream” processes along the Delivery Chain for a single or multiple social programs. In some cases, these
Social Registries are developed as specific modules of broader information systems. In the case of a single social
program, they may be embedded in the end-to-end functions and information system for that program. This
situation is common when a program beneficiary registry starts to evolve towards a Social Registry in terms of
functions, and even branches to serve other programs. And in some cases, the program(s) remain the point of
entry: people apply for benefits of a particular program and may then be considered for potential eligibility for
other programs. In other words, implementation phases such as outreach, intake, and registration may be
managed through a specific program, and the Social Registry may not be managed as a separate entity per se.
Examples of various models of Social Registries – both as separate entities and as embedded functions – are
included in subsequent Chapters of this paper (particularly in Chapters 3 and 4).

On a related note, it is important to highlight that not all countries operate Social Registries. Some countries
(or programs) do not record information on all applicants for a social program(s). They don’t use Social Registries
to support the functions of intake, registration, and assessment of needs and conditions to determine potential
eligibility for social programs. Rather, they gather information only on beneficiaries, on the basis of enrollment
decisions that are taken “outside the system.” For example, with community-based targeting mechanisms,
communities or local councils take enrollment decisions without recording information on all potential
beneficiaries. Instead, once these enrollment decisions, information on beneficiaries is recorded in beneficiary
registries and used in benefits administration systems. One downside to this approach is that the lack of records
on all applicants (or potential beneficiaries) prevents social accountability mechanisms such as grievance redress
systems to manage appeals and other complaints by those who are not enrolled as beneficiaries in social
programs.




7 One exception to this is if the Beneficiary Registry for one program is used as the basis for determining eligibility for another program
(i.e., those eligible for program X will be considered for eligibility for, or be guaranteed access to, program Y).

Social Registries are also distinct in function from population or family registries, although they can have
important synergies. 8 Countries operate various types of “registries,” each with their own specific objectives
and functions. Population registries are individualized information systems that serve as a continuous “real-
time” recording of selected demographic information pertaining to each member of the resident population of
a country, including date and place of birth, sex, date and place of death, date of arrival/departure and
citizenship. Some countries maintain family or household registries, which are civil registries used to track
individual ties to families, such as births, deaths, marriages, divorces, and so forth. Typically, population and
household registries do not collect socio-economic information that would be used to determine potential
eligibility for social programs. Nonetheless, where population and family registries exist and are maintained
with full coverage and accuracy in real time, Social Registries can derive important synergies from these valuable
sources of updated information on individual and household demographics.

       B. Social Registries are Information Systems

Operationally, Social Registries are information systems. This has been a source of confusion in the literature,
and between the SP and IT worlds. Some of the confusion stems from the tendency to define social registries
as “mere databases,” implying separate software applications to systematize and transform information. This
is because the term “registry,” can imply “a database or place where information is kept.” This separation of the
“database” and software applications results in confusion between development practitioners and IT experts. It
is also problematic because Social Registries do not function in isolation as “just a database” without
complementary software applications and business logic. Rather, we avoid this separation recognizing that a
Social Registry is a “brand name” that is defined by the function as an information system that collects, organizes,
stores, processes, transforms, creates and distributes information for the predefined purpose of supporting
outreach, intake and registration, assessment of needs and conditions, and determination of potential eligibility
for social programs (as discussed above). To accomplish those predefined goals, Social Registry Information
Systems (or “Social Registries” in shorthand) make use of a variety of system elements, namely: (a) data and


8   Palacios (2014).
                                                                                                                            8
information; (b) software; (c) database management; and (d) ICT infrastructure, as well as institutional aspects
(people, procedures, documentation, etc.), as discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.

Indeed, information is the core input and output of Social Registries. The main “inputs” to the system include
various types of information needed to determine potential eligibility for social programs, and for this reason
many end up calling the Social Registry a database. The specific data content is usually determined by the
eligibility criteria applied by the various “user programs” (one or multiple programs), depending on whether
they are using means and asset testing, proxy means testing, multi-dimensional poverty indices, other measures
of welfare, individual characteristics, or a combination of criteria. Such information typically includes:

    (a) Identifying information and household composition, such as name, birth date, gender; relationship with
        household head; marital status; unique identifiers such as a national or functional ID number;
    (b) Geospatial identifying information on the location of the household, including address and other contact
        information, as well as GPS geo-coding information (where possible);
    (c) Socio-economic status such as self-reported and/or verified information on incomes for each household
        member; education, and employment status of each individual;
    (d) Information 9 on housing and assets, such as housing characteristics (e.g. type of housing material,
        connection to water, electricity, and so forth), self-reported and/or verified information on assets (e.g.
        vehicle, land, livestock, etc.); and
    (e) Other information depending on the purpose of the Social Registry (such as disability status, access to
        services, health, food security status, registration with employment agencies, etc.).
The primary “outputs” of social registries are data that have been transformed into standardized formats or
aggregations that permit assessment of needs and conditions against program eligibility criteria (such as
means-tested incomes, proxy means scores, etc.). These “outputs” can vary across multiple program users if
they have different eligibility criteria or thresholds – as long as the data are gathered by means of the Social
Registry and the user programs share common “data dictionaries” and concepts for the variables included.




Chapter 3: The Functioning of Social Registries as Inclusion Systems
This Chapter dives deeper into how Social Registries function as inclusion systems (whereas the next Chapter
elaborates on their operation and structure as information systems). It opens by unpacking the basic functions
of Social Registries, illustrating how various functions and processes along the delivery chain can be mapped to
specific actors. The Chapter then explores the potentially powerful social policy role of an Integrated Social
Registry serving as “common gateway” for multiple programs - in social protection and beyond. It also examines
the degree to which Social Registries serve as “dynamic gateways” for continuous inclusion such that they allow
anyone to register or update their information to be considered for potential eligibility for social programs at
any time.

    A. A Deeper Look at Basic Functions of Social Registries along the Delivery Chain

As discussed above, the starting point for defining Social Registries is based on their core functions along the
Delivery Chain. Specifically, Social Registries support outreach, intake and registration, and assessment of needs
and conditions to determine potential eligibility for social programs. These are broad implementation phases.
As “business processes,” each phase has several activities supporting the major task of the phase. Each activity

9Such information sometimes includes (geo-coded) photographs of dwellings and assets, which can help with verification and quality of
data. Consent should be obtained to take and use photographs in this way.
                                                                                                                                   9
has inputs from the previous phase and outputs to the subsequent phase. These phases can be further broken
down into additional steps that define specific details regarding how each phase works, what triggers it, what
inputs and outputs are needed, and so forth. Some of these functions involve the “front office” – such as
outreach, intake and registration – whereas others are primarily “back-office” functions – such as assessment of
needs and conditions to determine potential eligibility for social programs.

Outreach

Outreach fosters basic awareness and understanding about the role and functioning of the Social Registry and
its relation to social programs. A key aspect of outreach involves communication, to inform the intended
population about possible social programs that they may be eligible for – and to inform them about the
processes for registering in the Social Registry. If registration processes serve just one social program, then the
communications would focus on the main features of that program (objectives, eligibility criteria, rights and
responsibilities). If the registration processes are “common” or “shared” across programs (as in the case of
Integrated Social Registries, as discussed below), then the communications need to cover the main features of
those diverse programs (objectives, eligibility criteria for the various sets of programs, and so forth). In either
case, communications should clearly emphasize that simply registering is no guarantee of eligibility or
enrollment for that program or set of programs. And, such communications should clearly explain the processes
involved in the Social Registry, including the registration process (interview, home visit, questionnaire or
application form), the type of information and documentation that would be needed, the processes for
notification of potential eligibility or enrollment in social programs, processes for grievances and appeals, and
so forth. Strategic communication tools can also be used to build broader awareness about the social policy
roles of Social Registries as inclusion systems (see Box 2 for examples).

Active Outreach can be essential for promoting potential inclusion of marginalized groups – for eventual
consideration of eligibility for social programs. If the Social Registry is to serve its “inclusion” role, it is important
that it cover as many potential recipients of social assistance (or other “user programs”) as possible. Active
efforts are often needed to proactively reach out to marginalized groups, such as indigenous populations,
homeless families, the disabled, and so forth, who may otherwise be excluded. Active outreach efforts are
particularly important with “on-demand” intake and registration methods since such marginalized populations
may be unaware of the processes for intake and registration in Social Registries as gateways for potential
inclusion in social programs. Even with en masse registration approaches, key population groups can be missed
without special active outreach methods. Countries have used a variety of active outreach strategies (see Box 2
for examples).




                                                                                                                       10
                               Box 2 – Outreach and Communications in Social Registries

Countries have used a variety of active outreach and communication strategies to build awareness and understanding
of Social Registries among stakeholders and reach out to marginalized groups who may otherwise be excluded. Some
examples include:
“Busca Activa” in Brazil’s Cadastro Unico. Brazil’s Social Registry the Cadastro Único (Cadúnico) has operated on an
on-demand basis since 2007. This means that anyone can come register and apply for benefits from the Bolsa Familia
Program and many other benefits and services that use the Cadúnico as an integrated gateway – at any time (dynamic
inclusion). By 2012, over 22 million families had registered into the Cadúnico (about 40% of the population). However,
the Ministry of Social and Development (renamed to Ministry of Social and Agrarian Development in 2016) was
concerned that the program was missing some extremely poor families, particularly hard-to-reach groups such as
indigenous and other ethnic communities, the disabled, the homeless, those living and working in trash dumps, people
working in extractive industries, fishermen, people living in remote areas, and so forth. As such, the Government
developed an Active Search strategy under its “Brasil Sem Miséria” (Brazil Without Poverty) initiative with the goal of
finding and registering all extremely poor families that had not yet been included in the Cadúnico. This new outreach
strategy was developed and implemented at the municipal level, with financing of a specific plan from the federal
government. The strategy followed an active search process based on the philosophy that it was the responsibility of
the state to go to high-poverty areas to find the poor who may otherwise be missed in the Social Registry, rather than
waiting for them to enroll on demand. More specifically, the efforts targeted specific populations – whose under-
registration in social programs had been identified through statistical analysis that combined poverty maps and
administrative data from the Cadúnico. The strategy included door-to-door visits by social workers, visits of mobile
“social assistance” vans to remote localities, as well as partnerships with government and civil society agencies
following a snowball approach that first visited a household enrolled in the Cadúnico to inquire about friends or
families nor enrolled, so that they could start finding those families. Partners included health community agents and
even electric power concessionaires. The principle was: for populations that were not able to “pursue their rights,” the
“rights would find them.” Locations used for registering the poor included schools. The initiative was a success and
resulted registering more than one million additional extreme poor families into the Cadúnico over the span of a year.
All of these newly registered families had previously been excluded from social programs, and most were deemed
eligible based on an assessment of their needs and conditions in the Cadúnico, thereby facilitating their enrollment in
social programs, including Bolsa Família.
Mexico: In the case of Mexico, the administrators faced a different challenge of outreach in urban areas. After several
experiences with disappointing results in the take-up by the urban population, a strategy was implemented which
included determining the location of temporary registration centers by careful analysis of data and estimates of the
potential population. Mexico also introduced traveling units that organized meetings with small groups to explain the
registration process.
Outreach & Strategic Communication for the Listahanan of the Philippines: In the case of the Philippines, registration
into the Listahanan (national household targeting system) is carried out using en masse data collection efforts once
every few years. Even with these “census-sweep” approaches, there is always the risk of missing marginalized,
remote, or otherwise hard-to-serve populations. During the recent nationwide data collection effort in 2015, the
Department for Social Work and Development (DSWD) developed an active outreach strategy that involved close
cooperation with local governments to assist enumerators in penetrating remote and hard-to-reach populations,
including with mobile teams on small boats, canoes, and other forms of adaptive transportation. Special efforts were
also made to reach people living in trash dumps without a fixed address. The Listahanan has also set a global example
in the use of strategic communications to build awareness and understanding. This was particularly important due to
previous misunderstandings of the role of the household targeting system vs the Pantawid conditional cash transfer
program, which was the flagship program managed by DSWD. As the Listahanan moved to serve as an Integrated
Social Registry for multiple programs, it was imperative that people would understand its distinct role as an inclusion
system for consideration of potential eligibility for multiple programs, as well as the process for intake and registration.
DSWD market-tested and adopted a clear branding (logo and tagline) for the Listahanan that conveyed its objectives as
an accurate and objective system of inclusion. DSWD also developed innovative communication strategies for various
stakeholders.

Intake & Registration

Intake and Registration involves the process of collecting self-reported information and documentation to
register the intended population for consideration of potential eligibility for social programs. This phase
represents the formal entry point into the Social Registry system. It includes several key elements, including: (a)
data collection and entry; (b) questionnaire and supporting documents; and (c) the interview process and home
visits.

The specific methods used for intake and registration vary. Data collection can be “supply driven,” “demand-
driven,” or a mix. With “supply-driven” approaches, individuals or families haven’t asked to be registered or
“applied for benefits.” Rather, field teams typically come to them with registration questionnaires that are
applied “en masse” to all or most individuals or families in a particular community or region, usually via door-to-
door methods. This approach aims to ensure inclusion of populations that may otherwise be missed, particularly
when active outreach methods are used (See Box 2). With “demand-driven” approaches, individuals or families
are take the initiative to register into the Social Registry, either in person or electronically. Application forms
are typically filled out on paper or electronically, and interviews are typically carried out at local offices and/or
via scheduled home visits. Mixed approaches combined both supply-driven and demand-driven approaches
(e.g., with active search methods that are used to ensure that marginalized groups are registered, while others
apply via on-demand registration). In this paper, we refer to individuals, families, and household that are
included in Social Registries as both “registrants” (which is more applicable with en masse registration methods)
and “applicants” (which is more applicable with on demand registration methods).

Another key aspect of Intake and Registration is the questionnaire (application form) and required
documentation. The questionnaire should gather relevant information needed to determine potential eligibility
for social program(s). 10 Human-centered design principles should be adopted to make the questionnaire user-
friendly: not too long in terms of number of questions or time taken to administer, and easy to comprehend and
navigate, both for the interviewer and for the registrants (applicants). The specific data content is usually
determined by the eligibility criteria applied by the various “user programs” (one or multiple programs). If
multiple programs use information in the Social Registry to determine potential eligibility, then core concepts
and variables should be harmonized across programs such that the relevant information is collected for all
programs (even if specific eligibility criteria or thresholds vary across programs), as discussed in more detail
below. Key supporting documents (such as national unique identification with biometric data) are sometimes
also required, but it is important to avoid excessive documentation requirements that present barriers to
inclusion or impose undue time, costs, or visits that could deter people from registering. It is also important at
the intake phase that everyone registered is informed of, and can give consent to, the planned use of the
information and ensured of personal data protection (as discussed in more detail in Chapter 4 below).

The interview process, sometimes combined with home visits, is another central step in the Intake &
Registration phase in many Social Registries. Interviewers must be well trained in effective interviewing
techniques, culturally-sensitive adaptations, managing expectations, technology-assisted interview methods (if
used), and so forth, regardless of data collection methods or the locations where registration is carried out.

Assessment of Needs & Conditions to Determine Potential Eligibility

A critical “back-office” function of Social Registries is the automation of the processes for assessing needs and
conditions to determine potential eligibility for social programs. As discussed above, Social Registries collect a

10   Unless key variables can be provided via data exchange from other reliable administrative information systems.
                                                                                                                      12
range of information on categorical characteristics (age, gender, household composition, disability status) and
socio-economic factors (incomes, employment, property, assets, education, etc.). The data required for these
processes can come from (a) self-reported information from the questionnaire & interview process (intake &
registration); and (b) data exchange with other administrative systems via interoperability. This information is
then transformed into measures of welfare (such as means-testing, hybrid means testing, proxy means test
scores, multi-dimensional poverty scores, etc.) and then compared to pre-defined eligibility criteria for user
program(s) to determine potential eligibility. This process is automated through the software applications
component of the Social Registry that supports the business rules and logic to carry out these algorithms.

It is important to note that the determination of eligibility by the Social Registry is distinct from enrollment in
social program(s). Determination of eligibility involves assessing needs and conditions vis-à-vis basic eligibility
criteria for social program(s), whereas Enrollment Decisions involves formal inclusion of eligible individuals or
families in a specific program. Eligible registrants (applicants) are not always or automatically enrolled in a
particular program due to: (a) budgetary limitations that can limit space and coverage such that enrollment is
determined on a first-come-first served basis with waiting lists; or (b) additional criteria guiding enrollment
decisions, beyond socio-economic needs & conditions, such as geographic prioritization, other categorical risk
factors, etc. Moreover, the institutional jurisdiction of these phases can differ: enrollment decisions are the
jurisdiction and legal responsibility of the user program(s) not the Social Registry. This is particularly important
if the Social Registry is managed by a host institution that is different from the user program(s), as discussed in
more detail in the next Chapter.

Processes for Updating Information

Updating of information – and reassessment 11 of needs and conditions – is another key function of Social
Registries. Outdated or static information on socio-economic status can lead to inaccuracies in the
determination of eligibility and calculation of benefit levels. The socio-economic situations of individuals and
households can change in many ways in terms of: their demographics (births, deaths, marriages, divorces);
addresses and location (moving residence, internal or external migration, displacement); economic status, such
as incomes (lost wages, promotions, changes in pension or other benefits, changes in unearned income),
employment status (job loss, newly employed, changes in employment, seasonal work); educational status (new
degree or professional certification, school enrollment); health events, conditions, and expenses; housing and
assets; and other factors.

The frequency of updating depends on the type of information and specific variables (content). Not all
information requires updating – some variables remain constant over time (such as birth dates or places, father’s
name), barring corrections to initial information. Updating of demographic information of individuals, which
determines household composition, should be on-going to account for births, marriages, divorces, deaths,
migration, and so forth. The updating of self-reported socio-economic data should be mandatory from time-to-
time because household situations can change rapidly and unpredictably, for example, with changes in
employment status, health events, crises, etc.

The periodicity of updating is also influenced by the sources of information for each variable, whether from
self-reported information or from data exchange with other administrative systems.



11The literature and common practice distinguish between “updating” of demographic information and “recertification” of socio-
economic information. We focus on the different frequencies, periodicity, and sources of updating for different types of variables
(demographic, socio-economic), and then the “reassessment” of needs and conditions by the Social Registry without getting into
certifying enrollment decisions, which can depend on other factors measured in the Social Registry and is typically the jurisdiction of user
programs (as discussed above).
                                                                                                                                        13
•    For self-reported information via on-demand systems, there are two types of updates: (a) continuous
     partial updates; and (b) full updates for reassessment of eligibility. With respect to the former, many
     countries have the general requirement that households “update their information to report any changes”
     on a continuous basis. In practice, this usually means changes in demographic status or household
     composition, which can affect not only eligibility status but also benefits calculations, and sometimes major
     changes in socio-economic status such as employment. In some countries, such as the US or Australia, any
     changes to information must be reported within a short period of time (usually 10 business days) to avoid
     penalties. With respect to the latter, many countries also establish official periodicity by which registrants
     must be reassessed for eligibility. In Brazil’s Cadastro Unico 12 and Chile’s RSH, 13 the requirement is a
     maximum of two years before the validity of registrant information expires. In Turkey’s ISAS, 14 all data are
     updated and verified through an annual in-person evaluation performed by the local inspection officer. In
     the US, 15 this time period is usually 12 months, but this can be longer for some categories on fixed incomes,
     such as the elderly and disabled (24 months) or shorter in some states or for categories whose situations
     change more frequently. Regardless of the type of information, Citizens need to know what is expected of
     them in terms of the frequency of updates and information / documentation required. They also need to
     know where and how to update their information.
•    For self-reported information via en masse registration systems, updating and reassessment usually
     depends on the next round of “census sweep,” often with lags of 4-6 years, even longer in some cases. In
     some of these systems, citizens are supposed to report and update changes in the interim years, but few
     have incentives to do so and the shares of households with updated information are usually low whenever
     citizens are already receiving a benefit or a service. Incentives for updating only arise when households are
     denied eligibility for benefit/service(s). In some countries, such as Indonesia, user programs do carry out
     updates for demographic and household composition data on their beneficiaries, as this information affects
     the calculation of benefit levels. These updates are not always fed back from beneficiary registries to the
     social registry, however.
•    For information that is sourced from other administrative systems, such as civil registries, tax systems,
     social security systems, land and property registries, utility companies, etc., the frequency of updates
     depends on both (a) the periodicity that the information in those systems is updated; and (b) the degree of
     interoperability and frequency of data exchange with those systems. With respect to the former, the
     periodicity of changes in information from other administration systems can vary: for example, with
     information on employment status or receipt of benefits changing monthly, payments of utility bills changing
     bi-monthly, social security contributions changing quarterly, tax information changing once a year, and
     property ownership changing sporadically. With respect to the latter, capabilities for interoperability and
     data exchange are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.

Mapping Functions and Key Actors for the Social Registry

The institutional arrangements for Social Registries vary across countries, and there is no blueprint. As
discussed in Chapter 5, some Social Registries are operated by an agency that manages a specific “flagship” social
program; others are “housed” by a specialized “host agency” that serves as an operating agent. Many Social
Registries are centralized in design and information management, but with decentralized or deconcentrated
responsibilities for citizen interface for the “front office” process of intake & registration, updating, grievances,
and so forth. Others aggregate sub-nationally managed registries into a national registry and so forth.

Irrespective of the institutional arrangements, uniqueness of role assignments is crucial for the principles of
clarity and accountability. Delivery Chain Process Mapping can be useful in establishing “who does what” and
“when” for core business processes. With this tool, each actor is assigned a “swim lane,” and core business
processes are mapped in sequence across those lanes. Uniqueness of role assignments is crucial for the
principles of clarity and accountability – and the term “swim lanes” is used to symbolize the concept that each
actor “stays in their own lane,” without crossing lanes for role confusion. Box 3 illustrates Delivery Chain
Mapping for the example of Georgia’s TSA Registry, and Annex 2 provides additional details on this tool.

                                    Box 3 - Delivery Chain Process Mapping – Example of Georgia’s TSA Registry
 Delivery Chain Process Mapping can be useful in establishing and sequencing intake, registration, and eligibility processes
 by key actors. The Figure below illustrates this tool for the case of Georgia’s TSA Registry, which was developed in 2006
 primarily to support the Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) Program, but it also provides access to potential inclusion in
 numerous other benefits and services (see Annex 1 and Chapter 5). The basic process is depicted in Figure 2. Households
 submit the initial application via the Social Agent at the reception desk of the local office of the Social Services Agency
 (SSA) in the Ministry of Labor, Health and Social Assistance (MoLHSA). The application includes basic information on the
 household, as well as consent information that the applicants sign to acknowledge their rights and responsibilities
 regarding data use, access, protection and so forth. Data Operators enter the information into the TSA Registry using
 software applications for the front office. The TSA Registry then pulls information from other administrative systems
 using the unique national ID and interoperability capabilities for data exchange (as discussed below). The local Social
 Agent then pulls up that information and conducts a home visit to the applicants’ home to gather further information
 for the complete Family Declaration. Two Data Operators then enter all of the information from the Family Declaration
 using the double-entry method to catch and remedy any errors in the process. The TSA Registry applies business rules
 programmed into the back-office software to calculate eligibility scores combining information from the Family
 Declaration and information curated from other administrative systems. This process determines if the household is
 eligible for the TSA Program. When a household is deemed eligible, the SSA/MoLHSA then formalizes the enrollment
 decision and calculates the benefits that would be paid to that household depending on their eligibility score and
 household composition (with additional benefits for children). The enrollment decision is then transmitted through the
 territorial SSA office to the Social Agent in the local SSA office, who then notifies the household of the decision. Service
 standards require that this entire process be completed from start to finish within 30 days or less.

    B. Integrated Social Registries as Common Gateways for Multiple Social Programs
Many countries offer a myriad of social programs, often with good intentions – but also with the risk of
fragmentation. Social programs can include a range of benefits (cash or in-kind) and services. Implementation
of parallel processes across numerous programs that aim to support similar population groups can be costly and
                                                                                                                                                                                               16
inefficient, particularly for intake and registration processes. For citizens, navigating this bureaucracy can be
frustrating and costly, as they have to go to multiple different locations to apply for different benefits and
services, providing the same information and documentation repeatedly, often with multiple visits. For
administrators, fragmentation can result in duplication of processes, inefficiencies, and wasted resources. For
government overall, fragmentation reduces capacities for coordination in social policy.

As such, “Integrated Social Registries” can serve as a common gateway for coordinating registration and
eligibility processes for multiple social programs. Integrated Social Registries combine the processes of
outreach, intake and registration, and assessment of needs and conditions to determine potential eligibility for
these multiple programs. The agencies responsible for the social programs then make enrollment decisions,
taking into account this information on eligibility plus other factors (such as budgetary space and other
prioritization criteria, as discussed above), as illustrated in Figure 2. 16 Key ingredients for Integrated Social
Registries include inter-institutional coordination arrangements, common eligibility concepts and a shared
intake questionnaire, and capabilities for information exchange.

                                 Figure 2 – Integrated Social Registries as a Common Gateway
                         for Coordinating Registration & Eligibility Processes across Multiple Programs

Integrated Social Registries are sometimes called “single,” “unique,” or “unified” systems. The terminology
used to describe Social Registries varies considerably across countries. When they serve multiple programs, they
are sometimes called “single registries,” “unique registries,” “national targeting systems,” or “unified registries.”
This doesn’t mean that they are the only Social Registry in the country. Rather, these “brand names” usually
signal that they are used “integrated gateways” for multiple programs. In fact, multiple registries can coexist –
for example, a Social Registry may serve as a gateway for multiple programs, but other programs may still
operate their own registration and eligibility systems in parallel (sometimes due to on-going fragmentation).



16 Note that despite the visualization of the Integrated Social Registry as a separate “entity” in Figure 2, there are many models for

developing Integrated Social Registries (as discussed in Chapter 5), and not all exist as separate entities from social programs. In some
countries, Social Registries are operated by agencies that manage flagship social programs (e.g., Brazil, the Philippines), but also serve
programs managed by other agencies. In other countries, the Social Registry of a specific program serves other programs (e.g., Pakistan’s
NSER in BISP). In some countries (such as Mexico’s SIFODE), citizens can register via a specific program but with a common application
and Integrated Social Registry that can help them access other benefits and services. In other countries, Social Registries do operate as
separate entities (e.g., with Colombia’s SISBEN or Dominican Republic’s SIUBEN).
                                                                                                                                      17
Integrated Social Registries can offer many advantages – for citizens, for user programs, and for social policy.
For citizens, common intake and registration procedures reduce the burden of having to navigate complex
bureaucracies and provide similar information and documentation to apply for eligibility for multiple benefits
and services to meet their diverse needs. For “user programs,” Integrated Social Registries can generate
economies of scale, efficiencies, and savings on administration costs – which can be significant as the processes
of registering and determining potential eligibility of individuals or households can be quite costly. Integrated
Social Registries can also be used to support planning and costing of interventions, assessing potential demand,
monitoring and evaluation, reporting, and other analytics.

As such, Integrated Social Registries serve as platforms that support access to benefits and services that can
extend well beyond the sphere of social assistance. As Social Registries mature and gain credibility as “honest
brokers” for quality information on a critical mass of the intended population, they gain in relevance for a larger
number of social programs. In turn, the more programs are signed on to use the Integrated Social Registry as an
eligibility “gateway,” the more citizens are likely to register or to be willing provide their information to become
registered. As such, Integrated Social Registries can become powerful inclusion platforms for delivering a range
of services to intended populations. Many of these services go well beyond social assistance, such as: social
tariffs for electricity, subsidized health insurance, education and training vouchers or materials, subsidized child
care, financial inclusion services, pro bono legal services, and more (as illustrated in Figure 3). Therefore, Social
Registries can evolve to support many types of programs, going way beyond “targeted programs” that would
aim to serve a subset of the population, and even to support universal services, such as health insurance
subsidies or social energy tariffs. 17

     C. Social Registries and Dynamic Inclusion
A key feature of Social Registries is whether or not they allow for dynamic inclusion, such that anyone can
register into a Social Registry at any time. In other words, dynamic inclusion means that access to registration
is open and continuous – usually with an on-demand application window for citizen interface – so that people

17Another example is pro-bono legal services. The poor need legal services – but it would be very inefficient for the judicial system to
collect the information necessary for assessing needs and conditions to determine who could qualify for pro bono legal services. Rather,
needs-based eligibility for pro-bono or subsidized legal services could be informed by data from the Social Registry.
                                                                                                                                    18
can register for consideration of potential eligibility for social programs when in need, or update their
information if their situations change. This principle is also important when developing “adaptive social
protection systems” with capabilities of responding to crises.

The concept of dynamic inclusion in Social Registries is closely related to the progressive realization of
universality and the implementation of the human rights agenda. Many countries adhere to compliance with
human rights principles, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations support the
implementation of social protection systems and measures for all, with expanding coverage of the poor and
vulnerable by 2030 (SDG Goal 1.3). The World Bank and ILO share this vision of universal social protection,
where anyone who needs social protection can access it at any time. 18 This vision is fundamentally linked to the
principle and practice of dynamic inclusion in Social Registries. 19 Integrated Social Registries can also help
promote universal coverage of social protection systems by providing a gateway for potential inclusion of the
poor, vulnerable, and lower-income population to a range of benefits and services that could meet their diverse
needs. Interoperability between Social Registries and other information systems in the social protection sphere
(e.g., pension and labor information systems) can also help coordinate universal coverage of the broader social
protection system across the spectrum of the population. Other human rights standards should guide the
process of progressively realizing social rights, including the principles of non-discrimination, transparency and
access to information, and accountability. Importantly, there is a valuable intersection between key features
that support human rights standards and those that support good practices for design and implementation of
Social Registries (see Box 4).

Despite the significance of the principle of dynamic inclusion, many countries operate registries with “fixed
lists” of registrants and beneficiaries. These systems are most common in developing countries, where social
assistance programs are rather new, coverage is small, fiscal space constrained, and administrative capacity is
limited. A typical approach is to conduct registration every four to five years. The challenge with this approach
is that registration is closed to new registrants or to people whose needs and conditions have changed in the
interim years between infrequent en masse data collection waves. As such, although these en masse registration
waves can work well as a means to “get started” and to fill initial data gaps, the risk of errors of exclusion and
inclusion increases with the passage of time, as the information becomes out-of-date and excludes households
whose situations have changed or worsened and are unable to access the registry. Moreover, the risk of
exclusion is multiplied when these “fixed list” static systems serve multiple programs, as they could be denying
numerous benefits and services to potentially eligible individuals or households. Finally, without a system for
continuous registration of new registrants (or updating of information for existing registrants), these static
“fixed-list” systems are also less agile to respond in times of crises (low “adaptability”).

 Progressive            • Dynamic Social Registry Systems facilitate access to social protection to an increasing
 Realization of Social       number of individuals and families by:
 Rights                           o Opening on-demand registration that permits anyone to register at any time (or at
                                        least during frequent open registration periods); and
                                  o On-going updating protocols and procedures.
                        • Identify population in advance, expediting access to programs.
                        • Allow efficient and coordinated approach to service delivery, which in turn facilitates the
                             progressive inclusion of new people to the system or more benefits to those who are
                             already in the system.
 Principle of Non-      • Facilitate access to the poor and vulnerable groups who may otherwise be missed by:
 Discrimination              o Active search and outreach, including through mobile teams, community outreach and

                             o Simple and user-friendly application procedures;
                             o Support to obtain necessary documentation and IDs;
                             o Provision of translation services or applications in multiple languages with culturally-
                                  appropriate adaptations.
                        • Sensitivity training to relevant staff, including interviewers and social workers.
 Transparency and       • Clear publication and dissemination of eligibility criteria, information requirements,
 Access to                   application processes, use of information, and so forth.
 Information            • Clear communications regarding the role of Social Registries – and the point that simply
                             registering in the Social Registry does not guarantee eligibility for any specific social program
                             or awarding of benefits. Rather, registration allows people to be considered for potential
                             eligibility for user programs.
                        • Communications, outreach and awareness campaigns, including with culturally- and
                             linguistically-appropriate adaptations.
 Accountability and     • Clear and permanent points of contact for citizen interface – ideally with multiple channels
 Social                      for grievances and queries (e.g., local office, hotline, online queries, etc.).
 Accountability         • Clear and monitored protocols and quality standards for notifications and follow up.
                        • Clear and effective grievance redress mechanisms that can distinguish between grievances
                             regarding information provided either already registered or not in the Social Registry, and
                             enrollment decision by the user programs.

                             (e.g., social controls) Applicant “journey mapping” assessments to trace experience of
                             registrants and feedback learning to improve and simplify processes, and to solve problems

One of the reasons that many countries operate “fixed list” systems is that many of the key ingredients for
implementing dynamic inclusion systems remain elusive in their country contexts. These key ingredients
include: (a) fiscal space and flexibility of user programs to accommodate new entrants and expanding coverage;
(b) insufficient “political will” to remove individuals and families who no longer qualify for program benefits in
order to make room for potential new beneficiaries; (c) flexible eligibility criteria that can accommodate and
signal changing circumstances (such as criteria that takes into account a catastrophic health event, change in
family circumstances, or sudden job loss); (d) limited administrative capacity; and (e) a digital governance

                                                                                                                           20
strategy that emphasizes a citizen-centered and service oriented approach, by making use of interoperable
administrative systems at the national and sub-national level.

On the latter, one key administrative ingredient for putting the principle of dynamic inclusion into practice is
the operation of an extensive and permanent network of access points for citizen interface. This network is
needed to support the functions of continuous intake and registration, updating, and processing of grievances
and appeals. In dynamic inclusion systems, these functions are often carried out on an “on-demand” basis, but
active outreach efforts are also important to communicate about the role of the registry and bring in vulnerable
groups that may otherwise be uninformed. Citizen interface can take many forms, but essentially what is needed
is a permanent “point of contact” where citizens can access the Social Registry system on a continuous basis.
Common arrangements for these “permanent access points” include operating through local offices, service
windows, kiosks, or even through digital service windows over the internet. Institutional arrangements for
these local offices vary: some countries operate through local government offices (as in the case of Brazil) while
others via local offices and staff representing central agencies (such as in Mexico).

An extensive network of local access points for citizen interface can be the primary capacity constraint
inhibiting the development of dynamic Social Registry systems. In many developing countries, such local
capacities do not exist. In some countries, local governments do operate some administrative “service window”
functions, but operating a national Social Registry through these local offices – which are often autonomous or
independent of central governments – requires significant commitment and trust on both sides, formal
agreements, protocols, processes, service standards, monitoring, oversight and controls, and capacities.

When capacity permits, there are potential advantages to building on-demand capabilities for dynamic
inclusion. One advantage is the chance to smooth the costs of registration and updating over time, and to invest
those funds in more permanent capacity for citizen interface, as discussed in Chapter 6 below. Another potential
cost advantage is the reduction in total intake, registration, and updating costs due to self-selection, as citizens
who are unlikely to be eligible for social programs voluntarily opt out of more dynamic on-demand systems.
Finally, an additional advantage is the political gain from smoothing the turnover of eligible and ineligible
individuals or families over time. The likelihood of large numbers of registrants whose situation has changed
and may no longer qualify them as eligible for social programs increases with infrequent census sweep data
collection approaches. The potential political cost of large numbers of people becoming ineligible all at once
could be far higher in these systems, than with dynamic systems that require more frequent updating over time.


Chapter 4: The Architecture of Social Registries as Information Systems
This Chapter provides an overview and more in-depth discussion of the structure of Social Registries as
information systems. It first outlines the basic architecture of Social Registries as information systems, and dives
deeper into four key layers of these systems: (a) data and information; (b) software applications; (c) database
management; and (d) ICT infrastructure. It then reviews the operation of Social Registries, within the broader
context of integrated social protection systems.

    A. Basic Architecture of Social Registries as Information Systems

As an Information System, the basic architecture of a Social Registry includes four elements: (a) information
& data; (b) software applications, including the visual interface and business logic; (c) database management,
and (d) ICT infrastructure. While the detailed architecture varies, social registries include each of these elements.
In this paper, wherever possible we eschew the term ‘MIS’, and employ terminology such as ‘Information
Systems’, ‘Software Applications’ and ‘Database Management Systems’ as defined in IT parlance (See Box 5).

                                                                                                                  21
Figure 4 illustrates ‘how’ Social Registries function within the overall architecture, and how they interact with
other functional modules of an Integrated Social Protection Information System (see Section 4.B). Since this
illustration can appear complex at first glance, we “march through” the various core components, focusing
specifically on aspects related to the social registry, with “screen shots” of each relevant section.

                                Box 5 – What is an ‘MIS’? It depends on whom you ask.

 There is plenty of confusion around the term “MIS,” with different definitions of the term in the business community,
 the International Development community, and the IT community.
 •    In the business world, Management Information System or MIS is an academic discipline or a course of study that
      focuses on the art of managing information systems effectively, including people, organizations and technology.
 •    In the International Development and NGO community, MIS is a catch-all term that has been used to refer to
      systems that manage information in specific sectoral contexts. For example, the Human Resource ‘MIS’, Education
      ‘MIS’, Health ‘MIS’ and so forth. In Social Protection, development practitioners often use the term MIS to refer to
      systems (or software applications) that manage information for the functioning of registration and eligibility
      systems – or for the operation of specific programs to deliver benefits and services (e.g., payments transactions,
      conditionalities monitoring, etc.).
 •    Meanwhile, in the IT world, the definition of MIS is an information system that produces reports that management
      need for planning and control, by processing information captured by transaction processing systems, stored in
      databases. MIS is a dated turn of phrase in IT parlance. Contemporary terminology for information systems that
      produce reports and dashboards include terms such as ‘Business Intelligence’ and ‘Analytics.’
 So how do we “translate” the terminology between the IT world and the (social protection) Development Community?
 In contemporary IT terminology, the term MIS as it was intended to be meant in the development community, refers to
 ‘Information Systems’, and in particular, ‘Software Applications’ and ‘Database Management Systems’. These terms are
 defined as below:

 •    Software Applications are standalone programs that solve a specific business need. Such applications process
      business and technical data in a way that facilitates business operations or management/technical decision
      making. A database is a large organized collection of data.
 •    Database Management Systems is a software that manages or controls access to a database. 20
 •    Information Systems are an interdependent group of elements that function together to accomplish some
      predefined goal (or to solve an organizational problem) by collecting, organizing, storing, processing, creating and
      distributing information. To accomplish that goal, an information system makes use of a variety of system
      elements, namely, Software, Hardware, Databases, People, Procedures and Documentation.

 Given the confusion around the term, we prefer to avoid using the term ‘MIS’ in this paper. Wherever possible, we
 refer to ‘Information Systems’, ‘Software Applications’ and ‘Database Management Systems’ as defined in IT parlance.
 If more specificity is needed to identify a particular type of information system, we will be more explicit, such as the
 “Integrated Social Protection Information System” (rather than the commonly used – but confusing – term “MIS”).

20 First developed in the 1970s, a relational database management system (RDMS) organizes that data

In the 21st century, “noSQL” database management systems that manage data modeled in means other than tabular relations have
evolved, and these are particularly useful for real-time web applications and big data.

Data & Information

Data comprise the first key layer of the architecture. Countries adopt a variety of methods for collecting or
curating data 21 needed to carry out registration and eligibility determination functions in Social Registries (see
Figure 5). Some rely on information provided by citizens directly (self-reported information), and some draw on
information from other administrative information systems via interoperability mechanisms (discussed in more
detail below). Many use a mix of these methods (see Figure 5).

Data Intake
Countries use a variety of data collection methods to allow citizens to register for social assistance. These are
described below. Irrespective of the approach, it is critical to design intake and registration methods using
human-centered design principles so that citizens can navigate the process and technology easily, answer the
required questions, upload any required documentation, and so forth, to reduce the administrative burden of
wasted time, private costs and fruitless visits, both to citizens as well as social workers and other front-line
service delivery staff.

•      Data intake through field teams whereby data are collected onsite in the communities from all or most
       families or households within selected areas (or entire regions or most of the country) via an interview
       questionnaire (and sometimes via home visit verifications of housing conditions and basic services).22 These
       interview questionnaires can be paper-based, or supported by technology such as tablets or other mobile
       devices.
•      Data and documents provided at a local office through social workers or citizen service representatives.
       This is a common approach in many countries. Local offices can include citizen service centers, social
       centers, municipal offices, kiosks, etc. They can be managed by central agencies, local governments, or
       outsourced partners.


21 Data can be structured, unstructured or semi-structured. Structured data are information with a high degree of organization, such that

it can be stored in a relational database and is readily searchable using algorithms or operations. For example data in spreadsheets.
Unstructured data are data that does not have a pre-defined data model and is not organized in a pre-defined. Typically text heavy, but
may include dates, numbers etc. Includes data in word documents, web pages etc. Semi-structured data are a form of unstructured data
that do not conform with the formal structure of data models but contains tags, metadata or markers to separate semantic elements and
to enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data. For example XML data and JSON (Javascript Object Notation).

•    Data and documents provided through offline-to-online approach, to mobile teams of facilitators, social
     workers or agents that receive applications in communities. Mode of access is via paper forms, tablets,
     laptops or personal computers. Social workers interview the applicants and collect responses, either on
     paper or they input the information through a digital application form using offline-to-online (O2O) 23
     approaches when connectivity is weak.
•    Data and documents provided by citizens through a self-service approach, using a digital application form
     to input data, with supporting documents digitally uploaded. Mode of access is via mobile devices, tablets,
     laptops, personal computers, or self-service kiosks located in public spaces. In countries that permit self-
     service intake and registration, citizens can apply online via ministry websites or through a digital service
     window that offers a range of government to citizen (G2C) services.

Some countries use human-centered design principles to lessen the administrative burden to citizens of data
intake and registration. Simple online “check my (potential) eligibility” simulators allow the individual to input
the minimum information to see if they may be potentially eligible for one or more programs before going in
person to a local office for the “real” application (to save time for both the individuals and the bureaucracy), or
before proceeding to create an account and filling out the entire application with all information required. Again,
software for these “potential eligibility” simulators is critical – and the potential applicants should be able to get
answers about potential eligibility for one or more programs within a matter of minutes. Various sites for
departments of health and human services in specific states (or counties) in the US provide for such eligibility
simulators for multiple programs. Another technique to simplify data intake at the point of registration requires
citizens to merely present their National ID and sign a consent form. This allows institutions to review socio-
economic data on registrants sourced from other government institutions through a sophisticated data
exchange mechanism at the back-end. As an example, Bütünleşik in Turkey is described in further detail below
and in Box 16.

Data Exchange
Information also comes from other administrative systems. In order to source the most current data from
other administrative systems, data exchange protocols may be used to verify, validate or “cross-check”
information provided by registrants, or to directly source certain types of information from other systems. 24 This
also helps social registry systems to become dynamic and adaptive and to reduce the amount of information
that the individuals and families have to provide, thereby reducing the time needed carry out intake and
registration. As a precursor to building the Integrated Social Assistance System (ISAS) or “Bütünleşik” system,
Turkey in 2005 decreed that the administrative burden for collecting 17 different documents to apply for
assistance would shift from the citizen to the government, with the objective of social inclusion and streamlining
the delivery of social assistance. Although the decree eased the application process for citizens, it still took public
servants almost 15 days to gather all the relevant documents. Subsequently, between 2010 and 2015, Turkey’s
ISAS Bütünleşik system (which means all-inclusive or integrated), was built to enable the collection of supporting
documentation online by exchanging data from several institutions to aid and streamline this very process (See
the section on Database & Interoperability for more details).

A whole-of-government approach for sharing data across agencies allows for dynamic inclusion, data quality,
efficiency and integrity. Such an approach requires a robust data exchange protocol that can facilitate cross-

23Offline to Online (O2O) services to citizens are a way of combining virtual and physical spaces, through h mobile platforms help bridge

access to services for the poor, vulnerable and marginalized, particularly in countries grappling with poor connectivity that hinders digital
delivery of services to citizens. Using an O2O approach, officials do not wait passively at the office for the digital access and applications
of citizens needing administrative services, but actively visit the blind spots armed with sophisticated digital devices and provide services
to citizens in need. See also Karippacheril et al., (July 2016).

agency sharing of the most current information updates captured from citizens through frontline agencies such
as health facilities, schools, citizen service centers for registering property, land, vehicles, businesses etc. Real-
time integration between the social registry and other administrative systems can help detect data with the
most current time-stamp, because some types of data are dynamic and transactional. Dynamic data have a time
dimension, or a numerical value, and refers to one or more reference data objects. 25 They change as a result of
an event (or a transaction), and therefore the individual or the families’ needs and conditions change. For
example, life events such as birth, marriage and death, or health conditions, or employment status. However, it
may not always be feasible to develop real-time connections between the social registry and other
administrative systems due to issues of performance and latency. Some data are static or fixed and rarely change
after they are recorded. For example name, gender, date of birth, etc. Other kinds of data change infrequently,
(for instance tax data, which changes once a year) and do not need to be updated using real-time integration
between the social registry and other administrative systems. Accordingly, institutions agree on a periodic
schedule for data exchange, and data are sourced through a bulk data transfer.

Inter-organizational data exchange protocols are typically based on an Interoperability framework defined at
the country or broader regional level (see section on Database & Interoperability for more details). Estonia, for
example, designed a data exchange layer for whole-of-government called X-Road. 26 The objective is to allow
citizens, businesses and government entities to securely exchange data and access information maintained in
various agencies’ databases over the internet, based on the principle that “The State shall not request from
citizens and businesses any data that are already in its possession”. For example, applying for a categorical
parental benefit is an e-Service and does not require submission any supporting documents. The different
certificates and documents required are generated automatically by the e-Service (which is a distributed
software) by using different agencies’ databases to collect data about the applicant. 27 Nonetheless, data
exchange protocols do not negate the need for self-reported information from citizens registering for social
benefits and services, at least in the form of an application or claim to express need. Even in Estonia, minimum
income guarantee benefit requires submission of an application, along with documentation of property and
movable assets and demonstration that after paying housing expenses families or individuals would not be able
to cover basic subsistence needs.

Data Protection
Given that Social Registries involve significant amounts of personal identifying and socio-economic
information, legislation, protocols, and tools are critical to support information security and protection of this
information. Such protections are critical to the credibility and trust of the system. Development of a Social
Registry should be articulated around the concept of digital governance, including access to information, cyber-
security, data security, data confidentiality, privacy standards, and personal data protection. Ideally, these
should adhere to international data sharing and information privacy standards and protocols, such as those
established by the OECD Guidelines for Fair Information Practices and Protection of Privacy and Trans-border
Flows of Personal Data, and the EU’s Data Protection Directive and the Council of Europe’s Convention for the
Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data. 28 Key principles for personal
data protection that are critical for social registries include: 29



25 In the context of data management, reference data are a list of permissible values used by master data or transactions data. They are

often defined by standards organizations such as ISO. For example, units of measure, country codes, etc. Master data is a single source
of common business data that are agreed on and shared across an organization, and are used across multiple systems, applications and
processes. For social programs, examples of master data include data on citizens (individuals, families, households), social programs (cash
transfers, food) etc.

    1. Consent: Individuals (or household representatives) shall be informed about the institution responsible,
         the planned uses and users of the data, and their right to respond and to oppose use of their data. They
         should also sign or otherwise endorse consent for the collection and use of information in the Social
         Registry, including for use by multiple programs.
    2.   Use and proportionality: Data shall only be collected for specific ends, only if they are necessary for
         such ends (collection is proportional to needs).
    3.   Data quality: Data should be accurate, complete, and kept updated to the extent possible, for the ends
         for which they are collected.
    4.   Confidentiality and safety safeguards: Those responsible for data treatment must take all necessary
         measures to ensure data is not manipulated, damaged, or illegally accessed by others.
    5.   Responsible transmission and data sharing: Data transmission and sharing has to respect the core
         principles of confidentiality, proportionality and safety, under the guidance of documented data sharing
         and transmission agreements (e.g., with user programs).
    6.   Right to access, correct, and oppose data: Those whose personal data are collected have a right to
         obtain information on their data and treatments applied; and to correct, oppose, supplement, update,
         lock or suppress incorrect, incomplete, ambiguous or outdated data.
    7.   Accountability: A data controller should be accountable for complying with these principles, with clear
         accountability for any breaches.

For example, the National Unique Registry (RNU, Registre National Unique) in Senegal has applied the
principles of data protection to key processes enabled by the registry. The principles are applied to the
processes of (1) data collection, (2) analysis and storage, and (3) data transmission and use. For the data
collection phase, the recommendations are to inform households about the purpose of social registry, potential
users, right to not respond (would prevent inclusion), and duration, obtain households’ consent, only collect
data that is needed for this phase , and ensure the secure uploading of data.

Software Applications

Software applications are the second key layer of the architecture of Social Registries. They support the key
functions of intake and registration of applicant data, and assessment of their needs and conditions (see “blue
bars” on Figure 4 above, with screen shot below in Figure 6).

Front office software applications for Social Registries provide a visual interface for citizens, and frontline
workers who may operate the application on behalf of citizens, for the purpose of: (a) registering to be
considered for potential eligibility for one or many programs through digital application forms or questionnaires,
(b) updating information and (c) tracking and monitoring application status. Software applications that support
more sophisticated Social Registries functionality may also be available to frontline staff and social workers for:
(d) validating applicant data dynamically through crosschecks with administrative systems, and (e) verifying data
with registrants and supporting documents to resolve conflicts with administrative systems.

Back Office software applications for Social Registries provide a visual interface for program and institutional
administrators to transform and manage applicant data for eligibility assessment. It enables them to: (a) view
data on individuals & households: unique ID, members, demographics, socio-economic, housing & assets, health,
education, employment, utilities, all programs registered, etc., (b) manage data: data cleaning for validity,
accuracy, completeness, consistency, uniformity by parsing, deduplication, transformation, statistical methods,
etc.; data filtering, data matching & data archiving, audit trails, (c) assess eligibility using policy/criteria,

checks, using protocols.

With the rapid penetration of mobile devices and mobile coverage, mobile applications are being used for
intake and registration, cross-checks and eligibility assessment. In a number of countries, front-office software
applications may be available to case workers at their offices (or in tablets/mobile devices) or data entry
operators to input that data into the system. Despite the availability of such software applications, case workers
may still end up using paper forms for speed and efficiency when they are face-to-face with registrants
(applicants) in the office or in the field. They may use the software application to input data in their spare time.
Such scenarios more likely than not suggest that those software applications need to be designed with human-
centered design principles in mind so as not to impose an undue administrative burden on citizens or case
workers.

Database Management and Interoperability

The third layer of the architecture of Social Registries includes database management, within the broader
context of data integration, interoperability and coordination with other administrative systems at the central
and local level (see Figure 7), that can enable sophisticated business intelligence and analytics.

Information sourced from citizens are housed and managed in database management systems. The
architecture for data management varies significantly across countries, and there is no one single model for
this. Information systems are developed over time using different database management technologies and
approaches, and may be owned by different parts of an organization. As a result, data are fragmented across a
number of hardware, software, organizational and geographic boundaries. Several kinds of architectural models
are possible for managing data to improve the performance of the system.

    1) For some countries, the Social Registry operates a self-contained database management system
       without links to other administrative systems across government agencies or levels of government. It is
       programmed to answer requests from client computers connected to a database server. Self-contained
       Social Registries rely largely on self-reported information from citizens, sourced through en-masse
       census survey sweeps or through intake and registration forms.
    2) In countries where the social registry operates as part of a ‘whole-of-government’ architecture for
       managing information systems across agencies, it may use either a centralized or a virtual/federated
       model. (a) In a centralized model, data is sourced from other systems, replicated and stored locally. (b)
                                                                                                                 28
          A federated or virtual model allows data exchange with other systems that store data in incompatible
          database management systems or storage models, and that may have been developed at different
          points in time by different entities. A federated or virtual database culls from multiple sources as if it
          were a single entity. These databases are connected via a computer network and are then accessed as
          if they are from a single database. The goal is to be able to view and access data in a unified way without
          needing to copy and duplicate it in several databases or manually combine the results from many
          queries.

Social Registries that are connected to a ‘whole-of-government’ architecture rely on data integration and
interoperability 30 frameworks to facilitate the exchange of data from other administrative information
systems in order to complement “self-reported” information from citizens (Figure 7). Examples include linking
to administrative information systems such as: civil registration database, national population register, land or
property cadasters, vehicle registration, tax system, social security contributions system, pensions payments
system, labor and unemployment, education, health, etc.

Such interoperability frameworks require a political, legal, organizational, semantic, and technical context.
Politically, there must be a real need, endorsed by political decisions and have a legal basis. Participating
organizations must have a commonly view and objective. Legally, they must comply with laws governing
information such as personal data protection, digital signatures, information security, public information, public
procurement etc. Semantically, the framework must be based on different organizations understanding the
meaning of information similarly. This entails building of common data dictionaries 31 (with common definitions
of variables, reference units, and time reference periods), metadata, thesaurus, taxonomies, ontologies, service
registers etc. Technically, the framework must comply with service oriented IT architecture standards.
Interoperability also requires that some sort of unique identifier(s) are included in all information systems such
that data on individuals can be properly matched up across systems (e.g., via a national unique identification,
see Box 6).

                       Box 6 – The Importance and Use of Unique Identifiers in Social Registries
 Unique identifiers such as a National ID serve as a “key” to open the door to integrated systems across programs,
 government agencies, and even ‘whole-of-government’. Social registries use unique identifiers to facilitate cross-checks
 of administrative information systems from other government agencies to validate and verify data on registrants. They
 also use unique identifiers to facilitate the authentication of those being registered in the Social Registry.

 Identification is the process of ensuring that an individual is assigned a unique identifier that establishes “who is this
 person.” In Social Registries, unique identifiers are needed to: (a) verify and authenticate identity of individuals; (b) link
 those individuals to families or households (depending on the definition of the assistance unit); (c) ensure non-
 duplication of registered individuals; and (d) linking of the social registry with other administrative information systems
 for the purposes of data sharing and exchange or cross-checks. The unique identifier can vary from a national identity
 number (foundational ID) to a number assigned to the individual within the Social Registry system for that purpose
 (functional ID) on the basis of identifying documentation. Ideally, the Social Registry would use a National ID that is
 robust and accurate, with full coverage of the population.

 India’s Aadhaar unique identification number is a 12-digit random number issued to the residents of India based on
 voluntary enrollment. Individuals provide minimal demographic and biometric information during the enrolment process
 and an Aadhaar number is generated. Uniqueness is achieved through the process of demographic and biometric de-
 duplication. Aadhar is used as a basis to roll out several Government welfare schemes and social programs. It one of the

30 Interoperability is defined as the ability for a system to share information with other independent systems using common standards.
31 A data dictionary is a repository that contains descriptions of all data objects consumed or produced by the software. An organized
listing of all data elements that are pertinent to the system, with precise, rigorous definitions so that both user and system analyst will
have a common understanding of inputs, outputs, components of stores, and (even) intermediate calculations.
                                                                                                                                       29
 key pillars of a ‘Digital India’, wherein every resident of the country is provided with a unique identity. It is by far the
 largest biometrics based identification system in the world.

 Beyond authentication of identity, unique identifiers are needed for interoperability. All connecting information systems
 need to have the same set of unique identifiers to match and link information. This is greatly facilitated by the use of a
 robust and accurate National ID.

 However, not all countries operate a National ID. Countries without National IDs do connect administrative systems. The
 US, for example, uses a set of identifiers to match individuals across administrative systems (name, address, gender,
 birthdate, social security number, etc.).

 In other countries the National ID system may be weak, with low coverage of the population, especially among the
 neediest population, or with many errors and duplications. In those situations, lack of coverage of the National ID can
 be a barrier to entry into the Social Registry (exclusion). Conversely, inability to verify identity can resulting duplications
 or fraud, when someone pretends to be someone they are not by using a counterfeit ID or an authentic ID belonging to
 someone else. In countries without a robust and accurate National ID, functional IDs are often created and assigned for
 the purposes of a specific social program or the Social Registry.

 In Brazil, for example, the Cadastro Único (Cadúnico) assigns a Unique Social Number (NIS) to individuals on the basis of
 a variety of identifying documents and IDs (e.g., the PIS and CPF). The multitude of IDs in Brazil is due to the fact that
 the PIS (Programa de Integracao Social) number is provided only to formal sector workers, and the CPF (Cadastro de
 Pessoa Fisica) is obtained on request. Moreover, other IDs, such as the voter ID and Identity ID, were managed for many
 years at the local level with no integration at the national level. Since the poor and vulnerable are commonly outside
 the formal sector, many lack the PIS and CPF. As a consequence, when people register, the Cadúnico assigns the NIS as
 the identification number for all individuals in the system. If an applicant has a PIS, this number was used as the NIS; for
 those without the PIS, a new unique NIS is generated. The NIS becomes the official number for social assistance, and if
 the individual registered in the Cadúnico obtains a formal sector job, the NIS becomes the PIS.

The architecture of data integration and data management varies (See Table 1). For years, integration between
different systems were often point to point, picking up specific data from specific agencies. They cost
considerable time and money, let alone resulting in a spaghetti-like mess of connections between institutions.
SOA, or “service-oriented architecture,” a development in the last 10 years, makes coupling between institutions
loose, i.e. connections are not hardwired to the databases of other agencies. With the advent of SOA, a number
of countries turned their connections or points into private APIs (application programming interfaces).
Communication is directed via a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to facilitate secure data exchange between
government institutions. Nevertheless, this did not solve the problem of transforming the spaghetti into a
unified data integration approach. To address this issue, some countries build the Social Registry as a data
warehouse, which ingests data from multiple agencies. The integration model for such an approach depends on
the volume of data and frequency of data updates, and can be summarized as follows 32:

       1. For chatty or transactional data – An enterprise service bus (ESB) is used for real-time and
          asynchronous communication. The enterprise service bus approach allows data to be routed and
          orchestrated between multiple agencies, based on a queuing system for data exchange requests. An
          example is a credit card payment over the internet, or an individual registering for benefits. In terms of
          data security, this model uses a firewall or a VPN to protect the data.
       2. For bulk data – An extract transform load (ETL) approach is used to extract bulk data from data marts
          of different agencies, to transform and load them up into a centralized data warehouse. This doesn’t

                                                                                                                              30
       have a ‘drip-drip-drip’ approach, where changes in data are constantly updated. In terms of data
       security, this model uses a WLAN, VPN or other trusted connections. It tends to be a more involved and
       centralized approach, with the added burden of having to protect the security and confidentiality of the
       data that has been collected. Some countries will do an ETL for bulk data once, and then a ‘drip-drip-
       drip’ method for data that changes frequently. A ‘flush and refill’ needs to be done periodically to ensure
       data is kept up-to-date. Turkey and Chile use this approach.
    3. For bulk + transactional – A Data Virtualization (DV) approach, where data is pulled together virtually
       and in real-time from different agencies and databases, without consolidating in a centralized data
       warehouse managed by one agency. This also allows sensitive data from agencies to be masked. In
       terms of data security, they could use firewall, VPN, WLAN, SSL handshake or whitelisting. This is a more
       agile approach when a more centralized approach is not feasible for various reasons, such as time, total
       cost of ownership, challenges with collecting and centralizing bulk data from other government agencies
       etc. Countries such as Jordan and Egypt are experimenting with this approach.
    4. A hybrid approach is to complement a centralized data warehouse with data virtualization, to include
       additional data, and extend the existing investment in a centralized data warehouse. Centralized data
       warehouses are useful for physically consolidating and transforming large volumes of data from various
       sources. When they are outpaced by the frequency of data updates, it proves challenging to keep large
       and centralized data warehouses current. In such instances, a hybrid approach may be useful.

Protocols must be in place to address issues arising from data conflicts between the Social Registry and other
information systems. In some countries, the software application will display red flags or warning messages
signaling the need for verification, updating or rectification, which are then cross-checked with the citizen orally
when they come into contact with the social worker, mobile teams, the service center or other frontline staff.
Pakistan, for example, has started to pilot this approach. In some other countries such as Chile, there are
protocols for data updates and rectification. The data point with the most recent time-stamp is given precedence
and is then cross-checked with the citizen to verify orally at the point of intake and registration, or when they
come into contact with the frontline staff. In Turkey, the system alerts administrators when there are data
conflicts, using a task-list with action items.

The adoption of data sharing protocols, legal agreements and a memorandum of understanding (MoU)
between social programs and the custodian of Integrated Social Registries data is vital. The Philippines has
                                                                                                                   31
recently developed standard data sharing protocols governing use of information from the Listahanan Social
Registry. A core principle governing these agreements is that Social Registries should share only specific
information needed for the agreed purposes with legitimate user programs in order to protect information
security and confidentiality (i.e., just the agreed minimum set of variables needed for user programs to take
their decisions). Data sharing agreements should be clear on the agreed and specific use of the information to
be shared, exact types of information to be shared (specific variables, time periods, etc.), specification of
confidentiality and security principles and safeguards, specification on specific users and their access levels, and
so forth.

ICT Infrastructure

Finally, the fourth key layer of Social Registry Information Systems is ICT infrastructure. These elements are
not illustrated in Figure 4 as they are highly context specific, but they are important to keep in mind when
designing a Social Registry. ICT infrastructure refers to composite hardware, software, network resources and
services required for the existence, operation and management of an organization’s IT environment. It can be
as simple as setting up IT equipment (servers, network, storage, power supply and cooling) in a room onsite, or
as complex as commissioning a data center in a warehouse-style building. Typically a data center to support
sophisticated operations include the following components of ICT infrastructure:

•      Facilities – including electrical power utility grids, UPS (uninterrupted power supply), back-up generators,
       power distribution units, automatic transfer switches, and cooling equipment.
•      Server equipment – including servers mounted on racks and cabinets (physical and virtualized).
•      Networking equipment – including routers, ports, switches, load balancers and link technologies
       (copper/fiber cabling).
                                                                                                                 32
•    Storage equipment – arrays mounted on racks and cabinets
•    Security – including physical monitoring and controls on onsite access such as keycards, locks, biometric
     verification such as retina scanners, motion sensors, CCTV, and virtual controls to secure access to networks,
     servers, application, data protection, cyber-threats, hacking, data modification, intrusion prevention and
     targeted threat detection.

A number of governments 33 are moving towards a shared data center approach to manage the time and cost
of procurement, investment and operations and to achieve economies of scale for government, as a whole.
Fragmentation of programs have resulted in duplicate investments in software applications, databases and ICT
infrastructure across and within government agencies. Some governments opt for a cloud-based (infrastructure-
as-a-service) 34 approach, to minimize procurement, investment and operations costs, and to take advantage of
potentially unlimited computing power, taking into account that this approach also entails a loss of control as
well as additional security concerns.

     B. Social Registries in the Context of Integrated Social Protection Information Systems
Many countries are moving towards Integrated Social Protection Information Systems. Social Registries are just
one component of these systems. Other elements include beneficiary registries, benefits administration
systems, grievance redress systems, and links with other administrative systems.

Social Registries are Just One Component of Social Protection Information Systems

Social Registries don’t operate in isolation. At the most basic level, a Social Registry feeds eligibility information
to social program(s) for enrollment decisions, which lead to the creation of a beneficiary registry(ies) and
benefits administration. In functional terms, this means linking the blue panel in the Delivery Chain in Figure 1
above (supported by the social registry) with the pink panel (which generates the beneficiary registry) and then
the purple panel (which supports benefits administration).

Moreover, they’re only one part of the puzzle: there are many other functions that need to be developed in
managing social programs. While Social Registries can support the “gateway functions” of intake, registration,
and eligibility determination, they do not fill other core functions needed to manage social programs. These
include beneficiary and benefits administration systems, case management systems, grievance redress systems,
and so forth. Furthermore, as discussed in Chapter 2, not all countries or programs operate Social Registries;
some simply record information only on beneficiaries, on the basis of enrollment decisions that are take outside
the system, for example in situations in which communities or local councils take such decisions directly.

Countries are increasingly operating or developing “Integrated Social Protection Information Systems” to link
these functions. Such information systems are comprised of components that automate various functions of the
delivery chain in a complementary manner, including the following 35:
•    Social Registries support the processes of outreach, intake and registration, and assessment of needs and
     conditions.



33 Korea built a Government Integrated Data Center in 2005 for whole of government with more than 20,000 pieces of hardware

equipment and a 30% reduction in data center costs.
34 Parts of the US Government use cloud-based Amazon web services, as infrastructure as a service.
35 While it is beyond the scope of this paper to get into a detailed examination of delivery systems for managing social programs (e.g.,

beneficiary registries, benefits administration, payments administration, conditionalities monitoring, and so forth), many of the concepts
and principles would apply to those systems as well.
                                                                                                                                      33
•   Beneficiary registries and benefits administration systems support decision, enrollment and notification
    phases along the delivery chain for a social program, as well as the management of information on
    beneficiaries.
•   Payment systems support payments administration and payments service provision. Linking payment flows
    with other program processes is critical to ensure the delivery of appropriate benefits to properly targeted
    individuals in a timely manner while minimizing costs.
•   Case management systems support the management of individuals/families/households participating in
    one or many programs, including needs assessment, planning and implementing services, advocacy, making
    appropriate linkages with service provides and complementary programs, and monitoring the delivery and
    use of services, including conditionalities monitoring.
•   Grievance redress mechanisms support filing of eligibility appeals, complaint handling, feedback and
    engagement of applicants, beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries of social programs.
•   Unique national ID or digital identification systems support the process of assigning a unique identifier to
    an individual that establishes “who is this person” (see Box 6). For integrated SP information systems, unique
    identifiers are needed to: (a) verify and authenticate identity of individuals; (b) link those individuals to
    families or households (depending on the definition of the assistance unit); (c) ensure non-duplication of
    registered individuals; and (d) linking with other administrative information systems for the purposes of data
    sharing and exchange or cross-checks. India’s Aadhar unique identification number is a 12-digit random
    number issued to the residents of India based on voluntary enrollment. Aadhar is used as a basis to roll out
    several Government welfare schemes and social programs, and is by far the largest biometrics based
    identification system in the world.
•   Business intelligence and analytics allows the transformation, generation, aggregation, analysis, and
    visualization of data into meaningful and useful information for social policy analysis and strategic decision
    support for social programs. It includes techniques such as data visualization, data mining, reporting, time
    series analysis (including predictive techniques), online analytical processing (OLAP), statistical analysis,
    standardized reporting, ad-hoc analysis, query & reporting, unstructured analytics, text analytics etc.
    Countries such as Mexico, Turkey and Chile are developing BI and data science approaches layering data
    from geographical information systems, beneficiary registries, social registries, and other data stores, as part
    of an integrated SP information systems strategy.
•   Interoperability frameworks for data exchange, including APIs, Web Services, Enterprise Service Bus etc. to
    connect to a whole-of-government architecture are also key components of an integrated SP information
    system. Within the broader country context of Digital Governance, integrated SP information systems
    interact with numerous other administrative systems, such as the National ID, civil registry, tax authority,
    etc., exchanging and cross-checking data across central and subnational levels of government. Moreover,
    the architecture of integrated social protection information systems includes feedback loops between the
    various information systems components for managing social programs (e.g., with data on enrollment
    decisions from the Beneficiary Registry feeding back to the Social Registry).


Visually, the components of these Integrated Information Systems are depicted in Figure 8 and include:

Two Parts of the Puzzle: Integrated Social Registries & Integrated Beneficiary Registries

Numerous countries operate Integrated Social Registries, as discussed in Chapter 3 above. These Integrated
Social Registries typically use common intake and registration processes, and then feed information on potential
eligibility to multiple social programs based on an assessment of registrants’ needs and conditions. The programs
would then make enrollment decisions based on program-specific eligibility decisions and budgetary space.
Integrated Social Registries. Importantly, since Integrated Social Registries collect information on all applicants,
they can be a signal of the potential “demand” for social programs. 36 Examples of Integrated Social Registries
include Brazil’s Cadastro Unico, Pakistan’s National Socio-Economic Registry, and the Philippines’ Listahanan,

36   Silva Villabos, et. al., (2015)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     35
which all serve multiple programs, as discussed in Chapter 5 below. As discussed above, some Integrated Social
Registries also link to other administrative systems, such as the ID system (for authentication) and systems for
taxes, pension contributions, property, and so forth.

Some countries operate Integrated Beneficiary Registries for coordination and efficiency of benefits
administration. Integrated Beneficiary Registries allow for monitoring and coordination of “who receives what”
benefits,” and for identifying intended or unintended duplications across programs. Since Integrated Beneficiary
Registries link information on beneficiaries of social programs, they can be a signal of the potential “supply” of
social programs. 37 An Integrated Beneficiary Registry operates as a data warehouse that collects information
from different social programs and their benefits administration systems, such as the number and characteristics
of beneficiaries, value, expenditure on social programs, performance of programs, such as the frequency of
payments/transfers, speed or cycle-time of key processes, number of complaints received and resolved. 38 It
allows for cross-checks using interoperability mechanisms between separate stand-alone benefits
administration systems and other administrative information systems such as Income tax, Civil Registration, as
well as the Social Registry. It allows for monitoring and reporting on that information, and disaggregation by
geographic location. Such analytics on the various programs would not only be useful to the government, but
also to citizens for better transparency on the performance and management of social assistance programs. One
example is Kenya’s “Single Registry” system. The country disposes of a number of SSN protection programs,
including (1) the Cash Transfer Program for Orphans and Vulnerable Children, (2) the Older Persons Cash
Transfer Program, (3) the Persons with Severe Disability Cash Transfer, (4) the Hunger Safety Net Program, and
(5) the World Food Programme Cash for Assets Program. Kenya has consolidated these programs by creating an
integrated beneficiary registry for social protection with a view to providing accurate analytical reports on the
social protection sector. Prior to developing that system, three cash transfer programs managed under the same
Ministry had developed parallel software applications, databases and ICT infrastructure for management of
information on beneficiaries, benefits administration and payments. Frontline social workers responsible for
these programs relied on separate software applications. A gradual process of consolidation of those programs
entailed the harmonization of the front-office software applications to have a similar look and feel, although
their database components are all still separate. Eventually, those databases were consolidated by means of a
data warehouse that serves as an Integrated Beneficiary Registry, which is now called the “Single Registry.” The
so-called ‘single registry’ has allowed efficient program monitoring, reduced double registration, increased
transparency and accountability, promoted the efficient transfer of data, and enhanced the quality of
operations.

Interestingly, many countries operate only one or the other – either an Integrated Social Registry or an
Integrated Beneficiary Registry.

•      Some countries with Integrated Social Registries lack Integrated Beneficiary Registries. Many countries
       have focused their efforts on developing Social Registries as tools for managing the “gateway” for
       consideration of eligibility of social programs. However, they do not link information on actual beneficiaries
       across social programs, particularly when those programs are managed by multiple agencies. In other
       words, they have not developed Integrated Beneficiary Registry systems – and thus lack the ability to
       monitor and coordinate “who receives what benefits,” and to identify intended or unintended duplications

37Ibid.
38In some instances, donors or other agencies operate digital platforms for integrated beneficiary and benefits management. For
example, the World Food Programme’s (WFP) SCOPE, is a proprietary digital platform for beneficiary and transfer management, which
imports data on beneficiaries of a program, uses biometric capabilities to capture and store identity data to authenticate them at the
point of registration, de-duplicates data on beneficiaries, manages entitlements to beneficiaries, administers the delivery of benefits
through commercial payment service providers (cash or mobile) with multi-factor authentication (Scope Card, Barcoded Household ID
Card, Pin number, Biometrics) and provides analytics on program operations. Discussions with WFP Staff in Washington DC, March 2017.

       across programs. One example is Brazil. While the Cadastro Unico Integrated Social Registry serves as a
       common gateway for some 30 social programs aimed at serving the poor and low income groups, Brazil does
       not operate an Integrated Beneficiary Registry that would allow it to coordinate and monitor benefits across
       these programs, particularly across the programs that are outside the Ministry of Social and Agrarian
       Development (MDSA). It thus has no way of tracking “who gets what” across programs managed by different
       agencies, even if they all use the common gateway of the Cadastro Unico.
•      Other countries have developed Integrated Beneficiary Registries, but do not operate Social Registries.
       Other countries have focused their efforts on the creation and integration of beneficiary registries to support
       benefits administration and coordination, but without developing Social Registries. One example is Kenya,
       which has developed the “Single Registry” to consolidate beneficiary registries, as discussed above. As
       discussed in Chapter 2, some countries (or programs) do not record information on all potential beneficiaries
       (registrants or applicants) of a social program. Rather, programs gather information only on beneficiaries,
       on the basis of enrollment decisions that are taken “outside the system.” For example, with community-
       based targeting mechanisms, communities or local councils take enrollment decisions without recording
       information on all potential beneficiaries. Instead, once these enrollment decisions, information on
       beneficiaries is recorded in beneficiary registries and used in benefits administration systems. Efforts have
       then focused on consolidating these registries into Integrated Beneficiary Registries for greater coordination
       across programs. However, without Social Registries – which support intake and registration and
       determination of potential eligibility for all applicants, these systems lack social accountability mechanisms
       such as grievance redress systems to handle appeals for those individuals or households who are excluded
       from social programs (potentially eligible non-beneficiaries). Other examples of countries with integrated
       beneficiary registries but not Social Registries include, inter alia: Vietnam’s POSASOFT (integrated
       beneficiary registry), Rwanda’s iSP-MIS (integrated social protection management information system), and
       various others in Africa that are currently under development.

Putting the Puzzle Together: Integrated Social Protection Information Systems

Some countries have combined these approaches and taken them further, creating Integrated Social
Protection Information Systems. A notable example is Chile’s Integrated Social Information System (SIIS), 39
which combines numerous elements: (a) an Integrated Social Registry (Registro Social de Hogares, RSH), which
serves as a gateway for determining potential eligibility for some 80 programs (benefits and services) from
numerous agencies; (b) an Integrated Beneficiary Registry (Registro Integrado de Beneficiarios, RIB), which links
information on beneficiaries across these programs; (c) an integrated inventory of social programs (BIPS), which
is more of a planning tool to monitor current and planned social benefits, services and infrastructure across the
country; and (d) a territorial information system to geo-reference individuals and households in the RSH and RIB,
as well as social programs in the BIPS, and which can link to other territorial information to support disaster
response and management. The overall system (SIIS) and its components all link numerous administrative
systems with interoperability capabilities for data exchange, which facilitates efficiency, authentication,
information quality and accuracy.

The combination of Integrated Social Registries and Integrated Beneficiary Registries is a powerful social policy
tool. 40 Integrated Social Registries can serve as a measure of the “demand” for social programs, particularly
when they allow for dynamic intake and registration, as in the case of Chile’s RSH. Integrated Beneficiary
Registries can serve as a measure of the “supply” of social programs, as is the case for Chile’s RIB. By putting
these together, the SIIS allows for sophisticated policy analysis including: (a) profiling of the specific needs and
conditions of various groups of the population (demand-side analysis via the RSH); (b) coordination of the
“supply” across programs, including detecting of intended or unintended overlaps; and (c) analysis of potential

“gaps” in coverage of key bundles of benefits and services that could be tailored to the typical needs of these
profiled groups (combining the demand- and supply-side analytics of the RSH and RIB). This gap analysis could
allow for simulations of fiscal resources needed to extend key benefits and services to underserved groups, with
clear identification of the potential additional beneficiaries that could be added.

Building Integrated Social Protection Information Systems

While it is beyond the scope of this paper to describe in detail the ‘how to’ of all of the components of an
Integrated Social Protection Information System, it is important to note that the approach should incorporate a
business-process orientation and a systems architecture approach.

This systemic process-oriented approach is not always adopted. In several countries, information systems for
managing and administering social programs tend to be limited in scope or non-existent. In these countries,
interventions are limited to developing ‘mere databases’ and managing data as lists (socio-economic
classification registries, beneficiary registries, payments registries, etc.), rather than building full-fledged
information systems that will support the daily operations and administration of social programs. The software
applications are limited to visual interfaces for applying to programs and providing basic reporting. Software
applications that automate key functions and processes such as cross-checks, validation and verification,
administration of benefits, administration of payments, case management or even grievance management are
semi-manual or manual. These software applications are not built as part of an information system or an overall
Integrated Social Protection Information System. With limited capacity, building information systems from the
traditional perspective of a pulling together databases in the form of a spreadsheet or even a small-scale
database management system may well be a worthy approach in the short term. 41 However, over the medium-
to-long term, it is critical that countries develop a business process orientation when building information
systems to ensure that the end-to-end processes of managing social programs are automated, as a by-product
of which timely, accurate, complete and high quality transactions data are generated.

In order to build full-fledged information systems, a business-process orientation is needed. Top on the policy
agenda would be to develop comprehensive process maps of the delivery chain, with clarity on roles and
accountabilities of various institutions, who does what and when (See Annex 2). 42 The next important step would
be to conceptualize what the overall integrated digital social protection systems architecture would look like for
the country, and how to sequence the implementation of those components, in tandem with legislative reforms,
public administration reforms, and technology application within the local context. However, this is not to say
that the building of information systems should be incremental and that countries should be entirely devoid of
risk-taking. The policy agenda when building full-fledged information systems for social programs should not be
limited to that of cautious incrementalism, but that of learning from the experiences of other countries and
leapfrogging, utilizing clever technology options where appropriate, especially where countries have the
capacity and the ability to quickly develop ‘good-enough’ business processes and systems designs. Governments
should develop Integrated Social Protection Information Systems as part of their overall agenda to build trust
with the citizens through their day-to-day interactions and delivery of services to them.




41 Some “so-called" social registries are developed as “mere databases,” but these do not fulfill the functions of Social Registries as
inclusion and information systems.
42 Greece developed delivery chain maps for hundreds of programs in an effort to develop a comprehensive plan and roadmap for building

integrated digital social protection systems.

Mexico, Montenegro, Pakistan, the Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Turkey. Annex 1 provides additional
details for each of these Social Registries. In addition, other social registries are included to illustrate specific
points, such as Kenya, Rwanda, Nigeria, Egypt, Vietnam, the US, Estonia, Belgium, Canada, Australia, and so
forth. As the Chapter demonstrates, there is much diversity around various characteristics of Social Registries.
One key distinguishing feature that is convenient for classifying these systems up front is whether or not the
primary method for intake and registration is on demand (at the initiative of applicants) or via en masse
registration waves (supply-driven “census sweeps” to register all or most citizens in specified areas at the
initiative of administrators). With en masse registration systems, we further classify as to whether they operate
more-or-less on a national basis, whereas others are restricted to limited areas. Many systems use a mix of on
demand and en masse methods, but the classification in Box 7 is according to the primary method by which the
majority of applicants or registrants enter the system. As shown in Box 7, the examples in our sample of 20
countries are split fairly evenly between those using on-demand methods for intake and registration and those
primarily using en masse census-sweep registration waves.

applications via municipal offices, with about a quarter of those registered entering through on demand since the last round of en
masse registration in 2011.


With this sample of Social Registries, this Chapter illustrates the diverse typologies and trajectories of country
experiences with Social Registries in terms of three key features: (a) institutional roles and responsibilities
(central and local); (b) characteristics of their role as inclusion systems: coverage, integration for use by multiple
programs, and dynamic inclusion for access to intake, registration and updating by anyone at any time; and
(c) characteristics of their architecture as information systems: degree of interoperability with other systems
and structure of database management.

It is important to highlight that these systems evolve over time and the starting points matter in terms of context,
capacity, and objectives. This also means that these systems will continue to evolve beyond the time-frame of
this paper. As such, when “current characteristics” are presented to describe diverse typologies of Social
Registries “today,” we loosely refer to the period from circa 2015-2017, though we also trace the evolution of

some systems prior to this “recent period.” While this Chapter presents an overview of cross-country patterns,
Annex 1 provides additional details on specific country examples.

    A. Diverse Institutional Arrangements and Legal Foundations

Institutional Arrangements

The institutional arrangements for Social Registries vary across countries, both centrally and locally. There is
no blueprint or single model that should be replicated across countries. Contextual and institutional factors
determine what is appropriate for each country.

Arrangements for managing and operating Social Registries at the central level vary significantly across
countries. Several “models” for central arrangements for managing and operating Social Registries can be
observed (Box 8). First, the most common model in our sample of 20 countries is that the Social Registries are
hosted, managed, and operated by a “central social agency,” such as a social protection ministry. Country
examples of this model include: Azerbaijan, Chile, Djibouti, Georgia, Macedonia, Mauritius, Mexico, the
Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Turkey, and Yemen (Box 8). In most cases, these central agencies also share
information from the social registry with other “user programs” and partner agencies via data sharing
agreements. Second, another model involves arrangements whereby the “central social agency” hosts and
manages (“custodian”) the Social Registry, but outsources implementation to an operating agent. Examples
include Brazil, Mali, and Montenegro. In the cases of Brazil’s Cadastro Unico and Montenegro’s SWIS, the
outsourcing is done via a performance contract. Again, data sharing arrangements govern the use of Social
Registry information for the purposes of use by other programs managed by other agencies. A third model
involves some other “central agency” that manages and operates the Social Registry, but is not otherwise
involved in implementing social programs. Examples include Colombia’s SISBEN, which is managed by the
National Planning Department, Dominican Republic’s SIUBEN which is managed in a specialized unit under the
Social Cabinet within the Vice Presidency, and Indonesia’s UDB, which has been managed and operated by
TNP2K within the Vice Presidency (although these arrangements are in transition). Fourth, another model is for
a specific social program agency to manage and operate the Social Registry, but share information with other
social programs and institutions; such is the case with Pakistan’s NSER, which is managed under a unit within
the BISP program agency. Finally, China’s Dibao Registry is managed in a decentralized way and data
management tasks are mostly carried out at local government units.

One key aspect of these diverse institutional arrangements is the degree to which Social Registries can serve
as an “honest broker” or custodian of data for multiple institutions and levels of government. Data sharing
across agencies requires a significant degree of credibility and trust, in addition to information security. In some
instances, it is “easier” for a social program to build a social registry for its own needs than to build and manage
a social registry as an integrated gateway for multiple programs. In some instances, it is “easier” for a social
program to collect its own information as a self-contained system than to access information of other agencies
via data exchange. Numerous factors come into play in determining these arrangements, including power
dynamics, institutional capacity and credibility, information quality and security.

There is even more diversity in the arrangements for managing citizen interface – and these vary significantly
depending on whether registration methods are carried out “on demand” or “en masse.”
• Within the countries using on-demand methods, all Social Registries – except Azerbaijan -- receive
   applications at local offices, but the jurisdiction of those offices vary (Box 9). Some are deconcentrated
   offices of the central agency, as in Georgia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Mauritius, and Turkey. Others are
   offices of local governments, such as municipalities, as is the case for Brazil, Chile, and Colombia (on-demand
   window). When central agencies work through autonomous local governments, they typically have to enter
   into formalized partnership collaboration agreements with each of the local government units. For example,
   in Brazil, citizen interface functions of the Cadastro Unico are implemented at local level via 5570
   autonomous municipalities according to specific “terms of adhesion” agreements, performance monitoring,
   and performance incentives for administrative cost sharing subsidies from federal government. 43 Finally, in
   some countries, such as Mexico’s SIFODE, the social programs themselves serve as the “window” for citizen
   interface such that people apply via any of the “user programs” using a common application form, and their

    data is then transmitted to the Social Registry to allow them to be considered for a range of benefits and
    services. Several countries in our sample (also) use digital service windows, allowing for electronic
    applications via personal devices (computers, tablets, mobile phones) or e-government kiosks or offices.
    Examples include Azerbaijan, Chile, and Turkey (initial application). Interestingly, in Azerbaijan, the VEMTAS
    registry only accepts applications online. The reasoning behind this was to eliminate face-to-face contact in
    order to reduce the potential for corruption and bribes.
•   Within the countries in our sample that use en masse registration waves (either nationwide or in specific
    areas), most use contracted field teams, sometimes in combination with community responsibilities (Box 9).
    Field teams typically include coordinators, supervisors, enumerators, encoders and verifiers. In the
    Philippines, field teams are contracted by the local NHTUs, but, importantly, the teams are not assigned to
    work in areas they are from, in order to reduce the potential for conflicts of interest. Pakistan has (primarily)
    outsourced field work to firms in specific geographic areas, with a separately contracted firm to supervise
    and check the field work. The Dominican Republic used to rely on NGOs, but is now planning for SIUBEN to
    contract and supervise field teams directly for the upcoming registration wave. The exception is the UDB in
    Indonesia, in which data were collected by the Statistics Agency for the 2015 registration wave.

Some countries build Integrated Social Registries on the basis of existing Beneficiary Registries for a specific
program. One example of this is Egypt, which is building a Unified National Registry (UNR) from the existing
beneficiary registry for the Family Smart Card System for food subsidies. The UNR is now also importing data
from other programs, such as the Takaful and Karama conditional cash transfer program, Social Pensions,
Pensions and other agencies. Further details on Egypt’s ongoing experience are included in Box 10. For now,
development of UNR capabilities has primarily focused on the back office for information management. As these
capabilities are strengthened, one question that arises for these types of systems is whether or not they will
develop front-office capabilities to support intake and registration that would allow people to apply for a range
of benefits and services supported by the system. Examples from our cross-country sample discussed above
shed some light on options that could be pursued to develop these capabilities. One option would be to rely on
the intake and registration procedures of specific social programs, but to develop a common application form
that could be used for all programs so that when individuals or families apply for one program, they could be
considered for many programs via the common application and unified social registry information system. As
discussed above, Mexico’s SIFODE is one example of this model. Another option would be to develop a common
application form for the social registry per se that serves many programs and is received at local
offices. Examples of this model include Georgia’s TSA registry, which accepts the common application via its
Single Window local offices of the SSA; or Brazil’s which accepts the common application via local municipal
offices.

Another variation in institutional arrangements in the context of large federal countries, which adopt
numerous approaches to Social Registries across “states” or “provinces.” Not all federal countries operate
national Social Registries. For example, in the United States and Canada, responsibilities for social programs is
decentralized to the states (US) and provinces (Canada). In those countries, each state (province) is responsible
for building or procuring the information systems needed to support the Social Registry functions of registration
and determination of eligibility, usually within the context of broader integrated social protection information
systems that also support beneficiary registries and benefits administration. Responsibilities for citizen interface
(intake, registration, updating, etc.) are then carried out by local government units (e.g., at the county level in
the US). 45 Other federative countries do operate national Social Registries. Examples include Brazil’s Cadastro
Unico (which is managed by the federal MDSA and implemented by autonomous municipalities, with some
limited support by the states), Mexico’s SEDESOL, Pakistan’s NSER (which is managed by the central
government’s BISP Program), and Australia’s Centrelink. In some countries, a “national social registry” is built
on the basis of existing sub-national registries, as in the case of Nigeria (see Box 11).

A key question facing federal countries is: do we need a national social registry? The answer to this often
depends on the constitutional or legal jurisdiction over social assistance, financing arrangements, and “path
dependence.” Putting aside those country-specific aspects, however, the question itself is worthwhile. Some
key reasons for operating a national Social Registry 46 include: (a) the context of implementing one or more
federally-funded programs; (b) a desire to ensure citizens are treated fairly and “equally” (or equitably) across
the country according to implementation of programs, uniform or standardized eligibility criteria, time limits and
procedures for updating requirements, and other service standards.; (c) redistributive objectives, to ensure that
resources “follow the poor” across the country; (d) efforts to reduce the potential for “duplicate” applications


44 The CSWs are public institutions funded by the state and managed by a board comprising of three representatives (one for the

municipality, one for the state, and one for the staff). There are 10 CSWs in Montenegro, with affiliates and branch office so that all
municipalities are covered. Each CSW is staffed with (at least) a case manager (social worker) and a lawyer.
45 Lindert (June 2005).
46 With beneficiary registries, additional justifications for national systems would also include the need for a national registry to avoid

duplications in enrollment or benefits across jurisdictions (states) and the objective of enforcing time limits on receipt of program benefits
(so that people cannot move across states to continue benefitting even after their official time limits for support have expired).
                                                                                                                                          44
in multiple jurisdictions; (e) efficiency, in terms of “buying” (procuring), “building” (developing), and maintaining
Social Registry systems; and (f) a desire to promote transparency and accountability in use of federal funds.

       Box 10 – Building an Integrated Social Registry from an Existing Beneficiary Registry: the Case of Egypt
 Egypt, which is building a Unified National Registry (UNR) from the existing beneficiary registry for the Family Smart Card
 System for food subsidies. The UNR is now also importing data from other programs, such as the Takaful & Karama
 conditional cash transfer program, Social Pensions, Pensions and other agencies.

 More specifically, the Food Smart Card System for food subsidies covers about 17 million households, or 70% of the
 population.

 More recently, the Ministry of Social Solidarity (MOSS) has designed and launched the Takaful & Karama conditional cash
 transfer program. Citizens apply for the T&K Program at Social Units at the district level on an on-demand, continuous
 basis. The T&K Social Registry maintains information on all applicants, currently covering about 2.4 million households
 or 10% of the population (and with about 1.7 million households deemed eligible and enrolled in the program). Database
 management for the Social Registry is central, hosted at the service provider’s data center as well as MOSS
 headquarters. Data are verified via interoperability with civil service registry, other social programs (contributory and
 non-contributory pensions) and National IDs.

 Egypt is now working on the development of the Unified National Registry (UNR) first on the basis of the existing
 beneficiary registry for the Family Smart Card System for food subsidies (and thus with coverage of about 17 million
 households, or 70% of the population). Data are to be imported from the Food Smart Card beneficiary registry and other
 systems. The system is expected to have online connections with at least 5 databases: the Food Subsidy System (as its
 base), the T&K Social Registry in MOSS, the registries in MOSS for social pensions and contributory pensions, and the
 Ministry of Education. It also has offline connections with four databases: Insurance-MOSS, NGOs-MOSS, Central Agency
 for Organization & Administration, Ministry of Higher Education, plus limited connection with sample datasets of the
 Income Taxes and Commercial Registry systems.

 For now, development of UNR capabilities has primarily focused on the back office for information management. As
 these capabilities are strengthened, one question that arises for these types of systems is whether or not they will
 develop front-office capabilities to support intake and registration that would allow people to apply for a range of
 benefits and services supported by the system. These could either be developed via existing intake and registration
 channels for social programs (e.g., using a common application form) or via a common application form specifically for
 the UNR that would allow citizens to apply for numerous programs.




Some countries that have not developed national Social Registries have sought remedies to patch over this
gap in systems across states. An alternative to operating centralized national registries can involve the ability
to “link” sub-national systems via sophisticated interoperability mechanisms such as data virtualization. As
discussed above, key ingredients for interoperability include a common set of identifiers (or unique ID) and
harmonized data definitions and structure of data management. Other remedies include: (a) carrying out
federal random-sample reviews of sub-nationally implemented social programs, reviewing applications for both
those who were deemed eligible and enrolled and those who were not to test for accuracy and consistency
across jurisdictions (e.g,. across states); and (b) setting federal guidelines for “systems integrity” for Social
Registries operated by sub-national entities (e.g., by states). All three of these alternatives are employed in the
US, which lacks a national registry despite original plans to develop one to support the operation of federally-
funded programs (such as food stamps / SNAP, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families/TANF, or Medicaid). 47
First, the Public Assistance Recording System (“PARIS MATCH”) allows states to upload and cross-check data on
a quarterly basis, using a standardized format for data exchange to detect duplicate entries across states

                                                                                                                          45
according to voluntary cross-state MOUs. Second, the Food Stamps (SNAP) Program is implemented at the state
level, but the Federal Government requires states to conduct rigorous random sample reviews (with subsequent
Federal random-sample re-reviews) of their registration and eligibility systems (“Social Registries”) to test the
accuracy of eligibility and enrollment decisions for approved and non-approved beneficiaries. Penalties are
levied on states when these reviews yield excessive error rates. And third, federally-funded and guided programs
(with national standard eligibility criteria), such as the Food Stamps SNAP and Women-and-Infant Children (WIC)
Programs, have developed “Systems Integrity Tools” to review state social registration and eligibility (“Social
Registry”) systems according to specific systems standards for both business processes along the delivery chain
(intake, registration, determination of eligibility, calculation of benefits) and information systems structures and
functions. 48

                    Box 11 – National and Sub-national Level Social Registries The Case of Nigeria
 Nigeria is a federal country with a great degree of state autonomy. The Government is developing a National Social
 Registry (NSR) as an electronic list of individuals representing in the first stage 4 million poorest and most vulnerable
 households. The NSR will serve as a policy instrument for social development in the country, whereby social programs,
 including for health, education and social protection, at Federal and State levels will, over time, be able to use a single
 common social registry to identify the poor and offer targeted benefits. It will constitute a Federal-level NSR with a
 federal “host agency” and with States managing intake and registration.

 The Federal-level “host agency” for the NSR will be established under the National Social Safety Nets Coordinating Office
 (NASSCO) in the Office of the Vice-President to hold information about the poorest and vulnerable households in the
 country. Information will be fed by States following the NSR guidelines and procedures. As in the case of Brazil and
 Colombia, formal Memorandums of Understanding between the federal level and each participating state will be signed
 to set out the respective roles and responsibilities of the state. State level administration will be housed in the State
 Office Coordinating Units set within the Ministry of Planning of each state. This process will build on the registries already
 being developed and used by 8 states, but aims to harmonize variables, information collected and systems in place in
 each Nigerian State. Registration of the population is the responsibility of states through local government authorities,
 supervised and assisted by NASSCO, using a combination of geographic and community-based targeting.




Legal Foundations

It is important for a Social Registry to be supported by a policy and legal framework. While the choice of
instruments will vary depending on the country, this framework should make explicit the roles and
responsibilities of different actors, the purpose and use of the Social Registry, rules governing the use of the
information provided, the rights and obligations of the population providing information, including data privacy,
data exchange procedures and control mechanisms. Countries where a Social Registry has been in place for
some time have developed a formal legal and policy framework for it consisting of guiding principles, laws, rules,
regulations, procedures, as well as managerial, financial and administrative mechanisms. Box 12 summarizes
some of the key elements of this framework for four countries – Brazil, Colombia, Philippines, and Chile.

The legal and regulatory framework often evolves, as the information in Box 12 demonstrates. Refinements
to the legal and regulatory framework and institutional arrangements usually takes place over an extended
period of time and continuously evolves as improvements are made and as overall social safety net policy
develops. For example, in some countries, a Social Registry may be developed initially for one program, but later
be given a larger more autonomous role within the national social protection system, requiring a corresponding
modification of the legal framework (Philippines). There is also a mix between a high level legal framework

(including Presidential decrees in several cases) and more detailed operating rules that are usually contained in
administrative circulars. Both are important for establishing a solid (but usually evolving) foundation for a Social
Registry. The specific instruments used reflect country context. In several cases, Presidential Decrees have
been used, but alternative mechanisms such as Cabinet documents have been used in other cases (Colombia,
for example).

Usually, countries use a mix of laws, decrees, regulations, and operational guidelines to support Social
Registries. Typically, the legal framework includes the following types of information: (a) legal foundations for
the Social Registry; (b) identification in broad terms of the main actors and institutions, and their roles and
responsibilities (including obligations of citizens); (c) the basic framework for the Social Registry, including key
definitions in terms of the social assistance unit (individuals, families, households); concepts and variables; and
other aspects; (d) overview of core business processes for outreach, intake and registration, determination of
eligibility, grievances, appeals, remedies, and so forth; (e) treatment of citizen rights, including access to, use,
privacy, and protection of personal data; (f) identification of the programs and other uses for the instrument; (g)
consequences for the provision of false information or unauthorized use of data, and so forth. When local
governments (such as municipalities) handle citizen interface (for intake, registration, updating), inter-
governmental agreements are needed to set out respective roles and responsibilities, monitoring and
performance, and cost-sharing arrangements. These legal instruments are usually complemented by
Memorandums of Understanding for data sharing protocols between institutions, and the broader information
security legal framework, as discussed in Chapter 4.

    A. Diverse Typologies and Trajectories of Social Registries as Inclusion Systems

There is considerable variation across countries in terms of the social policy roles of their Social Registries as
inclusion systems. This section first takes stock of the current coverage of Social Registries for the countries in
our sample. It then reviews the use of Social Registries across countries in terms of whether or not they serve
single or multiple programs. It then traces the typologies and trajectories of these systems across countries, and
for some, over time as they have evolved in their capacities as “integrated” and “dynamic” gateways for
inclusion. The section ends with a summary Table 3 that presents a typology of various approaches to Social
Registries as inclusion systems with respect to their advantages, challenges, key ingredients, and country
examples.

Diversity in Population Coverage of Social Registries

As inclusion systems, actual coverage of Social Registries varies significantly across countries (Figure 9). Some
Social Registries cover a huge majority of the population, such as those in Chile, Pakistan, the Philippines, the
Dominican Republic, and Colombia. Others cover between one third and one half of the population, including
Montenegro, Georgia, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and Turkey. Others operate on a smaller scale, ranging
between 3% (Mali) and 30% (Senegal, Yemen) of the population included in the Social Registries (Figure 9).

This variation in coverage can reflect a range of factors, including whether or not the registry is implemented
on a nationwide basis (vs only in specific areas), the relative size of the target population, the “maturity” of the
registry (if it is relatively new or has been operating for many years), the modality of data collection (on demand
vs. masse), and whether or not the Social Registry serves one or multiple programs.

Figure 10 suggests a fairly strong correlation between coverage of the population and the number of programs
served by the registry. In general, the larger the number of programs that use the registry, the larger the
coverage. As discussed in the next section, many countries use Social Registries for numerous programs, which
can represent a large range of benefits and services in social assistance and beyond. Figure 10 also reveals some
interesting patterns with respect to the correlation between coverage of the social registry and the method used
for intake and registration, as discussed below.

Social Registries that rely on census-sweep data collection methods often start with limited coverage, but then
get quite large as they mature and reach nationwide scope. Examples of countries that are still early in this
process include Sierra Leone and Mali (see Box 13). Some countries have moved from small “pilot” data
collection efforts to large nationwide systems with high rates of coverage. Examples of countries that are
undergoing expansion include Djibouti and Senegal (Box 13). The Listahanan in the Philippines expanded from
an initial pilot of 7,000 households in 2007 to covering 75% of the population by the 2015 nationwide update.
Pakistan’s National Socio-Economic Registry is another example, whereby a nationwide registration wave
resulted in coverage of 87% of the population over a period of three years (Figure 9). Because the overall cost
of these census approaches can be expensive, both in terms of budget and in terms of capacity and resources,
in many countries, they are carried out infrequently – usually every 4-5 years.

With on-demand application methods, there is a certain degree of “self-selection” in Social Registries. Some
individuals and families may not take the time to go register if they perceive that they are out of range of
eligibility for the program(s) that use the Social Registry. As such, the percent of population covered by on-
demand Social Registries may be somewhat lower than those that adopt a supply-driven “census sweep”
approach, when comparing Social Registries with nationwide coverage. Self-selection also depends on the
narrowness of eligibility criteria for programs using the Social Registry. Azerbaijan’s VEMTAS only covers 10% of

                                                                                                                                                                        50
the population because it only serves one program that has fairly tight eligibility criteria. In contrast, Chile’s
RSH has higher coverage, largely due to the fact that it serves over 80 programs, including some that are near
universal. Other examples of on-demand application systems cover in the range of one-third to one half of the
population, such as Montenegro’s SWIS, Georgia’s TSA Registry, Brazil’s Cadastro Único, Mexico’s SIFODE and
Turkey’s ISAS.

Indeed, an experiment with mixed data collection methods indicates the value of self-selection via on-demand
applications. Specifically, a paper by Alatas et. al. (2016) reports on a village-level experiment in Indonesia that
compared the outcomes of census-sweep and on-demand methods for a cash transfer program. In the
experiment, some areas implemented the registration process via census sweep approach, whereby mobile
teams would go to the communities to register everyone in the area. In other areas, an on-demand approach
was adopted, whereby households had to physically go register themselves. In both areas, the same criteria and
methods were used for assessing socio-economic status. The study found that on-demand methods did indeed
result in some degree of self-selection by the non-poor, who make up the bulk of the population. Many of the
non-poor opted not to apply, presumably perceiving the time costs of registering were not worth it.
Furthermore, the study found that the on-demand method improved the targeting outcomes of the program,
with a higher likelihood of the poor being registered. Nonetheless, active outreach methods are still encouraged
to promote awareness of the poor and marginalized to ensure they have access to registration.

                      Box 13 – Starting from Scratch: Social Registries in Djibouti, Mali, and Senegal
 For many countries, a common starting point involves building a Social Registry “from scratch” via en masse registration
 waves, first in limited geographic and then moving towards larger coverage. En masse registration waves are usually
 carried out to fill a real void in information on individuals and households, their characteristics, their geographic location,
 or their needs and conditions. In many developing countries, this information either doesn’t exist or isn’t reliable
 because it is out-of-date, incomplete, or of questionable quality. As such, teams travel to communities to register all or
 most households (hence the term “census sweep”). In many cases, the initial reach of these registration waves is small,
 limited to specific geographic areas, but with the intention to expand as capacity and funding permit.
 •   Mali’s Social Registry was designed to support the business processes of the JigisemeJiri Program (unconditional
     cash transfer, UCT), but already in consultations with other sectors and actors with the intentions of converting it
     into a National Social Registry for multi-program use. Nowadays, JigisemeJiri Social Registry is already being utilized
     by the direct cash transfer as well as the health insurance program managed by the Minister of Health/Agence
     National d’Assurance Medicale. In the upcoming months, it will incorporate public works and income generating
     activities programs, as well as being scaled up for reaching national coverage. Current coverage is still limited to 3%
     of the national population.
 •   Senegal’s Social Registry was designed to support the business processes of the Bourse de Securité Familiale
     Program (conditional cash transfer, CCT), but already in consultations with other sectors and actors with the
     intentions of converting it into a National Social Registry for multi-program use. Two years after the start, it was
     separated from the CCT program and was managed by its own team with its own processes. Nowadays, the Social
     Registry is already being utilized by two major governmental safety nets programs and several other NGO programs.
     It covers around 30% of population and has a national coverage (every neighborhood or village is targeted).
 •   Djibouti’s Unified Social Registry (RSU) builds on initial efforts to carry out a “census-survey-sweep” approach in
     selected areas that were chosen to receive “emergency” interventions. The system is evolving, however, and the
     initial Social Registry created for the “emergency” program is shifting to a large program (Programme National de
     Solidarité Famille - PNSF) that will facilitate people’s access to multiple programs and will accommodate new
     features, such as adding biometric information for improving interoperability of the RSU with other systems in the
     future. As of 2017, the RSU serves four programs and covers about 25% of the population.

Diversity in Social Policy Roles: Single-Program vs. Integrated Social Registries

Some countries develop and use Social Registries to provide access to a single program. As discussed above,
these are usually developed not as separate entities, but as part of the end-to-end implementation processes
and systems supporting that particular program. This has the advantage of building the system to meet the
specific needs and eligibility criteria of that particular program. In our sample of 20 countries, Yemen’s SWF
Registry and Azerbaijan’s VEMTAS Registry each serve only one program (in both cases, an unconditional cash
transfer program). In Azerbaijan’s case, that program is narrowly targeted as a “last resort program” for the
extreme poor, and applicants registered in the Social Registry represent only about 10% of the population. In
the case of Yemen, the SWF cash transfer program was developed to support the extreme poor (which represent
a relatively larger share of the population), and those registered in the Social Registry (both beneficiaries and
non-beneficiaries) represent about 30% of the population.

Increasingly, many countries are using “Integrated Social Registries” as a common gateway for coordinating
registration and eligibility processes for multiple social programs (Figure 11), as discussed in Chapter 3. In many
countries, the decision to move towards multi-program use of a common Social Registry is the result of an
explicit Government policy decision (e.g., in Brazil, Chile, Colombia). In other countries, as the quality and
credibility of the one program’s Social Registry improved, other programs started using that Social Registry
instead of carrying out their own intake and registration procedures (e.g., Pakistan). Either way, multi-program
use of a Social Registry requires adoption of harmonized eligibility concepts across programs (even if specific
criteria or thresholds differ), use of a common intake questionnaire, inter-institutional coordination and data
sharing agreements, and capabilities for data exchange and information security. Some countries are just
moving into multi-program use of Social Registries, as is the case of Mali, Senegal, Djibouti, Sierra Leone,
Mauritius, and Indonesia. Others have embraced this model in an extensive way, with numerous benefits and
services drawing on data from a common “Social Registry,” as shown for the Philippines, Pakistan, and Chile in
Figure 11.

It is important to note that not all user programs use Social Registries purely for eligibility purposes. Some
programs do use Social Registries directly for determining eligibility for social programs. Others use that socio-
economic eligibility data from the Social Registry and combine it with additional program-specific information
to determine overall eligibility and enrollment decisions for those particular programs. Some programs may be
universal, but use data from Social Registries to calculate benefit levels (e.g., for health insurance subsidies). Still
others use the information for planning purposes, to assess potential demand for an intervention in a particular
area or nationwide. Data produced by Social Registries can also be used for validating information collected
through other methods or sources, such as through community-based targeting methods, particularly when they
cover similar areas and contain similar sets of data for the same time frame. Still other user agencies and
programs use data from Social Registries for analytics purposes, including program evaluations, monitoring, or
other assessments. Data sharing protocols and MOUs between the Social Registry and user programs or
agencies should clearly govern the use of these data, and these uses should be part of the citizen consent process
at the time of registration (or subsequently).

The types of programs that use Integrated Social Registries go well beyond social assistance. All of the
countries in our sample use their Social Registries for cash transfers (either conditional or unconditional), usually
targeted to the poor, vulnerable, or low income groups. Beyond cash assistance, many use Integrated Social
Registries to support a wide range of benefits and services, some “targeted” and others “universal.” Examples
include social pensions; health insurance or health care subsidies; utility & transport subsidies; education and
skills; labor and employment programs; housing programs; sustainable livelihoods; agriculture, land, or
environmental conservation; emergency assistance; in-kind benefits, social services; legal services; war veterans
benefits; and a range of sub-national programs (often including similar types of benefits and services). Table 2
illustrates examples of the types of benefits and services that use Social Registries across various countries in
our sample (non-comprehensive examples. Essentially, these Integrated Social Registries can serve as a powerful
“multi-sided platform” across sectors, agencies, and programs.

Diverse Typologies & Trajectories of Social Registries as Inclusion Systems

Our sample of 20 countries reveals interesting patterns in the characterization of Social Registries as inclusion
systems. Figure 12 illustrates various typologies of Social Registries according to (a) the degree to which they
serve multiple programs (Integrated Social Registries) on the vertical axis; and (b) the degree to which they
permit continuous inclusion on the horizontal axis.

Many of these systems have evolved over time (and will continue to evolve), and the trajectories of various
countries over time illustrate several interesting diverse patterns:

•      Integrated but not yet Dynamic. Many countries have shifted from single-program use to Integrated Social
       Registries – but without developing capacity for dynamic inclusion (moving up the vertical axis rather than
       along the horizontal axis of Figure 12). Examples include Pakistan, the Philippines, Dominican Republic, 51
       Indonesia, Sierra Leone, Djibouti, Senegal, and Mali. One example is the Listahanan in the Philippines (aka
       the “National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction, NTHS-PR). It was originally designed to
       support intake and registration for the Pantawid Pamilia CCT Program through a pilot registration wave
       covering just 7,000 households in 2007. As the coverage, capacity, quality and credibility of the system
       improved, numerous other programs started to use it for registration and eligibility determination.
       Nowadays, the Listahanan is being used by 52 programs from many government agencies (including several
       large programs, such as the Pantawid CCT, the social pension, subsidized health insurance, and so forth), as
       well as by local governments and other institutions. The system still relies on en masse registration,
       however, and a nationwide census sweep was recently carried out in 2015 to update information in the
       Listahanan via en-masse data collection and covering 75% of the population. A key question facing these


51In the Dominican Republic, in between census sweeps, SIUBEN does collect some on-demand information from potential beneficiaries
(sometimes through smaller sweeps or on-demand in the regional offices, which are few). Nevertheless, if eligible, these applicants may
not enter programs until next round of program registration is open, which depends on budget availability. So the SIUBEN information is
updated usually every 4-5 years, but for a small percentage it is updated a bit more frequently.
                                                                                                                                   55
    relatively long-standing Integrated Social Registry systems is: can they build capacity to shift to dynamic
    inclusion systems? Will they continue to rely on infrequent nationwide census-survey sweeps - or will they
    start building capabilities for dynamic inclusion that permit people to register and update their information
    at any time? One key stumbling block seems to be a lack of a permanent network for citizen interface at the
    local level, either due to inadequate capacity for local service windows that can handle intake, registration
    and updating of information – or insufficient inter-governmental coordination to partner with local
    governments to build such capabilities. Yet there could be significant advantages to building such capacities,
    in addition to the desirable goal of building dynamic inclusion systems, as discussed in Chapter 3.

•   Integrated and starting to shift to Dynamic with a combination of en masse and on demand registration.
    Social Registries in some countries expanded to serve multiple programs, and are just starting to move
    towards on demand applications (moving first up the vertical axis and then starting to move along the
    horizontal axis of Figure 12). One example is Colombia’s SISBEN, 52 which has long operated as an Integrated
    Social Registry (serving many programs), but only recently started allowing for on-demand applications to
    allow for registration and inclusion in between en masse registration waves. SISBEN has been in place since
    1993 to identify beneficiaries for the health subsidy program. As the Social Protection System evolved, the
    Government took a policy decision to formally designate the SISBEN as the Social Registry for multiple social
    programs, including large programs beyond social assistance, such as subsidized health insurance and others
    (see Table 2 above and Annex 1).53 The capacity of information systems of SISBEN was strengthened to build
    some degree of interoperability with other information systems. Nowadays, SISBEN serves more than 8
    institutions and 31 programs, with population coverage of 73%. The system has continued to rely on en
    masse registration waves conducted every five years throughout the nation. The most recent wave was
    carried out in 2010-11, and another is planned for 2017-18. More recently, SISBEN has introduced on-demand
    applications, which are received by municipal offices who transmit the information to SISBEN. According to estimates
    in 2016, approximately three quarters of those registered in SISBEN have not had their full information updated since
    the last registration wave in 2011, but about a quarter have updated or registered via on-demand procedures at
    municipal offices. Similarly, Pakistan is just starting to pilot on-demand applications on a small scale, although
    the vast majority of households in the NSER will be registered or updated via the on-going en masse
    registration wave.

•   Dynamic first, then Integrated. In contrast, Brazil’s Cadastro Unico (Cadúnico) took a different trajectory,
    first building capabilities for dynamic inclusion before shifting to common use by multiple programs as an
    Integrated Social Registry (moving along the horizontal axis of Figure 12 before moving up the vertical axis).
    Indeed, Brazil invested significantly to build the Cadúnico as a credible system for the dynamic inclusion of
    low income families to support the expansion of the Bolsa Familia Program before moving towards use of
    the Cadúnico as an “integrated gateway” for multiple programs. In terms of the basic timeline, after a one-
    time nationwide “census sweep” in 2005-06, the Cadúnico has operated with on-demand dynamic registration
    capabilities since 2007, whereas the move towards a more “integrated gateway” with multi-program use of
    the Cadúnico came later, starting in 2011 under the Brasil Sem Miseria integrated social policy strategy (Box
    14). In this system, anyone who wants to register into the system, or update their information to reflect
    changing circumstances, may do so at any time (with no guarantee of any benefits). Additionally, all
    applicants are instructed to go to local offices every two years to update their information (or lose eligibility
    for any benefits or services covered by the system). Similarly, Georgia TSA Registry has developed strong
    “front-office” functions via its Single Window Offices that allow for on-demand applications that provide
    potential access to numerous benefits and services (see Box 15).

52 Nowadays SISBEN stands for Sistema de Identificación de Potenciales Beneficiarios para Programas Sociales. Originally, in 1995, SISBEN

was the acronym for “Sistema de Selección de Beneficiarios”.
53 This involved enhancing institutional dialogue among the Department of Statistics and Public Policy (DEPP), The National Planning

Department (DNP) that formulates overall policy and is in charge of SISBEN, Social Ministries, and the Ministry of Finance, as well as
expanding coverage and creating new programs.
                                                                                                                                     56
•      Integrated and Dynamic. Some systems were developed with capabilities for both multi-program use
       (Integrated Social Registries) and dynamic on-demand access. Examples include Macedonia CBMIS,
       Montenegro’s SWIS, Mauritius SRM, Mexico’s SIFODE, and Turkey’s ISAS. Chile’s current RSH was also
       launched as both an integrated and dynamic system, though it builds on decades of systems evolution. The
       examples of Chile’s RSH and Turkey’s ISAS are discussed in more detail in Box 16 of Section 5.C below.


                                         Box 14 – The Trajectory of Brazil’s Cadastro Unico:
                             Dynamic Inclusion before Multi-Program Use as an Integrated Social Registry
    Brazil invested significantly to build the Cadúnico as a credible system for the dynamic inclusion of low income families
    to support the expansion of the Bolsa Familia Program before moving towards use of the Cadúnico as an “integrated
    gateway” for multiple programs. The development of the Cadúnico took place over several phases:
•        Initial creation: 2003-04. The Cadúnico started off as a merger of pre-existing parallel social registries for four pre-
         reform programs (Bolsa Escola, Bolsa Alimentacao, Cartao Alimentacao, and Auxilio Gas), which were all
         consolidated into the Bolsa Familia Program in 2003.
•        Nationwide Census Sweep: 2005-06. A one-time nationwide updating of the current beneficiaries of the four
         programs was carried out in 2005-06 because the information contained in those pre-reform registries was
         significantly out-of-date.
•        Dynamic Inclusion System: 2007 and beyond. As Brazil was carrying out the nationwide census sweep, it started
         investing in building capacity for a continuous, on-demand dynamic inclusion system. These included actions on the
         “trilogy” of key systems for: institutional arrangements, citizen interface, and information technology capabilities.
         Specifically, key measures included: (a) formalizing inter-governmental arrangements for implementing intake
         procedures via local governments (including formal agreements, protocols, procedures, monitoring, and
         performance-based administrative financing subsidies transferred from the federal government to local
         governments for quality implementation of the Cadastro Unico and other functions); (b) strengthening the model
         for citizen interface via the network of social assistance and social service centers (SUAS/CRAS) in all 5,570
         municipalities throughout the country; (c) investing in strengthening the Cadúnico information system itself,
         including redesigning the intake questionnaire, rolling out versions 6.0 and then 7.0 of the Cadúnico software
         application, including eventual online capabilities throughout the country.

All of these investments meant that all registration has been carried out on a continuous on-demand basis since 2007,
with legislative reforms in 2011 to formalize the Cadúnico as and open dynamic inclusion. Anyone who wants to register
into the Cadúnico or update their information to reflect changing circumstances may do so at any time (with no guarantee
of any benefits). Additionally, all applicants are instructed to go to local offices every two years to update their
information (or lose eligibility for any benefits). The number of applicants in the Cadúnico itself thus expanded from 5.5
million registered families in 2003 to 27.2 million by 2015 (about 80.6 million registered individuals), representing about
40 percent of the national population). Since 2011, the Cadúnico has been used as an integrated gateway for numerous
programs, in addition to the Bolsa Familia flagship program.

Box 15 – Georgia’s TSA Registry: Integrated and Dynamic, with an Extensive Network of “Single Window” Offices
Georgia’s TSA Registry operates on an on-demand basis, and continuous access is facilitated by the extensive network of
local and regional “Single Window” Offices operated by the Social Services Agency (SSA) throughout the country. These
“one-stop shops” provide access to a range of social programs, social worker support, and labor services. Although the
registry was first developed to support the “Targeted Social Assistance” (TSA) cash transfer program, it now serves as an
integrated gateway for numerous other benefits and services. Citizens can apply any time on-demand at the SSA offices
using a common initial application, and then a common home visit questionnaire (Family Declaration).
The TSA Registry covers approximately 1.2 million people (or over 35% of the population), whereas 450,000 people (13%
of the population) are households that are enrolled in the TSA Program. Numerous other benefits and services rely on
information on potential eligibility from the TSA Registry, including subsidies and higher coverage under the Universal
Health Care (UHC) system, social energy tariffs, scholarships, special benefits for poor disabled, transport subsidies, and
so forth. Some of these, like energy tariffs and the UHC subsidies, are managed by the central government. Many
municipalities and district offices offer numerous other benefits and services that depend on the TSA registry for
eligibility purposes.
Two interesting uses of the TSA Social Registry not seen in many other countries include pro bono legal services and
foster care. In the case of pro bono legal services, the Social Services Agency (SSA) in the Ministry of Labor, Health and
Social Assistance maintains a formal Memorandum of Understanding with the court system that guarantees that court
fees would be waived for the poor. In the case of foster care, rather than looking at scores “less than” a certain threshold,
one factor that informs the approval of families to provide foster care services is whether their PMT scores are “higher
than” a certain threshold, to ensure that needy children would not face situations of economic vulnerability in foster
care placement.

    B. Diverse Typologies of Social Registries as Information Systems
There is considerable variation in the architecture of Social Registries as information systems. The context and
starting points matter, in terms of systems capacities, institutional structures, and the broader digital
governance context. Moreover, these systems evolve over time, sometimes with small iterative improvements
or adaptations, in other cases with “big bang” systems overhauls. As such, there is no single blueprint for how
Social Registries should be structured or managed. This diversity spans a number of aspects, and Table 4 at the
end of this section summarizes the typology of countries in our sample according to these features:

    •   Structure of data management: centralized vs. federated (virtual) systems
    •   Degree and use of interoperability and data integration with other information systems

Structure of data management: centralized vs. virtual

As discussed below, the structure of data management varies significantly across countries, depending on the
choice of data integration and the interoperability framework for whole-of-government. A number of
countries that are setting out on the path to building a Social Registry contemplate whether they should build
one comprehensive centralized social registry or if they can leverage existing decentralized databases to build a
virtual or social registry. (See Chapter 4 above)

One group of countries, many of which are at an early stage of developing their information systems
capabilities for a whole-of-government approach, may prefer to build a ‘self-contained’ database to manage
Social Registry data. Many of these countries have a weak interoperability framework among administrative
information systems. Self-contained databases usually store and manage data sourced through an en masse
registration (census sweep), for instance Indonesia’s UDB and Philippines’ Listahanan. Self-contained databases,
may also store additional data and updates sourced through point-to-point integration among agencies.

A second group of countries that have a traditional interoperability and whole-of-government approach tend
to develop a Centralized Social Registry. They build a data warehouse that stores information from various
administrative information systems sources, including beneficiary registries. These are based on traditional data
warehouse methods and they use ETL to extract, transform and load bulk data from administrative information
systems of the various agencies at regular intervals to provide analytics, and to answer the requests for data
coming from the authorities and from research institutions more effectively, quickly and cheaply. Changes in
data are uploaded periodically (daily, weekly, monthly etc.), based on an agreed schedule with various agencies.
Changes are not constantly updated in real-time as this would affect performance and latency. Such data
warehouses work well in countries that have mature information systems for tax, education, health etc.
Examples of such approaches include Chile Solidario and Turkey’s ISAS or Bütünleşik. This approach tends to be
more intensive in terms of time, cost and effort, as data needs to be constantly kept up-to-date with the source
data, with the added burden of protecting the security and confidentiality of all the data that has been collected.

A third group of countries that have an agile and highly interoperable framework for whole-of-government
are developing Virtual Social Registries using data virtualization technologies. This approach is being used by
countries that require agility, when a more centralized data management model is not feasible for various
reasons such as time, total cost of ownership, and challenges with collecting and centralizing bulk data from
other government agencies. A relevant example of a virtual data management approach is Belgium’s Crossroads
Bank for Social Security (CBSS). Countries such as Jordan and Egypt are currently experimenting with this
approach.


                                                                                                                61
Degree and use of interoperability and data integration with other information systems

Social Registries differ significantly according to their degree and use of interoperability with other
information systems and influence the structure of data management, as described above. The spectrum
ranges from “self-contained” systems that collect and manage all data directly, with little to no interaction with
other information systems, to “centralized” systems with limited, some or considerable interoperability with
other systems, to “virtual” systems which are highly interoperable and allow for real-time data exchange and
virtualization with numerous administrative systems (Figure 13).

each country based on information available as of 2015-17



Social Registries that are developed entirely as “self-contained” systems (or parallel “silos”), usually imply
little to no interoperability with other systems. All information is sourced through their own data collection
processes for intake and registration, and managed within their own information systems. These self-contained
systems are usually seen in countries where broader administrative information systems are weak, there is
limited capacity to support sophisticated information systems, may not be underpinned by a national digital
governance strategy, and where Social Registries (and social assistance programs for that matter) are relatively
younger. Because there are little to no integrations built between a self-contained system and other
administrative sources of data, it proves hard to do data cross-checks to verify and validate data for errors and
to keep data up-to-date for eligibility determination.
     • Yemen SWF, Djibouti RSU, Mali RSU and Senegal RNU have no interoperability with other systems yet.
     • Sierra Leone SPRINT has little interoperability using the household ID, for example with Anti-Corruption
          Commission System (which receives and filters all corruption and administrative grievances)
     • Indonesia UDB has little to no automatic data exchange with other administrative systems.
     • Philippines Listahanan has no interoperability with other systems yet, but the government is working
          more broadly on an e-government platform.



                                                                                                                                    62
Centralized Social Registries with little or some interoperability pull data from other information systems, for
example to run “cross-checks” or to push data to user programs. Such implementations are seen in countries
that have some existing capacity and are strengthening their ability to support more advanced information
systems implementations, including an interoperability framework for data integration with other agencies. Data
integrations are usually point-to-point and may be database links or private APIs. Cross-checks with other
information systems are on a periodic basis (for verification), or through infrequent “batch matches” (for data
audits and quality control).
    • Dominican Republic SIUBEN has limited interoperability with user programs, but they are developing an
        interoperability framework and data integration capabilities as of 2017.
    • Brazil Cadastro Unico, for example, runs periodic cross-checks with other information systems, such as
        the labor information system (RAIS), the pension system, and the tax system.
    • Pakistan NSER links to NADRA’s ID system for authentication of individuals.
    • China Dibao Registry has some interoperability with cross checks and some data exchange with other
        systems.
    • Georgia TSA Registry has some interoperability with other administrative systems for data exchange
        (tax revenue system, land cadaster, public property cadaster, utilities agency, vehicles registry in
        Ministry of Internal Affairs), as well as with user programs and municipalities.
    • Macedonia CBMIS has some interoperability via web-services with the Office of Management of
        Registries of births, marriages, deaths; National Employment Agency for monthly income, employment
        status; Agency for Real Estate Cadastre for property; Pension and Disability Insurance Fund. Macedonia
        also has an on-going project to enhance data integration with with numerous other systems.
    • Mauritius SRM has some interoperability, and links to the Mauritius National Identity System (MNIS) for
        authentication, as well as with other systems run by MSS, including the National Pensions Fund (NPF)
        for income verification and with the Benefits System.
    • Mexico SIFODE has some interoperability with the Civil Registry and RENAPO (National ID), but they
        have an ongoing project to develop an Integrated SP Information System, or “SISI”.
    • Azerbaijan VEMTAS has some interoperability with other administrative systems.
    • Colombia SISBEN has some interoperability and is linked to the Integrated System of Health Insurance
        (SIIS), Integrated Contribution System of Social Security (PILA), Information System for Operation of
        Subsidized Health Insurance (SISSUB), Information System for Regulation of Medicines, and more.
        Colombia’s SISBEN cross-checks data on a monthly basis with (i) the Social Security database (Base Unica
        de Afiliados del Fondo de Seguridad y Garantia del Sistema General de Seguridad Social), that receives
        information form the Registro Civil to update deaths and (ii) with the database of the Pension and
        “Parafiscales” unit of the Ministry of Finance to identify individuals whose salary is greater than five
        times the minimum monthly wage.
    • Montenegro SWIS has some automated and semi-automated interoperability with numerous
        administrative systems, including the population registry (for ID), tax system (public revenue office),
        pensions, health system, employment, Ministry of Interior (vehicles), real estate cadaster (property),
        etc.

Centralized Social Registries that have considerable interoperability have developed sophisticated methods
of data integration, such as using ETL (extract, transform, load) for bulk data transfer on a periodic basis, with
real-time links to transactional data updates as well as a ‘flush and refill’ to capture most current data updates
from other administrative systems at the national and local level. There may also be some private APIs and
database links to connect point-to-point with some agencies. Agencies with added capacity use an Enterprise
Service Bus (ESB) to exchange transactional data that changes frequently. These data integration approaches
are usually seen in countries that have invested in in-house capacity, have strengthened their ability to support
the implementation of more sophisticated information systems, and have developed an interoperability
framework for government agencies. Often, these Social Registries operate within the context of integrated
                                                                                                               63
social protection information systems, with active links to beneficiary registries, and within numerous other
administrative systems. Examples include Chile’s Social Registry of Households, which operates within the
Integrated System for Social Information (SIIS), and Turkey’s Integrated Social Assistance System (ISAS) are two
such examples (see Box 16).

    •   Turkey ISAS has a considerable degree of interoperability with other systems. ISAS is integrated with
        22 institutions online via web services, and also uses a data warehouse for bulk transfer of data through
        ETL. The National ID number and PIN provide two-factor authentication and the key for linking across
        these systems. Example information systems that are linked to ISAS include beneficiary registries of
        various programs, population and citizenship registry, household registry, social security, revenues
        administration, vehicles, land registry, farmer registration, health control information, education (school
        attendance, grade transition, etc.), employment agency, etc.
    •   Chile RSH also has a considerable degree of interoperability with other systems. RSH is part of Integrated
        Social Information System (SIIS), which includes the RSH + an Integrated Beneficiary Registry (RIB); data
        exchange via national ID with numerous other info systems (taxes, social security, unemployment
        insurance, pensions, health insurance, educational status, property ownership, vehicles ownership,
        etc.), as well as with the geographical information system.

     Box 16: Considerable Interoperability and Integrated Social Protection Information Systems: Chile & Turkey
•    Chile’s Social Registry of Households (RSH) is one example of a highly interoperable system that combines self-
     reported information from citizens and real-time data exchange with numerous other administrative systems. Chile
     first pioneered the development of a social registration and eligibility system (Ficha CAS) in the early 1980s, with the
     Ficha CAS proxy-means testing system serving multiple social programs early on in its inception. The RSH built on
     that early experience with the Ficha CAS system and was developed in response to the concrete changes and
     operational needs of the Chile Solidario initiative, which links extreme poor families to numerous benefits and
     services with active social worker intermediation and outreach. The design of a national system for social protection
     addressed the lack of communication among information systems managed by different agencies for numerous
     programs serving the Chile Solidario initiative. The 2004 law creating the Chile Solidario System included a mandate
     for the creation of a Social Information Registry (RIS), combining both the Household Social Registry (RSH) with an
     Integrated Beneficiary Registry (RIB) that links numerous program beneficiary registries. The RSH now covers about
     75 percent of the Chilean population and serves over 80 programs. Citizen interface is permanent, integrated, and
     dynamic: citizens can apply for over 80 social programs, update their information, and access their information online
     or through local offices. Self-reported information includes: family composition, housing conditions, education,
     health, occupation and income. Data drawn from other administrative systems include information on: taxes, social
     security contributions, unemployment insurance, pensions, health insurance, education, and property and vehicle
     ownership, and so forth. Interoperability is facilitated by a unique National ID. The RSH operates within the context
     of an Integrated System for Social Information (SIIS), with real-time two-way links to an Integrated Beneficiary
     Registry that permits coordination of both the demand for social programs (via the Social Registry) and the supply
     of programs (via the Integrated Beneficiary Registry).
•    Turkey’s Integrated Social Assistance System (ISAS) also maintains real-time interoperability with numerous
     information systems (population registry, social security, education and health, land registry, revenue
     administration, agriculture, etc.). This capacity was developed to consolidate parallel social registries that were
     largely paper-based systems and to reduce the amount of time needed to collect appropriate paper documents and
     complete the processing of applications. With the improved technology, the Integrated Social Assistance Service
     System (ISAS), Bütünlesik, was developed within the context of a broader digital governance strategy, allowing
     program administrators to query in real time and online a large number of government databases to verify the status
     of households applying for social assistance. At present, the system gives online query access to 22 institutions and
     28 databases through a web service system and is used by numerous social programs. For all social assistance
     programs, the initial application involves presentation of the applicants’ National ID numbers and signing of a
     consent form to allow institutions to review their information. A socio-economic profile is generated in ISAS by
     linking datasets from various institutions to the citizen’s unique national ID number. The profile is then assessed for
     completeness of information, inconsistencies, and potential eligibility via data exchange with numerous information
     systems (population registry, social security, education and health, land registry, revenues administration,
     agriculture, etc.). Subsequently, a social worker carries out a home visit to collect and verify information of
     households and their member using a standardized questionnaire (with approximately 50 questions). At present,
     this home visit questionnaire is still paper-based, but there are plans to move to a digital interface. Once information
     from the home visit is digitalized, the Social Registry is available for use by 17 programs (as of 2017), including various
     types of income support (such as CCT, old age and disability pension), Universal Health Insurance subsidies,
     scholarships and other educational supports, and so forth (see Annex 1)




A virtualized data management model for Social Registries provides the advantage of agility for data
integration and high degree of interoperability. Centralized and intensive data integration methods prove
tortuous when there are a huge number of data sources as well as attributes that must be sourced, and frequent
updates need to be managed near real-time, to improve the quality of data and therefore eligibility
determination. This approach is seen in countries that have strong in-house capacity, and ability to support
sophisticated information systems implementations, and have well developed integration and interoperability
frameworks. Data from various administrative sources is not physically moved to the agency that is the custodian
of the social registry, but is virtualized for the purpose of eligibility determination. This approach is useful in
countries where a number of institutions may be unwilling to participate in creating a large centralized store of
                                                                                                                              65
data for the social registry, on account of data protection and security, as well as the risk of data becoming
quickly outdated when it is replicated in a centralized data store. The data virtualization approach offers
considerable improvements in updates and cross-checks to validate and verify data, with real-time and dynamic
decision support. From the sample set of countries, there are no examples as yet of this approach.

Chapter 6: The Cost of Social Registries
Estimating and comparing the costs of Social Registries is not straightforward for several reasons. 54 First, there
are many different types of costs. One type of costs are the private costs to individuals and households
associated with participating in intake and registration processes. Another type is administrative costs both at
the local “front end” and in the “back office, and covering, both physical and human capital cost relating to staff
salaries, method and frequency of data collection and diversity in institutional arrangements. Second, costs of
Social Registries are spread out over time, varying significantly, because countries rarely design, build and
operate these systems from scratch with a single investment. This Chapter elaborates on some of these points,
and provides some examples in Box 17, while noting that cross-country estimates and comparisons of costs is
beyond the scope of this paper.

The first set of costs involves private costs of registrants. These typically include the time and money invested
by citizens to gather required documents, travel to citizen interface points, participate in intake and registration
interviews, and so forth. Some countries offer assistance to help individuals (a) obtain free copies of documents
or have documents scanned at registration site instead of bringing own copies; and (b) receive free lost
documents replacement, which implies that administrators pay direct the authorities in charge of delivering the
documents in form of subsidies. And in some instances, countries even include a line in the budget for the Social
Registry to cover those expenses (e.g., in Palestine).

The second set of costs involves the administrative cost of outreach, intake and registration. These “front-
office” costs vary significantly depending, for example: on the outreach approach that includes communication
to foster awareness, and the decision of having a pro-active outreach approach to promote inclusion of the most
marginalized and in remote areas; on the interview process and data entry that can be at the household level or
at a registration point, and also paper based or electronic that incur in extra costs as digitalization and trainings
on the tools; and method and frequency of data collection, e.g., infrequent census sweep approaches vs
continuous on-demand approaches. When looking only at the registration method, infrequent en masse data
collection generally involves large “lump sum” budgets that must be financed entirely within a specific time
period. Costs include, inter alia, hiring and training of mobile teams and procurement of necessary materials
(including mobile and fixed IT equipment and infrastructure, which can rapidly become dated and unusable for
future rounds. While for continuous on-demand approaches, a network of permanent “contact points” for
citizen interface, such as trained social workers and having IT equipment in local offices is required. This
approach can often take advantage of existing service windows or local municipal offices that provide other
functions. Continuous on-demand methods offer the advantage of smoothing the costs and financing of intake,
registration, and updating over time – which may be easier to finance as an on-going operating cost rather than
in large “lump sums” that must be budgeted for en masse data collection waves.

The third set of costs involves the costs of IT systems capabilities (software, database management, IT
infrastructure at central and local levels). These “back-office” costs vary significantly across countries. Some
factors that come into play include whether Social Registries are developed as “self-contained” silo systems, or
whether they operate within a broader “whole-of-government IT strategy” with interoperability or whether it




54 A few studies have attempted to estimate costs of Social Registry functions, usually in the context of other program administrative

costs. Some examples include: Lindert, Skoufias, and Shapiro (2006), Coady (2000); Caldés, Coady and Maluccio (2006); Tesliuc, Pop,
Grosh and Yemtsov (2014), among others.
                                                                                                                                  70
operates with local arrangements with local servers or only at central level with web connections with a central
server.

Other aspects that come into play include institutional arrangements, financing, and whether or not Social
Registries serve one or multiple programs. Often, the budget for Integrated Social Registries lies with the host
agency. One question that arises is which user programs would bear the costs of Integrated Social Registries
that serve multiple programs. In Brazil, for example, the Cadastro Unico serves numerous social programs, but
the operating budget resides primarily with the Ministry of Social and Agrarian Development (former Ministry
of Social Development) and is typically attributed to the flagship Bolsa Familia program. To some degree, user
programs in other agencies get a “free ride” on administrative costs due to the gains in efficiency that come with
multi-program use of the Social Registry. Vertically, another aspect that arises is the financing of local costs for
citizen interface. Again, the example of Brazil is useful as the central government passes administrative cost
subsidies to municipalities to cover the local costs of citizen interface for intake, registration, and updating.

Another key aspect is the evolution of cost elements of Social Registries over time. Very few Social Registries
are planned, budgeted, and financed all in one fell swoop, from start-up to full operation. Rather, as noted
throughout the paper, Social Registries evolve over time, and the starting points vary considerably. Technologies
and capabilities change, as do the costs of these investments. Besides the aforementioned comments key
elements of these costs over time include:

•      On-going administrative operating costs, which are necessary to run and use the system, including staff in
       both central and decentralized offices, activities to keep information system dynamic and up-to-date, and
       costs of appeals, and management and operation of the data base;
•      Systems improvements, including software updates, systems upgrades, training staff on new procedures,
       and so forth; and
•      Evaluation costs, including assessment, monitoring, evaluation, and audits.

                                                Box 17 – Examples of Cost Estimates

     Turkey: 55 Even though Turkey started from a base of extensive administrative information systems and program
    information systems, the development of the integrated information system represented a substantial investment. The
    total estimated cost of ISAS development was US$13.1 million, an amount that is considered reasonable compared to
    other countries that have developed similar systems. Since the system currently covers about 40 million people, or 10
    million households, this represents a system development cost of US$1.3 per household in the period. Turkey was able
    to reduce development costs by contracting TUBITAK, a public agency, to develop the system “in house” and provide
    ongoing maintenance. A breakdown of the costs by type includes: US$5.3 million for hardware (computers, servers,
    security systems, and system rooms), and US$7.8 million for analysis, technical design, and software development. The
    contract with TUBITAK included ongoing maintenance through 2015, and the IT department of the Ministry of Family
    and Social Policy provides continued daily maintenance. The cost efficiencies that were generated by ISAS outweigh the
    costs of developing and operating the system. ISAS has the capability to identify these cost efficiencies, for example:
    identifying and eliminating 10 percent of assistance benefits that were duplicated, reducing paper costs to the tune of
    processing 2.3 million fewer documents per month, and reducing processing time. With respect to the latter, for the
    time needed to process applications from registration to enrollment decisions was reduced by 20 percent. Moreover, it
    is estimated that the system generates a savings of one million full-time equivalent person days per year. Finally, ISAS

55 See Ministry of Family and Social Policy (April 2017, and 2017). It is important to note that ISAS is a full integrated social protection
information system, including modules for the Social Registry functions to support intake, registration, and determination of eligibility,
as well as beneficiary management and payments administration.

                                                                                                                                        71
 estimates overall resource saving of $39 million per year – far higher than the $13.1 million invested to develop the
 system.

 Colombia: The set-up cost of SISBEN was estimated at around USD 2.25 56 per family registered in 1995, of which 73%
 was related to household data collection. In 2001-2002 SISBEN administrators defined the new strategy for SISBEN, the
 SISBEN II, when a new questionnaire and procedures we defined to be applied nationwide from January 2003. SISBEN II
 continued using an en masse approach in selected poor areas identified by the cities and municipalities, to be followed
 by application on-demand for those not included in the initial survey of 1995. Over the SISBEN II cycle for registration,
 2003-2006, the estimated cost per family registered was USD 2.3 for a total of 8 million families. Then, SISBEN III
 registration cycle cost about USD 2.52 per family, including data collection and front/back office investment for
 improving interoperability. As technology evolved some data collection costs are declining due to use of electronic
 instruments, the SISBEN IV cycle cost for updating and registering new families, more than 10 million families, dropped
 to USD 1.27 per family.

 Brazil: During the phase of the consolidation of four programs 57, 2003-2005, into the Bolsa Familia program that formed
 the initial largest base for the Cadastro Único (Cadúnico) the estimated cost per family in the CadÚnico was USD 0.53 per
 household, because it mainly consisted of having households recertified using a single enrolment form and data entered
 in a simple system. As the Cadúnico matured 58, becoming the gateway for benefiting from “low income families” social
 policies during the period 2006-2009, it required more human and physical capital investment increasing the cost per
 families to USD 2.03. Between 2010-2013 Cadúnico version 7 introduced online synchronization with the federal center
 and other systems as pensions systems, increasing the cost per family to USD 2.06 due to the physical infrastructure
 needed.




     Chapter 7: Assessment Tool
This Chapter presents an overview of the “nuts and bolts” of Social Registries, indicating core “questions” one
would ask in assessing Social Registries (Assessment Tool). This review of core nuts and bolts and Assessment
Tool aims to help policymakers and technicians to assess and identify the quality of the current Social Registry
inclusion systems for social programs channeled to poor and vulnerable groups. It allows countries to assess,
build, or strengthen their Social Registries by providing an overview of key elements of these systems, along with
“checklist” style questions on each of these elements. It can help guide a “gap analysis,” facilitating an
assessment of Social Registry in its current state (status quo) and development of a “Road Map” of what would
be needed to strengthen it towards a desired vision for the future. This “gap analysis” can also benefit from the
experiences and lessons learned from a range of typologies and trajectories of Social Registries in other countries
(See Annex 1 for a summary inventory and characterization of Social Registries in a sample of countries). For
countries that are “starting from scratch,” the Assessment Tool provides an overview of key building blocks that
should be considered in the development of these systems.

Involvement of various stakeholders would be important in carrying out the assessment. These include inter
alia: (a) central agency stakeholders, including the Social Registry manager, policy maker, operators and IT staff;
(b) frontline staff involved in the intake & registration processes (e.g., at local offices, citizen service centers,
mobile teams, etc.); (c) stakeholders from user programs that use the social registry; and (d) citizens, applicants,
or those already registered.

The Assessment Tool is structured around five parts: (a) guiding questions to help characterize the current state
of the Social Registry, which can help situate it with respect to other countries with similar (or desired) systems
in order to benefit from lessons learned; (b) structural aspects of the Social Registry; (c) process aspects; (d)
information systems aspects; and (e) performance of social registries (Figure 14).

Given the wide diversity of Social Registries as inclusion and information systems, the checklist of “Assessment
Tool” questions is not meant to be exhaustive – and not all questions will be relevant for all systems and
contexts. Moreover, it is not intended to be prescriptive, nor is it advocating for any specific model or blueprint
for Social Registries. Any diagnostics or recommendations that emerge from its application will be country
specific.

Part 1 - Characterizing & Situating the Main Features of the Social Registry

Situating the Social Registry in Country Context & Social Protection Landscape (Current and Envisaged)

The core characteristics of Social Registries evolve to reflect the country context and landscape of social
protection policies and programs (existing and envisaged). The design and implementation of social protection
and social policy more broadly are associated with particular institutional arrangements – and those will
influence different aspects of the Social Registry. Particularly relevant is to what extent a country is trying to
improve the efficiency of the Social Safety Net (or SPL landscape) by promoting a more systemic approach. In
many countries, a Social Registry is viewed as an important instrument that supports this more systemic
approach. Also important are the coordination mechanisms and bodies that exist in a country. The role and
development of a Social Registry also depends on the characteristics of the intended populations for user
programs or potential user programs, as well as the eligibility criteria and concepts related to measuring socio-
economic needs and conditions. As such, situating the Social Registry in this broader country context and SPL
landscape (current and envisaged) is useful:
                                                                                                               73
1. Is there a national policy for Social Protection and Labor?
2. What government entities are responsible for administering social protection policy?
3. Is there a coordination body or steering committee involving different government agencies and stakeholders
   that focuses on improving coordination of various SPL and social programs more broadly?
4. What are the broad characteristics of the poor, vulnerable and other intended populations?
5. What are the main social programs to address the poor, vulnerable and other intended populations?
6. What are the eligibility concepts and criteria for these programs?

Characterizing the Social Registry in Terms of Core Features (Current and Envisaged)

At the outset, it is also useful to broadly characterize the Social Registry in terms of its social policy roles and
system architecture. This can help depict the Social Registry in terms of the “status quo” and the “vision for the
future,” and thus facilitate a “gap analysis” and road map for strengthening the registry towards that desired
vision. It can also help situate the Social Registry in terms of the typologies and trajectories of other countries,
so as to facilitate learning from relevant international experience. Tables 3 and 4 above provides an overview
of typologies of Social Registries according to various characteristics, and Annex 1 provides a summary inventory
of Social Registries in our sample of countries. These can to help situate a variety of Social Registries that could
offer valuable lessons learned for other countries.

1. What is (are) the existing Social Registry(ies) and what is the current coverage (number of households and %
   of population covered)?
2. Does the Social Registry serve one or multiple programs (Integrated Gateway)? If it currently serves one
   program, is there a vision to expand its use to multiple programs?
3. What are the Intake and Registration processes – and what is the periodicity of open registration (Dynamic
   Inclusion)? Can anyone register in the Social Registry at any time for consideration of potential eligibility for
   social program(s)? If the current periodicity of registration is infrequent, is there a vision to move towards a
   more open and continuous system of dynamic inclusion?
4. What are the main sources of information included in the Social Registry? Self-Reported (via en masse data
   collection or on demand-applications)? Via data exchange with other information systems?
5. What is the degree of Interoperability with other Information Systems?
6. What is the structure of database management for the Information System

Part 2 - Structural Features: Institutional Arrangements, Citizen Interface and User Programs
Key structural features for implementing Social Registries include institutional and legal arrangements for the
social registry as well as citizen interface, as well as the use of Social Registries by (multiple) user program(s).

Institutional and Legal Arrangements for the Social Registry

One aspect which differs significantly across countries – and depends greatly on country context - is the
institutional and legal arrangements for the Social Registry. Institutional and legal arrangements should be
tailored to local realities, building on existing capacities and structures if they work well.

Institutional arrangements for the Social Registry include the definition of which actors are responsible for the
various aspects of design and implementation, as well as the supporting formal policy and legal framework.
Several aspects for institutional arrangements should be considered as part of an “institutional assessment,”
including identifying the “host agency” for the Social Registry, the operating agent, arrangements between the
Social Registry and user programs, arrangements (including the agencies, local offices, or contracted firms that
                                                                                                                 74
are tasks with outreach, intake and registration – or inter-governmental relations if sub-national registries are
being linked to a national registry). Some Social Registries are operated by an agency that manages a specific
social program; others are “housed” by a specialized “host agency” that serves as the operating agent. Some
Social Registries are centralized in design and information management, but with decentralized registration and
data collection. Others aggregate sub-nationally managed registries into a national registry. The institutional
assessment may be taken to an even deeper level to carry out a functional review, to examine institutional
capacities including organizational structures, human resources, IT capacity (see also Part 4 of the Assessment
Tool below), and so forth. Institutional responsibilities for specific processes along the delivery chain can also
be mapped using “swim lanes tools” called “Delivery Chain Process Mapping,” as illustrated in Annex 2.

The legal framework also plays an important role in establishing and regulating social registries and can take
different forms depending on the country context. Regardless of the institutional and legal arrangements, clarity
of roles, processes, communications, financing, administrative cost-sharing, and quality control is essential.
Some Social Registries are created by law while others are set up through less formal means. Regulations or
operational guidelines typically govern implementation.

1. What entity(ies) is the “host agency” for the Social Registry? What entity(ies) (are) responsible for managing
   and administering the Social Registry?
2. Is there a coordination body or steering committee involving different government agencies and stakeholders
   that focuses on Social Registry coordination?
3. What are the main administrative levels of governance for the country?
4. What is the organizational structure, core human resource capacities, and IT capacity for managing the Social
   Registry? (Functional Review)
5. What are the main institutional roles and responsibilities for specific processes along the delivery chain (see
   also Part 3 of the Assessment Tool below, as well as an illustration of Delivery Chain Process Mapping in Annex
   2).
6. What is the legal, regulatory and policy framework governing the roles and responsibilities for the Social
   Registry?
7. Are there established and documented management standards, guidelines and processes for managing and
   operating the Social Registry?


Citizen Interface (also crucial for “Dynamic Inclusion” aspects)

Another central aspect for implementing Social Registries is the set-up for “Citizen Interface” – i.e., the point of
contact for citizens (registrants / applicants, potential or actual beneficiaries of social programs) with the Social
Registry System. This citizen interface can take many forms, such as: (a) at local office, service window, or kiosk;
(b) via mobile teams; (c) via social workers, frontline staff or enumerators; (d) via digital service windows, and
so forth. They can be managed by central agencies (e.g., staff or contractors hired by the central agency) or by
local governments. It can also be handled explicitly as the “citizen interface” for the Social Registry – or implicitly
via a (host) user program. The citizen interface also has an important “time dimension,” meaning: is the point
of contact for citizens available to them on a permanent or infrequent basis? This is a key ingredient for
determining whether or not Social Registries can serve as a “dynamic gateway” for inclusion of applicants at any
time. Another related aspect is whether or not this “contact” (e.g., intake and registration) is initiated by the
applicants themselves (e.g., on demand) or by the administration (e.g., via supply-driven en masse data
collection). Finally, an important aspect of citizen interface is the “user experience” of the citizens themselves
– and if the point of contact and associated processes are citizen-centered and service oriented.


                                                                                                                    75
1. What are the “points of contact” for citizens (applicants) to interface with the Social Registry? Are the entry
    points via specific program(s) or via explicit arrangements for the Social Registry itself?
2. What institutions are responsible for those points of contact? How are the administrative costs of the citizen
    interface financed?
3. Is there a physical location (e.g., local office, service window) where citizens can interface with the Social
    Registry system?
4. Who staffs the citizen interface? Social workers, mobile teams, facilitators, frontline staff, enumerators, or
    community representatives? Who manages and finances those staff?
5. What services can citizens carry out via that point of contact? Can they: (a) Register in the Social Registry (or
    “apply” to one or many programs via the Social Registry)? (b) Update, review or rectify information in the
    Social Registry? (c) Request grievance redress or request re-review or appeal of eligibility decisions (for the
    information in the Social Registry that is used to determine potential eligibility for social programs)? (d) Track
    and monitor application status? Queries? Etc.
6. How often can citizens access that point of contact? On a permanent basis? Or on a periodic or infrequent
    basis?
7. What are the communication channels for citizen interface (face-to-face, digital (mobile/tablet/PC/laptop),
    phone (direct/toll-free lines/IVR))?
8. Are citizens (especially those who are marginalized, remote or vulnerable) able to participate in the design of
    the intake and registration process to better take into account their specific needs and conditions that may
    not immediately be apparent to policy makers and administrators at the center (i.e., a citizen-centered
    approach to designing the system)?
9. How many citizens are served by the interface per day/week/month?
10. At what administrative level(s) do the citizen interface(s) operate?
11. Does the citizen interface cover intake and registration, case management, grievance and redress
    mechanisms? Any other functions or business processes covered?


User Programs for the Social Registry (Single-Program or “Integrated” Multi-Program Gateway)

A key distinguishing feature for Social Registries is whether or not they serve a single or multiple programs. A
Social Registry for a single program enables the effective use of information that is essential to the registration
and eligibility determination of potential beneficiaries for that particular program, and facilitates transparency,
accountability, and monitoring. When used for multiple programs, Social Registries can reduce transactions and
private costs for citizens and the administration. For citizens, with a common entry point, they would avoid
having to provide the same personal data separately to apply for multiple programs. For the administration, this
arrangement would be expected to reduce administrative costs because not every program would have to invest
in carrying out the business processes of intake and registration, which can be quite costly, as well as the
information management aspects of managing these processes. 59 When these efforts are consolidated, the
Social Registry should be able to ensure a high level of data quality and accuracy.

1. Does the Social Registry serve one or many programs delivering benefits/services? What are the user
   program(s) or potential user program(s) of the Social Registry?
2. How are the user program(s) using (or planning to use) information from the Social Registry? For eligibility
   determination and enrollment? If so, do they take enrollment decisions directly on the basis of information
   from the Social Registry, or do they combine it with other program-specific criteria? What are other uses of



59Adequate budget for these processes must be maintained for the common Social Registry, however, and financing or co-financing
arrangements should be clarified among user programs and the host agency.
                                                                                                                            76
      the information from Social Registries? For monitoring or cross-checking with other information? Other
      uses?
3.    Do citizens have to register with the Social Registry AND apply separately for some user programs that they
      may be eligible for? Or will one application with the Social Registry suffice to be considered for potential
      eligibility for the user programs (benefits and services)? Or can they apply for a particular user program, which
      can pass the required information to the Social Registry?
4.    What are the main population target groups of these user program(s)? Are these national or sub-national in
      coverage?
5.    What is the definition of the registering unit (individual, family, household) for the Social Registry and the
      assistance unit for specific social programs?
6.    What are the eligibility criteria for these user program(s), including conceptual and operational definitions of
      each variable, aggregation calculations for welfare measures, and eligibility thresholds?
7.    Can these eligibility concepts be harmonized for use in a multi-program Social Registry? What is needed to
      harmonize these concepts?
8.    Is there a common questionnaire to serve the multi-program Social Registry? Has this been vetted and agreed
      by the various user program(s)?
9.    Are the eligibility criteria known or transparent for citizens (potential registrants or potential beneficiaries)?
10.   Regarding data sharing by the Social Registry with the User Programs & other partner institutions (such as
      policy-making or analytical research bodies):
      a. What are institutional arrangements, legal standards and protocols or memorandums of understanding
           for data sharing between the Social Registry and User Programs or other partner institutions (such as
           policy-making or analytical research agencies)?
      b. Are there service standards for providing information from the Social Registry to user programs? Who
           monitors those service standards?
      c. Are there cost-sharing arrangements for financing the administrative costs of the Social Registry across
           user programs, or are those costs recorded and absorbed by the Social Registry agency or by a “primary
           host program?”
      d. Do the User Programs feed information on enrolled beneficiaries back to the Social Registry? If so, what
           type of information?


Part 3 - Delivery Processes: Outreach, Intake & Registration, Assessment of Needs and
Conditions to Determine Potential Eligibility, Updating, and Grievance Redress

As discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, the core function of Social Registries is to support registration and
determination of potential eligibility for social programs. Along the “Delivery Chain,” this means that they
support the implementation processes of outreach, intake & registration, and assessment of needs and
conditions to determine potential eligibility for inclusion in selected social program(s) (the blue shaded parts of
Figure 1 above), as well as the processes for updating of information and grievance redress.

In addition to the assessment questions suggested below, Delivery Chain Process Mapping (DCPM) is a useful
tool for assessing institutional roles and sequencing of core business processes within these implementation
phases. Annex 2 illustrates DCPM tools with a hypothetical visual example. With this tool, each actor is assigned
a “swim lane,” and then core business processes are mapped in sequence across those lanes. This mapping
helps assess the robustness of the delivery chain by identifying “who does what” and “when” for core business
processes supporting the functions of the main implementation phases. Uniqueness of role assignments is
                                                                                                               77
crucial for the principles of clarity and accountability – and the term “swim lanes” is used to symbolize the
concept that each actor “stays in their own lane,” without crossing lanes for role confusion. DCPM tools can
also be useful for mapping reforms. For example, the current institutional responsibilities can be mapped for
business processes “as is.” Envisaged reforms can then be mapped for the “to be” scenario to highlight key
changes in processes, sequencing, automation, and/or institutional roles and responsibilities.

Outreach

Outreach involves interactions to inform people about social programs, build awareness, and encourage
potential beneficiaries to apply. Outreach can also involve two-way communication to better inform program
or registry design by gathering inputs, views, and feedback from people and other stakeholders. “Active
Outreach” is often used to proactively reach vulnerable groups that may otherwise be uninformed about social
programs or their rights. Outreach efforts can be carried out by Social Registry actors, user programs, or both.
It is imperative that accurate and consistent information about citizen rights and responsibilities for both the
Social Registry and user programs be shared, as well as eligibility criteria for user programs, types of information
and documentation that would be needed, and the nature of use and users of information that would be
collected, as well as information security precautions.

1. To what extent are special efforts made to reach out to individuals, families, groups and communities, such
   as people with elderly with mobility issues, people with disabilities and people leaving in remote areas?
2. Are there ethnic and language differences within a country that should be taken into account in developing
   the outreach strategy? If so, are they taken into account in the outreach strategy? How pro-active is the
   outreach strategy for the Social Registry?
3. Which agency/local government level is responsible for defining the outreach strategy?
4. To what extent are various communications, media and social media channels used to inform the population
   about the Social Registry and the means to register?
5. Are communities involved in any process of the outreach? Which processes?
6. Is there high awareness of the Social Registry (and user programs) among the population of interest?
7. Are citizens informed of their rights and responsibilities? Is it standard process to inform citizens various
   aspects such as: (a) that registering for the Social Registry does not guarantee enrollment in social programs
   or awarding of benefits? (b) how the intake and registration process works and what information or
   documentation will be required of them? (c) how their information will be used and how they can access
   their information or query the system? (d) how and when they need to update their information?
8. Does the outreach for the Social Registry also provide information with regards to various Social Programs
   (user programs) and their eligibility criteria, as well as next steps regarding notification or follow up (while
   also informing citizens that registering does not guarantee enrollment or benefits of any kind)?
9. What kind of supervision and monitoring procedures are in place for evaluating the quality of the
   communication and outreach?

Intake & Registration Processes

Intake & Registration involves the process of collecting information to register the intended population for
consideration for potential inclusion in social program(s). Such information can include: personal and household
identifying information (including unique national identification); socio-economic information; and other
information on needs and conditions. It is important to characterize up front the type of intake and registration


                                                                                                                 78
process used, whether it is via en masse registration, on-demand applications, or a mix of the two. Some of the
core factors to consider when assessing intake and registration processes include the following:
1. Which agency/local government level is responsible for intake and registration processes? (see also Delivery
    Chain Process Mapping discussion and tool in Annex 2)
2. Who carries out intake and registration processes? To what extent are these processes supervised, subject
    to certification, etc.?
3. Does the Social Registry have manuals and training for social workers/interviewers/frontline
    workers/enumerators and supervisors?
4. Where are the interviews carried out? Are home visits required (for all registrants or some subset)?
5. Is an online application available?
6. Is access to registration open and continuous, whereby people can register at any time (usually through a
    local office or a digital service window for citizens)? Is there a specific open enrollment period? Or is it open
    throughout the year? Or is it open until user program slots (budget) are filled up?
7. In the case of en masse registration waves are households in locations-not-surveyed allowed to apply for
    inclusion in the Social Registry?
8. How often does the questionnaire or application form change? In the case of en masse registration, do the
    different information collection waves allow continuous analysis of the data over time?
9. Are households whose situation has changed allowed to apply for inclusion in Social Registry?
10. Are individuals required to provide an ID and/or other forms of documentation and certificates during the
    intake and registration process?
11. Do registrants (applicants) sign statements certifying veracity of information provided?
12. Are citizens informed about how the information they provide will be used by the Social Registry
    administrators and user programs? Do they give consent for the information to be validated and provided to
    other agencies (such as user programs), e.g., via consent forms?
13. Is there a plan for updating or rapid expanding intake and registration in times of crisis or emergencies? Does
    the Social Registry have expedited intake and registration protocols and procedures?


Assessment of Needs & Conditions to Determine Potential Eligibility

Assessment of needs & conditions involves systematic processes and methodologies for determining the needs
of applicants (potential beneficiaries) using various eligibility criteria and screening tools for the purposes of
determining potential eligibility for programs, and informing the determination of the potential benefits package
and service strategy. In most Social Registries, this assessment is typically automated via software applications
(discussed below).

1. Which agency oversees or manages the process for determining eligibility? (see also Delivery Chain Process
   Mapping discussion and tool in Annex 2)
2. What are the main steps in determining potential eligibility for social assistance programs?
3. Are the process and eligibility criteria automated within the Social Registry (via software applications)?
4. Are the process and eligibility criteria for determining potential eligibility established by law or regulation
   and/or written up in any manual/guide?




                                                                                                                  79
Determination of Potential Eligibility vs Enrollment Decisions

It is important to note that the determination of potential eligibility is a distinct phase from enrollment decisions
along the Delivery Chain (Figure 1 above). Determination of potential eligibility involves aggregating and
analyzing categorical and socio-economic information gathered in the Social Registry to assess individuals’ and
families’ needs and conditions vis-à-vis basic eligibility criteria. Enrollment decisions involve the formal inclusion
of eligible individuals or families in a specific program. However, not everyone who is deemed “potentially
eligible” based on those criteria would enrolled in a particular program, and the Delivery Chain distinguishes
between these phases. There are several reasons for this, including (a) budgetary limitation that can limit space
and coverage in the particular program; or (b) additional criteria guiding enrollment decisions, beyond the socio-
economic information produced by the Social Registry. Moreover, the institutional jurisdiction of these phases
can differ: enrollment decisions are typically the jurisdiction and legal responsibility of the user programs, not
the Social Registry, particularly in cases in which the Social Registry is used for multiple programs.

Processes for Updating Information

Updating of information – and reassessment 60 of needs and conditions – is another key function of Social
Registries. Outdated or static information on socio-economic status can lead to inaccuracies in the
determination of eligibility and calculation of benefit levels. The frequency of updating depends on the type of
information and specific variables (content). Not all information requires updating – some variables remain
constant over time (such as birth dates or places, father’s name), barring corrections to initial information.
Updating of demographic information of individuals, which determines household composition, should be on-
going to account for births, marriages, divorces, deaths, migration, and so forth. The updating of self-reported
socio-economic data should be mandatory from time-to-time because household situations can change rapidly
and unpredictably, for example, with changes in employment status, health events, crises, etc. The periodicity
of updating is also influenced by the sources of information for each variable, whether from self-reported
information or from data exchange with other administrative systems.

1. Is the registration date recorded (for initial application and updates) in the Social Registry?
2. What are the rules and processes for updating and rectifying information (for various types of information
   and/or specific variables)?
3. Do citizens have the facility to update/rectify self-reported data on a periodic basis?
4. How and where do citizens go to update/ rectify their information? How are they informed of this? How
   often do they need to go and what information/documentation is needed?
5. What are the arrangements for periodic wholesale updating of Social Registry data (for en masse registration
   systems)? How frequent are these?
6. Are any updates of information handled “automatically” based on data exchange with other agencies? Which
   ones? What is the frequency of those exchanges and updates?
7. Are the programs using self-reported updates only, or also exchange some information for supporting some
   level of updating?




60The literature and common practice distinguish between “updating” of demographic information and “recertification” of socio-
economic information. We focus on the different frequencies, periodicity, and sources of updating for different types of variables
(demographic, socio-economic), and then the “reassessment” of needs and conditions by the Social Registry without getting into
certifying enrollment decisions, which can depend on other factors measured in the Social Registry and is typically the jurisdiction of user
programs (as discussed above).
                                                                                                                                        80
Grievance Redress

Grievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) or complaint handling mechanisms/systems are constructive and
continuous feedback channels between beneficiaries/citizens and government/service providers. “Grievances”
imply beneficiary and citizen feedback, which not only include complaints but also information inquiries,
suggestions, and compliments. Well-designed and implemented GRMs can help program/project management
significantly. They help generate public awareness about the program/project and its objectives, deter fraud and
corruption, mitigate errors and risks (e.g., inclusion and exclusion errors, delays and errors in payment), provide
program/project staff with practical suggestions and feedback that allow them to be more transparent,
accountable, and responsive to beneficiaries and citizens at large, test the effectiveness of internal
organizational processes, and increase stakeholder involvement in the program/project. An effective GRM and
trend analysis of grievances can help arrest problems before they become more serious or widespread by taking
necessary corrective actions if needed, and thereby preserving the program/project funds and its reputation 61.
Therefore, setting effective GRMs are needed and careful system design and consideration of the specific
institutional context and administrative setting. GRMs must be in place to minimize incentives and opportunities
for error, fraud and corruption and some specific design features include good communication campaign to
inform population about their rights and responsibilities as well as the channels for making a claim, in order to
eliminate opportunities for bribery and opportunity for corruption. Note also that setting up adequate
administrative procedures includes ensuring that administrative processes are clearly defined and that staff and
other resources are adequate to carry them out; instituting a range of quality control procedures to ensure that
process is respected, information systems have appropriate safeguards, etc.

1. Is there a functioning grievance redress system to document and handle complaints (e.g., about gaining access
   to register, or about information concerns, and so forth)?
2. How are grievances and appeals triaged between those pertaining to the Social Registry vs those pertaining
   to user program(s)?
3. What % of grievance cases received a response? Was the response received within the time-frame
   established to do so?

Part 4 - Information Systems Aspects

Operationally, Social Registries are Information Systems, since information is the core input and output of Social
Registries. An Information System is an interdependent group of elements that function together to accomplish
some predefined goal (or to solve an organizational problem) by collecting, organizing, storing, processing,
creating and distributing information. To accomplish that goal, an information system makes use of a variety of
system elements, namely: (a) data and information; (b) software; (c) database management; and (d) ICT
infrastructure, as well as institutional aspects (people, procedures, documentation, etc). Social Registries
include all of these elements, though their architecture is also quite diverse in terms of sources and content of
information, degree of interoperability, structure of database management, and so forth.

Data and Information

Information and data are core input and output of Social Registries. The main “inputs” to the system include
various types of information needed to determine potential eligibility for social programs, and for this reason
many end up calling this as database. The primary “outputs” of social registries are data that have been
transformed into standardized formats or aggregations that permit assessment of needs and conditions against
program eligibility criteria. These “outputs” can vary across multiple program users if they have different

61   See Kumagai and Agarwal (Forthcoming, 2017)
                                                                                                                81
eligibility criteria or thresholds – as long as the data are gathered in the Social Registry and the user programs
share common “data dictionaries” and concepts for the variables included.

Social Registries capture a variety of types of information – and with different methods of data collection. Once
the intake process ends, there are some basic procedures to be carried out to transform this data into
information for the Social Registry, that is, data need to be validated and verified. Validation involves checking
that the data are complete and consistent for each person registered, and that each person is unique. Data
should also be subject to external verification, in person (e.g., random home visits) or via cross-checking with
other information systems. Once data have been verified and validated, the Social Registry is ready to be used,
and it can be considered reliable. Oversight and controls procedures and tools are also used for higher-level
quality control, including cross-checks (internal and external), sample audits and re-reviews, and other
mechanisms. Finally, protocols for personal data protection are needed, including the principles of consent, use
and proportionality, data quality, confidentiality and security safeguards, responsible transmission and data
sharing, right to access/correct/oppose data, and accountability.

1. What types of information are collected and stored by the Social Registry?
     a. Questionnaire/Application Form
     b. Specific variables (demographic, socio-economic, etc.)
2. What type of modalities are used for collecting information?
     a. Are data collected en masse data collection or a census sweep?
     b. Are data collected onsite via mobile teams/facilitators/social workers?
     c. Are data collected via local offices/citizen service centers?
     d. Are data collected through a digital interface (mobile/tablets/laptops/PCs)?
     e. Are administrative data pulled from other government institutions for curating and or validating
         information provided by applicant?
     f. Once applicant data is collected, how is it uploaded to the system?
     g. Can applicants upload these documents digitally through a citizen interface?
3. Which dataset will form (or formed) the initial basis for the Social Registry?
     a. Will the Social Registry database be initially built up from existing beneficiary registries?
     b. Will the Social Registry database be built up by transferring datasets currently owned by another
         institution, such that the agency responsible for the Social Registry is the new custodian?
4. If data have already been collected:
     a. Are there any gaps in these data (geographically or for full coverage of the bottom x% of population)?

Data Verification and Validation

It is crucial for the social registry to establish and apply procedures from the very data validation and verification.
It is advisable that information updating mechanisms be developed and timelines specified such that this process
occurs in a timely manner, ideally on a continuous basis. More specifically,

Data verification is the process of checking data to ensure that the value matches data that may have been
provided to other government agencies. When data verification procedures are built into software applications,
they rely on interoperability mechanisms to ‘talk’ to the databases of other government agencies. For example,
data verification would involve checking whether a man who reports he is married on his intake and registration
form, is verified to be true by checking data from the civil registration database. There are different ways to do

                                                                                                                    82
this. It can be done in person through a random supervision process where registries are chosen and the
collected data are verified in the field. There needs to be clear and explicit courses of action in the case of
mismatching or false registries. Verification can also be done through an administrative process. When other
social registries or systems are available, these can be cross-checked with the data collected for the social
registry and can act as an external verifier. Electronic is another option. Ideally this takes place online and
implies having one or more validated systems that can be consulted by the social registry to verify the data. All
of the above methods require standardized verification procedures and clarity with respect to who is in charge
of the procedures. The people in charge should not be involved in the data collection process. The
administrative and electronic methods, in particular, require agreements with other stakeholders who provide
the comparison data for verification. No matter where they come from, it is highly advisable to have protocols
duly agreed upon and signed by the stakeholders involved that regulate the process and the frequency of data
verification.

Data validation is the process of ensuring that the data provided by citizens are valid (clean, correct and useful).
When data validation is built into a software application, they use automated business rules to ensure the
validity of the data.) A simple example of data validation would be to make sure that data on age provided by
the citizen is a numeric input and is not more than 150 years, for example. The basic validation procedures that
need to be followed for the data collected for the social registry are as follows:
•        Check that the data is complete for each person registered. Ensure that all mandatory fields are
         completed. Data on all household members must be complete and correctly grouped. If even one piece
         of mandatory data for one household member is missing, the entire households’ data will remain
         pending.
•        Apply internal consistency grids to the registered data. Basic internal consistency grids must be defined.
•        Check for duplication. For a valid, high-quality database, it is important that there be no duplication,
         meaning that no one is registered more than once. There must be standardized procedures to detect
         duplication, including specific responses for each situation.

1. To what extent are there defined protocols for data validation and data verification for the Social Registry,
   and are these protocols accessible to the appropriate stakeholders?
2. Who carries out the data verification and validation process?
3. Are home visits performed for verification (for all registrants or some subset)?
4. Is there a periodic data validation and verification process for guaranteeing reliability of the data?
5. Are there protocols to validate (through cross check and logic) and verify the correctness of data sourced
   from other administrative information systems?
6. What data cleaning processes are carried out?
    a. Are the data received from main source checked against data standards and for internal consistency
         (including duplicate)? If yes, how many pieces of checking algorithm are applied? How many records are
         duplicate entries?
    b. Are the data cross-verified/validated with other administrative data sources such as national ID and tax
         databases? If yes, how many data elements are cross-checked?
    c. Can all the records failing to pass the above check step(s) be addressed by certain error or inconsistency
         rectification protocols in place?
    d. What is the percentage of “cleaned”/useable data out of total “raw” data in terms of number of records?
7. What are the protocols when self-reported information conflicts with information existing in the Social
   Registry or other information systems?



                                                                                                                 83
8. Are there cross-checks on data from other administrative systems to ensure that the most current data is
   used by the Social Registry? In case of data conflicts, does the system show a red-flag or does the system
   automatically replace outdated data with the most recent data update from other administrative systems?

Oversight and Controls for Data Quality 62

Most Social Registry and social programs benefit from having well designed error, fraud and corruption (EFC)
process that includes a good oversight and controls for addressing data quality. Fraud occurs when the applicant
at the time of registration provides wrong information intentionally, while error occurs when it is unintentional.
Corruption occurs when the staff intentionally changes information of applicants for its own benefit without
applicant consent. Therefore, oversight and controls mechanisms are key to deter error, fraud and corruption in
social protection programs. Such systems are complementary to demand-side social accountability mechanisms.
Activities for prevention include improved verification of eligibility, provision of information to citizens and risk
profiling. Activities for detection include risk-based and random reviews, data matching, risk profiling and
telephone hotlines. Activities for monitoring are linked to performance management.


1. Is there a mechanism in place for the Social Registry to independently verify a sample of data received via
   home visit, spot check, or audit?
2. What are the supervision procedures for overseeing all processes for the Social Registry? Who is responsible
   for supervision, oversight and controls?
3. Are there any procedures/mechanisms in place to ensure that the “right” people are providing the “right”
   information? If so, how often are they used?
4. What types of cross-checks are automated into the Social Registry? Both internal cross-checks (within the
   Social Registry) and with other information systems? At what point along the “delivery chain” are these built
   into the process? Does the system carry out cross-checks immediately upon data entry or later in the process?
   How does the system flag inconsistencies? What are the protocols for rectifying flagged inconsistencies?
5. Is there a specific strategy in place to prevent fraud? Have there been any ad-hoc measures implemented to
   identify or prevent fraud? If so, what were the results of those activities and what where the consequences
   of anyone involved in fraud (benefit recipients or others)
6. What are the measured rates of detection and rectification of errors (of different types) and fraud? How and
   how often are these measured and reported?

Protocols for Personal Data Protection

The rise of the Internet and rapid changes in technology have accentuated the virtual aspect of privacy. Various
categories of personal information may be regarded as sensitive or critical to personal security or social relations,
and thus considered private. A number of countries are setting up Social registries, which gather or curate
multiple types of information to assess needs and conditions. These include characteristics of individuals,
families, households (“categorical factors”) and socio-economic status, including self-reported or verified
income information, assets, education, health and employment status, access to services, or other aspects such
as food security. In order to ensure the privacy of its members are protected, and thereby to ensure the public’s
trust in the registry, it is critical that design of social registries take into account a human rights approach to
personal data protection.


62   See Tesliuc (2017)
                                                                                                                  84
1. What are the protocols for personal data protection?
   a. Is there a documented information security policy and a policy for confidentiality of personal information
       (privacy)?
   b. Is there a personal data protection law and how does it apply to the Social Registry?
   c. Are the data access control lists, user roles and security levels (confidentiality) defined to determine who
       can have access to what?
   d. Is there a way to authenticate users who request access to the data in the Social Registry?
   e. Is there a set of standards for data access, data use/disposal, and data confidentiality that the Social
       Registry must comply with?


Software Applications

Software Applications are also crucial elements of Social Registry Information Systems. They can include many
layers and support many functions to transform and use the data. One key layer involves core software
applications to support the citizen interface, including modules to support: (a) registering to be considered for
potential eligibility for one or many programs (software-supported applications or questionnaires); (b) updating
of information; (c) filing an appeal or grievance; (d) requesting grievance redress; (e) tracking and monitoring
registration status; and so forth.

1. Does the Social Registry have a front-office software application for citizens and social
   workers/facilitators/mobile teams?
2. Does the Social Registry have a back-office software application for administrators in central/subnational
   government agencies?
3. What kinds of functionalities are available through the front-office software application?
   a. Apply to one or many programs
   b. Update information
   c. Make an appeal (for someone whose data was collected to inquire about their information and appeal in
      the event they were deemed ineligible for a particular social program based on information from the
      Social Registry)
   d. Request grievance redress (example, individual or household whose data were not collected through any
      of the citizen interface modalities described earlier, to be registered and included in the Social Registry,
      or who disagree with their assessment)
   e. Track and monitor status of registration status, grievances, appeals, etc.
   f. Analytics and reporting.
4. What kinds of functionalities are available through the back-office software application?
   a. View data on household members, demographic, socioeconomic data, housing & assets, all programs
      registered etc.?
   b. Assess eligibility applying the policy
   c. Generate an eligibility list
   d. Data processing, cleaning, cross-checks etc.
   e. Data exchange – pushing eligibility data to beneficiary systems, and pulling applicant data from other
      administrative system
   f. Analytics on registrants, updates, eligibility, etc.

                                                                                                               85
5.  Which of these functionalities and software applications already exist?

Database Management and Interoperability

Database management varies significantly across countries, and there is no one single model for this.
Information systems are developed over time using different database management systems, and may be
owned by different parts of an organization. As a result, data are fragmented across a number of hardware,
software, organizational and geographic boundaries. Several kinds of architectural models are possible, including
a centralized and a virtual or federated data management model. In this section we also review data sharing and
interoperability mechanisms between the Social Registry and other administrative information systems.

Part 5 - Measuring the Performance of Social Registries
While the earlier sections focus on structures (actors), processes, and systems, this section focuses on indicators
for measuring performance of Social Registries. Specifically, this section maps out some typical questions and
indicators for measuring the performance of Social Registries around three key dimensions: inclusion (coverage,
equity, accessibility); efficiency (for citizens, for systems, for user programs); and accuracy (quality of
information, system integrity). This section also discusses aspects of systems for performance monitoring,
reporting and analytics.


Inclusion: Coverage, Equity, Accessibility

1. What is the overall coverage of the Social Registry relative to the intended population? How has this coverage
   evolved since the inception of the Social Registry?
2. What is the coverage among the poorest quintile and 2nd poorest quintile?
3. What is the degree of awareness of the Social Registry among intended population?
4. Has there been any indication that active outreach to bring in hard-to-reach population groups has been
   effective? (e.g., measured by increased coverage of those groups - # added to registry)
5. Can anyone apply for registration into the Social Registry at any time? Or is the entry only possible
   periodically? Once a quarter, a year, or every few years (how often)? (Measure of “dynamic inclusion”)
6. Are there any barriers to inclusion in the Social Registry – e.g., those that would limit accessibility such as ID
   or documentation requirements?


Efficiency: for Citizens, Administrators, User Programs

For Citizens
1. Does the Social Registry offer a common application (questionnaire) for multiple programs?
2. How far is the frontline point-of-contact for citizen interface for the Social Registry from the poor
    populations (measures of distance for sample or by group)?
3. How long does the process of applying take?

                                                                                                                  89
4.  How many visits need to be carried out on average to complete the process?
5.  Are documentation requirements difficult to provide?
6.  If there is a face-to-face interview process, how long does it take (time)?
7.  If there is a home visit, how long does it take and who needs to be present?
8.  How do applicants track about their application status?
9.  What is the “user experience” for citizens in interfacing with the Social Registry system? Are there quality
    standards for time turnaround, number of visits, ease of access, etc.?
10. What are the private costs for registering in the Social Registry:
         a. Time costs: travel time, waiting time, interview time, document preparation time, etc.
         b. Money costs: transport, photocopies, etc.

For Administrators
1. How much time elapses for the end-to-end Social Registry process, from intake and registration to
    determination of potential eligibility (cycle time)?
2. What is the time taken for specific business processes (cycle time: for intake and registration, assessment of
    needs and conditions, etc.)?
3. What is the volume of applications processed through the system per day/week/month/year?
4. What is the frequency of transactions by the system?
5. What is the Total cost of ownership (TCO) of the system (includes direct and indirect costs).
        a. Software cost (license, product per user charge, database, operating system software, server
            software, network software, maintenance fees, others)
        b. Hardware cost (server hardware cost, network upgrades, desktop hardware, data center facilities,
            power supply/generators/UPS, cooling, maintenance fees, etc.)
        c. Consulting costs (individual consultants or consulting firms) for design and implementation,
            deployment and upgrade, integration, future projects, etc.)
        d. Personnel cost at central operating level (management, IT staff, administrators, etc.)
        e. Costs at frontline for citizen interface (social worker/interviewer staff time, data processors,
            supervisors, IT staff and costs, etc.)
        f. Training costs (staff time, trainer, location, materials, etc.)
        g. Communication costs, based on roll-out strategy
6. Can direct and indirect benefits be calculated?
        a. Direct benefits (reduction in paper costs, reduction in material costs –fewer mistakes-, increasing
            business value, reduction or increase in personnel cost, etc.)
        b. Indirect benefits (measuring expected change in labor time or productivity, improved process
            management through reduced administrative overhead, reduced cost of errors and omissions,
            reduction non-value added time, etc.)
7. What is the cost of the system vis-à-vis population served/number of applicants
8. What are the costs to implement the Social Registry initially and per year since the inception?

For User Programs
1. What % of data records provided by the Social Registry are useable to enroll beneficiaries (in program X)?
2. What % of program X beneficiaries draw on data from the Social Registry for enrollment decisions?
3. Are the data from the Social Registry transmitted to User Program in a timely manner? In what frequency?
    What is the time lapse from the time of request for data to the time of transmission?

                                                                                                              90
4. Are the data transmitted in usable format and with all agreed information?

Accuracy: Data Quality, Systems Integrity

To ensure data quality and accuracy of the Social Registry, tools, protocols, and procedures are needed to
cross-check information, flag inconsistencies, and follow up and rectify error or inconsistencies. Systems
audits are also useful for periodic reviews.

1. What is % of records with complete information (i.e. no missing values) in the database?
2. What % of records having some data updated last year (or appropriate time reference period)? Are there any
   estimates on how many records and data elements that were expected to be updated last year?
3. What % of active records for individuals (or households) have data that is greater than two years old (or
   appropriate time reference period)?
4. Is there a mechanism in place for the Social Registry to independently verify a sample of data received via
   home visit, spot check, or audit?
5. Are systems audits or independent Social Registry reviews conducted? If so, how often? What have been the
   results? Has the Social Registry been audited or assessed by national control agencies or 3rd party with regard
   to system integrity, security, and performance? What were the main findings? Were recommendations from
   these assessments monitored and carried out?
6. What are the measured rates of detection and rectification of errors (of different types) and fraud? How and
   how often are these measured and reported?


Systems for Performance Measurement, Reporting, Use in Social Policy Planning

This section takes stock of the performance monitoring, reporting, and analytics systems for the Social Registry
itself. Social Registries should have mechanisms for monitoring performance, as they directly contribute to the
performance of user programs. Performance also matters for the credibility of these systems. In addition,
monitoring and analytics can facilitate the use of Social Registries for social policy planning, particularly when
reforms are being introduced. Social Registries can also be used to gauge the potential demand for social
programs.

1. Does the system have a performance monitoring system? Does it carry out user satisfaction surveys? Process
   evaluations? Analytics?
2. What are the standard monitoring reports for the Social Registry? How often are they issued? Who uses
   them and for what decisions? What variables are used to monitor overall quality of the registry?
3. How accessible is data (anonymous) in the Social Registry for analytical use? Is there an interactive, web-
   based system for analytics?
4. What data analytics using the Social Registry data have been carried out to support social policy discussion
   and decision-making? For example, designing new programs, scaling up or adapting existing programs,
   consolidating/coordinating existing programs, estimating fiscal cost?
5. Are these data analytics routinely required by the planning and/or budgeting authorities?
6. What types of evaluation reports have been generated using Social Registry data and analytics?

Annex 2: Using Delivery Chain Process Mapping Tool for Social Registries

Delivery Chain Process Mapping (DCPM) is a useful management tool for assessing institutional roles and
sequencing of core business processes within the implementation phases along the Delivery Chain. The
objectives are to promote efficiency, transparency, and effectiveness of program implementation by identifying
and sequencing key steps for implementation; and clarifying roles and responsibilities across actors (who does
what and in what sequence). With this tool, each actor is assigned a “swim lane,” and then core business
processes are mapped in sequence across those lanes. This mapping helps assess the robustness of the delivery
chain by identifying “who does what” and “when” for core business processes supporting the functions of the
main implementation phases. Uniqueness of role assignments is crucial for the principles of clarity and
accountability – and the term “swim lanes” is used to symbolize the concept that each actor “stays in their own
lane,” without crossing lanes for role confusion.

Ideally, DCPM would be carried out in a participatory manner with the participation of core actors. In this
manner, each actor understand their own role, how their role fits with bigger system, and can help identify
potential improvements and reforms. The participatory approach also helps build trust, consensus, ownership
and understanding of the key processes along the delivery chain. The basic steps for DCPM include:
(a) identifying the actors (e.g., citizens, local interface, info systems, central agency, service provider, other
agency, etc); (b) discussing the roles and responsibilities of each actor along the “Delivery Chain;” (c) assigning a
“swim lane” to each actor; (d) identifying the steps for the carrying out implementation phases along the
Delivery Chain; (e) mapping the steps in sequence across the “swim lanes” for each actor; (f) reviewing processes
for efficiency & effectiveness: are all of the steps really needed? Are they all “value-added” steps? Can some
be eliminated to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy?

Figure A2.1 illustrates is a hypothetical example of DCPM for eligibility determination and enrollment
decisions. 64 The roles of four key “actors” are mapped with “swim lanes” for each of the key delivery phases:
(a) citizens (all applicants); (b) local representatives for citizen interface (e.g., social worker at local office or
mobile teams); (c) the Social Registry Information System, managed by the Central Social Registry Host Agency
(such as Ministry of Social Affairs); and (d) a User Program (could have multiple – and could be within Ministry
of Social Affairs or in another agency). While it may seem surprising to include the Social Registry Information
System as an “actor” in the system, it is important to map these functions since the process involves managing
large quantities of information – and it is important to signal how the information system can support the
delivery chain through the automation of key functions. Following the Delivery Chain in Figure 1 (main text), the
sequence of “business processes” for the Social Registry are mapped for each of the core implementation phases
of: (a) outreach; (b) intake and registration; and (c) assessment of needs and conditions (blue shaded columns
in Figure A3.1). The processes for user program decisions and notifications regarding enrollment are also
mapped in the two right hand columns (shaded pink and purple in Figure A3.1).

This is just a hypothetical example of DCPM: other institutional arrangements and sequencing of business
processes could also be mapped depending on the country context. This example has user programs taking
centralized enrollment decisions, but an alternative could be that the information from the social registry is sent
back to the Local Government for “local validation” and enrollment decisions by local committees. Information
could also be “curated” from other administrative systems to supplement the information gathered locally. And
so forth.




64We used the “Swim Lanes” functions in Microsoft Visio software to map these processes, but other types of software could also be
used.
                                                                                                                             103
DCPM tools can also be useful for mapping reforms. For example, the current institutional responsibilities can
be mapped for business processes “as is.” Envisaged reforms can then be mapped for the “to be” scenario to
highlight key changes in processes, sequencing, automation, and/or institutional roles and responsibilities.

Abstract

This paper makes several contributions. First, it presents a “Guidance Note” on the framework
for Social Registries, anchoring the definition of these systems in their functions along the
Delivery Chain and their social policy role as inclusion systems, while clarifying terminology in a
manner that is consistent with IT standards in the discussion of their architecture as information
systems. Second, it illustrates the diverse typologies and trajectories of country experiences
with Social Registries with respect to their (a) institutional arrangements (central and local);
(b) use as inclusion systems (coverage, single or multi-program use, static or dynamic intake and
registration); and (c) structure as information systems (structure of data management; degree and
us of interoperability with other systems). These patterns primarily derive from a review of Social
Registries in a sample of 20 countries), (Azerbaijan, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, the Dominican
Republic, Djibouti, Georgia, Indonesia, Macedonia, Mali, Mauritius, Mexico, Montenegro, Pakistan,
the Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Turkey, and Yemen). The paper also draws on experience
in other countries (Kenya, Rwanda, Nigeria, Egypt, Jordan, Vietnam, India, Estonia, Belgium, the
US, Canada, Australia, and others) to illustrate specific points. Third, this paper develops a basic
“Assessment Tool” covering the core building blocks of Social Registries using a “checklist” style
of questions. Given the wide diversity of Social Registries in both their role in social policy and
in their architecture, the approach is not prescriptive: it does not advocate for any specific model
or blueprint for Social Registries. Any diagnostics or recommendations that emerge from use of
this Guidance Note and Assessment Tool will be country specific. Some key take-away messages
include: (a) the importance of recognizing both the role of the “front lines” for outreach, intake
and registration (Social Registries as inclusion systems) and the “back office” functions of Social
Registries as information systems; (b) the potential power of Social Registries as integrated and
dynamic gateways for inclusion; (c) the recognition that Social Registries are generally part of
end-to-end systems for specific programs, integrated social protection information systems, and/
or even “whole-of-government” approaches; and (d) there is significant diversity in the typology
and trajectories of Social Registries across countries and over time.
