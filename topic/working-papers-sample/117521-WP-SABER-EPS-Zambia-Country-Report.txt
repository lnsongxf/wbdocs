Policy Goals for Independent Private Schools                                                                                       Status
 1. Encouraging Innovation by Providers
    The school has the legal authority to appoint, deploy and dismiss teachers as well as set teacher salaries without review by
    central authorities. Schools can set their own curriculum but final review of their operational plan is carried out by the
    Ministry of Education. The Education Board has the legal authority over how resources are allocated to classrooms with
    final review from central authorities.

 2. Holding Schools Accountable
    The government sets standards for what students need to learn and also indicates by when or how well they need to be
    learned. Standardized exams are administered annually. The government requires schools to undergo a standard term
    inspection. Inspections reports outline priorities for improvement. Sanctions are not administered based on the results of
    school inspections or performance on standardized exams.

 3. Empowering All Parents, Students, and Communities
    No information is provided to parents on the results of standardized exams or inspection reports. Neither students nor
    parents are surveyed as part of an inspection process. The government does not provide tax subsidies or cash transfers for
    families attending private schools.

 4. Promoting Diversity of Supply
    The government allows all of the following types to operate a school: Community, not for profit, faith based and for profit.
    Certification standards require schools to own the land. Registration/certification guidelines are made public and from
    multiple sources. Schools are required to pay a registration fee and renewal fee in order to operate.

 1. Encouraging Innovation by Providers
    Schools have legal authority to appoint, deploy and dismiss teachers with the final review from central authorities. The
    central government has the legal authority over how the curriculum is delivered. The school (school principal, school
    council, parent association etc.) has the legal authority to manage school operating budgets without review by central
    authorities. The Education Board has the legal authority over how resources are allocated to classrooms with final review
    from central authorities.

 2. Holding Schools Accountable
    The government sets standards for what students need to learn and also indicates by when or how well they need to be
    learned. Standardized exams are administered annually. The government requires schools to undergo a standard term
    inspection. Inspections reports outline priorities for improvement. Sanctions are not administered based on the results of
    school inspections or performance on standardized exams. The government requires schools to report on the use of public
    funds as a condition for the continuation of funding during a standard term.

 3. Empowering All Parents, Students, and Communities
     Ad hoc information is provided to parents on standardized exam results or inspection reports / available on demand.
    Neither students nor parents are surveyed as part of an inspection process. Schools are allowed to select students based
    on both academic performance and geography. Parental choice is restricted by voluntary non-monetary parent
    contributions i.e. in kind labor or goods.

 4. Promoting Diversity of Supply
    The government allows all types of providers to operate. Aided schools must pay a fee to apply for aided status. All
    budgets academic and additional budgets (facilities and transport) are equivalent to per student amounts in public schools.

The four policy goals enable a government to increase
innovation and strengthen accountability among the
critical actors in an education system (figure 2).
Empowering parents, students, and communities
enhances the ability of parents to express their voice and
hold policymakers accountable for results. Additionally,
when parents are empowered, in most contexts they can
have greater influence over provider behaviors.
Increasing school accountability strengthens the quality-
and equity-assurance mechanisms between the state
and education providers. Encouraging innovation and
promoting diversity of supply can allow providers to
respond to local needs. Increasing school-level
autonomy in critical decisions improves the services
provided to students. Allowing a diverse set of providers
to enter the market can increase client power and enable
citizens to choose from a wider range of models. By

for the education services provided in their countries.
The tool allows governments to systematically evaluate
their policies and implement practices that are effective
across multiple country contexts.
Four types of private provision of education
Across the world, governments can implement
numerous strategies to improve educational outcomes
by supporting non-state education provision. SABER-EPS
benchmarks key policy goals across the four most
common models of private service delivery:
    1. Independent private schools: schools that are
       owned and operated by non-government
       providers and are financed privately, typically
       through fees.
    2. Government-funded private schools: schools
       that are owned and operated by non-
       government providers, but receive government
       funding.
    3. Privately managed schools: schools that are
       owned and financed by the government, but
       are operated by non-government providers.
    4. Voucher schools: schools that students choose
       to attend with government-provided funding;
       these schools can be operated by the
       government or non-government providers or
       both, depending on the system.
SABER-EPS analyzes laws and regulations to: (1) identify
the types of private engagement that are legally
established in each country and (2) assess each
education system’s progress in achieving the four policy
goals. The aim of the SABER-EPS Framework is to
provide policy guidance to help governments establish
strong incentives and relationships of accountability
among citizens, governments, and private education
providers, with the goal of improving education results.

There is still much to be known about the performance
of the non-state education sector in Zambia. To date,
empirical research on the learning outcomes of non-
government schools is not extensive. Private school
students outperform their public counterparts in both
reading and mathematics on the SACMEQ assessment
(table 4). These results show only raw differences in
student scores without accounting for student
background differences; however, it is worth noting,
these students are statistically equal in terms of family
socioeconomic status (as measured by a SACMEQ
composite score of parent education level and home
possessions).

According to the SABER-EPS Framework, Zambia’s
private and faith-based institutions are considered
independent private schools while grant-aided and
community schools are considered government-funded
private schools. As such, community and grant-aided
schools will be integrated into the section on
government-funded private schools and discussed in
tandem.

      The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative
      produces comparative data and knowledge on education policies and
      institutions, with the aim of helping countries systematically strengthen
      their education systems. SABER evaluates the quality of education
      policies against evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic
      tools and detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all parties
      with a stake in educational results—from administrators, teachers, and
      parents to policymakers and business people—an accessible, objective
      snapshot showing how well the policies of their country's education
      system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth learn.


      This report focuses specifically on policies of Engaging the Private Sector
      in Education.
