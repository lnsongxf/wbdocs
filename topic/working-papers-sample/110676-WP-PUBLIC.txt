OVERVIEW
The global economic environment remains fragile. Global growth in 2016 looks set to be softer than anticipated,
reflecting in large part weaker momentum in major advanced economies and commodity-exporting emerging
markets. Driven by sluggish import demand in advanced economies, global trade remains weak with trade
volumes contracting in the first quarter and stagnating in the second quarter of 2016. Amidst lackluster global
growth prospects, developing East Asia Pacific continues to perform relatively well with weak external demand
being largely offset by robust domestic demand, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies
across most countries in the region.

Faced with global headwinds, Vietnam’s economy is showing resilience, supported by robust domestic
demand and export-oriented manufacturing. Growth decelerated to 5.9 percent during the first three quarters of
the year, mainly due to the impact of a severe drought on agricultural output, cuts in oil production, and slowing
external demand. But the underlying fundamental drivers of growth -resilient domestic demand and export
oriented manufacturing- remain broadly intact. However, Vietnam’s economic performance owes in part to rapid
credit growth and an accommodative fiscal stance, which may support growth in the short term but may amplify
existing medium-term financial and fiscal risks.

Resilient growth was accompanied by low inflation and a strengthening external position. After falling to
record lows in 2015, inflation has picked up mainly due administrative price hikes for health and education
services but core inflation remains subdued and headline inflation is expected to stay below the official target
of 5 percent. Externally, the current account surplus widened mainly as a result of slowing import growth. FDI
inflows remain robust and Vietnam’s limited exposure to portfolio investment contained the impact of recent
global financial volatility. Bolstered by the strengthening external position, the exchange rate has been relatively
stable through the year though Vietnam dong started to depreciate recently due to sharp rise of the US dollar. The
SBV gradually rebuild foreign reserves, albeit they still remain at a relatively low 2.6 months of imports. However,
in the context of a strengthening US dollar and sharper depreciation of currencies of major Vietnam trading
partners, concerns of real exchange rate appreciation of the dong and its possible negative impacts on Vietnam’s
export competitiveness remain.

However, monetary conditions have eased considerably and credit growth remains elevated, potentially
exacerbating existing macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities. As a result of largely unsterilized foreign
reserve accumulation, money supply expanded rapidly throughout the year, growing at about twice the rate of
nominal GDP  . Ample liquidity together with some easing of macro-prudential requirements fueled credit growth
which accelerated to 19 percent (year-on-year) in October 2016. While inflationary pressures remain subdued,
there are concerns that sustained rapid monetary expansion and credit growth may -as in the past- exert pressure
on asset prices and ignite inflationary effects down the line. In addition, existing risks to medium-term financial
stability may intensify, particularly since Vietnam’s credit to GDP ratio - 112% at present- is already high for
country of its income level and the overhang of past non-performing loans has not been fully resolved.

The fiscal deficit also remains sizable, but the government has reinforced its commitment to achieve fiscal
consolidation over the medium term. The fiscal deficit averaged 5.5 percent of GDP over the past five years and
is expected to remain at about 6 percent of GDP this year. While the risk of acute debt distress is still relatively

low, public debt has risen fast and is approaching the statutory limit of 65 percent of GDP. To address concerns
about medium term fiscal sustainability, the Medium Term Financing Plan 2016-20, adopted by the National
Assembly on November 9th 2016 aims to gradually reduce the fiscal deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP by 2020. It
is now crucial to underpin these targets with specific policy measures to achieve a quality adjustment through a
balanced combination of revenue and expenditure measures and a strong focus on spending efficiency gains, as
opposed to across-the-board curtailment of discretionary spending and investment.

Building on steady progress, deepening and accelerating structural reforms remains crucial to support
a more productivity-led growth model. There are signs that the current economic growth model is facing
growing structural constraints. Economic growth has become overly reliant on factor accumulation (capital,
natural resources and low skilled labor) and macroeconomic stimulus (loose fiscal and credit policies) while the
contribution of productivity increases (total factor productivity) has declined. Recognizing this critical challenge,
the economic restructuring plan 2016-20, adopted by the National Assembly in November, also reconfirms key
structural reform priorities of the government for the coming five years, including further reforms to enhance
banking system stability and build deeper capital markets, improve efficiency of the SOE sector, strengthen public
investment and enable a more productive and dynamic private sector. These plans are important steps in the
direction of structural reforms and – if implemented consistently – would help address some of the emerging
structural constraints in the economy.

Vietnam’s medium term outlook remains favorable. GDP is expected to expand by around 6 percent in 2016
underpinned by robust domestic demand and export oriented manufacturing. GDP is projected to accelerate
slightly to 6.3 in 2017 predicated on a recovery in agriculture and improving global prospects. Inflation is expected
to come in just below the official target of 5 percent this year and then moderate next year as administrative price
hike -which were the main driver of inflation this year- moderate. The external accounts are expected to remain
favorable thanks to an improved trade balance, but the current account surplus is expected to decline next year,
as import growth recovers. The fiscal deficit is projected to remain high at about 6 percent of GDP this year but
expected to adjust over the medium term in line with Government commitments.

The outlook is subject to pronounced downside risks. Domestically, delayed implementation of structural and
fiscal reforms could intensify macroeconomic vulnerabilities and lower potential growth. Externally, a further
slowdown in the global economy and waning prospects of TPP could dim Vietnam’s growth outlook through trade
and investment channels. Meanwhile, fragile global financial market conditions and the prospect of rising interest

rates due to anticipated monetary tightening in the US are of some concern, as Vietnam is planning to tap global
markets to meet some of its fiscal financing needs.



Special focus: TRANSFORMING VIETNAMESE AGRICULTURE - GAINING MORE FROM LESS

Over recent decades, Vietnam’s agricultural sector has made enormous progress, realizing major gains
in productivity and output and contributing to national goals related to food security, poverty reduction,
social stability, and trade. Nevertheless, there are growing concerns related to the quality and sustainability
of Vietnam’s agricultural growth and related patterns of development. A comparatively low quality of growth is
manifested by low smallholder farmer profitability, considerable under-employment among agricultural workers,
mixed or uncertain product quality and food safety, low value addition, and limited technological or institutional
innovation. Some agricultural growth has come at the expense of the environment in the forms of deforestation,
biodiversity loss, land degradation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. In most locations, agricultural
growth has involved an increase in cropping areas or intensities and ever higher uses of inputs and natural
resources. Hence, more output has come from more and more inputs and increasing environmental costs.

Vietnamese agriculture now sits at a turning point. The sector now faces growing domestic competition—from
cities, industry, and services—for labor, land and water. Rising labor costs are beginning to inhibit the sector’s
ability to compete internationally as a low cost producer of bulk undifferentiated commodities. The country’s rural
youth have rising aspirations for living standards. Vietnam’s expanding consumer class and trade partners are
expecting higher standards, both for products and production practices. Going forward, Vietnam’s agriculture
will need to generate ‘more from less’. That is, it will need to generate more economic value—and farmer and
consumer welfare—using less natural and human resources and without degrading the environment. It will need
to rebrand itself and increasingly compete on the bases of innovation, reliable supply, predictable quality, and
assured food safety and environmental protection.

The Vietnamese government has played a major and, in some areas, a leading role in the past development
of agriculture. Some of its past functions—including those of land use planner, production target setter, manager
of farms, commodity trader and dominant technology supplier---will be less important or even detrimental in
the process of shifting toward a more flexible, market-driven, and knowledge-based agriculture. Government
can undertake less direct investment in agriculture if it is effective at facilitating private investment and private
provision of technical services. That should free up resources to achieve excellence in the application of important
regulatory functions (e.g. environmental, biosecurity, and food safety risk management). Government will need
to play a continuing role in facilitating a more active agricultural land market, in supporting rural infrastructure
and other elements which impact the transaction costs of farmers and agro-enterprises and in revitalizing the
country’s agricultural innovation system. In sum, the government will need to ‘lead less yet facilitate more’ in the
step-wise transformation of Vietnam’s agriculture and agro-food system.

    A. External Economic Environment
    The global economic environment remains fragile. Global growth in 2016 looks set to be softer than anticipated,
    reflecting in large part further weakening momentum in major advanced economies (figure 1). In particular,
    growth prospects in the Euro Area, the United Kingdom, and the United States, have deteriorated since June. In
    addition, commodity-exporting emerging market and developing economies continue to struggle to adjust to low
    commodity prices. Driven by weak import demand in advanced economies, global trade remains sluggish with
    trade volumes contracting in the first quarter and stagnating in the second quarter of 2016.

Global headwinds notwithstanding, growth in developing EAP remains resilient. Developing EAP continues to
perform well relative to other developing regions (table 1). Weak external demand was largely offset by robust
domestic demand, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies across most countries in the
region. However, policy space is increasingly limited as budget deficits have increased across much of the region,
largely reflecting rising public expenditure, which is being used partly to scale up investment but also to meet
growing current expenses. Thanks in part to low commodity prices, inflation remains muted across most of the
region. Financial market turbulence and capital outflows from emerging markets triggered by political uncertainty
and anticipated policy shifts in the US have spilled over to the region, in particular to countries with deeper
financial integration.

12 TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnam’s Recent Economic Developments
The external environment remains challenging for Vietnam’s economy. The global recovery is expected to
continue at a slow pace with pronounced downside risks. Vietnam’s economy remains susceptible to a further
slowdown in the global economy, since fiscal and monetary policy buffers are increasingly limited leaving little
room for additional accommodation to counteract further negative shocks. Short-term risks include a sharper-
than-expected slowdown in China as well as political uncertainties and prospective monetary policy tightening
by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Financial market conditions remain fragile and subject to sudden bouts of volatility.
While Vietnam’s more limited exposure to volatile capital flows have contained immediate spillovers of global
volatility (compared to more financially integrated markets), rising interest rates and tightening global liquidity
are of some concern as Vietnam is planning to increasingly tap international capital markets to meet its fiscal
financing needs over the medium term. In addition, protectionist rhetoric and in particular the waning prospects of
TPP may affect Vietnam’s future prospects, given its strong trade-exposure to the US market and the expectation
that it would become a major TPP beneficiary.


B. Recent Economic Developments in Vietnam
Stable macroeconomic conditions amidst moderating growth

Although growth has moderated somewhat during 2016, Vietnam’s macroeconomic environment remains
favorable. Growth decelerated slightly to 5.9 percent during the first three quarters of the year, mainly due to
the impact of the drought on agricultural output, cuts in oil production, and slowing external demand. But the
underlying fundamental drivers of growth -resilient domestic demand and export oriented manufacturing- remain
intact. After falling to record lows in 2015, inflation has picked up slightly -mainly due administrative price hikes
for health and education services- but headline inflation remains below the official target of 5 percent (figure 2).
Externally, the current account surplus widened mainly as a result of slowing import growth. Meanwhile, FDI
inflows remain robust and Vietnam’s limited exposure to portfolio investment contained the impact of recent
global financial volatility. Bolstered by the strengthening external position, the exchange rate has been relatively
stable through the year though Vietnam dong started to depreciate recently due to sharp rise of the US dollar. The
SBV gradually rebuild foreign reserves, albeit they still remain at a relatively low 2.6 months of imports. On the
downside, some of Vietnam’s economic performance owes to rapid credit growth and an accommodative fiscal
stance, which may support growth in the short term but -if continued for too long- may amplify existing financial
and fiscal risks.

Despite a challenging global environment, Vietnam’s economy is showing resilience, supported by robust
domestic demand and export oriented manufacturing. Preliminary data shows that Vietnam’s GDP growth for
the first three quarters of 2016 came in at 5.9 percent (y/y). On the production side, agriculture and the mining
sector slowed down significantly, but this was offset by sustained, albeit moderating growth in manufacturing,
construction and service sectors (figure 3). On the demand side, domestic demand has remained robust,
supported by accommodative monetary, credit and fiscal policies. Investment growth has picked up fueled by
sustained public investment, FDI inflows and strong credit growth. Meanwhile, private and public consumption
also remain buoyant, underpinned by wage hikes in the public sector, rising real incomes and resilient consumer
confidence.

A severe drought affected agricultural output. A severe drought and salinity intrusion in the Mekong delta and
South Central Coastal regions led to a contraction of agricultural output of 1.2 percent during the first quarter.
Growth returned to positive territory in the second quarter (0.4 percent) and then further strengthened to 2.1

percent in the third quarter. However, despite the gradual recovery the agricultural sector expanded by only
0.7 percent in the first nine months of 2016, compared 2.1 percent during the same period last year. Aside of
these short term fluctuations, the agricultural sector faces significant opportunities to contribute more strongly
to growth, but also substantial challenges in terms modernizing production, raising productivity and linking more
effectively with agribusiness value chains. Vietnam’s agriculture will need to generate ‘more from less’. That is, it
will need to generate more economic value—and farmer and consumer welfare—using less natural and human
resources and without degrading the environment. These structural opportunities and challenges are examined in
more detail in the special topic note of this report.

Industrial output remains a key growth driver, but it decelerated slightly due to sharp contraction of oil output
and subdued external demand. Overall, the value added of industrial and construction sectors grew by 7.5
percent (y/y) during the first nine months of this year. While this was below the growth rate of 9.9 percent in same
period last year, industrial still contributed about half of the overall GDP growth this year. Mining output contracted
sharply by 7.1 percent in the first three quarters of the year, mainly reflecting cuts in oil production due to the still
subdued global oil price. However, this was offset by sustained performance of export-oriented manufacturing,
mainly in the FDI sector and construction activity which benefited from availability of ample credit and a recovery
in the real estate sector.

On the demand side, domestic demand remains resilient, underpinned by buoyant investment and
consumption growth. Final consumption and capital formation are expected to contribute 4.3 and 1.7 percentage
points respectively to the overall GDP growth of 2016 (figure 4). In the first nine months of 2016, investment
growth picked up 9.6 percent (y/y) in nominal term bring gross capital formation to about 33% GDP          . Capital
disbursement for FDI sector Vietnam rose 12.4% (y/y) and accounted for nearly a quarter of total investment
outlays of Vietnam. In addition, public investment remains strong, contributing about 38 percent to gross capital
formation while private domestic investment was supported by availability of ample banking sector credit. Fueled
by rising real incomes and still subdued inflation, retail sale rose steadily by 9.5%, indicating robust underlying
consumption growth.

Inflation picked up slightly, driven by hikes in administered prices

Headline inflation accelerated in recent months reflecting a series of increases in the administered prices, mainly
for education and health services. Headline inflation (y/y) was at 4.1 percent in October 2016, accelerating from
0.6 percent in December 2015 (figure 5). Hikes in administered prices contributed about 67 percent of total
inflation. In effort to move closer to cost recovery, prices of healthcare and education services were adjusted

sharply by 46.8 percent and 10.9 percent (y/y) respectively in October 2016 following adjustments in fees for
healthcare services, prices of medicine and tuition fees. In addition, the drought and associated supply shock to
agricultural output exerted pressure on food prices, especially in the early part of the year which climbed from 1
percent in December 2015 to 2.6 percent (y/y) in October 2016.

Monetary conditions have eased considerably throughout the year mostly as a result of unsterilized foreign
reserve accumulation. Strong forex inflows stemming from a strengthening external BOP position have allowed
the SBV to rebuild foreign reserves, but reserve accumulation was not fully sterilized. Reflecting ample liquidity
short-term interbank interest rates decreased to below one percent, diverging significantly from the official policy
rate. While inflationary pressures remain subdued, there are concerns that sustained monetary expansion may -as
in the past- exert pressure on asset prices and ignite inflationary effects down the line.

Credit growth remains elevated, raising concerns that it may amplify risks to medium term financial stability.
In pursuit of the official credit growth target the State Bank resorted to macro-prudential easing, including
adjustment in risk weights and the long term lending to short term deposit ratio which together with ample liquidity
helped achieve the credit growth target of 19 percent (year-on-year) in October 2016. This rapid expansion of
credit –more than twice the growth rate of nominal GDP (figure 7)- may amplify existing risks to financial stability,
particularly since the credit to GDP ratio - 112% at present- is already high for country of Vietnam’s income level
(figure 8). These concerns are reinforced by the fact that the overhang of past non-performing loans have not
been fully resolved and remain a drag on bank’s balance sheet. It is also noteworthy that the credit intensity of
growth seems to be rising with high credit growth delivering increasingly small incremental output gains.

Persistent fiscal pressures require decisive action

Sizable fiscal deficits have emerged in recent years. The fiscal deficit averaged 5.5 percent of GDP over the
past five years, leading to a rapid increase in public debt. While the risk of acute debt distress is still relatively
low, public debt has risen fast and is approaching the statutory limit of 65 percent of GDP. The Ministry of Finance
reported that, by the end of 2015, Vietnam’s total outstanding public debt (government, publicly-guaranteed and
local government) was estimated at 62.2 percent of GDP   , about 12 percentage points higher than the level in 2011
and inching quickly toward the legally-mandated ceiling of 65 percent of GDP (figure 9). Moreover, medium term
fiscal financing needs –including for the redemption of short term domestic debt (figure 10)—are substantial
and interest expenditure is on the rise. At the same time, access to concessional external financing will naturally
continue to tighten as Vietnam solidifies its middle income status and becomes more reliant on international and
external capital markets as a source of governance financing.

18 TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnam’s Recent Economic Developments
Fiscal outturns in the first months of 2016 continued to show persistent budget pressures. Revenue collection in the
first 9 months of 2016 is estimated to have increased by 5.2 percent (year-on-year), nominally, achieving 71 percent of
the budget plan. Revenue performance was mainly driven by higher collection of non-tax revenue. In contract, collections
from major taxes underperformed, compared to the budget target. The collection of VAT declined 5.5 percent, trade tax
collections was flat and CIT (excluding oil sector) rose 5.7 percent. Prolonged weakness in the oil price and the reduction
in production volumes added pressure on oil related revenue which came in at about half of the annual target. Weak
collection on tax was partially offset by rising non-tax revenues which increased 24 percent and accounted for nearly 30
percent of total revenues. Since these sources of revenue do not present recurrent revenue sources, there are concerns
about whether the recent increases are sustainable (figure 11).

Public expenditure continued to stay on an expansionary trend mainly on the back of rising investment. Total public
expenditure increased by 6.2 percent in nominal terms in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period
last year, reaching 67 percent of 2016 budget plan (figure 12). While recurrent expenditure rose by 5.5 percent, capital
spending increased 9.1 percent on account of large public investment projects. Debt service payments (including interest
payment and amortization) also continued to rise in 2016 and now account for 16.2 percent of total revenue.

The government has reinforced its commitment to rein in the fiscal deficit over the medium term in order to
contain further increases in the public debt to GDP ratio. The medium term financing plan 2016-20, adopted by
the National Assembly on November 9th 2016 envisages a gradual fiscal adjustment over the coming four years.
The plan aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP by 2020. It is now critical to underpin these targets
with specific policy measures to achieve the envisaged adjustment. The quality of the adjustment, including a
balanced combination of revenue and expenditure measures and a strong focus on spending efficiency gains,
as opposed to across-the-board curtailment of discretionary spending and investment is therefore important.
Equally, the need for budget discipline will have to be balance with the need to ensure fiscal space for critical
investments in infrastructure and spending on essential public services.

The government is paying more attention on spending consolidation. In June 2016, the Prime Minister issued
Directive No. 22/CT-TTg aimed to enhance the implementation of the State budget and finance tasks in 2016.
Accordingly, strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of public investment is among the most important
tasks for the consolidation of capital spending. At the same time, decisive measures are needed to stabilize and
rationalize recurrent expenditures. Overall spending in the 2016 State budget is planned to increase about 3.5
percent in nominal terms over the 2015 estimated outturns, compared to an average of 14 percent in 2011-15. On
the capital budget side, attention has been focused on completing ongoing projects; new projects are approved
only in exceptional cases. For capital investments there are now stricter provisions on spending of revenue
collected over what was planned in the original budget.

The government is also focusing on strengthening revenue mobilization. It will require continued efforts to
enhance further policy improvements and revenue administration. On the tax policy front, it will be important
to continue to reform tax policies towards strengthening domestic revenue mobilization. Several specific policy
options for further consideration that could help bolster revenue performance include: (i) Broadening VAT base;
(ii) Broadening CIT base and rationalizing tax expenditures; (iii) Increasing excise rates; (iv) Building a modern
property tax system; and (v) Rationalizing the policies on natural resources-related revenues. In parallel with
tax policy changes, tax administration reform remains a priority. The next phase of tax administration reform
will include a more systemic review and implementation of business process re-engineering, a move towards
transparent information-based taxation operations, and the application of risk-based audit for better compliance
management. If implemented properly, these measures will help not only to strengthen the tax administration’s
efficiency and effectiveness in maximizing revenue mobilization, but also help to reduce the compliance cost for

   Vietnam’s revenue performance remains strong, but has been falling in recent years. The share of total revenue and
   of taxes in GDP went down from 26 percent and 23 percent in the period of 2006-10 to 23 percent and 20.4 percent,
   respectively, in the period of 2011-15. Three factors contributed to the structural decline: (1) a decrease in the oil
   revenue; (2) sharp reduction of trade taxes due to deepening global integration; and (3) lower land revenue collection.
   However, at the same time the revenue structure has seen positive change with collection relying on more sustainable
   revenue sources. Domestic revenue in total revenue increased substantially from just 52 percent in 2001-05 to over 68
   percent in 2011-15.

   The government overall tax reform strategy is to revert the declining trend in revenue collection and to stabilize it at
   around 22-23 percent of GDP . A reform implementation plan for 2016-2020 is being drafted and expected to be adopted
   by MOF by end of 2016. A good tax reform plan will help to address the challenges of the fiscal balance, the falling trade
   revenue and growing base erosion resulted from global integration and to improve the investment climate.

   Immediate administration reforms are being taken with the objectives to enhance collections and improve the
   investment climate. Vietnam has embarked in a series of indicator-based reforms to lower the tax compliance costs
   through three Government Resolutions No.19 which has helped Vietnam to move up 11 places in the Paying Taxes
   indicator of the Doing Business Report 2017. Vietnam is in the initial process to establish the legal framework and to
   develop institutional structure and capacity to join the BEPS agenda and implement BEPS actions. A government decree
   is being drafted to address the transfer pricing challenges such as asymmetry of information, or excessive interest
   deductibility. At the same time the Large Tax Office is being upgraded with more functions to enhance the effectiveness
   of tax administration of this critical group of taxpayers. Risk-based management is being adopted for key functions such
   as audit and refund. In medium term, MOF has indicated continued reforms in these areas, as well as on reengineering
   of current business processes based on an enhanced IT system.

   Tax policy reforms are expected to be implemented over the medium term. Major policy reforms have completed such
   as the reduction of the standard CIT rate to 20 percent as of January 1, 2016, or the introduction of the VAT threshold in
   2013. Over the medium term, the government may consider unifying the VAT rate structure or to remove the exemptions
   to broaden the base. On CIT, incentives that have eroded the CIT base may be rationalized but this will have to proceed
   cautiously to ensure this does not harm investment attraction. Other options in line with the objective to strengthen the
   domestic resources mobilization would include the introduction of the Property Tax, as well as improving the current tax
   laws on Natural Resources, Environment and Excise.




Strengthening external position despite lackluster global demand

Vietnam’s external position strengthened underpinned by a widening current account surplus and robust FDI
inflows. Vietnam merchandise trade balance recorded a widening surplus in 2016, with a slowdown in import
growth more than offsetting decelerating exports. While repatriation of profits and dividends continue to expand
owing to Vietnam’s sizable FDI sector, this is partly offset by robust remittances inflows and overall the current
account surplus widened during the first months of the year. The capital account surplus also remains sizeable
due to sustained FDI inflows and Vietnam’s continuing access to concessional financing. The improved balance

of payments situation allowed the SBV to shore up foreign reserves to about 2.6 months of import cover by the
end of Q2-2016. Meanwhile the nominal exchange rate remained stable, leading appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate (REER) by about 5.4 percent since the beginning of 2015. This contrasts with most of currencies
in the region which depreciated by the rage from 3 percent to 13 percent in real terms over the same period and
may over time affect Vietnam’s export competitiveness (figure 13).

Export growth moderated somewhat during the first ten months of 2016. Vietnam’s total exports are estimated
to have expanded by 7 percent in the first ten months of 2016, mainly reflecting low commodity prices and weak
external demand (table 2). Low oil prices compressed oil exports which declined by 41 percent in value and 25
percent in volume terms. Rice exports also were down by 17 percent in value and 22 percent in volume terms.
However, the slowdown of rice exports was offset by strong exports of vegetable and fruits, coffee, black pepper,
cashew nut, rubber, as well as seafood. Exports of vegetable and fruit increased by 31 percent (year-on-year) to
US$ 2 billion in the first ten months of 2016, bypassing export earnings of rice (1.88 billion), as well as crude
oil (US$ 1.92 billion). At the same time, weakening external demand has dampened export growth. Most labor-
intensive manufacturing exports such as garment, footwear, phones, and computer continue to record growth,
albeit at a lower level than last year. Despite the slowdown, Vietnam’s exports continue to outperform many peer
countries in the region (figure 14).

Import growth slowed markedly in the first ten months of 2016. In value terms imports expanded by about
2.2 percent during the first ten months of the year, compared to 13.4 percent over the period last year. This is
mostly related to declining imports of fuel, machinery and equipment as well as slowing demand for material
and intermediate good for export processing. After a strong surge in past three years, imports of machinery
and equipment by foreign invested firms declined by 15 percent in the first ten months of 2016, indicating a
maturing investment cycle. However, imports of machinery and equipment by domestic firms increased by 20
percent, reflecting the completion phase of many major public and domestic investment projects. Imports of
raw materials and intermediate goods (steel, chemical, wooden materials, fertilizer, animal feed, cotton, fabrics,
phone parts and electronics accessories) have also substantially slowing down, reflecting falling external demand
for Vietnam’s exports and growing inventory. Imports of automobiles fell sharply partly because of a hike in taxes
and fees on private vehicles. The slowdown of growth rate of imports in general reflects the broader slowdown
of the economy (table 3).

Foreign direct investment (FDI) remains an important driver of Vietnam’s trade and more generally economic
performance. With some of the lowest labor costs in the world, strong openness to trade (Vietnam has signed
more trade agreements than any other country in the region) and an advantageous geographical location, Vietnam
has been major destination of FDI. By the end of October 2016, Vietnam had investments from more than 100
countries and territories, with total accumulated FDI commitments of around US$ 290 billion (equal to about 150
percent of GDP) in a broad and diversified range of investment activities. The foreign-invested sector contributes
about 18 percent of Vietnam’s GDP      , nearly a quarter of total investment, two thirds of total exports and has
created millions of direct and indirect jobs. Aside of capital investment, FDI is also bringing frontier technologies,
management capacity and market knowledge to Vietnam, contributing to industrial upgrading and productivity
growth (box 2).

However, linkages of FDI firms with domestic firms as suppliers remain relatively weak. On the other hand,
there are domestic firms which are largely inward oriented and serving the domestic market. The linkages between
these two segments are very limited. As such, the FDI sector operates in isolation rather than serving as a broader
catalyst for growth, with limited spillovers to the domestic private sector in the form of increased demand for
inputs, access to new technology and managerial techniques, demonstration effects and agglomeration benefits.
The expanding labor intensive manufacturing sector has not stimulated the development of supplier industries
such as cotton and synthetic cloth, dyes, chemicals, plastics and steel. As the experience of Japan, Korea,
Taiwan (China), Singapore, and now China shows, export value added can be enhanced through heightened
technological intensity in exported products and services. These examples also show that an export model that is
primarily based on low labor cost and labor intensive, low technology exports will ultimately diminish as wages
inevitably rise.

Most FDI in Vietnam has gone to labor intensive manufacturing, accounting for 58 percent of all FDI inflows in since
1988. As a result, Vietnam has emerged as global manufacturing and assembly hub, integrated in major supply chains.
Most investment is concentrated in light industries such in textile and garments, computers, mobile phones and other
electronics.

While there is a diversified investor base, regional investors are most active in Vietnam. Despite Vietnam is host
country for investors from around 100 countries and territories around the world, the majority of FDI in Vietnam came
from East Asia, in which Korea, Japan, China, Hong Kong (China), and Taiwan (China) accounted for a half of total
registered capital. ASEAN countries accounted for around 20 percent of the FDI inflows. FDI from the United States and
Europe only accounted for small amount of less than 10 percent of total capital.

Most FDI in Vietnam are greenfield investments that are fully owned and operated by foreign investors. Foreign
investors have overwhelmingly chosen to invest via 100 percent foreign-owned enterprises – currently accounting for
70 percent of all Vietnamese FDI projects with joint ventures and business cooperation contracts making the remainder.

Thanks to sustained inflows, the share of the FDI sector in output and total investment has increased steadily. By
the end of 2016, FDI sector consisted of about 18 percent of Vietnam’s GDP from about 10 percent in 2000. FDI also
accounts for nearly a quarter of Vietnam total investment - approximately 8 percent of GDP  . The FDI sector also created
3.9 million jobs – about 30 percent of total employment in enterprise sector or 7 percent of Vietnam’s labor force.

  FDI sector continued to be an engine for Vietnam’s trade performance. The FDI sector accounts for 70 percent of
  Vietnam’s total exports and its non-oil export value is growing by a staggering 25 percent on average over the last
  decade. Thanks to export-oriented manufacturing FDI sector, Vietnam’s export composition has shifted and become
  much more diversified- from agricultural and primary commodities to labor-intensive manufacturing and technology
  goods. Noteworthy FDI driven additions to the export basket include smart phones, computers and chips, cameras
  and electronics and more recently transportation vehicles. These higher valued export items have increased from less
  than 5 percent to around a third of Vietnam’s total exports now. At the same time, the FDI sector has boosted import
  activities, especially for capital goods, such as machinery and equipment for investment expansion as all as materials
  and intermediate goods for export processing and manufacturing. Strong export surplus of FDI have helped Vietnam to
  mitigate its persistent trade deficit which in turn, will contribute to stabilize Vietnam’s macroeconomic balances.

  FDI enterprises also account for about 14 percent of fiscal revenue. Contributions (tax and fees) of non-oil FDI
  enterprises to Vietnam’s total budget revenues have almost doubled from 7.4 percent in 2005 to 14.1 percent in 2015.
  However, at the same time the budget contribution of FDI firms as share of net turnover, declined from 7.7 percent in
  2005 to 4.8 percent in 2014. This is most likely reflecting tax incentives extended to foreign investors which may help
  attract more FDI but erode revenue performance and also lead to distortions of overall investment climate.

C. Building on Steady Progress, Further Acceleration and Deepening of
Structural Reforms Remains Critical
Vietnam has made steady progress in advancing structural reforms. Following adoption of landmark policies,
namely Government Resolution 11 (2011) and Prime Minister Decision 339 (2013), macroeconomic stability has
been gradually restored and overall economic growth has recovered. There is also progress on key structural
reforms – public investment, state-owned enterprises and financial sector.

  Restructuring of the financial sector has progressed, but challenges remain. Progress was made in the
•	
  consolidation of weak credit institutions through mergers and acquisitions, tightening of banking supervision,
  and creation of the Vietnam Asset Management Company (VAMC) which has absorbed a majority of non-
  performing loans. However, asset quality problems and associated risks to capital adequacy continue to be
  a drag on the banking sector, as resolution of bad debt has progressed slowly, hampered by the lack of an
  enabling legal framework.

  SOE reforms also progressed, but the focus needs to shift on deepening these reforms. A large number
•	
  of state-owned enterprises were equitized and the governance of state owned enterprises was gradually
  improved. However, many of the equitizations only involve divestment of minority shares, limiting private sector
  participation and leaving assets effectively under state control. Compliance with the improved requirements
  for corporate governance and transparency also remains incomplete.

•	On public investment, a new improved legal framework was put in place and is now being implemented.
   The Public Investment law of 2014 principally strengthened the institutional and procedural framework for the
   management of capital spending, including enhanced medium term investment planning and strengthened
   systems for project appraisal and selection. In line with the provisions of the law the first Medium Term
   Investment Plan (MTIP) which sets out the investment program for the coming five years has been prepared
   and deliberated by the National Assembly.

  Finally, Vietnam is also making progress in improving its business climate. Following adoption of Resolution
•	
  19/2014 and Resolution 19/2015 several aspects of the business environment have been improved. As a
  result, Vietnam moved up in the World Bank’s Doing Business from rank 91 (of 189 countries) in 2011 to rank

   82 (of 190 countries) in the most recently released Doing Business 2017 report. Nevertheless, Vietnam is still
   lagging compared to more advanced economies in the region, including Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.
   Building on recent progress, it is important for Vietnam to sustain these reforms to enable businesses to
   flourish and create more jobs in the country (Box 3).


                                Box 3: Vietnam Implements Reforms to Improve Business Environment

  The 2017 Doing Business survey ranked Vietnam 82nd out of 190 economies worldwide thanks to several reforms
  making it easier to do business in Vietnam: Paying Taxes, Protecting Minority Investors, Trading across Borders and
  Getting Electricity. Last year Vietnam was ranked 91st in the same survey.

  However, the modest ranking improvement still positions Vietnam behind many regional countries. Strong
  performers include Singapore, standing at 2nd, Malaysia (23rd), and Thailand (46th). While Vietnam outperformed
  ASEAN-4 (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand) in some business environment dimensions such as “Stating a
  Business”, ”Dealing with Construction Permits”, “Getting Credit”, it is still lagging behind in important topics like “Paying
  Taxes”; “Resolving Insolvency”, “Getting Electricity”…

 The focus on further improvement of the taxes environment is essential. Economies around the world have made
 paying taxes faster, easier and less costly for businesses. The below table highlights what tax reforms has Doing
 Business recorded in Vietnam since 2011. Despite these efforts of the authorities, Vietnam stands at 167 in the ranking
 of 190 economies globally on the ease of paying taxes.

Looking ahead, the Government has reinforced its commitment to continue to move forward with structural
reforms to support a more productivity-led growth model. There are signs that the current economic growth
model is facing growing structural constraints. The pace of economic growth is losing momentum and the
macroeconomic outlook implies rising uncertainty and downside risks. Economic growth has become overly
reliant on factor accumulation (capital, natural resources and low skilled labor) and stimulus (loose fiscal and
credit policies) while the contribution of productivity increases (total factor productivity) has declined. Labor
productivity growth has leveled around 4 percent (average over the past 5 years) and rates of return to capital
have diminished. The environmental footprint is growing, reflected for example, by rapidly rising carbon intensity
of Vietnam’s economy with greenhouse gas emissions outgrowing GDP growth. These trends reinforce the need
to focus on the quality of growth, enhancing labor productivity and competitiveness of the economy. Recognizing
this critical challenge, the Party’ Central Committee at its latest meeting (October 2016) highlighted that Vietnam
needs to continue its unfinished restructuring agenda by further reforming the growth model. The new growth
model will be based on enhancing productivity, strengthening quality and improving economic competitiveness.
The allocation of capital and human resources must follow market principles while economic growth must be
ensured with macroeconomic stability, social equity, and environmental protection. The economic restructuring
plan 2016-20, adopted by the National Assembly on November 2016, also reconfirms the key structural reform
priorities of the government for the coming five years (see box 4).

                                              for the Period 2016 - 2020

   Develop a robust private sector in the economy and attract foreign direct investment. The overall objectives are
   to develop an equal, fair and enabling business environment, reduce barriers to business doing, reduce institutional
   risks and costs to enterprises. Key tasks in this area include: (i) improve the business environment and facilitate the
   development of private enterprises at both central and sub-national levels; (ii) strengthen support for small and medium
   enterprises; (iii) support major private enterprises in their long term investment and establishment of strong brand
   names as well as domestic and international competitiveness; (iv) enhance the business performance of enterprises by
   the adoption of fair and strong market competition; (v) attract and relevantly manage foreign direct investment.

   Restructure the state owned sector including state owned enterprises, public investment, the state budget and the
   public service delivery. The overall target in this area is to reduce and rationalize state investment and commercial
   activities in those sectors of the economy, where the private sector can effectively operate (e.g. all sectors except natural
   monopolies). The State budget will be consolidated following prudent fiscal policies. The quality and performance of
   public service delivery will be enhanced by the adoption of the principles of autonomy, self-responsibility, and market
   based competition.

   Restructure financial markets, with emphasis on the restructuring of credit institutions and development of deeper
   capital markets. The overall objective is to complete the fundamental restructuring of credit institutions to reduce
   systemic risks, strengthen the depth and breadth in the performance of capital markets. Three important tasks are
   identified in this area including: (i) refine the legal frameworks on the monetary and banking system; (ii) accelerate
   the process of dealing with non-performing loans and adopt Basel II standards in credit institutions; (iii) expand and
   enhance the performance of the stock market, the bond market and the insurance market.

   Modernize master planning to enhance productivity, quality, and performance in combination with strengthening
   international economic integration. The overall objective is to accelerate the modernization of master planning and
   development planning, gradually establish an economic and regional structure relevant to the advantages of each
   sector and region, so as to enhance labor productivity and value addition in each sector, region and the whole economy.
   Prioritize

   the development of critical sectors of comparative advantages, and prioritize state resources to support the development
   of priority economic sectors and regions.

   Restructure important factor markets, including the land use right markets, in addition to human resource
   development, science and technology development. The overall task is to establish consistently the factors of the
   market economy as the basis for efficient resource allocation in line with the objectives of economic restructuring and
   growth model transformation.

D. Medium-Term Economic Outlook and Risks

Vietnam economy is expected to grow at around 6 percent in 2016. GDP continues to be underpinned by robust
domestic demand, in turn reflecting strong private consumption and investment growth. With an expected pick-up
in global activity, Vietnam’s growth prospects may improve to 6.3 percent in 2017-18. Inflation is expected to
slightly increase during the last quarter of the year on account of planned rise in administrative prices, adverse
impacts of unfavorable weather on food price, and the year-end seasonal factors, with inflation ending the year
at around 4.9 percent (end of period). The current account surplus is expected to widen largely thanks to an
improved trade balance. The fiscal balance continues to be under pressure with relatively minor adjustment this
year. The fiscal deficit is projected to remain high at about 6 percent of GDP this year which would bring the public
debt-to-GDP ratio to the statutory limit of 65 percent of GDP  . Over the medium term the fiscal account is expected
to adjust over the medium term in line with Government commitments to reduce the deficit.

This medium-term outlook is subject to several downside risks. Domestically, delayed implementation of
structural reforms, this may worsen medium term growth prospects as the current model -based on factor
accumulation and loose macroeconomic policies- will ultimately run into constraints. This may in turn intensify
demand for further loosening of monetary and fiscal policies, with the risk of stoking inflationary pressures
and reversing the recent gains in macroeconomic stability. On the external side, Vietnam’s economy remains
susceptible to a further slowdown in the global economy through trade and investment channels. Fragile financial

market conditions and rising interest rates are also of some concern as Vietnam is planning to increasingly tap
international capital markets to meet its fiscal financing needs over the medium term. Finally, protectionist rhetoric
and in particular the waning prospects of TPP may affect Vietnam’s future prospects, given its strong trade-
exposure to the US market and the expectation that it would become a major TPP beneficiary.

    TRANSFORMING
    VIETNAMESE AGRICULTURE:
    GAINING MORE FROM LESS1

    A. Vietnamese Agriculture at a Crossroads
    Over the past quarter century, Vietnam’s agricultural sector as made enormous progress and the country is
    regarded as a food security ‘success story’. Steady advances in smallholder rice productivity and intensification
    through the 1990s and beyond have played a central role in Vietnam’s successes in reducing poverty, eliminating
    chronic hunger and ensuring social stability. Vietnam once experienced hunger yet its per capita food availability
    now ranks among the top tier of middle-income countries. With a comparatively large proportion of its agricultural
    area serviced by irrigation, Vietnam has not experienced the wide fluctuations in food crop output experienced by
    other countries (Figure 2.1). Low unit costs of production and a large aggregate surplus supply have contributed
    to affordable consumer prices for the country’s leading food staple (Figure 2.2). Many countries are trying to learn
    from Vietnam’s food security success.

Vietnam’s performance in terms of agricultural yields, output, and exports, however, has been more
impressive than its gains in efficiency, farmer welfare, and product quality. Vietnam lags behind regional
peers in relation to agricultural land, labor, and water productivity and has, since the mid-2000s, experienced a
declining rate of growth in total factor productivity. A gap is widening between farm and non-farm incomes (Table
2.1), while income inequality is rising within rural areas. Most of Vietnam’s agricultural trade is in the form of raw
commodities, typically sold at prices lower than those of leading competitors due to quality or other differences
(Table 2.2). Its less expensive raw materials tend to be blended with those from elsewhere to obtain finished
products sold under international brands. Paradoxically, while Vietnamese cuisine is attracting more and more
attention in high income countries, most Vietnamese-supplied food products and ingredients remain out invisible

to consumers, in part due to perceptions about food safety and/or environmental risk. This is paralleled at home,
where there are growing concerns about the safety of domestically produced animal products, vegetable, tea, and
other foods or beverages.

Vietnam’s expanded agricultural output has come from more and more inputs, and has sometimes entailed
a high environmental cost. A large proportion of Vietnam’s agricultural growth has stemmed from expanded
or more intensive use of land and other natural resources, and relatively heavy use of fertilizer, other agro-
chemicals, and antibiotics. As a result, aspects of Vietnam’s agricultural success have come at the expense
of the environment. For example, the expansion of coffee and rubber production in the Central Highlands has
been an important contributor to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and groundwater depletion. The intensification
of rice production has contributed to land degradation, water pollution, and high greenhouse gas emissions.
The expansion of shrimp aquaculture in the Mekong Delta has resulted in large-scale destruction of mangroves
and has been a major source of water pollution. Figure 2.4 summarizes some of Vietnam’s agro-environmental
hotspots.

Vietnamese agriculture now sits at a turning point. The sector now faces growing domestic competition—from
cities, industry, and services—for labor, land and water. Rising labor costs are beginning to inhibit the sector’s
ability to compete globally as a low cost producer of bulk undifferentiated commodities. The pace of agricultural
growth has slowed—from 4.5% per annum between 1994 and 2000 to 3.3% from 2001 to 2007, down to 2.6%
between 2008 and 2013. The consequences of over-intensive input- and natural resource-use—both for the
environment and for farmer profitability—are increasingly coming into view. Some environmental problems are
now adversely impacting both productivity and the international position and reputation of Vietnam’s commodities.
Vietnam faces bright opportunities in both domestic and international agro-food markets, yet effectively competing
in these will increasingly depend upon the ability of farmers and firms to deliver (food and other) products with
reliability, and with assurances relating to quality, safety, and sustainability.

Going forward, Vietnam’s agricultural sector needs to generate “more from less.” That is, it must generate
more economic value—and farmer and consumer welfare—using less natural and human capital and less
harmful intermediate inputs. Future growth can rely primarily on increased efficiency, innovation, diversification,
and value- addition. This strategic shift was highlighted in the government’s Agricultural Restructuring Plan (ARP),
approved by the Prime Minister in June 2014. The ARP defines sector goals in terms of the triple bottom line of
economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable development. It lays out expected changes in the roles
and spending patterns of the government in the sector and discusses the need to work more closely with other
stakeholders, including in the private sector. There are currently many initiatives aiming in these directions. Yet,
achieving the shift these represent on a large, sector-wide scale will require reforms in certain economy-wide and
sector-specific policies and, over time, major changes and additions to the core institutions servicing agriculture.


B. Early Yet Accelerating Patterns of Structural Transformation Within
Agriculture

Consistent with the patterns of economic structural transformation observed elsewhere, the share of
(primary) agriculture in Vietnam’s national GDP and employment has been declining and is expected to
continue doing so. Between 2000 and 2015, agriculture’s share in total GDP declined from 22.7% to 17.0%, while
its share of employment fell more sharply from 65% to 47%. The GDP share of primary agriculture is expected to
decline over the coming two decades, perhaps by 0.5 percent per annum. By the early 2030s, primary agriculture
would then account for some 8 percent of Vietnam’s GDP     . However, agro-industry, together with food distribution
and logistical (and other) services could account for nearly double this share. This means that the overall agro-
food complex would still account for nearly one-fourth of total GDP   . Primary agriculture’s share of employment
will likely fall to 25%, yet if employment in agro-food related manufacturing and services is also considered,
then food and agriculture will still be providing a primary source of livelihood for at least one-third of Vietnam’s
population in the 2030s.

Vietnam is also experiencing a transformation in the national diet and in patterns of food expenditure. As
recently as 1996, rice accounted for more than 70% of calories consumed. Over the subsequent decade, per
capita rice consumption increased with income growth, yet this pattern began to reverse in the late 2000s. Both
per capita and national aggregate rice consumption are now declining and this trend is expected to continue for
another two decades before levelling off. Vietnam has been experiencing the region’s highest rates of growth in
the consumption of meat, milk and eggs. Significant growth has also occurred in the consumption of fish and of
a variety of processed foods. Dietary shifts are not confined to the wealthier segments of the population. Some of
the most significant shifts in diet and food spending patterns are occurring among Vietnam’s poor and near-poor.
For example, households in the lowest income quintile spent more than 48% of their food budget in 2002 on rice,




36 TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnam’s Recent Economic Developments
compared with only 18 and 9 percent on animal products and fish, respectively. By 2012, the tide had shifted to
protein. Rice accounted for one-third of their food spending, while animal products and seafood accounted for a
combined 39%.

Structural changes are also evident in the structure of Vietnam’s agricultural production. Agricultural census
data suggest that only modest changes are occurring in Vietnam’s agrarian structure. In 2011, ‘agricultural
households’ numbered 8.9 million, down from 10.1 million a decade earlier. In 2001, 67% of these farms were
less than 0.5 ha; in 2011 the share of such small farms was 69%. The share of such households with more
than 2 ha rose only from 5 to 6% during this period. This national picture masks some significant regional
contrasts. Land consolidation—and farm mechanization—have been more evident in the Mekong Delta and the
Southeast than elsewhere. Just as importantly, it masks over some significant changes which are occurring in
the structure of production, especially commercial production. For example, nation-wide the number of rice-
growing households exceeds 9 million. However, since 2000, the Mekong Delta accounted for 2/3 of the growth
of national production, with most of this growth occurring in about 20 districts. Expanded production from about
300,000 farm households (whose average landholding was 2.74 ha) accounted for most of Vietnam’s expanded
rice exports since the early to mid-2000s. Likewise, most of the expansion of livestock production has occurred
on medium-size farms, with the more recent growth in dairy production featuring several large-scale integrated
operations. Perennial crop production (other than for rubber) remains predominantly with small and medium scale
farms, yet here too we’ve seen some tendency toward consolidation.

Changes in agricultural land use have begun and are likely to accelerate in the coming decade. Despite shifting
consumer demand, food crop diversification is still at an early stage in Vietnam (See a comparison between China
and Vietnam in Figure 2.5). Rice still predominates in large part due to it being the dominant area of focus of public
investments in irrigation, agricultural research and extension, but also because of long-standing restrictions on
the use of designated ‘rice land’ for alternative crops and, especially, non-agricultural uses. While the area under
paddy has changed little since 2000, due to the intensification toward double and triple cropping, the harvested
area increased by 1.7% per annum between 2000 and 2010. Until quite recently, there was little change in the
areas planted to other annual food crops. Where there has been more change has been the very large expansion
(during the 1990s and through to the mid-2000s) in the area under aquaculture and an outward expansion of
coffee and other tree crop plantings in the upland regions. Looking ahead, we expect to see very significant further
changes in agricultural land-use. For example, one can anticipate that market, environmental, and other factors will
contribute to upward of one-third of the current paddy-land being shifted by 2030 to alternative agricultural land-
uses or ecosystem services. Paddy-land affected by saline intrusion will be converted to aquaculture. Much of
the paddy-land in peri-urban areas will be used for vegetable or ornamental plant production. Paddy-land near the
coast and near ecologically sensitive sites will take on greater multi-functional roles, seeking to maintain or revive
biodiversity and support eco-tourism. Where drainage services are improved, some paddy- land will be converted
to maize production. Rice-based production systems will also change, incorporating more rotation crops to
improve soils and manage pests, and moving toward greater specialization—including in fragrant varieties and
organic or other eco-safe production systems. Despite the decline in the rice-growing area, Vietnam will continue
to experience production levels providing a significant exportable surplus with a larger share consisting of high
quality and specialty variety products which will provide higher profits for farmers and enterprises.

Less change has been observed in the vertical structure of Vietnam’s agricultural value chains. Many value
chains remain fragmented and the level of commercially oriented collective action remains very low. There has
been a long-standing government policy of supporting farmer cooperatives, but the number of cooperatives
has fallen significantly over time and the vast majority of the surviving ones are involved mostly in coordinating
water-use and channeling advisory services to members. Of the nearly 9,200 service cooperatives still active in
2012, 84 percent were in regions of the country which account for little of Vietnam’s agricultural exports. Less
than 1 percent of Vietnam’s smallholder coffee farmers are members of commercially oriented cooperatives;
the proportion in core sourcing areas for rice exports is similarly very low. In the Mekong Delta there are many
thousands of informal collaborative groups, but these have not been permitted to perform business functions.
For commercially-oriented cooperatives there are issues of cooperative management and governance, and (local)
government interference in decision-making. The paucity of well-functioning cooperatives raises the transaction
costs in most commercial supply chains as it is more challenging for downstream firms or intermediaries to
communicate with farmers, influence and monitor their practices, and aggregate their production. Contract
farming is also much less well developed in Vietnam than in other countries where smallholders play a prominent
role in commercial value chains. Most value chains therefore feature large numbers of intermediaries and, in the
case of rice, several steps of intermediaries (i.e., local assemblers, first stage millers, sometimes another set of
traders or brokers who then supply the larger miller- exporters). Technologies, capabilities, financial strength,
and business ethics vary across these intermediaries. And it becomes difficult to track one’s supplies. With this,
it is difficult to make forward commitments to buyers and assure them that the product’s origins are safe and
sustainable.

The geography of Vietnamese agriculture is changing. The growth and patterns of specialization of agriculture
across Vietnam’s different regions has exhibited great diversity (Table 2.3). Several regions, including the Red
River Delta and the two Central Coast regions, have seen their rates of growth lag over most of the period since
2000. The Red River Delta, for instance, has seen an absolute decline in agricultural gross value-added in four of
the past five years. Urbanization and industrialization are the main drivers of economic development there. The
Central Highlands region has witnessed the most robust rates of agricultural growth on the basis of tree crop

expansion and diversification and vibrant clusters for vegetable and flower production. The Southeast has also
seen higher- than-average growth through a combination of tree crop and livestock production expansion. The
Mekong Delta region, which accounts for about one- third of agricultural gross value-added (AGVA), saw growth
taper off between 2009 and 2013 due to some disruptive events in the aquaculture subsector and declining rates
of growth in rice value-added. Among regions, Vietnam’s two rice bowls—the Mekong and Red River Deltas—
have experienced the slowest pace of agricultural growth since 2009. Three regions, the Mekong Delta, the
Southeast, and the Central Highlands, now account for about 60 percent of Vietnam’s gross agricultural output
and more than 80 percent of its agricultural exports. The future trajectory for agriculture in Vietnam’s different
regions will depend upon many factors. Of course, each region’s natural resource endowment and the legacy
pattern of agricultural development will be influential. Also influential will be demographic trends, including out-
migration and the likely average aging of the household heads engaged in farming in the future. The competition
for resources from other sectors will also, increasingly, come into play.

Looking ahead, continued changes in dietary preferences and food spending patterns will alter the landscape
of Vietnam’s food security, shift the locus of economic opportunity in the sector, and lend greater importance
to emerging areas of public policy concern. Both in Vietnam and elsewhere in the region, we expect to see a
declining importance of rice in the aggregate diet, continued growth in consumption of animal products, fruits and
vegetables, and processed foods and, with life-style changes, a continually growing importance of out-of-home
eating. Vietnam’s food security will increasingly relate to the cost and availability of animal feed (ingredients)
for which the country has a heavy reliance on imports. The expanded ‘consumer class’ in Vietnam and in other
middle income countries will present farmers with potentially more lucrative market opportunities plus open up
many commercial opportunities in the non-farm service and manufacturing segments of the food system. Dietary
and eating pattern shifts will put a premium on improving the management of animal health and food safety risks.
And, growing attention will need to be given to nutrition awareness in order for Vietnam to avoid the surge of non-
communicable diseases which have accompanied dietary and life-style changes in other countries.

C. The Way Forward: Sectoral Aspirations and Reforms Needed to Get From
Here to There

In the spirit of the Agricultural Restructuring Plan’s sustainable development ‘triple bottom line’ vision, the
ambitions that Vietnam can realistically set for its agro-food sector during the coming 10 to 15 years might
include the following:

  Growth: The agricultural growth rate will cease its ten-year decline and revert to the pace experienced in years
•	
  just after the turn of the millennium at between 3.0 and 3.5 percent.

  Productivity: This acceleration of growth will come primarily from growth in total factor productivity and the
•	
  reversal of its recent decline. Akin to patterns observed in other high performing middle-income countries,
  more than three-fourths of sectoral growth will be due to TFP growth. Agricultural labor productivity will
  increase substantially, and this will close the gap which currently exists between Vietnam, Thailand, and
  China. It will also close the gap between Vietnam’s agricultural sector and its labor-intensive manufacturing
  subsectors. The current gap in water productivity in Vietnam’s large irrigation schemes (vis-à-vis those in
  China and other middle-income Asian countries) will be closed as a result of land-use changes and improved
  water management and irrigation services.

  Sustainability: The reality and reputation of Vietnamese agriculture as eco-unfriendly will fundamentally
•	
  change. In large portions of the sector, the monitoring of agronomic practices against sustainability standards,
  natural resource management, waste management, and energy efficient methods will have been mainstreamed.
  Vietnam will be among the leading developing countries in the effective utilization of agricultural wastes—for
  energy, feed, composting, and other purposes. Dimensions of Vietnamese agriculture will be domestically
  and internationally recognized for their multi-functionality—including their protection of landscapes and
  contribution to eco- tourism.

  Nutritional Security: The sector will continue to play a major role in meeting national food security, servicing
•	
  increasingly diverse food demands and meeting domestic consumer expectations for safety, quality, and
  price. And Vietnam will meet or exceed all of the World Health Assembly nutrition targets for 2025, including
  those related to under- nutrition (i.e., child stunting), micro-nutrient deficiencies, and obesity. While this is a
  multi-sector challenge, the agricultural sector will help promote a healthy and diverse diet.

  Competitiveness: More than 50 percent of Vietnam’s agro-food exports will consist of processed and other
•	
  value-added products, more than double the current proportion. More than two dozen brands of Vietnamese
  companies that make agro-food products will be well-recognized in major regional and international markets.
  Vietnam will rank in the top 10 to 20 percent of developing countries in terms of the proportion of its agricultural
  commodity export volume which is derived from production areas which are either internationally certified
  or otherwise recognized for compliance with a broad range of environmental and social standards. In the
  process of this recognition, the current discrepancy between the high international regard for Vietnamese
  cuisine and the invisibility of most Vietnamese foods and raw materials abroad will be resolved.

Going forward, Vietnam’s changing climate could gain prominence as a driver of sector transformation as
well as in changes in the geography, nature, and quality of production. Indeed, temperature and sea-level rise,
the disruption of rainfall patterns, and the intensification of weather extremes will alter sector constraints over
time, namely with respect to land-use possibilities. That said, with proactive policies and investments that sustain




40 TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnam’s Recent Economic Developments
a fast pace of sector restructuring, Vietnamese agriculture has the opportunity to remain ahead of the race against
climate change. In the timeframe of the coming two decades, many of the changes that are anticipated as a result
of climate change—including a contraction of rice production, further aquaculture development, and an end to
coffee’s and other tree crops’ physical expansion—will largely be consistent with the sector’s potential, not only
to adapt, but also to thrive by “producing more from less.”

Looking Beyond Traditional Agricultural Policy

Many of the challenges that Vietnamese agriculture faces as it transitions to an efficiency-based and higher
value-added sector cannot be addressed exclusively through changes in agricultural policies. Addressing the
sector’s transitional and longer-term competitiveness and sustainability challenges requires broader, economy-
wide reforms, especially in relation to land (ownership/tenure and usage rights), the role and operating conditions
of state-owned enterprises and banks, policies and institutions associated with science and technology, and
approaches to government decentralization and coordination. Many of the recent special initiatives to support
structural and behavioral changes within the agricultural sector have become necessary to countervail the
constraining effects of non-agricultural policies, regulations, administrative practices, and so forth.

Likewise, supporting the business of agriculture entails government functions not normally considered
the mandate of ministries of agriculture. For example, there is a need to facilitate good corporate governance;
provide a level playing field for market participants and potential entrants (e.g., efficient, transparent processes
for business licensing and establishment); create a regulatory environment suited to local business and cultural
standards and the relevant level of industry development; and establish a transparent system of business and
trade taxation, and a clear legal code and redress processes for contracts. There is need for coordinated roles for
public institutions. Elsewhere in Asia, ministries of agriculture have found it very challenging to develop capacity
for effective, proactive support to agricultural diversification and inclusive agribusiness. Guiding the modernization
of agriculture thus involves numerous ministries beside agriculture and the effective coordination of effort.

Leading Less and Facilitating More

To achieve the lofty aspirations laid out above and otherwise support the modernization of Vietnamese
agriculture, the government will need to lead less and facilitate more. Administrative controls on land and direct
state involvement in both input and output markets were important factors in the sector’s stability and inclusive
growth over recent decades. However, maintaining these policies and certain legacy institutions could delay the
agricultural sector’s transformations in directions needed for it to remain in step with a modernizing, middle-
income country. Demographic and other domestic changes, as well as changes in the external environment, will
deepen the pressures and raise the stakes for the modernization of the sector. Micro-managing these change
processes would be exceedingly difficult and ultimately constrain the inherent energy and resilience of Vietnamese
farmers, as well as deter investment throughout the agro-food system. For illustration, Table 2.4 identifies some
areas where changes are possible in how the government intervenes in relation to agriculture and agribusiness
development.

The above also implies that the government will need to invest more selectively, focusing on core public
goods and services. In Vietnam, this might mean continuing to invest in rural infrastructure, early warning
weather systems, land administration services, basic agricultural research, pest and disease surveillance and
reporting, institutional capacity to enforce environmental and input regulation, or to support certification systems,
food safety inspection and related regulatory functions, and the provision of safety nets. In addition, by focusing
on improving the enabling environment, the government will better be able to leverage public funds to encourage
and enable much greater investment by farmers and the private sector. In higher income countries, agro-food
chains largely consist of private sector businesses. The levers of intervention for government are limited and
essentially exist to create and maintain a supportive enabling environment.

One cross-cutting area in which these (re-)orientations of government will imply significant changes in
Vietnam is that of innovation policy. Building the sector’s capacity for innovation— that is, for continuous,
and sometimes breakthrough improvement in how the business of agriculture is carried out—will be vital for
achieving nearly all of Vietnam’s aspirations for the sector. And doing so will generally call upon the government
to retreat from a number of functions it has proactively filled, including in research and technology transfer, and
to assert leadership by helping to draw out the best in the multiplicity of actors now seen as central to innovation.
In Vietnam’s case, this will involve shifting more resources and effort into, among things, building the capacities
of and connections among people, organizations, and systems. This is in the same vain as recent reforms that
have sought to make research institutions more demand- responsive, and firms more engaged in developing and
absorbing technology.

Facilitating More Efficient Use of Agricultural Land

In order to improve farmer welfare, meet the changing needs of domestic consumers, and reverse the pattern
of a declining rate of agricultural growth, much more efficient use will need to be made of Vietnam’s agricultural
land. Inefficiencies in land-use, at least in the lowland and delta areas, stem from various factors, including (i) the
structural legacy of earlier egalitarian land allocation policies; (ii) legal, regulatory, and administrative barriers to




42 TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnam’s Recent Economic Developments
a more active (transfer and leasing) land market; and (iii) the restrictions placed on land-uses, for the large area
of land designated as paddy-land.

Land consolidation, in various forms, will be critical for upgrading production systems and product quality,
reducing transaction costs within value chains, and enabling households to gain and maintain a middle
living standard based at least partly on agriculture. A more active market for agricultural land will facilitate
land consolidation in some areas, allow those farms and firms wishing to invest further in agriculture to pursue
their plans and enable many households to reduce their livelihood risk, by gaining guaranteed lease income
while focusing their labor or entrepreneurial efforts elsewhere. Land consolidation will also allow for increased
mechanization, a process which will become increasingly important as labor costs rise.

Enabling greater choice and flexibility in land-uses will be critical for improving farm household welfare,
better manage weather, other production and market risks, and spurring investment in agriculture. The
government is rightly concerned about widespread and uncontrollable conversion of agricultural land for other
purposes. And it wants to ensure that large areas of lowland suitable land continue to cultivate Vietnam’s leading
staple food—rice. yet, the paddy-land designation policy has resulted in Vietnam far overshooting its food
security objectives and generating a massive exportable surplus whose international sale generates only modest
incomes for farmers and net returns to the country overall. The costs of the restrictive paddy-land policies have
been recognized. The government has set goals for the conversion of some paddy-land and with Decree 35 has
set out rules which should provide farmers and local leaders with much greater scope to convert land to other
agricultural uses or introduce rotations between seasons. Active technical and other support by government for
crop diversification may be needed during the transition phase given lower levels of knowledge and technology
availability for the alternative crops and different types of risk which farmers may face. The changes being brought
should be carefully monitored. The revised policy still restricts farmers from converting paddy-land for more
permanent purposes—i.e., the planting of tree crops. This restriction should be reconsidered after the impacts
of the current reform are observed. As noted earlier, over the longer term we might expect upward of one-third of
the current paddy-land being shifted over to alternative agricultural land-uses and ecosystem services. Gisseke
et al. (2013) project that this type of change will bring very significant benefits and increase the future pace of
agricultural growth.

Facilitating More Efficient and Sustainable Use of Irrigation Water

Irrigation facilities have been the government’s biggest investment in the agricultural sector. Since the mid-
1970s, some $6 billion (present value) have been invested in irrigation—about 80 percent of the government’s
capital investment in the sector. While irrigation schemes have played a major role in Vietnam’s impressive
progress with respect to food security and poverty reduction, their utility will come under a stronger spotlight
as farmers seek to diversify land-uses and in the face of intensifying competition for land, water and budgetary
resources. Irrigated agriculture needs to increase overall factor productivity and better account for its water-use.
And the existing infrastructure will need to deliver a range of multi-functional water services—not just irrigation
and drainage. Water supply to municipalities, rural centers, industry and maintenance of flows for aquaculture,
fluvial transport and environmental services are becoming increasingly important.

In 2014, an irrigation restructuring scheme was announced, calling for an array of sustainable development
objectives and pointing toward a combination of technical advances and institutional reforms. As the subsector
is fully decentralized, the focus of change and modernization will be at the provincial level. The provinces are
responsible for irrigation investment planning, implementation of the investment, and operation and maintenance.




                                         TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnam’s Recent Economic Developments       43
yet the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development—working with provincial and user agencies—will need to
play a major role in promoting a facilitating a more service oriented approach to irrigation. The implementation of
reforms in the subsector will be a long-term effort that needs to be accompanied by measures to resolve the long-
term financing of irrigation and drainage management companies, improve their accountability (and oversight),
and improve their incentives to deliver requested and reliable irrigation services. Various approaches are being
pursued including changes in corporate governance arrangements, use of performance contracts, basing funding
on the implementation of business plans, and using improved tools for monitoring the performance of schemes
in relation to both technical and higher level objectives. Attention is also needed to strengthen the relationships
between IDMCs and water user organizations in order to improve irrigation service delivery. Good practices locally
seem to involve a shift from a hierarchical top-down approach to one of regular communications, joint problem
solving, and an overall orientation of co-managing the irrigation schemes.

Strengthening Green Agriculture Policies and Implementation Capacities

The government has recently turned its attention to environmental challenges, Vietnam’s Green Growth
Strategy—which touches upon agriculture-related themes—being emblematic of the attention being paid to
the matter at the highest levels of government. However, Vietnam’s agricultural policies and public expenditures
are still primarily driven by production output objectives (Khoi et al. 2015). Several agricultural promotion policies
moreover appear to conflict with environmental protection goals. For example, efforts to conserve fisheries
and promote fishery resource (co-)management occur in the same locations where fuel and/or boat-building
subsidies are offered to expand local fish processing capacity. Efforts to restrict farmers from cutting trees and
cultivating steep slopes may be undermined by the promotion of new investments in nearby ethanol plants with
large feedstock requirements. Government waivers and subsidies for water and irrigation service fees temporarily
increase farmer incomes, but contribute to improper water management, often in ways that increase greenhouse
gas emissions.

In Vietnam as in many other countries, meanwhile, primary attention has been given to putting in place
effective regulatory solutions to agro-environmental problems. Yet, regulatory enforcement is often challenging,
especially in circumstances like that in Vietnamese agriculture where primary production is highly fragmented.
Scherr et al. (2015) highlight a wider range of policy instruments that governments may use, often in combination,
to provide the incentives and controls needed to prevent environmentally destructive agricultural activities and
otherwise induce sustainable farming and natural resource management practices. These instruments set and
allow enforcement of the rules, raise awareness and provide needed information, and enable, through various
means, better behavior and technologies. Through incentives and information, whether these surface through
procurement, R&D, extension, or quality systems, government can enable and encourage private action. It can
directly invest in environmentally protective infrastructure or activities, or help others to mobilize such resources.
There are opportunities for interventions at multiple levels. At the farm and community levels, efforts can focus
on mainstreaming the adoption of good agricultural practices and promoting the multi-functionality of farming
areas (production; ecosystem services; eco-tourism). And, at a landscape level, multiple stakeholders can be
mobilized to develop sustainable agro-based ecosystems, such as one for industrial crops and agro-forestry in
the Central Highlands.

Managing Climate Change Risks to Vietnamese Agriculture

Growing recognition that climate change risk will interfere with the pursuit of near-term and long-term
agricultural development objectives has led a growing number of countries and development partners




44 TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnam’s Recent Economic Developments
to embrace climate-smart agriculture. The concept reflects a desire to integrate or mainstream adaptation
and mitigation objectives into ongoing sector development efforts, reorienting these as necessary. Less than
a preconceived approach or outcome, climate-smart agriculture implies the embrace, at multiple levels, of
processes to identify context-relevant policies and actions that will enable the agriculture sector to better fulfill its
multiple functions in a changing climate (e.g., as they relate to production, food security, livelihoods, economic
growth, and ecosystem health).

Some adaptations to climate change are likely to occur spontaneously, that is, as the result of farmer rather
than public sector initiative. Examples include delaying planting of winter- spring rice in the Red River Delta;
switching to drought-resistant crops such as cassava, maize, and groundnut in the Central Region; shifting to
salt-tolerant aquaculture as salinity creeps into the coastal parts of the Mekong River Delta; and stepping up the
capacity of veterinary services to respond to a higher incidence of vector-borne disease in the livestock sector.
Many of these changes can already be observed in Vietnam today. And taken together, shifts such as these can go
a long way toward averting the worst sector impacts suggested by “business-as-usual” modeling results, which
usually assume zero adaptation. That said, the rapid pace and extent of change that could transpire as global
greenhouse gas concentrations rise could test farmers’ and other agricultural actors’ ability to cope.

This points to a critical need for the government to help bolster the sector’s ability to manage both the
foreseeable challenges that climate change will bring (such as salinity intrusion, temperature stress, dry season
water scarcity, heightened flood and extreme weather risk, and so forth), as well as the significant amount of
uncertainty or unpredictability that climate change implies (e.g., with respect to rainfall, pests, and disease). In
fact, the uncertainty that is intrinsic to climate change points to the relevance of at least three mutually reinforcing
approaches when it comes to planning adaptation and other climate-smart agriculture strategies. These are (i)
to embrace the tenets of adaptive management; (ii) to strengthen the capacity for learning and innovation within
government as well as in the private sector; and (iii) to favor “no regrets” adaptation strategies.

Adaptive management is an approach to making decisions that deals with a context of uncertainty by making
learning central to the process (i.e., by making learning about a given system a central objective of decisions
that otherwise intend to improve that system). Adaptive management represents the deliberate and systematic
use of best available knowledge to guide policy decisions and management practices. Its effectiveness can
reflect such things as the quality of leadership; the skills, attitudes and social capital of individuals; the aptness
of institutional incentives and culture; and the strength of data and knowledge management systems. Particularly
fundamental to its success over time—and the ability to adapt to climate change—is the capacity for innovation
and learning, at every level of government, and much more broadly throughout the economy. This adaptive
management approach is consistent with the idea of prioritizing no-regrets strategies—actions that can be
justified from economic, social, and environmental perspectives whether a given climate change scenario unfolds
or not, or actions that are relatively reversible in case of unforeseen developments. Many of these have already
been identified and are actively being pursued in Vietnam.

Fostering Learning for Knowledge-Based Agriculture

Vietnam’s ability to respond to both environmental and market pressures in years ahead will require it
to incorporate increasingly sophisticated levels of knowledge into decision-making, production techniques,
and management processes at the farm level and beyond. For example, farmers will be in a better position to
compete, while generating more from less, if they are able to base what they grow and how they grow it on a
strong, evidence-based grasp of the resources they have to farm with, of weather, phytosanitary and other risks




                                          TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnam’s Recent Economic Developments           45
they face, and of consumer preferences (including for greener production processes) and price dynamics. And
they will better be able to compete if they can do this with access to the best solutions science has to offer to the
specific challenges they face. Shifting from a resource-intensive to knowledge based agriculture will, among other
things, require major changes in the ways in which farmers learn and gain access to technical and commercial
information. This has particular implications for Vietnam’s extension and advisory services, the training and
educational opportunities it offers individuals working in the sector, as well as data management systems, as
discussed below.

Agricultural extension. Agricultural extension in Vietnam has traditionally been top-down and supply driven.
Large numbers of public extension officers continue to work at provincial, district and local levels, providing
training, organizing demonstration models (related to new varieties or different agronomic practices), help
farmers to respond to outbreaks of pests or diseases, and supporting the implementation of a variety of localized
schemes. The government has recognized the need for and value of socializing advisory services, encouraging
the involvement of universities, private enterprises, and NGOs in advising farmers, and encouraging a more
multi-directional flow of information. Central government funding for certain extension programs have established
a competitive bidding process, enabling non-state entities to increase their activity. Recent projects supported
with development assistance funding have also sought to encourage private extension work. Agro-enterprises
which are entering into contracts or partnerships with farmer groups are likewise fielding staff to serve advisory
and monitoring functions. This will become increasingly important where companies will be needed to have an
effective traceability system for their products and raw materials. Yet, despite these developments a broader
rethink is needed regarding the objectives (i.e. beyond crop yields), approaches, and methodologies for extension.

The government and traditional public sector extension services may still have an important role to play,
though less as the main provider of centralized advisory services and more as a broker, mobilizer and funder
of services provided by others. For many extension agencies, moving into these roles will rest on an embrace of
structural and cultural changes, both internal and external to their organization. In particular, integrating brokerage
functions into traditional extension services will often require these institutions to build new skillsets, reframe
their mission, and modify staff incentives by changing performance measurement criteria. Brokering requires
specific facilitation skills for managing group processes and building trust; and it cannot be judged by traditional
performance indicators such as publications or numbers of trainings. Vietnamese policy-makers might consider
how approaches from elsewhere could be applied locally.

Stimulating Innovation throughout Agro-food Value Chains

How effectively it can seize domestic demand opportunities, compete in commodity markets and remain food
secure—in a changing climate—will depend upon how well Vietnam innovates. As has already been argued,
this will call for continued reforms in Vietnam’s innovation policy to sharpen the country’s research and absorption
capabilities. While Vietnam’s agricultural strategy has come to embrace a broad set of themes—including post-
harvest management, climate change adaptation, advances in quality and value-addition, and so forth—the
focus of most publically funded research programs has remained on agricultural production. In addition, research
priorities remain are still identified centrally, to a large extent, and may not be aligned with regional or local
(business) needs. Public funding for agricultural research is provided through MARD, provincial governments
and the Ministry of Science and Technology, and although the size of the envelope has increased, it is small in
comparison to that of Asian peers as a fraction of agricultural GDP    . In recent years, competitive processes have
gained favor as a means of allocating research funding, as they are seen as a means of encouraging research
institutes to become more autonomous, responsive to demand, and commercially driven. Yet, the reform process




46 TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnam’s Recent Economic Developments
of the agricultural research system is still at an early stage. In this respect, Vietnam may find merit in placing
increasing emphasis on more demand-responsive and multi-disciplinary research, and on multi-stakeholder
consortium models involving research institutes, universities, industry, and farmers.

Vietnam will also want to gravitate toward more effective technology absorption—not only by farmers, but
also by agro-enterprise SMEs. The absorption of technology by producers and agro-food enterprises is a weak
link in many transitioning agricultural innovation systems, including Vietnam’s. A lack of dynamism in firms’
embrace of improved processes or tools can be symptomatic of innovation systems in which the development
of new technologies or improved ways of doing things is separate from firms’ activities, or includes limited
involvement of these in innovation processes. It can reflect the notion and reality that technology absorption is
separate from innovation, and a resulting weak capacity on the part of firms to absorb technology that they played
little role in conceiving or developing. This separation limits firms’ opportunities to learn-by-doing, or to shape
technology developments that are well-tailored to their day-to-day business needs. Other factors that contribute
to weighing down technology absorption by firms include a lack of investment and especially venture funding,
inadequate support for the development of business plans and marketing strategies especially, and a lack of tools
and appetite for risk-taking.

Fostering Collective Action for Competitive and Inclusive Agricultural Value Chains

Although processes of consolidation have begun, Vietnamese agriculture remains largely characterized
by fragmented production and value chain structures. Comparatively low levels of collective action have
often prevented the realization of economies of scale, inhibited the development of quality management and
product traceability systems, and served to weaken overall subsector governance and coordination. In Vietnam,
common types of collective action organizations—including cooperatives and industry associations—have
often served political rather than technical or commercial functions. Yet, in recent years, the government has
recognized the importance of various forms of institutional collaboration for fostering innovation and improving
industry performance. The Agricultural Restructuring Plan advocates for the broader application of public-private
partnership and contract farming models.

International experience points to the multiple approaches and benefits of strengthening collective action
in its many possible incarnations. Government can support producer and industry organizations in two broad
ways: it can invest in institutional strengthening, and it can use its legal and regulatory authority to create a
supportive environment. The public sector can help build stronger organizations by funding technical assistance
for such efforts as participatory institutional assessments, administrative and governance reforms, leadership
building, and the development of learning and information exchange mechanisms. It can also directly fund
targeted activities, or personnel such as organizational facilitators and brokers; and deploy economic incentives
for businesses and research organizations to work with these organizations, increasing their relevance in the value
chain.

While contract farming is primarily private-sector led, government support for such arrangements is not
uncommon on the grounds that these can contribute to meeting broader policy objectives such as inclusive
growth, food security, or the protection of natural resources. Besides improving the enabling environment
(e.g., the rule of law, the quality of infrastructure, health, and education, political stability, financial markets, and
so forth), the public sector can encourage contract farming by facilitating interactions and brokering transactions
among potential counterparts, establishing a legal framework for farming contracts, putting economic incentives
in place, building technical and institutional capacity, and educating counterparts about potential benefits and




                                          TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnam’s Recent Economic Developments           47
risks. That said, the public sector needs to tread carefully. A number of contract farming arrangements have owed
their failure to facilitators in the public or non-profit sector getting ahead of value chain actors and pushing for
arrangements that were not in line with existing capacities, ambitions, risk-preference, or levels of trust; or that
put development objectives ahead of business viability.

Agro-based cluster development will be an appropriate strategy in a number of Vietnamese contexts in which
important gains could come from strengthening (cooperative and competitive) linkages among farmers and
various commercial players, as well as the infrastructure that underpins these. Cluster development lends
itself to incremental forms of public sector support. In an initial phase, the public sector can be involved in sowing
the seeds of institutional reform by building trust, encouraging collaboration, and helping to strengthen local
infrastructure. And it can focus on supporting a series of small value chain initiatives that accompany process
and later product upgrading, and build confidence in cluster activities. In subsequent phases, support can focus
on access to finance, incentives for startups, and measures to attract and develop entrepreneurs, and potentially
the creation of special economic zones.

Strengthening Systems and Capacities for Managing Emerging Food Safety Risks

The processes of urbanization, industrialization, and income growth, and changes in the composition of
consumer diets (favoring animal products and other high value and processed foods) have simultaneously
increased the exposure of Vietnamese consumers to food safety risks and increased demand for higher
standards of food safety. At stake is the Vietnamese agro-food sector’s ability to maintain and gain relevance
in the rapidly evolving and growing domestic market—in short, to stake out increasing market share. Vietnam
has responded to these challenges by revamping its food safety regulations and investing in laboratories. It has
also streamlined institutional structures by reducing the number of ministries in charge of food safety from the
previous six to the current three. Having moved to a model that privileges decentralized support for agriculture,
with some three fourths of public agricultural expenditure occurring at the provincial level, Vietnam will need to
look at ways to make a devolution of food safety responsibilities work well. The government wants to utilize its
existing capacity to address food safety, and plans to task agencies that were previously in charge of export
food safety to take increasing responsibility for domestic food safety control. As it proceeds with these and other
reforms, international experience and global trends in food safety control systems can inform the strategies it
employs.

In terms of food safety governance, international experience highlights a move toward the judicious sharing
of responsibilities—among levels of government as well as with private sector entities—and proactive, risk-
based approaches to protecting consumer safety. Notable trends include the following:

  Consolidation and coordination. While a majority of OECD countries maintain several agencies in charge
•	
  of food safety, the trend in emerging economies has been to consolidate food safety within one government
  agency (as in China and Kazakhstan). This reflects the desire to reduce barriers for collaboration between
  multiple agencies. In emerging economies, more than in developed economies, collaboration between
  government institutions is a major challenge. Through such consolidation governments expect to reduce
  institutional battles for spheres of influence. That said, high level coordination bodies have become common
  in many countries (e.g., Germany, South Korea, China) and offer an alternative to single or integrated agency
  structures.




48 TAKING STOCK An Update on Vietnam’s Recent Economic Developments
•	Devolution of authority. To address the challenge of oversight at the sub-national level, some countries have
   opted to entirely devolve food safety authority to regional bodies (e.g., Australia), while others—usually small
   ones—have opted to centralize authority without attempting to replicate national structures at the sub-national
   level. In the latter case, even local food safety inspectors report to a central national authority as opposed to a
   regional or local one. There are several trade-offs to consider in deciding between these two approaches. The
   devolution model allows for greater integration of food safety with other regulatory functions yet also creates
   the potential for inconsistent applications of national laws and regulations. It can also suffer from a lack of
   adequate resources being devoted by sub-national government to this function.

•	Pro-active prevention. Many countries have moved toward approaches to food safety management that give
   precedence to the prevention of hazards over the inspection of finished products. While this approach has
   been spearheaded in developed countries, it is of high relevance to more resource-constrained countries.
   When it comes to prevention, the hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) approach is one of
   the best known and most widely adopted. HACCP is a management system developed in the U.S. in which
   food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of biological, chemical, and physical hazards from
   raw material production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the
   finished product (U.S. Food and Drug Administration). Its principles require that (identified and realistic) food
   safety hazards be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.

•	Risk-profiling. One of the defining pillars of pro-active prevention (i.e., HACCP) is the principle of hazard
   monitoring. One practical way to go about doing this involves auditing and assigning risk profiles to enterprises.
   Risk-profiling generally entails a shift from the retrospective recording of food safety breaches, to the more
   pro-active assessment of how likely future problems are going forward. And risk-profiling generally places
   less emphasis on the safety of end-products than on that of business facilities and practices. Ideally, risk-
   profiling also takes into account risks that arise through sourcing and primary production of the foods that
   firms use.

Ultimately, the governance of food safety is only as successful as its ability to widely, consistently, and durably
change the behavior of the many: of consumers, of farmers, small food processors, food service workers,
and of those working in agro-enterprise more broadly. And the key lesson from international experience in
this respect is that it is not effective to manage risk strictly through policing. The public sector needs to seek to
influence all of these players to, in essence, motivate them to in large part police themselves.

D. Conclusions

A smooth and successful transformation of Vietnam’s agriculture and broader agro-food system will occur if
government follows the ethos of the Agricultural Restructuring Plan and undertakes to “lead less yet facilitate
more” change and investment in the sector. The Vietnamese government has played a major and, in some
areas, a leading role in the past development of agriculture. Some of its past functions—including those of
land use planner, manager of farms, commodity trader and technology supplier---will be less important or even
detrimental in the movement toward a more flexible, market-driven, and knowledge-based agriculture. Government
can undertake less direct investment in agriculture if it is effective at facilitating private investment, including
through public-private partnerships. That should free up resources to achieve excellence in the application of
important regulatory services (e.g. environmental, plant and animal health, food safety). There will be a continuing
role for government in promoting more efficient and sustainable land and water use, the maintenance of rural
infrastructure, increased collective action, and other elements which help mitigate the risks and transaction costs
faced by farmers and agro-food enterprises.
