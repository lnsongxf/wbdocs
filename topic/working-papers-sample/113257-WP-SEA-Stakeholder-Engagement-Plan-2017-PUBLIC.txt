1    INTRODUCTION
Myanmar has immense hydropower potential. It is home to the drainage basins of four large rivers:
Ayeyarwady, Chindwin, Sittaung and Thanlwin. Despite its hydropower potential, rich biodiversity and
natural resources, Myanmar remains the least developed economy in Southeast Asia (UNDP 2013).
While the country has abundant energy resources - including renewable alternatives - hydropower is
the main source of fuel for electricity requirements, followed by natural gas and coal (ADB 2015). In
2012, hydropower provided 75% of supply. Tapping the country’s extensive hydropower potential
could provide a critical source of electricity for the national grid and could power economic growth,
which is expected to average at least 6.8% in coming years. Myanmar also has one of the lowest
electrification rates in Asia, where less than a third of the population has access to the electricity grid
(World Bank 2014).
There are 58 hydropower projects (HPP) under construction or planned (each with at least 10 MW
capacity) with total potential installed capacity of 46,101 MW (Figure 1). These projects are expected
to harness up to 50% of the country’s hydropower potential. Most of the hydropower development
plans are targeting the Thanlwin and Ayeyarwady-Chindwin basins.

assessment (SEA) of the hydropower sector in Myanmar. An SEA provides a valuable tool to plan
balanced hydropower development in a watershed or nationally early in the planning process. An SEA
considers the cumulative impact of multiple projects across a broad area, particularly on significant
environmental and social values. An effective SEA could lead to the conservation and maintenance of
natural systems and services while optimizing project siting and configuration.
There is a critical opportunity to involve users of river resources in basin wide development planning
so that all values and interests are considered, consensus reached on the tradeoffs and conflicts over
resource uses resolved. The SEA and its program of stakeholder involvement has the potential to
make an important contribution in that balanced and inclusive planning process. This document sets
out the SEA approach to stakeholder engagement.
1.1       SEA objectives and outcomes
The overall objectives of this SEA are to i) define a sustainable development pathway for hydropower
in Myanmar over the next 20 years and beyond; ii) achieve broad consensus on this pathway, based
on environmental, social and economic considerations; and iii) promote long-term economic
development and sustainable use and protection of natural resources and ecosystems.
The key expected outcomes of the SEA are:
          a more informed and improved dialogue between stakeholders;
          enhanced understanding by decision makers and other stakeholders of the range of
           stakeholder values and priorities that need to be considered in formulating the sustainable
           hydropower development pathway;
          a shared development pathway that accounts for stakeholder priorities;
          an E&S rating of pipeline project proposals;
          recommendations on policies, procedures and plans required to plan hydropower, trading off
           different values and outcomes; and
          recommendations on additional baseline data gathering required to fill key information gaps.
The SEA is aiming to develop a Sustainable Hydropower Development Pathway in Myanmar.
Conducting the SEA before major project decisions are made means it can have a real influence in
shaping hydropower development and watershed management at the early stages of planning.
1.2       Phases and key outputs
The 12-month SEA process will be implemented in three key phases: 1) Scoping and baseline
assessment 2) Sustainable Development Pathway Setting and Assessment 3) Mitigation and
recommendations. The phased approach envisages analysis, stakeholder engagement and
documentation at each stage. That approach with progressive reporting and review promotes
transparency, consensus building, validation, and respect for the process as it moves forward. It is
important not to leave reporting until the final stage - there should be no surprises at that late stage,
which could reduce the SEA’s credibility and authority and lead to its rejection by important
stakeholders. The proposed phases are:
1. Scoping and baseline assessment: The geographic and temporal boundaries are determined.
   Through stakeholder consultations, sustainability principles and key themes are refined to identify
   the key strategic environmental and socio-economic issues for each river basin. Information and
   spatial data is collected to describe the existing status and trends in the key strategic issues.
2. Sustainable development pathway setting and assessment: The risks and opportunities
   associated with the implementation of the business-as-usual (BAU) case and sustainable
   hydropower development strategy are assessed using trend analysis and GIS overlays for each of




                                                                                                                  3

    the strategic issues. Spatial multi-criteria analysis is used to rank the proposed hydropower
    projects according to impact and sustainability.
3. Mitigation and recommendations: The last step involves defining measures to enhance the
   benefits and to avoid, or mitigate, the negative effects of proposed hydropower development.

The phased approach envisages analysis, consultation and documentation at each stage. That
approach with progressive reporting and review promotes transparency, consensus building, testing
and agreement on the facts, and respect for the process as it moves forward. Stakeholder engagement
and release of reports have been integrated into the overall SEA methodology as shown in Figure 2.

             Detailed Draft SEA;
             Final SEA.
Below is a summary of the key outputs and the expected dates for delivery:
      (i)        Stakeholder Engagement Plan (December 2016): The plan will be prepared to ensure that
                 the main stakeholder groups are effectively engaged in each of the key steps of the SEA.
                 The stakeholder engagement plan will be reviewed and updated regularly as the SEA
                 progresses to reflect experience and advice stemming from on-going consultations. It will
                 be closely integrated with the overall IFC Communications Plan for the SEA.
      (ii)       Scoping and Baseline Report (February 2017): This report will present the SEA purpose
                 and methodology, scope and boundaries and tools for spatial and trend analysis and the
                 initial baseline information for the key themes and issues. The report will include the
                 review of the decision-making, institutional and legal framework and the definition of
                 sustainable development objective and indicators for the key themes. A summary of the
                 regional river basin consultations will also be included in the scoping and baseline report.
      (iii)      Project Sustainability Analysis Report (May 2017): The sustainability analysis of projects
                 is a core component of the impact assessment report. This component will be drawn out
                 into a short policy brief and communications reference for decision makers.
      (iv)       Impact assessment report (June 2017): The findings of the impact assessment phase will
                 be distilled into the draft impact assessment report and released for stakeholder
                 comment.
      (v)        Draft SEA Report (August 2017): Sufficient time has been made available in the work
                 scheduled for GOM and stakeholders to review and provide comments on the draft SEA
                 draft prior to finalizing the report in October 2017. Members of the SEA team will be
                 available to provide high-level briefings to Government and other stakeholders if
                 required.
      (vi)       Final SEA report (October 2017)
Each of those reports will be subject to stakeholder review and comment.

1.5       Approach
The systematic assessment to be applied in this SEA involves well integrated and often parallel tasks
including:
       Identifying key issues: Identifying environmental and social (E&S) issues considered by
        stakeholders as important for development and management of the river basins
     Grouping issues into strategic themes: Consolidating the list of issues into strategic
        environmental and socio-economic themes
     Overlaying available GIS layers for hydropower development and environmental and socio-
        economic issues in the selected river basins
     Outlining the past and future trends (to 2035 and to 2050 for climate change) and drivers of
        change in the strategic themes
     Defining sustainability objectives and indicators for the strategic themes
     Reviewing of hydropower projects against the sustainability objectives and categorizing them
        according to the significance of potential impact
     Trends analysis for scenarios: Outlining the expected future trends (2035) in strategic themes
        for the Business-As-Usual (BAU) case and for the sustainable hydropower development
        pathway
     Identifying critical concerns and opportunities associated with hydropower development in
        Myanmar and policy and management responses to them
The SEA seeks stakeholder involvement in each of those activities to ensure the approach is
participatory and stakeholder driven process.

2     STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Stakeholder engagement can be defined as “any process that involves stakeholders in problem-solving
or decision-making and uses stakeholder input to make better decisions” (Baldwin and Twyford,
2006). This definition highlights that stakeholder engagement is a process or series of actions, impacts
and outcomes and not one single activity (UNEP, 2007). The International Association of Impact
Assessment (IAIA) has developed SEA performance criteria to achieve “Participative SEAs”, so that the
process informs and involves interested and affected public (Partidario, 2012). The approach of this
SEA recognizes the need for stakeholder involvement in its activities and phases so the process is
inclusive, transparent and fair.
2.1       Objectives of the stakeholder engagement plan (SEP)
The objectives of this SEP is i) to outline the stakeholder consultation and communication activities
throughout each step of the SEA, ii) to identify the key stakeholder groups, and iii) to identify resources
needed and length of time to achieve effective participation in each stage of the process. Stakeholder
engagement will be delivered primarily through carrying out the following key consultation events:
          Kick-off meeting: Meeting with IFC, GOM and other stakeholders to introduce the SEA
           methodology and process.
          Regional river basin consultations: Meetings and workshops with different stakeholder
           groups at the basin and region/state level to identify the key environment and social (E&S)
           issues and opportunities.
          Multi-stakeholder baseline assessment workshops: Review findings from regional river basin
           consultations and to focus on identifying and prioritizing specific issues and opportunities at
           the national and basin level for the Ayeyarwady-Chindwin and Thanlwin.
          Consultation with local communities: Discussions with local communities affected by existing
           HPPs in the Thanlwin, Ayeyayarwady-Chindwin and Sittaung.
          Impact assessment workshops: Review findings of the impact assessment and project
           sustainability analysis report and play a role in framing the sustainable hydropower
           development pathway based.
          Final Multi-stakeholder workshops: Review the draft SEA and provide comments and
           suggestions through group discussion and activities.
Further information on the design of the key stakeholder events is outlined in section 5. The key
stakeholder consultation events were designed to capture as many state/regions as possible with
multiple visits to major river basins and coastal regions in Myanmar (Figure 5).

The SEP recognizes the dynamic nature of a SEA and consultations will also involve ongoing:
       Direct discussions with individual stakeholders;
       Roundtable meetings with specific stakeholder groups;
       Interaction with the Advisory Group and six Expert Groups;
       Outreach at conferences, forums and other workshops in Myanmar and the Mekong region.


                                                                                                               9

It is important to highlight upfront that the role of an SEA is to assess at a strategic-level, the
cumulative impacts of multiple projects across the major basins and coastal regions in Myanmar. It
needs to take into account the representative views of relevant stakeholder groups. But the SEA
cannot be compared to an environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) which examines
individual projects and affected communities in more detail. The SEA will engage directly with some
local communities affected by existing hydropower as a way of confirming and deepening
understanding of riverine community concerns and opinions, however this will not always be possible
- in which case stakeholder representatives or “gate keepers” will need to be identified and consulted.
2.2       Stakeholder groups
The first step in the SEP is to identify the key stakeholders to be consulted and involved. The initial list
of stakeholders was developed based on the TOR and updated following the kick-off Meetings in
October through direct conservations with IFC, MOEE, MONREC, the Advisory Group and other
stakeholders. The stakeholder groups to be engaged will be expanded and updated as the SEA evolves
to identify additional groups which have an important stake in hydropower development and
watershed management. The initial list of stakeholders is categorized under the following stakeholder
groups:
          Union government;
          Sub-national government;
          National and local civil society organizations (CSOs);
          Local communities ;
          Private sector;
          International non-government organizations (NGOs);
          Universities and research institutes;
          Multilateral development agencies and banks.
2.3       Stakeholder analysis
Stakeholder analysis is the process of identifying the stakeholder groups that are likely to affect or be
affected by a proposed action, and sorting them according to their impact on the action and the impact
the action will have on them. The following stakeholder analysis will be incorporated into the key steps
of the SEA (Table 2).

 Inception and baseline           stakeholder group their potential role in the project and the degree of
 assessment                       importance and influence. ‘Influence’ relates to decision -making power and
                                  ‘importance’, the level of interest in the SEA.

                                  and influence recommendations for avoidance, enhancement and mitigation.

Stakeholder analysis is an ongoing process and will evolve as new stakeholders are introduced to the
SEA process. The preliminary stakeholder analysis has identified the various interests of stakeholder
groups and what influence might these groups may have on the SEA. The analysis also shaped the
design of stakeholder consultation events and which stakeholders to engage and when. The following
sections will included for each stakeholder group:


                                                                                                                 10

2.4     Stakeholder groups
2.4.1 Union Government
Union government agencies are key stakeholders for the SEA. Engagement with government will serve
two main purposes:
      (i) involve ministries, departments and committees in each step of the SEA to build consensus
           and ownership of the findings;
      (ii) identify the governance framework for hydropower, socio-economic development and
           watershed management.
Table 3 maps out the potential role, interest and influence in the SEA for each of the stakeholders at
the Union government level when the mandate, history of involvement, resources and authority in
development planning and decisions making considered.

Through direct discussions and roundtable meetings with the national stakeholder groups the
institutional (decision-making) responsibility and policy and planning instruments will be mapped for
sectors using river basin resources including; agriculture, aquaculture, energy, fisheries, hydropower,
mining, transport (navigation). The process for reviewing and approving hydropower projects will be
examined carefully to identify steps, gaps or overlaps between institutions. The mapping process will
help to identify the governance context and capacities of institutions to effectively manage river basin
development.
2.4.2 Sub-national government
The SEA team plans to conduct stakeholder engagement activities in states/regions where there is
existing and planned hydropower development including; Kachin, Shan, Kayah, Kayin, Mon states,
Sagaing, Mandalay and Tanintharyi regions, and Bago division. Sub-national government agencies at
the state and region levels are key stakeholders in river basin development as summarized below in
Table 4.

 Identify the issues and opportunities facing river basin development at the
                                                                                        High            Low
 state/region and basin level.
State/region governments were created by the 2008 Constitution and established in 2011. Today,
Myanmar comprises seven states and seven regions, five self-administered zones, one self-
administered division, and Nay Pyi Taw as a Union Territory. During the past decade, there has been
some decentralization of natural resource management and revenue collection (TAF, 2014). Engaging
with region/state offices of MONREC, MOEE and other ministries presents an important opportunity
to enhance coordination between the multiple sectors involved in hydropower development.
States/region governments will be included in the following stakeholder engagement activities:
       Regional river basin consultations
       Baseline assessment multi-stakeholder workshops
       Final multi-stakeholder workshops
       Direct discussion and roundtable meetings.

The spatial analysis will also identify the extent to which the townships, village tracts and villages in
each of the river basins will be affected by existing and planned hydropower development.
2.4.3 National and local CSOs
There is mounting pressure from civil society organizations (CSOs) and local communities opposing
large scale hydropower development. National and local CSOs in Myanmar have called on the
government to halt hydropower projects on major rivers, citing potential negative environmental and
social impacts. The environmental and human rights movement in Myanmar is very active, mobilized
primarily around high profile projects and such as the suspended Myistone dam in Kachin State and
the Mong Ton dam in Shan State. Table 9 summarizes the initial stakeholders for national CSOs based
in Yangon.

 Participate in key consultation events, direct and roundtable meetings. Provide
 data and information for key themes and guidance on defining the sustainable               High         Low
 hydropower development pathway.
National CSOs focusing on environmental and social issues and groups representing women, youth,
ethnic minorities and other marginalized stakeholder groups will be invited to participate in key
stakeholder events, including:
        Baseline assessment multi-stakeholder workshops
        Impact assessment workshop
        Final multi-stakeholder workshops
        Direct discussion and roundtable meetings.
National CSOs will also be invited to join expert technical groups (EGs) and the SEA Advisory Group
(AG).
The Local CSOs based in states/regions have been mapped in preparation for the regional river basin
consultations.
2.4.4 Stakeholders at the river basin level
Stakeholder groups will be identified and mapped at different levels and scales. In the context of the
SEA, scale in stakeholder engagement refers to river basin, administrative, hydrological, ecosystem or
economic boundaries (Dore & Lebel, 2010). Globally, participatory approaches have tended not to
effectively address the diversity of stakeholders in a river basin (Warner, 2006). Identifying and
engaging stakeholders at the river basin level is complex due to geographic and administrative
boundaries between countries, states/regions and townships. For example, the Thanlwin River
originates in China and flows through the Shan, Kayah, Kayin and Mon States. Contested areas and
regional autonomous zones further complicate stakeholder engagement in Myanmar. The SEA will
take a decentralized approach to participation which addresses those challenges.
In developing the SEP, stakeholder groups were initially identified for the regional river basin
consultations planned in the Thanlwin, Sittaung, Chindwin and Tanintharyi region. There are several
local CSOs operating at the basin and state/region level in Myanmar. These groups represent a diverse
range of interests, including: environmental, governance and security, transparency and
accountability, law enforcement, conflict, peace process and ethnic minorities.
In planning for the regional river basin consultations, the local CSOs were mapped at the basin level
for the Thanlwin, Sittaung, Chindwin and Tanintharyi. This process was led by the Stakeholder
Consultation Specialist and involved contacting CSO networks to determine which organizations were
working at the basin and state/region levels in the key river basins in Myanmar, this initial stakeholder
list is shown below in Table 6.

 Other consultation events will involve sub-national government in the Mon and Kayin states for the
Thanlwin basin. Stakeholders will be mapped again at the basin and state/region level prior to multi-
stakeholder workshops and consultation with local communities affected by existing hydropower.
2.4.5 Local communities
Local communities will be involved in the river basin consultative meetings and workshops. They will
also be involved in case study consultations.
Case studies: For in depth case study analysis, the SEA team will consult with local communities
affected by three existing HPPs. These in-depth studies will provide an opportunity to validate
information at the village level around the environmental and social impacts of hydropower. The
spatial analysis will for the social/livelihoods team will also identify the exposed villages to existing
and planned hydropower development.

 aims to provide opportunities for ground truthing on the environmental and
 social impacts of hydropower in Myanmar.

There are more than 135 ethnic groups in Myanmar - most located in the areas identified for intensive
hydropower development. To ensure that consultation with local communities is inclusive of ethnic
minority groups a pool of local interpreters who speak local languages and dialect will be available to
assist the SEA team in carrying out these consultations. Conducting consultations only in the Burmese
language has the risk of excluding the views and opinions of the most vulnerable and marginalized
groups within ethnic communities.

There is an opportunity to involve some Myanmar and international hydropower developers in each
of the key steps of the SEA. The interest of the private sector was demonstrated through participation
in kick-off meetings and membership of the HDWG. The Shwe Taung group presented at the kick-off
meetings in October 2016 and reaffirmed the commitment of the private sector to manage
environmental and social impacts. The private sector have limited experience implementing E&S
safeguards and IFC performance standards and require support from internatonal organisations.
Hydropower developers and private companies will be invited to participate in the following key
stakeholder events:
        Multi-stakeholder workshops
        Impact assessment workshop
        Direct discussion and roundtable meetings.
Hydropower developers were also invited to join expert technical groups (EGs) and membership on
the Advisory Group (AG). The SEA team will engage with hydropower developers and association to
update the HPP database and for assistance in arranging field and site visits to existing HPPs.
A special purpose hydropower developers group has been established by IFC which provides a critical
opportunity to bring the private sector into the SEA process - the Hydropower Developers Working
Group (HDWG). The HDWG is an innovative platform for companies to influence policy, network, and
identify solutions to improve sustainability and business operations. To provide hydropower
companies with an opportunity to drive positive change in their sector, the HDWG was established in
2016 in Myanmar. Members meet quarterly for business discussions and seminars on pressing issues
in their field. The SEA team will look for opportunities to meet with hydropower companies on an
individual basis and to present progress of the SEA at its quarterly meetings.
2.4.7 International NGOs
There are several international NGOs with extensive experience in Myanmar working on biodiversity
conservation, integrated water resources management (IWRM), renewable energy, sustainable
hydropower and advocacy for local communities (Table 10).

The SEA will draw on existing research carried out by local and international NGOs for development
of the baseline assessment. FFI, WCS, WWF, IUCN and WorldFish have extensive knowledge and
spatial data on protected areas, landscapes and conservation areas across Myanmar that will feed into
the biodiversity, aquatic ecology and fisheries themes. WWF also has a strong focus on renewable
energies and water.
Oxfam and International Rivers provide advocacy for river communities, with Oxfam also funding
water governance programs and action research. SEI and WLE have conducted local level research in
the Ayeyarwady-Chindwin and Thanlwin rivers on river health, sustainable hydropower and water
quality. TNC have just opened their offices in Myanmar and have been evaluating system-scale
planning for hydropower in the Yeywa cascade on the Mytinge River.
As part of the SEP, the SEA team will engage with international NGOs throughout the key steps of the
SEA. International organizations will be invited to participate in the following engagement activities:
       Baseline assessment multi-stakeholder workshops
       Impact assessment workshop
       Final multi-stakeholder workshops
       Direct discussion and roundtable meetings.
National CSOs were also invited to join expert technical groups (EGs) and membership on the Advisory
Group (AG).

There is limited published information on biodiversity, aquatic ecology and fisheries for the major river
basins in Myanmar. As part of the SEA the team plans to consult with universities and academic
institutions to obtain existing information and explore linkages with ongoing research. Universities
and research organizations will be invited to participate in:
       Baseline assessment multi-stakeholder workshops
       Impact assessment workshop

The World Bank is supporting the Ayeyarwady Integrated River Basin Management Project (AIRBM).
The project aims to assist Myanmar in developing the institutions and tools needed to enable informed
decision making in the management of national water resources and to implement integrated river
basin management in the Ayeyarwady Basin. The State of the Basin Assessment (SOBA) will commence
in January 2017 and will comprise 6 packages:
          Surface water modelling
          Groundwater and Data Management
          Sediments & Geomorphology
          Biodiversity & Fisheries
          Sectoral Development, Macroeconomics and Basin Pollution Assessment
          3D Mapping and Local Consultations.
Results from those packages are anticipated to be completed in April or May 2017 and will be
integrated into the SEA baseline assessment, to some extent allowing the SEA team to focus research
activities on the other major basins in Myanmar and the Tanintharyi and Rakhine coastal regions.
The ADB supported an initial energy sector assessment that outlines development issues and strategic
options for the GoM and is continuing to support power sector planning. This work will be
complimented by World Bank studies on energy tariffs, the transmission network and rural
electrification.
As a part of the SEP, The SEA team will engage regularly with these stakeholder groups to ensure that
the sustainable hydropower development pathway considers the opportunities and limiting factors of
the energy sectors.
There are many bi-lateral donors investing in the water and energy sectors in Myanmar. The following
will be included in ongoing dialogue:
          Government of Australia: Supporting the AIRBM, IFC sustainable hydropower program and
           Myanmar Healthy Rivers Initiative (MHRI) through the Mekong Water Resources Program and
           Australian Water Partnership (AWP).
          JICA: Developing with MOEE the revised National Electricity Master Plan (NEMP), and will
           discuss data sharing and scenarios for hydropower development. The power demand
           forecasting will be finalized in March 2017 and be incorporated into the SEA. There is potential
           to identify the NEMP process as the framework within which the SEA is continuing and
           influencing. Collaborative arrangements are being put in place between the Japanese
           consultants working on the NEMP and the SEA team to integrate the two processes and avoid
           confusion among stakeholders. One special issue for discussion is the intention of the JICA
           team to conduct an SEA of the NEMP as part of JICA safeguard requirements.
          Government of Norway: Assisting the MOEE with capacity building through assistance from
           the Norwegian Directorate for Energy and Water Resources (NVE). The cooperation focuses
           on sustainable hydropower development, legal frameworks, hydropower standards and
           hydrology, and provides on-the-job training and formal training courses. They have also
           established and E&S working group in MOEE.
          Government of Netherlands: Recently commenced implementation of the Integrated
           Ayeyarwady Delta Strategy Project (IADS). The SEA team will need to work closely with the
           project consultants to share information and methodology especially relating to the business-
           as-usual case for planned HPPS in the Ayeyarwady-Chindwin basin.

Hydropower dams affect women and men in different ways, either by imposing a disproportionate
share of environmental and social impacts on women or through an inequitable distribution of
benefits. Therefore, in engaging relevant stakeholders in the SEA, it is necessary to assess information
about interests and opportunities of the hydropower sector as well as constraints faced by Myanmar
women in affected communities. The team will obtain gender-disaggregated data, where possible, to
understand the context and factors that influence gender differences as well as women’s participation
in natural resources and community decision making. The stakeholder engagement activities will also
engage women's groups to examine how these issues could impact livelihoods, gender relations and
roles of women - and what kind of actions and solutions are needed to enhance equity and avoid
negative effects.
The SEA team will need to take those findings into account in implementing the stakeholder
engagement plan and in conducting the stakeholder analysis.
2.6    Conflict
The initial list of stakeholder focus on international and local organizations focused on groups working
on environment, water governance and social & livelihoods. Following the first AG meeting, conflict
and sub-national governance emerged as critical issues for inclusion in the SEA. Large-scale
hydropower projects are planned in the upper reaches of the Ayeyarwady and Thalnwin rivers in the
Kachin and Shan states, where there is active conflict, contested areas and regional autonomous
zones. The following stakeholder groups that specialize in conflict and governance will be consulted
to understand conflict issues and include this in the analysis of existing and planned hydropower:
                                     The Asia Foundation (TAF), Oxfam, International Resource Committee
 Conflict and governance
                                     (IRC), Hope Foundation, Community Development Association (CDA),
 organizations
                                     Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), Joint Peace Fund

3     ETHNIC ARMED ORGANIZATIONS (EAOS)
A key issue that emerged during the kick-off meetings was conflict. Actors in Myanmar’s ongoing
peace processes have identified natural resource revenue sharing and control of natural resources as
key issues. There are more than 20 EAOs, ranging in size from just a few dozen troops up to
approximately 30,000 (TAF, 2014). Several planned HPPs in the Shan Kachin and Kayah States are in
or near contested areas or self-administered zones. The SEA will now include a separate GIS layer for
conflict analysis including; location of EAOs, contested areas, regional autonomous zones and conflict
events.
Additional resources will be provided by IFC to provide conflict advisors to determine how to integrate
conflict into the SEA and to assist in designing and facilitating stakeholder consultations with EAOs in
April and May 2017. The EAOs are an important stakeholder group as they have interests in the control
of natural resources and specifically hydropower development. For example, the Karen National Union
(KNU) has signed agreements to develop HPPs and the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO)
Bukkhaw Power Company operates a HPP that provides electricity to Myitkyina, Kachin state. These
consultations will provide unique insights on planning for hydropower development in contested
areas, including negotiations around benefit sharing and control of natural resources. These
consultations with be confirmed by IFC during the scoping and baseline phase.

4     KEY SEA CONSULTATION EVENTS AND PROCESS
4.1    Inception and scoping
During the initial steps of the scoping and baseline phase, the team will consult with the GOM, IFC and
AG to confirm work plans and discuss the SEA purpose, methodology and tools. At this stage the legal,
institutional and decision-making framework for hydropower, watershed management and other
sectors will be evaluated. This process will assist in identifying sustainable development objectives as



                                                                                                              20

an assessment framework for the SEA by reviewing existing policy, plans and through direct
consultation with GoM.
The influence of government policy and strategy will be examined, including the presidential order
issued on August 12 to form a commission to examine the 6000MW Myitsone hydropower project
and the upper Ayeyarwady Cascade. The SEA team will engage with parliamentarians on key economic
and other committees around hydropower and sustainable development.
4.2    Understanding sustainable development objectives
Influencing decision makers and potentially affected or interested stakeholders starts with
understanding the issues of concern and development priorities. The SEA team with the IFC, AG and
EGs, will seek to improve stakeholder understanding of the range of development priorities of
stakeholders and to gain broad understanding of sustainable development priorities by:
       preparing an overview of key sustainable development priorities of decision makers /
        stakeholders so that these can be debated
       meeting relevant decision makers and stakeholders to present and discuss the different
        priorities
4.3    Identifying key issues and opportunities
One of the key objectives of the scoping and baseline phase is to identify and prioritize a list of key
issues and opportunities that stakeholders consider strategically important for river basin
development and management in Myanmar. The identification of key issues and opportunities will be
stakeholder led. From the initial SEA consultations, it can be anticipated that the issues will relate to
the following strategic themes:
       1.   Social issues, conflict and livelihoods
       2.   Economic development
       3.   Hydropower
       4.   Geomorphology and sediment
       5.   Aquatic ecology and fisheries
       6.   Biodiversity and environmental quality
       7.   Climate change and extreme events
Key issues, opportunities and development objectives will be grouped into strategic themes and
sorted with stakeholders in terms of significant. The issues will be identified through regional river
basin consultations and direct discussions with stakeholders. The multi-stakeholder baseline
workshops will guide stakeholder groups in prioritizing and grouping the key issues.
4.4    Key stakeholder consultation events
The kick-off meetings between the SEA Team, IFC, MOEE, MONREC and other stakeholder groups were
held in Nay Pi Taw on Thursday 6 October 2016. The purpose of this meeting was to present the SEA
process and methodology, work plan and scheduling for the SEA. The key consultations as per the
agreed work plan are outlined in Table 11.

The following sections of the SEP provides a summary of the key stakeholder consultation events to
be carried out under the SEA.
4.4.1 Regional River Basin Consultations
The Ayeyarwady-Chindwin, Thanlwin and Sittaung are classified as the three major river basins in
Myanmar. Also, there are planned and exiting HPPs in the Bago and Myit Ma Hka and Mekong river
basins, and, within the Rakhine (Arakan) and Tanintharyi (Tenasserim) coastal regions.
Initially the regional river basin consultations were planned to be carried out in the Thanlwin and
Sittaung and the Tanintharyi and Rakhine coastal areas due to the significance of planned and existing
HPP and the gaps in data and information. The Bago and Myit Ma Hka and Mekong sub-basins were
not included as the Mekong sub-basins is in conflict areas and the Bago and Myit Ma Hka has only one
existing 20MW project and no planned projects.
Originally, the Ayeyarwady-Chindwin river basin was not included in the regional river basin
consultations as the SEA was intending to utilize the multi-stakeholder platforms and field work as
part of the AIRBM SOBA. However, due to ongoing conflict in Rakhine state and ongoing uncertainty
concerning the SOBA studies start up, the Chindwin Basin was included in the regional river basin
consultations. The revised dates for the planned consultations are provided in Table 12.

The regional river basin consultations will consist of two separate events i) Meetings with region/state
offices of MONREC, MOEE and other ministries, and ii) civil society workshop. The events are planned
to assist the SEA team in compiling E&S data and information from region/state governments and civil
society working at the river basin and state/region level. The purpose of the regional river basin
consultations is to engage stakeholders early in the SEA process to:
       Present the SEA objectives and identify how stakeholder can engage with the process
       Carry out participatory stakeholder mapping and analysis at the river basin level
       Identify key environmental and social (E&S) issues and opportunities
       Group the E&S issues and opportunities into key (or strategic) themes.
The participants will be encouraged to discuss E&S values and uses of the river, and development
issues facing the basin or region. The SEA team will use the ‘affinity diagram’ process which combines
individual/group brainstorming with a structured approach to displaying the ideas/products of the
brainstorming according to common themes. These themes are then used by the Group as a basis for
determining the key E&S values. Groups will then be provided with base maps of the river basin or
region, to draw locations of key areas for biodiversity and livelihoods (




Figure 6).
The results of the maps will then be digitized and with the key findings from the regional river basins
prepared as a separate report. The participants will be asked to record the Top 2 Ways to receive
Information on the SEA from the IFC communication outreach tools. The participant lists from those
meetings will be recorded to ensure that the stakeholders are invited to participated in future multi-

4.4.2 Scoping and Baseline Assessment Workshops
The team will conduct three multi-stakeholder baseline assessment workshops in January and
February 2017:
   National Multi-Stakeholder Workshop: Friday, January 27, 2017 in Yangon
   Ayeyarwady-Chindwin Multi-Stakeholder Workshop: Tuesday, January 31, 2017 in Myitkyina,
    Kachin State
   Thanlwin Multi-Stakeholder Workshop: Friday, February 3, 2017 in Loikaw, Kayah State
All the multi-stakeholder workshops will be inclusive and open for all stakeholders to attend from the
union and sub-national government, international and local NGOs, universities and private sector. The
IFC will advertise the workshops on the SEA website and participants will need to register prior to
attending. The Ayeyarwady-Chindwin and Thanlwin workshops will have more of a regional focus,
however stakeholder groups from Tanintharyi and Sittaung will be invited to attend.
The objectives of the workshops are to:
       Share findings from regional river basin consultations and other stakeholder engagement
        activities
       Present the initial spatial and trend analysis under each of the strategic themes for the SEA
       Identify key issues and opportunities in river basin development
       Set priorities for the key issues and opportunities.
The results of the baseline assessment workshops will be used to update the initial trend and spatial
analysis and to define the indicators and BAU case for the impact assessment phase. A workshop
report will be provided and disseminated to stakeholders for comment.
4.4.3 Local communities affected by existing hydropower development
The consultation with local communities will include villages affected by existing HPP in each of the
major river basins; Ayeyarwady-Chindwin, Sittaung and Thalnwin. These consultations are planned
from January- March 2017 and will likely include the following three projects:

   Shwegyin dam (75MW): Commissioned in 2011 in the Sittaung River Basin, Bago Division
   Balunchaung 1,2, 3 Cascade: Thalnwin River Basin, Kayah State
   Lower Yeywa (790 MW): Commissioned in 2010 in the Ayeyarwady-Chindwin basin, Mandalay
    Region
The SEA team will arrange the Schwegyin and Balachaung cascade visits to coincide with the baseline
assessment workshops in January and February 2017. A separate visit will be arranged in March
2017 to consult with local communities living near the Lower Yeywa dam (



Figure 7). The consultations with one or two villages affected by existing HPP will involve participatory
approaches to identify the changes in water resources, fisheries, land use, ecosystem services and
livelihoods. The consultation will include a discussion with local communities on resettlement,
livelihood restoration and benefit sharing. Aspects of the Gender Impact Assessment (GIA) manual
developed by Oxfam will be integrated into the stakeholder consultation tools recognizing that, in
most cases, it is women and children who are more adversely impacted by dam-induced changes
(Oxfam, 2013).

Consultations with local communities will are an opportunity for ground-truthing the views of local
communities who have been affected by existing HPPs in Myanmar. Results of those consultations will
be captured under the Social/Livelihoods themes of the Impact Assessment Report to identify exposed
populations or those who may be affected by HPPs.
4.4.4 Impact Assessment Stakeholder Workshops
The following outputs: a) Impact Assessment Report and b) Project Sustainability Analysis Report will
provide interim reports for review, with material being used as a basis for stakeholder engagement
and reported in the final SEA. The findings of the E&S sensitivity analysis, categorization of HPPs and
impact assessment of the BAU case will be distilled into the project sustainability analysis report.
The SEA team will conduct a National Impact Assessment workshop in June 2017 in Yangon.
Stakeholder groups will be encouraged to provide comments on the findings and to have a critical role
in framing the sustainable hydropower development pathway based on the impact assessment of the
BAU case. A stakeholder analysis will be prepared by workshop participants to determine who may be
affected by future hydropower development. The project GIS database will be updated and the GIS
layers and maps presented during the stakeholder workshops.
4.4.5 Final Stakeholder Workshops
The mitigation, avoidance and enhancement measures for the sustainable hydropower development
pathway will be incorporated into the Draft Final SEA report for wider stakeholder review and
comment in July 2017. The team will conduct three final Multi-Stakeholder workshops in July 2017 in:
 Mandalay: Regional stakeholders from the Ayeyarwady-Chindwin basin
 Hpa An or Mawlamyine: Regional stakeholders from Thanlwin basin
 Yangon: National level stakeholders and international organisations
The final multi-stakeholder workshops will allow stakeholder groups to review the draft SEA and
provide comments and suggestions through group discussion and activities. A comments and
responses matrix will be prepared to ensure that all comments and suggestions are considered in
preparing the final SEA. This workshop will also identify stakeholder groups who may require
consultation or issues that require further clarification by the SEA team.

5     SPECIAL ADVISORY AND EXPERT GROUPS
The SEA team will interact with key stakeholder groups convened by the IFC including the Advisory
Group (AG), Expert Technical Groups (EG) and the Hydropower Developers’ Working Group as part of
the stakeholder engagement process.
5.1       Advisory Group
The Advisory Group (AG) is a key guiding force in the SEA. It’s role is to:
      1. provide oversight and support to conducting the SEA; and
      2. to lend support in shaping and implementing recommendations of the SEA.
The AG will commence by reviewing and providing advice on the SEA Team’s work and participating
in some SEA consultation activities. A key function of the AG is to ensure that diverse views are
considered during the SEA process.
The AG will be briefed by the SEA consulting team on (i) forthcoming activities and methodologies, (ii)
baseline conditions, and (iii) key findings as they emerge. The AG will provide on-going advice to the
SEA team on their activities, sustainable development objectives and priority setting, available
baseline data and the identification of significant biophysical and socioeconomic values, and
consultation and relationship building. The AG will also review draft SEA reports.
Members: the AG will be chaired by IFC, and consist of 15-18 members. Ideally, each member will
commit to serving at least a one year term when the SEA Report is scheduled to be completed. Senior
representatives will be drawn from a range of stakeholder groups with most based in Myanmar to
facilitate regular interaction.
Separate to the AG, the SEA will organize expert groups (EG) which will draw in additional stakeholders
to provide technical inputs. AG members may have technical staff that can participate in the EGs.
Meetings: The AG will aim to meet quarterly face-to-face and have additional engagements via
conference calls (or other means) as needed between the quarterly meetings.
SEA team input: the SEA team will provide an initial briefing to the AG on the aim and scope of the
SEA and on baseline findings to date. Further presentations to the AG are expected to occur regularly
during the SEA to provide briefings on developments and forthcoming activities. In addition, each draft
report will be provided to the AG for review and comment.
5.2       Expert Groups (EG)
Expert Groups (EG) will be convened during the preparation of the SEA to facilitate discussions on:
          SEA approach and methodology
          available data sources on baseline conditions;
          potential hydropower impacts;
          determination of the significance of key baseline values; and
          review of assessment process and findings.
The EGs will provide an effective mechanism for exploring each significant issue in detail. They provide
an opportunity for consultation with recognized specialists in the main disciplines relating to
sustainable hydropower development. Debate within each EG will be encouraged to determine
significant biophysical and socio-economic values in Myanmar that require protection or controls.
The following six EGs will be formed:
      1. Hydropower and energy
      2. River hydrology and geomorphology


                                                                                                                 28

    3.   Aquatic ecology / fisheries
    4.   Terrestrial ecology, protected areas, forestry
    5.   Social, livelihoods, indigenous peoples, conflict areas, cultural issues
    6.   Economics, river and basin non-hydropower use and development (including navigation,
         irrigation, agriculture, mining)
Members: EG meetings will be convened by IFC. Each EG will consist of around 5-8 members with
recognized specialists in key disciplines invited to join the EG for a 9-10 month period (the life of the
SEA). Members will mainly be drawn from research institutes, NGOs and consultancies.
Meetings: The most critical stage of EG input into the SEA is during (i) the collection of baseline
information, (ii) determination of significant values, and (iii) definition of the desired sustainable
hydropower development pathway, therefore several meetings are expected to occur early to cover
the baseline, then less frequently as the SEA progresses.

6    SEA COMMUNICATION OUTREACH TOOLS
Communication is one of the main components of SEA in its role to engage with stakeholders and to
influence strategic decision processes. Keeping stakeholders informed is important throughout the
process, and especially linked to each stakeholder consultation event.
To ensure that stakeholder group can stay up to-date on events communication outreach tools,
feature stories, podcasts, resources and progress in each step of the SEA implementation are available
online and when appropriate in Myanmar language. The outreach tools include:
    1. SEA Website: A one-stop for all resources and news related to the SEA - Infographic on
       Roadmap (Figure 5); Podcasts; Newsletters; Feature stories resources and key outputs
    2. IFC Hydro Advisory Monthly News: Currently received by 1,500 industry-related subscribers.
       All consultation participants with email access will be subscribed to receive updates on the
       program and the SEA.
    3. Radio: Could be an option to inform communities of the SEA progress and results… nothing
       planned yet, but if there is interest we could explore this.
    4. Podcasts: Like radio, podcasts are longer features on the SEA, but online for free listening in
       English language.
    5. Media: Interviews, op-eds and blogs on the SEA to inform the public on progress.
    6. Video: IFC will document and produce a video on the SEA. But, it will not be finished until
       nearly the end of the study so this is for information on the process after it is finished.
    7. Social Media: Twitter, Instagram, World Bank Myanmar Facebook
The SEA road map is available on IFC’s hydro advisory website to facilitate participation and inform
stakeholders.

Stakeholder groups in the regional river basin consultations were asked to select the top two
communication outreach tools which they considered to be the most effective means of reaching their
constituents. The results of those surveys will be used to inform the overall communications plan and
be presented in report on the findings of the regional river basin consultation.
The SEA team will engage with the IFC outreach tools and provide comment, review and
communication pieces as required.

7    CONCLUSIONS
The SEA is a strategy development planning tool. It needs to be conducted in an efficient way so that
its consultative processes and recommendations remain relevant to and can influence the on-going
decision making process. SEAs take a broad approach in terms of geographic area, the planning
horizons and the scope of planning and policy formulation. There are some 90 planned hydropower
projects of all sizes covering all basins of the country. For that reason, the SEA needs to take a strategic
approach to stakeholder engagement. It will not be possible to consult with all potentially affective
communities and groups.
The SEA will need to reach out to key groups and individuals who have the respect and confidence of
riverine communities. It will need to reach out to representatives of the private sector and to other
concerned segments of society. The approach the SEA is taking is to conduct as many consultative
events as possible in decentralized locations which are a key focus for planned hydropower. It is also
setting up a comprehensive set of linked expert groups which will meet frequently throughout the SEA
process. Those groups alone will involve some 50 individuals from 30 organizations. Other methods
are being adopted to assist groups to review and comment on the SEA findings and conclusions as
they arise - not left to the final stage - so adjustments and new viewpoints can be taken on board.
Particularly important all comments and opinions expressed with be documented and their influence
summarized in a comments and responses matrix which will form part of the various SEA reports as
they are released.
Through those various measures, the SEA will seek to maximize stakeholder involvement in each phase
of the process recognizing it is a strategic tool and will establish the framework and direction for future
more intensive and site specific consultations with a broader range of stakeholders as the basin
development planning process moves forward.
