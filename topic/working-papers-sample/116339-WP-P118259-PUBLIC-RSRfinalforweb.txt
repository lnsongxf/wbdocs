       his 2015–16 Progress Report of the Rapid Social Response Program (RSR)
       summarizes the progress made by the program between January 2014
       and December 2015, i.e., after the period reported on by the 2014 report.
Unless otherwise specified, data and information in tables, figures, and text are
as of December 2015 and cumulative since the beginning of RSR operations in
December 2009. Key facts about RSR accomplishments are presented in table 1
and elaborated on in subsequent sections of this report.



The RSR Today: Where It Stands and Where
It Is Headed
The RSR multidonor program was established in 2009 to help the world’s
poorest countries, in partnership with the World Bank, to build effective social
protection systems. The RSR is supported by the Russian Federation, Norway,
the United Kingdom, Australia, and Sweden.

Since its inception in 2009, the RSR—in addition to becoming a widely recog-
nized brand name associated with SP systems building—has undergone several
transformations, in line with development needs worldwide. Since Phase 1
(2009–12), launched to assist countries in addressing urgent social needs stem-
ming from crises and helping them build the capacity and institutions to better
respond to future crises, the RSR has morphed into Phase 2 (2012 onwards),
which supports the agenda of social protection and labor (SPL) systems building.
Cross-sectoral by nature, the RSR has also managed to move beyond the core
SPL areas to include other priorities that are easily linked to SPL operations,
including gender, nutrition, employment, and—more recently—disaster risk
management.

Today, the RSR is one of the key instruments for implementing the World
Bank’s 2012–2022 Social Protection and Labor Strategy for Resilience, Equity
and Opportunity, mainly in countries eligible for International Development
Association (IDA) support.1 It does so by providing relatively small—compared
to typical IDA/International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
operations—but catalytic funding, averaging $575,457 as of 2015, in support of
social protection agendas worldwide. The RSR has demonstrated time and again
that the grant amounts, albeit modest, can effectively support countries’ efforts
in designing or strengthening their social protection systems. The catalytic nature
of RSR support helps draw in other resources and partners. By 2015, 79 RSR
projects were associated with IDA/IBRD operations, totaling $46 million. RSR
funding has helped leverage $5.68 billion in IDA financing thus far.

Five years after its operationalization, the contributions made by the RSR are
increasingly more visible. Throughout nine selection rounds to date—resulting
in 167 projects in 79 countries worldwide—the RSR has been able to support
the growing social protection agenda as a whole, either through supporting pilot

programs in countries without prior SPL experience; facilitating new dialogues

core components of SPL systems through designing new payment modalities;
creating new targeting mechanisms; strengthening management information

and so on.
    THE WORLD BANK | RAPID SOCIAL RESPONSE PROGRAM


                             The role of the RSR in the SPL sphere continues to be recognized, as was
                             recently done at the Ministerial Roundtable meeting during the World Bank–Inter-
                             national Monetary Fund spring meetings. The Ministerial Roundtable annually
                             convenes high-level representatives (typically ministers of economy and finance,
                             development agency officials, and senior government representatives) for a
                             dialogue on safety nets.

                             As new frontiers emerge in the development arena, the role of social protec-
                             tion is also expected to grow—and new social protection programs will need
                             to respond not only to shocks originating within the economy, but also to
                             outside shocks such as climate change, natural disasters, and displacements.
                             While social protection programs are now technically present in every low- and
                             middle-income country worldwide, coverage remains insufficient—particularly
                             in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which house most of the world’s poor.
                             At the same time, the severity and frequency of natural disasters is increasing,
                             reversing years of development gains. Natural disasters and human-made crises
                             have the potential to create a new layer of transient poor; these usually dispro-
                             portionately affect the chronic poor, who are less able to respond to such shocks.
                             Against this evolving backdrop, there is an increasing need worldwide to continue
                             building on linkages between social protection, disaster risk management, and
                             climate change adaptation measures.

                             Going forward, the RSR too will need to adapt and take on a greater role in
4                            SPL-related developments. While maintaining the core objective of increasing
                             SPL coverage in the poorest and most vulnerable countries, the RSR portfolio
                             will have to include activities that help social protection programs become more
                             adaptive, scalable, and sufficiently flexible to respond to natural disasters and
                             human-made crises.



                             P H A S E 1: C ATA LY T I C , C R I S I S R E S P O N S E
                             Originally, from its operationalization in 2009 until 2012, RSR’s main mandate
                             was to help low-income countries cope with major crises such as the food, fuel,
                             and financial crises of 2008–10. Support was earmarked solely for IDA-eligible
                             countries to protect the postcrisis poor populations of the most severely affected
                             countries.

                             Although the amounts granted from the RSR were nominal in comparison
                             to countries’ needs, this seed money provided critical support in the form of
                             services and in-kind benefits to vulnerable and poor populations. Some of the
                             pilot programs supported by the RSR led to full-fledged IDA operations as in
                             Cameroon, Mozambique, and Rwanda. This initial phase also positioned the RSR
                             high in the social protection agenda, which allowed it to then move into new and
                             more forward-looking spheres. A total of 80 activities were supported during this
                             phase, with $60.8 million of programmable resources.

PHASE 2: SPL SYSTEMS ORIENTED
Following its successful and effective
Phase 1, the RSR evolved into its second
phase, with a strong focus on social protec-
tion systems building and strengthening. In
the fall of 2012, the RSR donors approved
a five-year extension of the program from
June 2013 to June 2018.2 This new man-
date—which marked the official inception
of the new phase—was a response to
the World Bank’s new 2012–2022 Social
Protection and Labor Strategy for Resil-
ience, Equity and Opportunity (World Bank
2012), which called for the RSR’s continu-
ous involvement in supporting low-income
countries as well as global knowledge
sharing on SPL systems through support of
South-South learning forums and commu-
nities of practice.

The donors agreed on several aspects of
the RSR business model and a results framework, while the focus on low-in-
come countries in establishing or strengthening their core social protection
                                                                                                                              5
systems remained unchanged. RSR support continued to be provided to activ-
ities in IDA-eligible countries for new or improved SPL system components,
platforms, and architecture for a specific country or countries (Theme 1) and
to protect access to basic services in times of crisis for a specific country or
countries (Theme 3). However, in contrast to the first phase, the inclusion
of IBRD countries was made possible under a new theme, Theme 2, which
encourages knowledge sharing across development levels so as to further boost
social protection system agendas. In cumulative terms, Phase 2 expanded the
RSR portfolio to include 62 countries and 131 total projects altogether (excluding
regional activities).

During Phase 2, an important subtheme emerged under Theme 2, with a par-
ticular focus on providing nutrition benefits—particularly for young children and
pregnant/lactating mothers. A nutrition-sensitive RSR trust fund was therefore
established under the RSR umbrella (see discussion under “Special Channels”
later in this report).

Overall, the new programmable resources and new mandate allowed the RSR to
boost SPL presence in the broader development agenda and increase the World
Bank’s engagement in low-income countries, thereby focusing both the national
and international SPL agendas away from stand-alone projects and toward sys-
tems building.

                                             Social Protection and Labor RSR Multi-Donor Trust Fund (RSR-NS). In 2014/15,
                                             four countries benefited from RSR-NS grants, with projects designed to improve
                                             the delivery of nutrition services. The activities addressed nutrition either as part
                                             of a cash transfer conditionality, interventions to improve MIS, policy dialogues,
                                             or capacity-building initiatives. RSR-NS grants are able to support both the RSR

                                             interlinkages between safety nets and nutrition. Such support makes sense, as
                                             nutrition remains at the core of safety nets, whether delivered as part of in-kind
                                             transfers or via training to beneficiaries of cash transfers (see discussion under

WHAT’S NE X T?
Over the past six years, the RSR has made a lasting imprint on SPL, as well as
on broader development agendas, and transformed itself in response to the
development trends and needs of countries worldwide. Nevertheless, much
work remains to be done.

•	 SPL coverage has increased, but is still not high enough, particularly in
  low-income countries. While funding from the RSR and its catalytic effect
  on IDA operations have helped reach over 72 million people worldwide, most
  poor people still do not have access to social protection—especially in low-in-
  come countries. As of 2015, only one in five people receives any SPL benefits
  in low-income countries. The gap is more acute in Sub-Saharan Africa and
  South Asia (World Bank 2015).

•	 Client interest in adaptive social protection is increasing. Support from
  the RSR has helped build and strengthen crucial SPL programs and systems.
  Many of the activities have long-term goals which will need follow-up, and
  there are still many countries that could utilize the RSR to leverage IDA financ-
  ing. Many IBRD countries, too—through collaboration with the GFDRR—
  would benefit from building or strengthening their adaptive SPL systems.

•	 The RSR experience and the momentum created through its operations
  and partnerships with the German Agency for International Cooper-
  ation (GIZ; for knowledge exchange), and the GFDRR (for disaster-re-
                                                                                                                       7
  sponsive safety nets) could open the door to more forward-looking
  agendas. As echoed at the Ministerial Roundtable meeting during the World
  Bank–International Monetary Fund spring meetings in April 2016—and evi-
  dent from changing dynamics worldwide—there is indeed a need to continue
  building on linkages between safety nets, disaster risk management, and cli-
  mate change adaptation measures in both low- and middle-income countries
  by supporting programs as well as knowledge exchange.

•	 With new frontiers in the development agenda, there are also new
  opportunities for SPL and RSR involvement. The urbanizing world, waves
  of migration within and across national borders, and fragile and conflict situa-
  tions are among
  the challenges
  that could be
  turned into
  opportunities for
  involvement of
  the RSR. The new
  RSR paradigm can
  be one of charting
  new development
  agendas, and
  new pathways
  for experimenting
  and learning.

                             LESSONS LEARNED
                             The RSR systems-building agenda has helped develop concrete results,
                             and facilitated tangible country outputs and outcomes. To date, the RSR
                             supports 167 activities in 79 countries worldwide, reaching over 72 million
                             people. RSR catalytic funding has enabled new activities in countries without
                             SPL support before; and for those countries with existing support, it has enabled
                             continued engagement. Nevertheless, there is still much to be learned from
                             ongoing operations. One of the areas where improvement is needed is extension
                             of closing dates for projects. To date, 116 activities have requested an extension
                             of closing dates, with an average of 251 days per project.

                             The RSR remains influential and continues to serve its catalytic purpose
                             in building and strengthening SPL systems in low-income countries. An
                             increasing number of countries are realizing that the value added of RSR-sup-
                             ported SPL systems can be much greater than had been anticipated in their initial
                             expressions of interest. Several countries in the South Asia region that received
                             RSR support for their SPL activities were able to apply their RSR-supported SPL
                             systems well beyond the intended scope. For instance, Bangladesh piloted a
                             new government-to-person payment mechanism for its public works program;
                             this RSR-supported activity, Improving the Payment and Monitoring System for
                             the Employment Generation Program for the Poorest, complemented a $150 mil-
                             lion IDA initiative. Although this was not originally intended, the payment mecha-
                             nism was then applied to the design of a new conditional cash transfer program,
8
                             the Income Support Program for the Poorest (see discussion under Theme 1).
                             Similarly, in Nepal, the RSR-funded social protection pilot program established
                             an MIS and a new payment mechanism which will be utilized by a broader set
                             of social welfare programs, making the value added of the established systems
                             much greater than anticipated. These spillover effects underscore the need for
                             continued RSR support going forward.

                             Due to RSR support, new dialogues emerged with countries without prior
                             SPL experience. The RSR is overwhelmingly credited with building trust with
                             government counterparts, allowing for international best practices to be shared
                             and implemented, and for SPL programs and systems to eventually be built.

                             Knowledge sharing has been widely popular and well accepted by govern-
                             ment counterparts, increasing the visibility of the RSR in low- and middle-
                             income countries. The most recent South-South Learning Forum held—in
                             partnership with the GIZ— in November 2015 in Beijing, as well as several work-
                             shops on coherent pension policy and improved pension delivery in Africa and
                             the establishment of regional communities of practice on cash transfer programs,
                             have made policy makers and practitioners increasingly receptive to building
                             or strengthening SPL systems. Continuous efforts in such knowledge-sharing
                             activities will allow for more IDA and IBRD country exchanges and innovation in
                             SPL programming.

Summary Accomplishments
The RSR continues to be a highly popular and influential program. While
staying true to its core purpose of supporting SPL systems building, the RSR has
branched out to include nutrition-sensitive social protection, disaster-responsive
social protection, and to support the ongoing urban social safety net agenda
through knowledge exchange and learning events.

Since becoming operational in December 2009, the RSR has received a total
of 349 expressions of interest and approved a total of 167 activities worldwide,
amounting to $88.7 million. During Round 9, a total of $5.6 million was allocated
to 14 activities, including nutrition-sensitive and disaster-responsive social protec-
tion. The overall approval rate for expressions of interest submitted is 47.9 per-
cent, with 35.2 percent of the funds requested actually being granted (table 2).

The program is reaching an increasing number of countries every round,
with the majority still low-income countries, mainly in the Africa region.
Excluding global and regional projects that encompass more than one coun-
try, the RSR has supported technical assistance—as well as small-scale pilot
projects—in a total of 79 countries. Table 3 lists the countries that have received
RSR support thus far. During calendar year 2015, several new countries were
added to the pool of RSR support, including Armenia, Botswana, Ecuador, Fiji,
Jamaica, Mexico, the Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Tonga, Uzbekistan, and
Vanuatu. Later, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, Sudan, and Vietnam were added to the
                                                                                                                            9
list of supported countries.

RSR support has reached most IDA countries. In line with the overarching
objective of increasing SPL coverage and supporting IDA-eligible countries in
improving or building their SPL systems, the RSR continues to be successful
in targeting and assisting IDA countries worldwide. As previously mentioned,
the number of countries in the RSR portfolio gives a clear picture of how the
RSR has been expanding and how it has kept true to its fundamental objectives.
Moreover, IDA eligibility is in fact the necessary criterion for receiving direct
assistance from the RSR’s original financial instruments—the RSR Catalyst Trust
Fund and the RSR Multi-Donor Trust Fund. Middle-income countries that are
IBRD eligible can be included under RSR-financed projects whose objectives are

      Box 2: RSR’s Thematic Typology

      Theme 1: New or improved SPL system components, platforms and architecture for a specific country or
      countries

      a.	 Systems diagnostics, analysis and stock taking

         1.	 Diagnostic studies, stock taking notes and mapping of SPL programs, beneficiaries, or data collection practices

         2.	 Identification or development of effective options by comparing the existing programs, their performance,
            cost-efficiency with programs in similar circumstances in other countries

      b.	 Specific elements of system components, platforms and architecture, including:

         1.	 Building systems for robust identification of beneficiaries and development of registries
         2.	 Improving processes for determination of eligibility
         3.	 Developing effective appeals and grievances procedures
         4.	 Streamlining payment systems to minimize the risk for error fraud and corruption and increase efficiency
         5.	 Setting up appropriate evaluation arrangements
         6.	 Establishing practices for communication and outreach
         7.	 Building information systems for better service management
         8.	 Improving administrative processes and clarifying rules

      c.	 Interministerial program harmonization of policies, programs and administrative arrangements

12       1.	 Coordination of legal and policy level frameworks

         2.	 Integration of individual programs into coordinated, national systems through harmonization and use of common
            components, platforms, or architecture (from the list b.1–8 above)

      Theme 2: Increased cross-national learning and knowledge-sharing for SPL service delivery

      •	 South-South and peer-to-peer learning
      •	 Communities of practice
      •	 Analytical and operational toolkit

      Theme 3: Protection of access to basic services in times of crisis for a specific country or countries

      •	 Provision of nutrition benefits—particularly for young children and pregnant/lactating mothers

      •	 Provision of other forms of social assistance benefits—cash transfers (conditional and unconditional), in-kind
         transfers, public works, waivers for school fees and health costs, protection of particularly vulnerable groups (e.g.
         protection from gender-based violence) and required administrative support
                                                                                       P ROGRE S S RE P OR T 2015 –16


As of December 2015, the cumulative count of projects and resources allocated
for Theme 2: Increased cross-national learning and knowledge-sharing for
SPL service delivery, were 32 and $8.1 million, respectively. Since the last prog-
ress report, the share of Theme 2 in terms of resources allocated has risen from
8.2 percent to 9.2 percent in the portfolio, while the number of Theme 2 projects
increased marginally.

The number of projects and the share of resources dedicated to Theme 3: Pro-
tection of access to basic services in times of crisis for a specific country
or countries did not increase since the last reporting period, remaining at 18 and
$14.6 million, respectively. Theme 3 activities are recipient-executed emergency
projects that actually distribute cash/in-kind benefits to poor and vulnerable popu-
lations to mitigate the severe impact of major crises. For this reason, expressions
of interest that include Theme 3 activities are not approved unless the application
of World Bank Operational Policy 8.00, Rapid Response to Crises and Emergen-
cies, has been declared for the intended beneficiary country (see further discus-
sion of this point in the financial section). Because Themes 1 and 2 grew both in
terms of project count and resource allocation, the relative size of Theme 3 as a
share of all RSR support decreased from 11.5 percent to 9.3 percent, and 19.5
percent to 16.5 percent, respectively.



Association with IDA and Other Financial
Products of the World Bank Group                                                                                        13
By the end of calendar year 2015, the RSR had received $101.2 million program-
mable resources from its five donors—the Russian Federation, Norway, the
United Kingdom, Australia, and Sweden (table 4). Of that amount, about $46 mil-
lion was associated with large-scale national programs/projects supported by
World Bank operations—that is, IBRD loans, IDA credits/grants, or trust funds
other than the RSR.

The Bank operations together provided client national governments with
$5.68 billion in IDA credit/grants ($1.5 billion increase from last reporting),
$50 million in IBRD loans; $455 million in trust fund resources ($253 million
increase from last reporting). The cumulative total financing from Bank operations
reached $6.18 billion. The client governments mobilized $6.8 billion in total.

In terms of association ratios, every dollar of programmable RSR
resources is associated with $56.10 of IDA financing. If we only include the
RSR financing of those projects that are directly associated with Bank operations,
the figure increases to $123.40. If the total financing through the World Bank
Group—as well as national financing—is taken into account in the numerator, the
ratio rises to $283.75 per dollar of RSR financing.

During the calendar years 2014 and 2015, the Bank approved 17 SPL operations
for total IDA financing of $996 million. Associated national government counter-
part financing is estimated to be $622 million (table 5).

     NOTE: WBG = World Bank Group. Note that the IDA figures were dominated by a single country (Bangladesh). IDA is the sole financier
     for most projects, with the following notable exceptions: IDA provides 18 percent ($500 million) of the total cost of Bangladesh’s Safety
     Net Systems for the Poorest Project (P132634; July 2013); the rest ($2.2 billion) comes from the government. IDA provides 75 percent
     ($300 million) of support to Nigeria’s Youth Employment and Social Support Operation (P126964; March 2013); the remaining $100 million
     is provided by the government. And for Tanzania Productive Social Safety Net (P124045; March 2012), is funded by IDA ($220 million), the
     government ($4 million), U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) ($16 million) and Spain ($0.9 million).

                                              The RSR results chain is simple and straightforward. First, the RSR provides a
                                              small amount of funding to facilitate SPL system building and strengthening of
                                              activities in IDA-eligible countries. Then, many of those efforts mobilize and facil-
                                              itate the preparation of a full-fledged IDA-funded project. Finally, the IDA project
                                              provides the needed SPL coverage (figure 5).

                                              ability to better inform SPL policies and programs. Its portal (http://datatopics.
                                              worldbank.org/aspire/) generates harmonized indicators to assess performance
                                              of social assistance, social insurance, and labor market programs based on
                                              nationally representative household survey data. Most indicators are estimated
                                              by program type, for the entire population and by quintiles, of both pre- and

          n the following pages, we highlight 16 RSR activities implemented in
          recent years. Most of these are under Themes 1 and 2 (see theme
          descriptions below); we also discuss some special channel activities.
Some grants approved in recent selection rounds support activities that build on
previously financed RSR activities and achievements. This is the case for several of
the projects profiled in this section.


Theme 1: Support to New and Improved
Social Protection and Labor Systems
Coordinated SPL systems bolster people and help economies grow. RSR
helps to build critical parts of such systems through policy dialogue and
technical assistance, and by providing the analytical work that helps the
systems run efficiently and cost-effectively. RSR projects mobilize larger
resources from IDA as well as other sources to complete the system-
building work and help governments operate the systems to expand social
protection coverage.


Theme 2: Increased Learning and Knowledge
Sharing for Social Protection Service Delivery
RSR raises awareness on how to increase coverage of social protection
in low-income countries through South-South learning initiatives and
the development of communities of practice. RSR also helps to create
new diagnostic techniques that can benefit individual countries or have
a global impact on social safety net systems and poor people’s access to
basic services.


Theme 3: Protecting Access to Basic Services
to the Most Vulnerable in Times of Crisis
As crises hit and threaten livelihoods and human capital, RSR’s emergency
window for limited-scale delivery of SPL benefits and services can be
opened to prevent irreversible harm to the most vulnerable populations.
RSR projects help to provide nutrition benefits, particularly to young
children and their mothers, waivers for school fees and health services,
and the required administrative support for efficient service delivery.

                               As Afghanistan experiences growing fragility and vulnerability, the RSR
                               is helping generate evidence-based guidance to support the development
                               of social protection policies that strengthen the safety net and increase
                               the social protection coverage of the poor. By providing an assessment of
                               the feasibility of employment generation programs, as well as options for
                               an affordable mix of safety net programs, policy recommendations will

                               CHALLENGE
                               More than one-third of the Afghan population is chronically poor, and almost an
                               equal amount is food insecure with a high propensity to external shocks. Job

$370,000                       and implemented by development partners and nongovernmental organizations.
                               Combined, these programs only reach up to 25 percent of the chronically poor
                               population. Development partners are revising their priorities and reducing the
                               scope of their programs in light of security constraints, creating another coverage
                               gap in the already fragmented social safety net arena.



                               APPROACH
                               Determining the best mix of interventions to support the chronically poor and
                               vulnerable populations in the Afghan context is challenging. Labor-intensive
                               public works, as a scalable safety net option, are adequate given the postconflict
     context. Public works programs have the potential to mitigate seasonal shocks
     and strengthen social cohesion. However, there have been concerns regarding
     organizational capacity at the local level, governance issues, and timing conflicts
     given the livelihoods calendar in certain regions of Afghanistan.

     Responding to the limited information available to inform policy decisions,
     the RSR supported publication of a policy note. The policy note draws on two
     assessment reports—one that delves into the potential and feasibility of scal-
     able employment generation programs, and a second that proposes options for
     an effective mix of safety net programs. The note identifies policy priorities to
     strengthen the safety net and increase the social protection coverage of the poor.



     ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND RE SULTS
     •	 Stocktaking on existing evidence on safety nets has been completed, with a
        special focus on labor-intensive public works and targeted cash transfers. The
        analysis found that the impacts of public works on consumption, recovery
        from shocks, and coping mechanisms are mixed. Evidence on the impacts of
        cash transfers is scant, but positive impacts on household spending patterns
        has been observed. The findings suggest that focusing on building a targeting
        system rather than on seeking short-term solutions is more effective and not
        costly.

22   •	 The RSR grant supported the completion of a policy note informed by two
        assessments. Policy recommendations suggest prioritizing the use of scarce
        resources and achieving efficient targeting to improve the coverage and resil-
        ience of the poorest and most vulnerable, and to introduce a predictable cash
        transfer that coexists with humanitarian assistance.

                                         RSR funds are playing a catalytic role in finding alternative and effective
                                         ways to reach the poor in both urban and rural areas. Continuous support

                                      bility of building a comprehensive social protection system.
     APPROACH
     Focusing only on the success of a pilot program is not enough to ensure long-
     term sustainability and scalability. In line with the government’s strategy, the RSR
     is providing support for those elements of social protection systems that allow
     increasing coverage to potentially reach all vulnerable populations.

     A variety of elements need to be set up, and tested or strengthened during pilot
     implementation. RSR funds are supporting technical assistance to accompany the
28   cash transfer pilot funded by AusAID. These elements include guidance on innova-
     tive implementation approaches, information management systems, and updates
     to registration systems. Lessons for a wider selection of programs (not limited to
     cash transfers) and initial data on delivery performance will be available through
     an RSR-funded monitoring and evaluation system. This information will be used to
     inform policy discussion to improve donor coordination.

                               mechanisms for informal workers and other mobile populations in urban areas. In
                               coordination with state governments, they administer a number of pension pro-
                               grams, whose performance has been constrained by ill-defined implementation
     procedures, coverage lags, and unintentional limits to program entry, as well as
     many challenges impeding service delivery. The ministry is particularly interested
     in strengthening existing operational tools and broadening coverage of its Worker
     Welfare Funds and the National Pension Scheme. At present, Worker Welfare
     Funds are used to target and provide social protection to workers in the informal
     economy, but the extent of their performance—and the impact on the welfare
     of informal workers—is unknown. These funds are financed through a general
     tax on industries in which informal workers operate. The boards of these funds
     then register beneficiaries and bring them under cover for pensions and health
     insurance, and scholarships for children.

     The RSR is helping assess social protection delivery to informal workers across
     the urban spectrum. This assessment will provide benchmarks on performance
     and tools currently in use by the Worker Welfare Funds, and determine the
     specific needs and vulnerabilities of the urban population these are intended to
     assist. The assessment will inform the design of future urban policies, as well
     as program reforms. To ensure that proposed administrative reforms are sustain-
     able, replicable, and scalable, proposed identification, registration, and application
     processes, as well as payment delivery systems, are being piloted.



     ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND RE SULTS
     •	 A systematic analysis has been completed, which identifies bottlenecks faced
34
        by potential beneficiaries as they try to access available social protection plat-
        forms. Findings show high transaction costs for an informal worker, as there is
        a cumbersome application process and paperwork requirements. Such imped-
        iments may be excluding the most vulnerable and poorest populations.

     •	 The analytic work suggests that the performance of the Worker Welfare
        boards has been poor. Currently, a large share of the funds remain unused; in
        2013, 87 percent of funds were not utilized.

     •	 An assessment of the specific needs and vulnerabilities of populations in
        Delhi, urban Himachal Pradesh, and urban Odisha is under way. Data collec-
        tion will be completed later this year.

     •	 The implementation arrangements used by the pension schemes have been
        reviewed, and various areas identified for increased coordination and coopera-
        tion between the Pension Fund Regulatory Authority and other pension sector
        stakeholders.

     •	 Initial reports on benchmarking business processes have been completed.
        The findings highlight recommendations to improve enrollment procedures;
        these are being field tested in Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, and Odisha. The
        series of pilots is meant to identify a replicable strategy for voluntary coverage
        among specific categories of unorganized workers.

     •	 Pilots and concurrent evaluations are ongoing and are expected to provide the
        necessary confidence in the proposed strategy to improve coverage. Reports
        and results will be available in early 2017.

                                           As Myanmar emerges from decades of isolation, the RSR is helping
                                           generate evidence-based guidance and decision making in the social
                                           protection sphere, as well as weave new relationships with development
                                           partners. An RSR-supported policy dialogue has led both to a new social
                                           protection strategy and to needed improvements in implementing
                                           capacity to carry out reform.

                                           Myanmar households are vulnerable to both economic and natural disaster
                                           risks, proper programs for coping with these risks are lacking. Nearly all poor
                                           households are excluded from social protection coverage, and rely on commu-

                                           social protection also remains very low, at 0.57 percent of gross domestic prod-
                                           uct (GDP); and social assistance expenditures only account for 0.02 percent of
                                           GDP—well below the 1–2 percent average in much of East and South Asia, and
                                           even in poorer Sub-Saharan African countries. Meanwhile, civil service pensions
                                           and social security, which mainly benefit the more privileged segments of the
     population, account for 0.55 percent of GDP. Developing the necessary building
     blocks of a social protection system in Myanmar requires gradual strengthening
     of institutional capacity while ensuring fiscal sustainability.



     APPROACH
     The government of Myanmar has laid out an ambitious reform agenda and
     called for an inclusive and comprehensive social protection system. The recently
     approved Rural Development Strategic Framework and the Social Protection Stra-
     tegic Plan have helped put social protection and social assistance on the poverty
     agenda. RSR support is aimed at smoothing the transition from sporadic and
     fragmented donor programs to a more government-led approach and system.
     Building on the new reform momentum, RSR funds will help the government
     generate more and better information and an evidence base to drive policies and
     develop appropriate mechanisms of reaching the poor and vulnerable.

     Through a social protection assessment, RSR technical assistance and analytical
     work have established a comprehensive understanding of the nature of social
     protection. The assessment identified existing social protection schemes, gaps
     in programs and coverage, and the actors involved; it also helped in formulating a
     strategic direction for the sector as a whole. Further, the assessment found that
     the best way to target beneficiaries was in phases, as capacity for implementation
     could then be developed simultaneously. The assessment identified communi-
36
     ty-driven development platforms as a viable vehicle for social protection delivery.

     RSR funding supported the participation of several government officials in learn-
     ing events and workshops. Exposure to international best practices will help build
     capacity as well as foster greater interaction and more engagement with devel-
     opment partners on the ground.



     ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND RE SULTS
     •	 RSR support created new and essential knowledge through a comprehen-
        sive social protection assessment documented in a series of technical notes.
        These, together with several technical workshops, have helped shape the
        government’s new social protection strategic plan, and have informed reform
        of the social security and pension systems as well as implementation of the
        Rural Development Strategic Framework.

     •	 Knowledge sharing has been facilitated between the World Bank and the ILO,
        an initiative that also led to increased agency coordination and less duplication
        of effort.

     •	 Partnership and cooperation among the ILO, the WFP, and other nongovern-
        mental organizations on the ground have been strengthened. The resulting
        technical discussions and joint collaboration helped inform the national dialogue.

                                        APPROACH
                                        The RSR contributed to developing, testing, and implementing the operational
                                        tools necessary to sustain the expansion of the PSSN to reach 1.2 million
                                      households. A comprehensive assessment was carried out after an initial round
                                      of household identification to inform the rest of the scale-up. This was followed
                                      by laying out a strategy for the use of information, communications, and technol-
                                      ogy (ICT) in the Tanzanian context.

                                      The grant also allowed for enhancement of key operational tools, including the
                                      MIS, the single registry of beneficiaries, and a formal payment system. Such
                                      enhancements ensured that, among other considerations, the MIS collects
                                      timely information on beneficiary compliance. One of the biggest challenges the
                                      government faced in the PSSN expansion was collecting information for targeting
                                      and the registry. Technical assistance played a pivotal role in the design of a new
                                      targeting mechanism that uses a proxy means test. Lastly, a plan for a payment

     and programmatic gaps, as well as areas to improve coordination, consolidation,
     and expansion as a basis for building a social protection system. Additionally, it
     includes considerations for labor programs and the role of social security and

                               Years of isolation from the international community have led to limited aid avail-
                               ability, a lack of exposure to international best practices, and a damaging build-up
                               of arrears with multilateral organizations. Nevertheless, with its vast natural
                               resources and existing public infrastructure, the country has the potential to sus-
                               tain growth and reduce poverty; realizing this potential will require a revival of its
                               institutions, critical improvements in service delivery, and meaningful economic
                               reforms.
     APPROACH
     The government of Zimbabwe has shown a strong commitment to developing a
     national social protection strategy—and, through that, to improve and redesign
     its social protection system. To date, it has completed several policy frameworks
     to guide the design and implementation of such a system. But building a robust
     and sustainable one out of existing programs requires a harmonized and reliable
     targeting mechanism to identify the poorest and those most in need.

     Technical assistance offered through RSR funding is supporting the government in
     the revival of its social protection system. Notably, it is buoying government efforts
44   to develop a social protection strategy and create a harmonized targeting system
     and beneficiary registry for the country’s main social safety net programs. These
     initiatives will lead to a more effective safety net system by eliminating duplication
     and ensuring a higher optimization of benefits to the poorest.

     The RSR will also help introduce international best practices to the social protec-
     tion arena in Zimbabwe, and help the government make the best decisions for
     programs and systems going forward.



     ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND RE SULTS
     •	 RSR funds helped prepare a National Social Protection Policy Framework, which
        will serve as the backbone for the upcoming social protection strategy and help
        bring coherence to the sector. The framework note will provide guidance to
        targeting and program harmonization, as well as to overall systems building.

     •	 Financing from the RSR helped the Ministry of Public Service, Labor and
        Social Welfare review the existing targeting mechanism in place for the Basic
        Education Assistance Module (BEAM) and align it with the Harmonized Cash
        Transfer Program in order to improve effectiveness. An operations manual for
        BEAM has been finalized.

     •	 The RSR is supporting the government in improving and integrating its MISs
        and beneficiary database, so as to harmonize programs under one umbrella
        system.

                                      order to unlock the full potential of the learning space, the forum’s scope needed
                                      to be widened to specifically include experiences in francophone contexts.



                                      APPROACH
                                      Following requests from several countries in West and Central Africa for an
                                      exchange platform in French, a francophone group was launched with support
                                      from the RSR by mid-2013. Since then, more countries have expressed an
     interest in joining the group; the addition of Burundi and Comoros brings the cur-
48
     rent total to 18 member countries.

     The RSR grant provides continuing support to the francophone Sub-Saharan
     Africa CoP on cash transfer and conditional cash transfer programs. During this
     second phase, the grant will allow access to a wider range of tools and literature
     in French to fill a wide information gap identified during the first year of the CoP.
     It will also allow for increased face-to-face events, as well as bilateral interactions
     for in-depth technical and operation-specific discussions.



     ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND RE SULTS
     •	 The CoP has been accommodating new countries, and membership has
        increased from 11 countries to 18.

     •	 Six videoconferences, two bilateral meetings, and seven face-to-face meet-
        ings have been held—the most recent in May 2016 in Brazzaville, Republic of
        Congo.

     •	 The platform is continuously populated to facilitate country knowledge sharing
        of experiences.

     •	 A few videos have been developed explaining how the CoP works and the
        benefits of joining, gathering experiences from a face-to-face meeting in
        Niger. A forthcoming video, developed during the latest meeting in the Repub-
        lic of Congo, shows examples of rich discussions on intersectoral aspects.

INCREASED LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE SHARING FOR SOCIAL PROTECTION SERVICE DELIVERY




THE RSR AND SOUTH-SOUTH LEARNING
In November 2015, the RSR supported the 6th South-South Learning
Forum, Emerging Social Protection Systems in an Urbanizing World, in
Beijing. The forum was a landmark event, convening more than 250 policy
makers from 75 countries to discuss, share, and learn from emerging
knowledge and practical innovations in the as-yet underexplored area of
social protection in urban areas.



CHALLENGE
Today, worldwide, roughly 54 percent of the population lives in urban areas.
Urbanization is a growing phenomenon, and developing at a growing rate, which            49
brings forth both opportunities and challenges for development—in particular,
protection of the poorest. While it is true that global poverty is declining, with the
new urbanization trend, poverty challenges may be increasing in urbanized areas.

Having more than 180,000 people move to urban areas globally requires shifts
in thinking and policy making. Such demographic swings test social protection
systems—even more so in disaster-prone areas. While cities can provide more
opportunities for human development, such influxes can strain existing systems
(higher demand for jobs, housing, and services). Against this backdrop, social
protection systems—and social safety nets in particular—can play a crucial, stra-
tegic role in identifying and supporting the urban poor. These provide a much-
needed platform to reach those most in need, as well as linking them to jobs and
services. The new urban agenda will also serve as an important pillar in activities
related to fragility and disaster risk management.



APPROACH
The South-South Learning Forum was co-hosted by the World Bank Group and
the government of China, specifically the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of
Finance, and the Beijing municipal government. Crucial support was provided by
the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)
and the GIZ.
     Why China?

     •	 China represents the world’s largest developing country with 1.3 billion people. Much of the world’s population
        growth will occur here—as will most of the world’s poverty.

     •	 Unlike other experiences in SPL worldwide, China scaled up from urban to rural.

     •	 Despite its enormous size, China has managed to develop a comprehensive social protection system for urban
        dwellers, including a minimum living wage guarantee; support for the extreme poor; postdisaster assistance;
        and medical, education, housing, and employment support. Seventy million people are covered by a range of
        such SPL instruments, countrywide.

     •	 China has made great progress in delivering safety nets to the poorest in urban areas in a rapidly transforming
        context. As such, it was the perfect location for learning how to design and implement such SPL systems, with
        a particular focus on the Dibao Safety Net Program.




                                         This forum provided a much-needed platform to share cross-country experiences
                                         and expand the dialogue on how to effectively deliver SPL services in a rapidly
                                         urbanizing context. Special emphasis was placed on operationalizing safety net
                                         programs and adapting them to these evolving issues. The mix of countries
                                         attending the event represented an array across the development spectrum—
                                         with diverse urbanization contexts and different state capacities—allowing for
                                         practical, real-world exchanges.

Thoughts on the Forum from Participating Ministers

•	 “This forum is very timely, with a topic that will affect everyone going forward, even though our poverty is con-
   centrated in rural areas. The Benazir Income Support Program in Pakistan built a well-known ID system, and
   we hope this experience can be transferred to the countries we collaborated with during this event, and that
   their urbanized experiences can help us in our efforts, too.” —Marvi Memon, Minister of State and Chairper-
   son of the Benazir Income Support Program, Pakistan

•	 “China’s experience is very interesting, as they scaled up in the opposite manner from most of us—from urban
   to rural. There is much to be learned, as our country continues to tailor programs to the urban agenda with
   a strong focus on resilience.” —Mekuria Haile Teklemariam, Minister of Urban Development and Housing,
   Ethiopia

•	 “This forum highlighted the dire challenges of urbanization, and we all have better ideas on how to prepare
   going forward. Lesotho has benefited from many other country experiences in shaping our social protection
   agenda, and now we’re also able to give advice thanks to this forum.” —Molahlahi Letlotlo, Minister of Social
   Development, Lesotho

•	 “Ideas, strategic decisions, what worked and what hasn’t, were all explored. As Nigeria is trying to put all
   social safety nets on one platform, the forum has helped us understand that the urban context needs to be
   part of the system as well going forward. It will help us the make right decisions.” —Maryam Uwais, Adviser
   to the Vice President, Nigeria

•	 “Social politics tends to be challenging regardless of the level of development. As we all experience new global
   urban challenges, it’s important to share experiences. We have different cultural, economic, and historical plat-
   forms, but the challenges are similar.” —David Sergeenko, Minister of Labour, Health and Social Affairs, Georgia

TRENDS IN NATURAL DISASTERS
Natural disasters are becoming more frequent and severe, and they
are affecting more people. When natural disasters strike, they ruin lives. In
rapid-onset, sudden disasters like super-typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines in
2013 or the 2015 earthquake in Nepal, a person’s house, livelihood, and assets
may be washed away or crumble in an instant. These tragic events often scar
people psychologically through bereavement and shock, and can leave others           55
physically disabled. They can fracture and displace entire communities, sever-
ing social and familial bonds and reversing years of investment in community
facilities, infrastructure, schools, and hospitals. Slow-onset, creeping disasters
like the 2011 drought in the Horn of Africa can be just as ruinous, making food
scarce in countries where many may already be food poor and leading—in the
worst instances—to
famine and starvation.

                                                           At this juncture, social protection can help meet the needs of
                                                           affected people through myriad interventions that center on

                                        the delivery of such services in response to disasters is characterized by ad hoc
                                        programs hastily established after a disaster. Implemented in this fashion, such
                                        programs can take time to be delivered, be lacking in transparency, and struggle
                                        for coordinated delivery. However, implementing similar interventions through

DISASTER-RESPONSIVE SOCIAL PROTECTION:
THE RSR-GFDRR PARTNERSHIP
A review of existing social protection–disaster risk management (DRM) programs
worldwide reveals a common thread of design and implementation parameters
that ought to be established to make social protection more disaster responsive,
including the following:

•	 Programs should have sufficient footprint, flexible design, and comprehensive
   service delivery systems in place ex ante.

•	 Appropriate and credible information (on livelihoods, meteorological data, etc.)
   should be available to determine the needed response, prepare adequately,
   and influence timely decision making.

•	 Established disaster risk financing arrangements should
   exist that govern disaster response.                               Box T3-1: Strengthening Social Protection

   paredness and response through SPL. In Fiji and Tonga,
         the RSR-DR grant is helping the governments design SPL programs that are
         better able to help the poor and vulnerable postdisaster. With varying levels of
         maturity in their SPL systems, neither Fiji nor Tonga are currently utilizing their
         SPL systems in response to disaster. With RSR help, both countries will have
         more detailed analyses on financing options as well as support in program
         implementation.

     	   In Jamaica, a similar grant will help make the existing Program for Advance-
         ment through Health and Education (PATH) program more disaster responsive.
         The flagship conditional cash transfer program’s service delivery mechanisms
         have been used to provide cash and in-kind support to poor and vulnerable
         households postdisaster. To make service delivery even more effective and
         to be able to reach a larger number of affected people, the RSR-DR grant will
         help the government of Jamaica improve the design of delivery mechanisms
         and provide the necessary training for staff and beneficiaries.

     •	 Promoting stronger integration of risk financing and SPL. In the Philip-
         pines, the RSR-DR project is centered on strengthening the government’s
         ability to better protect poor and vulnerable households postdisaster. The social
         protection and welfare programs in the Philippines—delivered through the
         Department of Social Welfare and Development—have been at the frontline of
         disaster response, as witnessed after Typhoon Yolanda in 2013. Nevertheless,
         the potential for social protection to better assist those most in need during the
         response period after a crisis occurs has much potential for improvement. The
58
         grant will help assess the potential for introducing a scalable emergency cash
         transfer in the Philippines (which will replace some of the in-kind assistance) as
         well as an MIS to support such an important postdisaster program.


     GOING F ORWA RD
     SPL programs have the potential to build resilience among the population post-
     disaster. Key elements of SPL programs—including targeting and enrollment,
     financing, payments, and so on—have the potential to incorporate ex ante
     mechanisms that can lower the vulnerability of already poor households (or those
     that may become poor after disasters strike), minimize the costs of delivering
     systematic response to those most in need, and even prevent more protracted
     social and economic crises.

     The RSR-GFDRR partnership has fortified the new collaboration between SPL
     and DRM—an agenda that is attracting much attention in development frontiers.
     The RSR itself, originally conceived as a crisis response program, is well aligned
     to continue its engagements in disaster-responsive SPL. Indeed, through its
     partnership with the GFDRR, the RSR can help take this agenda forward through
     catalytic investment in disaster-responsive social protection systems. Specifi-
     cally, it can engage in this agenda through knowledge products that help expand
     the growing but still limited body of knowledge on disaster-responsive SPL, as
     well as through technical assistance on systems development and adaptation in
     line with the four parameters outlined above.

    PROTECTING ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES TO THE MOST VULNERABLE IN TIMES OF CRISIS



Nutrition-sensitive RSR grants can support work in middle-income
countries, and aim to influence nutrition through improvements to SPL
systems. NS-RSR grants can fund stand-alone activities or work that adds
a nutrition-sensitive lens to World Bank Group SPL country projects.



IMPLICATIONS OF NUTRITION FOR SOCIAL
PROTECTION
An estimated 45 percent of deaths of children under age 5 are linked to malnu-
trition (Black and others 2013), and globally almost 2 billion people suffer from
some form of malnutrition (IFPRI 2016). While poorer countries may exhibit
greater rates of undernutrition (too little food and nutrients), malnutrition as a
whole affects countries all over the world (as noted, for example, in the executive   59
summaries of both IFPRI 2016 and Shrimpton and Rokx 2012), and can affect the
health and labor profiles of middle- and high-income countries. Whether under-
nutrition or overnutrition (too much of the wrong food), the impacts can range
from poor physical and cognitive development among vulnerable children, to
reduced capacity to work and increased health care costs for individuals. When
both under- and overnutrition are present in a country—which is not unusual (see
IFPRI 2014, chapter 4), the economy may feel the impacts of the “double burden
of malnutrition,” and governments will have to tame a two-headed beast that
starts as a health concern but can affect labor, safety nets, government services,
and national expenditures. In short, malnutrition is a human capital challenge that
cuts across all economies and layers of the population.



EMERGING THEMES IN NUTRITION AND SOCIAL
PROTECTION
Working across sectors does not come naturally. The NS-RSR window supports
critical connections between nutrition and other disciplines in a way that can lead
to meaningful policy change. The current suite of grants (table T3-1) provides a
window into the shared needs across countries that are revealed once a team
applies a nutrition-sensitive lens.

ground by involving multiple ministries and institutions in policy planning and

                                          others. Whether providing a new space for dialogue or supporting a pre-existing
                                          mandate to build multisectoral capacity, the NS-RSR window allows key policy
                                          players to come together.

                                          South-South exchange. NS-RSR grants offer a means to take advantage of
                                          shared experience in several ways. For example, the team in Armenia is building
                                          on a learning visit by the Ministry of Labor to Brazil to hear about its Zero Hunger
                                          program, and Ecuador is looking to translate policy elements that contributed to
Peru’s dramatic reduction in stunting among children into useful approaches in its
own context.

In addition to these country-country examples, the NS-RSR window is support-
ing a global knowledge-sharing effort—Enhancing Public Distribution Systems
as a Safety Net grant—that highlights lessons in public food distribution systems
across the world. Working with authors from India, Indonesia, Mexico, Sri Lanka,
Uganda, and the United States, this NS-RSR team is scanning nations of all
income levels and nutrition situations to directly compare and contrast decisions
made around in-kind food support to vulnerable families. The project will result in
a book that is the first of its kind in terms of scope. Early workshops are showing
how many poverty programs have evolved incrementally to take on food and
nutrition components—essentially becoming public food distribution systems
over time.

Governance. Nutrition-sensitive approaches are more likely to stick if they
become owned and monitored by governments. Mexico is using an NS-RSR
grant to contribute to a culture of evidence-based policy making, and pilot ways
to establish causality among complex multisectoral programming. The World
Bank team is drawing on both international and national experts to accomplish
this work, together building a system that can be taken over by government
officers as they oversee massive national programs such as PROSPERA and
the National Crusade Against Hunger (Crusada Nacional Contra el Hambre). In
Botswana, the NS-RSR is helping the Ministry of Local Governance and Rural             61
Development understand how national policies can incorporate both nutrition
and social protection programs as complementary services, and help drive the
country’s Vision Beyond 2016. With an eye toward improving return on invest-
ment for social safety net spending, the grant in Botswana supports the ministry
in identifying program coherence and justifying its budget decisions.



INTEGRATED APPROACHE S
Good programs of any kind require both individual demand and quality supply in
order to be effective. In several cases, NS-RSR teams are making these criti-
cal links for nutrition-sensitive initiatives and ensuring an integrated approach.
In Ecuador, experience from the recently completed Cresciendo con Nuestra
Guaguas program shows it is possible to achieve a suite of multisectoral suc-
cesses: increase awareness of the importance of child growth through social
protection programs, improve nutrition counseling techniques, and promote high-
er-quality monitoring and evaluation tools for those services. Now, an NS-RSR
grant is supporting scale-up of the Cresciendo experience, looking to expand
improvements in the provision of nutrition services and inform budget allocations
at the national level. In Armenia, an NS-RSR team began with a plan to address
demand for growth monitoring services, but quickly found that supply—that is,
the quality of the services provided—was the more critical issue. It has since
pivoted to reduce the administrative load on social workers and train them as
touch points for nutrition education, while simultaneously looking at the quality of
     cooking demonstrations, growth monitoring, and other key services overseen by
     the Ministry of Health.



     DATA AND TE CHNOLOGY
     Social protection as a sector stands out for its focus on targeting pro-poor
     services toward vulnerable populations, as well as using social registries to
     track access, use, and impact. NS-RSR grants are taking advantage of these
     strengths by upgrading hardware and moving toward registries that track use of
     government services across both social protection and nutrition. In Armenia, the
     government is reviewing its methods to identify who receives social safety net
     benefits, looking to target the most vulnerable households that are at greater
     risk of malnutrition. The NS-RSR team is supporting these efforts by providing
     a suite of policy options based on household data and new surveys and facili-
     tating an informed choice of what works in the Armenian context. In Botswana,
     the Ministry of Local Governance and Rural Development is upgrading its social
     registry database in order to track not only social safety net use, but also the use
     of food supplementation programs that target nutritionally vulnerable women
     and children. The upgrades require coming to multisectoral consensus on which
     programs should be tracked, what type of information to include, and even the
     hardware and software that is a best fit for Botswana. At a more individual level,
     Ecuador is exploring the use of nutrition-focused text messages that both edu-
62   cate and drive demand for services promoted through the NS-RSR grant.



     COMING TO COHERENCE
     What stands out across all NS-RSR grants is the act of taking critical steps
     toward coherence—aligning separate programs, policies, people, and tech-
     nology. In an era when budgets are tight at all levels, whether in IDA or IBRD
     countries, finding common ground and leveraging (for example) sophisticated
     safety net targeting formulas to help identify those in need of growth monitoring
     and nutritional counseling is the type of effort that makes good fiscal sense.
     NS-RSR teams such as that in Armenia find that sitting down with government
     counterparts and describing the areas of overlap between the sectors is a signifi-
     cant step in itself, and often allows them to consider more holistic approaches to
     human capital, good health, and good nutrition across generations.



     WHAT’S NE X T
     The NS-RSR is allowing World Bank teams to support the nutrition-sensitive
     social protection agenda. There is still more ground to cover, and the NS-RSR
     mechanism is positioned well to respond. The following themes are likely areas
     of entry for new projects.

     •	 1000 Days. This rallying cry of the public health nutrition world is likely to
        continue being integrated with social protection targeting systems. Sources
   such as the 2013 Lancet series on maternal and child nutrition point to the
   period from the first day of pregnancy to a child’s second birthday as a critical
   time for development (Lancet 2013), when human capital may become locked
   in for the rest of a child’s life.

•	 Measuring impact on nutrition. Part of the work in the Mexico NS-RSR
   grant is to establish a system able to tease out the independent effects of
   different policies and programs on nutrition. This is a complicated task from
   a monitoring and evaluation perspective, and future grants can continue to
   support the development of appropriate methods and indicators to assess
   multisectoral impact.

•	 Maintaining collaboration. In cases such as Armenia, NS-RSR grants may
   be allowing a country to work on nutrition across ministries for the first time.
   These interactions provide the building blocks for multisectoral and nutri-
   tion-sensitive work, but represent a significant shift in approach and even
   mind-set toward collaboration. Future rounds of grants can build on such
   groundwork, and will require continued investment to establish nutrition sensi-
   tivity as a norm.

•	 Behavior change communication (BCC). Nutrition and social protection
   find a programmatic intersection around BCC. Conditional cash transfers can
   encourage use of government services such as growth monitoring, or find
   ways to include individual or small-group counseling approaches that address
   nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and practices. BCC is a common challenge in
                                                                                       63
   improving nutrition and an area that can be included in NS-RSR grants.

These and other themes will continue to drive the NS-RSR as a mechanism that
brings a nutrition-sensitive lens into the SPL arena. The cohort of grantees will
make for a natural knowledge network to further South-South exchange, and
together create a supportive grant system that will grow even more effective
over time.

                                                       In December 2014, the size of the RSR Trust Fund Program expanded, with the
                                                       activation of the Nutrition-Sensitive Social Protection and Labor RSR Multi-Do-
                                                       nor Trust Fund (RSR-NS). The Russian Federation is the sole contributor to this
                                                       trust fund under the RSR Trust Fund Program umbrella, with a total contribution
                                                       amount of $3.30 million. All World Bank client countries (IDA only, IDA, and
                                                       IBRD) are eligible for RSR-NS financing for the purpose of nutrition-sensitive SPL
                                                       system building and strengthening. Consequently, as of December 31, 2016, the
                                                       RSR Trust Fund portfolio had grown to include the following:

                                                       •	 The RSR Multi-Donor Trust Fund (RSR-MDTF)
                                                       •	 The RSR Catalyst Trust Fund (RSRC), which closed on June 30, 2012

                                                       The Russian Federation remains the largest funder to the RSR Trust Fund Pro-

                                                       and Australia. In 2013, the United Kingdom joined the RSR-MDTF with a total
                                                       contribution of £15 million. As of August 2016, donor contributions to the RSR
                                                       totaled about $108.42 million. Table F-1 shows the breakdown of contributions by
