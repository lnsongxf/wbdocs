Executive Summary
This Policy Note assesses the current state of Bhutan’s agribusi-
ness sector and recommends steps the Royal Government of Bhutan
(RGoB) might consider to increase the sector’s growth. The govern-
ment regards agriculture as a priority for achieving the national objectives
of diversifying the economy, reducing poverty, and creating more inclu-
sive growth, as discussed in its Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2013–2018). This
Note focuses on agribusinesses (specifically, nonfarm enterprises) and the
business-enabling environment in which they operate. Agribusinesses drive
improvements in farm production and productivity by creating demand for
the products of commercial agriculture.1 A strong agribusiness sector is a
crucial catalyst in the transformation from a primarily agrarian economy to
an industrial society, pulling Bhutanese agriculture into global value chains
and attracting private investment—all of which can foster inclusive economic
growth, an RGoB objective.

The analysis here relies primarily on the results from Enterprise Sur-
veys conducted in Bhutan, one in 2009 and the other in 2015. The
World Bank Group (WBG) conducts these surveys using fairly standardized
methods in many of its member countries, and using firm-level interviews to
systematically capture statistically useful data on how the private sector views
the competitive landscape in which it operates.

The insights obtained from the Enterprise Surveys are supplemented
here by extensive literature reviews and by fieldwork conducted in
Bhutan by WBG agribusiness experts to obtain qualitative data and
information from key informants in the private and public sectors.
The interviews gathered information from individuals from the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forests (MoAF, 2010); business support agencies, such as the
Bhutan Exporters Association (BEA) and the Bhutan Chambers of Commerce


1. This report distinguishes agribusiness from agriculture, with the latter defined as on-farm pro-
duction and productivity. Most of the discussion here focuses on easily distinguishable forms
of agribusiness. The Enterprise Surveys did not include any production-level agribusinesses.

Introduction
This Policy Note begins by briefly describing the purpose of this study
of agribusiness in Bhutan, the data sources for the analysis, and the
contextual information essential for interpreting the results of the
analysis. The discussion first explains why the agribusiness sector is cru-
cial for achieving national objectives, including inclusive economic growth.
It then focuses on specific elements of the environment in which Bhutanese
agribusinesses operate, describing the factor endowments of agriculture and
reviewing the institutions that support and govern agribusiness. The second
part of this note focuses on the results of the analysis; the third sets out the
conclusions and recommendations.

This Policy Note was prepared at the request of the Ministry of Eco-
nomic Affairs (MoEA) of the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) to
inform MoEA’s Economic Development Policy, the key strategic and
planning document for Bhutan’s economic growth. The Policy Note was
developed in close consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests
(MoAF), bilateral and multilateral development institutions working in Bhu-
tan, and Bhutan’s private sector (particularly agribusinesses and the organiza-
tions that represent them). The recommendations provided here are intended
to support the MoEA’s proposal to transform Bhutan’s agribusiness sector into
an engine for economic growth, a tool for poverty reduction, and a focus for
greater private-sector investment.

The agricultural sector, considered one of the “five jewels” of Bhu-
tan’s economy, is a priority for Bhutan, given the potential for agri-
culture to contribute to the government’s objectives of diversifying
the economy, reducing poverty, and fostering more inclusive growth,
as discussed in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2013–2018). The sector
employs about 56 percent of the population, yet it contributed just 17.7 per-
cent to gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014 and has exhibited relatively flat
growth (RGoB Eleventh Five-Year Plan).

                                                                                   1

Analysis
The analysis that follows examines Bhutan’s agribusiness sector
from several perspectives. Starting with summary data on the sector’s per-
formance and composition, the analysis moves into a deeper exploration of
the effects of the enabling environment, trade issues, and investment patterns
on the sector’s performance and prospects.

Composition of the
Agribusiness Sector
The Enterprise Survey also reaveals that agribusinesses in Bhutan are
primarily microenterprises operating as sole proprietorships and are
geographically concentrated in the Thimpu/Paro region. In the 2015
Enterprise Survey, 64 of the 367 sampled firms were agribusinesses. Extrap-
olating to the full population, agribusinesses make up 20.2 percent of the
firms in the Bhutanese economy: 726 of 3,592 firms in the total population.
As Figure 7 indicates, the majority of agribusinesses (55 percent) are in the
Thimphu/Paro region, 19 percent are in Gelephu/Sarpang, 16 percent are in
Phuentsholing, and 10 percent are in Samdrup Jongkhar. The regional distri-
bution is similar across other sectors, with one in two firms located in Thim-
phu/Paro and one in ten located in Samdrup Jongkhar (Appendix 2, Table 1).

Bhutanese agribusinesses are smaller than businesses in other sec-
tors. The Enterprise Survey shows that 91 percent of agribusinesses are
microenterprises (in other words, they have fewer than five employees) (Fig-
ure 8). No agribusiness has more than 100 employees (the definition of a
large firm for Bhutan); 6 percent are small enterprises (5–19 employees); and
3 percent are medium enterprises (20–99 employees). Firms outside the agri-
business sector are much less likely to be microenterprises: Only 68 percent
have fewer than five employees. Significantly more small and medium enter-
prises (SMEs) also exist outside of the agribusiness sector (24 percent). Bhutan
generally has few large enterprises: Even among non-agribusiness firms, only
1 percent have more than 100 employees (Appendix 2, Table 1).
                                                                                   13

Conclusions and Recommendations

Summary of Conclusions
Bhutan needs greater investment and private-sector participation in
its agribusiness sector. The sector includes very few medium and large
agribusiness firms, and across the spectrum of Bhutanese agribusinesses,
innovation and technological advancement are relatively low.

A major conclusion of this analysis is that the RGoB and public insti-
tutions that govern and support agribusiness need to reexamine their
incentive structures to exert a more positive influence on the growth
and development of private agribusinesses in Bhutan. Currently the
RGoB’s impact on the labor market, as well as the MoAF’s interventions in
agricultural product markets, may be absorbing much of the human capital
and market opportunities required for development of a dynamic set of pri-
vate agribusinesses. The public sector should redirect some of its investments
toward activities that grow, rather than subtly replace, the private sector.

Second, the MoEA can grow its private agribusiness sector by cap-
italizing on several relatively untapped opportunities to add value
and improve export markets, which in turn will catalyze growth in
agricultural production and productivity. Taking advantage of these
opportunities will require not only greater capital investment (to replicate
established technologies) but also, to a large degree, increases in total factor
productivity (TFP) (to raise productivity through innovation and investments
in knowledge).

Third, although Bhutan has policies in place to allow FDI, the MoEA
should make a focused investment promotion effort. FDI is crucial not
only to draw needed capital into the country but to help introduce innova-
tion and unique management processes that increase total factor productivity
(TFP).

Appendix 1
Spotlight on Mushrooms
Bhutan’s vast forest reserves, mountainous terrain, and cultural tradition
of mushroom collection, consumption, and export indicate its potential to
become a notable exporter of mushroom products. Bhutan already cultivates
shiitake mushrooms commercially and has developed export markets for shi-
itake, matsutake, and a few other varieties of wild mushrooms. It presently
exports only 1–4 MT of mushrooms per year, but the average value per ton
is about US$40,000. With a reasonable increase in volume, mushrooms could
quickly become a significant agricultural export. In parallel with continued
development of the cultivated mushroom market and the niche market for
matsutakes, Bhutan can also explore expanding its presence in other mush-
room market segments: fresh wild mushrooms such as chanterelles, morels
(Morchella spp.), coral, oyster, porcini (Boletus spp.), and others; fresh cultivated
mushrooms (shiitake as well as any other cultivated types, such as Aspergillus
spp.); frozen wild mushrooms (chanterelles and porcini); and dried wild mush-
rooms of many varieties (morels, black trumpet, porcini, matsutake, and
others).

Each of these segments has its particular requirements. For example, fresh
mushroom exports rely on cold-chain technology and excellent logistics. Due
to the expense of transport, only certain varieties are suitable for this trade (for
example, morels and matsutakes). Frozen mushrooms require IQF (individual
quick frozen) processing and, of course, a reliable frozen goods cold chain.
Because these mushrooms are likely to be exported by container, they must be
produced in sufficient volumes to warrant such transport. Only high-volume
mushrooms, such as chanterelles and porcini, fit into this segment.
