Improving Service Levels and Impact on the Poor	                                                     vii
  Executive Summary
  Inequality is on the rise in Indonesia. Although the country made significant progress in reducing
  poverty from 24 percent, at the time of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, to 11 percent in
  2014, and maintained 6 percent annual growth for a decade up to 2015, consumption growth
  has not been evenly distributed across the population. The poorest 40 percent of Indonesians
  now account for just a fifth of total household consumption, while the richest 20 percent
  account for nearly half. This places Indonesia among the countries with the highest levels of
  inequality in East Asia—just below Malaysia, the Philippines, and China—and above the
  average of five Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries with
  the highest levels of inequality.

  Indonesia is undergoing rapid urbanization, and although this can be accompanied by strong
  economic growth, it creates a number of challenges, including disparities in income and access
  to services. The urban population accounts for about half of the country’s total population, a
  figure estimated to rise to approximately 68 percent by 2025. Underinvestment in urban
  infrastructure and lack of adequate planning limits the potential economic growth and
  development benefits of growing cities and contributes to widening inequalities. Over the past
  decade, for every 1 percent increase in urbanization, Indonesia achieved only two percent
  gross domestic product (GDP) growth, below the return on urbanization in other Asian countries
  such as China, Vietnam, and Thailand, which have significantly benefited from economies of
  agglomeration.

  Unequal access to services at the beginning of life is a key driver of inequality. Children who      	   Unequal access
  are born into poverty are more likely to be deprived of critical services such as health care,           to services at the
  nutrition, education, water supply, and sanitation—placing them at an unfair disadvantage from           beginning of life
  the outset. When accessible, these services help level the playing field for the next generation         makes it more
                                                                                                           difficult to break
  by providing the basic conditions that allow children and adults to lead healthier, and more             out of poverty

  society, and is key to economic growth and prosperity.

  New evidence shows that owning a toilet, drinking clean water, and living in a community where
  most of one’s neighbors own a toilet are important drivers of child growth and cognitive
  development in Indonesia. Repeated exposure to fecal pathogens—especially common in
  areas where open defecation is practiced, fecal waste management is inadequate, and water
  quality is poor—can cause inadequate absorption and nutrient loss through diarrhea and poor
  gut function. These conditions stunt a child’s growth, causing irreversible impairment to
  development, learning, and earning—the effects of which extend over generations.

  Despite recent gains, many millions of Indonesians still go without improved water and               	   Poverty is only
  sanitation. In Indonesia, 87 percent of the population has access to improved drinking water             one determinant
  and 61 percent has access to improved sanitation, a 39 and 36 percentage point increase,                 of WASH access:
  respectively, since 1990. Although these gains are commendable, there are still close to                 poor urban
                                                                                                           dwellers often

  (WHO and UNICEF 2015). These summary figures hide the persistent divides between urban                   wealthier rural
  and rural populations and among different income levels in access to services, and they mask             inhabitants.
  underlying gaps in quality faced by all households, regardless of income or geographic location.

  Growing incomes are helping to both reduce poverty and increase access to proper water and
  sanitation, but gaps in access between the poor and rich remain, and in some cases are
  widening. For drinking water (urban and rural) and urban sanitation, access increased in

                               or B40); however, overall levels of access are lower among the B40 and the gaps remain
                               large. For the most recent year of data (2015), there was a 14 percentage point gap between
                               the T60 and B40 in access to improved water in urban areas (84 percent vs. 70 percent), and
                               a 10 percentage point gap for rural water (64 percent vs. 54 percent). For rural sanitation,
                               the gap between the T60 and B40 households has increased, and in 2015 stood at
                               20 percentage points (55 percent vs. 35 percent). Although rates of open defecation in rural
                               areas decreased at the same rate in B40 and T60 households, B40 households were more
                               likely to transition from open defecation to basic latrines, whereas their T60 counterparts
                               transitioned to improved latrines. The gap in access to sanitation between B40 and
                               T60 households in urban areas is also substantial (19 percent), but it has narrowed from
                               25 percent in 2002.

                               There is also variation at the local government (LG) level. District poverty rates do not neatly
         reduce inequality.
                               correspond with either levels of access or equity of access to improved sanitation; some poor
                               districts are doing a better job than wealthier districts, and a far better job than some of their
                               poorer peers. For example, despite there being no significant difference in poverty levels
                               between Java and non-Java districts, Java districts have achieved higher levels of coverage
                               overall for both B40 and T60 households.

         the sanitation        the main challenge facing Indonesia at the outset of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)
         needs of              period. Although most households are gaining access to drinking water and sanitation due to
         urban dwellers        rapid urbanization and increasing living standards, not everyone is benefitting from the same

                               urban areas, compared with only 20 percent of B40 households. Furthermore, it is estimated
                               that more than a quarter (27 percent) of B40 households drink groundwater that is unsafe, due
                               to inadequate protection from environmental contamination. The Government of Indonesia
                               (GoI) has set an ambitious target for universal access to improved water by 2019, aiming for
                               60 percent coverage of piped and 40 percent coverage of non-piped water sources in urban
                               areas. However, given these patterns of access between B40 and T60 households, it is likely
                               that B40 households will remain on a non-piped service for longer than T60 households.

                               also lack these services. Failure to address the sanitation conditions of urban dwellers,
                               especially those living in informal settlements, could exacerbate inequalities, and is among the
                               greatest threats to the inclusive growth and sustainability of Indonesian cities.

                               more likely to suffer the negative consequences of this lack of access, such as poor health

  Table ES.1 summarizes the key recommended actions and the responsible agencies/
  stakeholders.


                           Key Facts and Recommended Actions

    Fact 1

    The government of Indonesia’s 100-0-100 target is universal access to improved water
    supply, but current patterns in equity of access to piped water suggest that low-income
    households are likely to remain on a non-piped service for longer than non-poor
    households. Currently, of the 29.6 percent of urban households with access to piped
    water supply, the B40 make up just 7.5 percent, whereas the T60 make up 22.1 percent.
    A number of barriers, including (1) financial sustainability and performance of PDAMs;
    (2) government budget allocation and spending; (3)  perceptions and behavioral
    constraints; and (4) lack of legal frameworks for equitable service delivery prevent low-
    income households from accessing piped water connections.

    Recommended Action

    Expand piped water services to a larger share of the bottom 40 percent in urban areas.

      ••     Improve the efficiency and performance of Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (water
             utility; PDAMs) to generate a virtuous cycle of performance, tariff increases, cost
             recovery, and expansion of connections, especially to poor households. The National
             Urban Water Supply Program (NUWSP), the main delivery mechanism for the urban
             water supply platform, includes a robust emphasis on performance improvement of
             PDAMs. The program could be enhanced through capacity building for LGs and
             PDAMs on incorporating equity and social concerns into tariff structures, and
             guidance on structuring cross-subsidization between customers in order to protect
             the poor and vulnerable. Additional capacity building on project preparation and
             project proposal development should cover (1) how to assess affordability of water
             tariffs; (2) willingness among poor households to pay for piped water connections;
             and (3) incorporation of low-income households, including customers of Water
             Hibah (an output-based grant scheme for piped water), in the overall performance
             improvement and investment plan.



Improving Service Levels and Impact on the Poor	                                                                                 xi
         ••     Expand financing options for low-income households to connect to piped water.
                Piped water connection fees are unaffordable for households living near or below
                the poverty line, and although the Hibah scheme has incentivized more poor-
                inclusive service delivery, not all PDAMs are eligible to participate, leaving a large
                share of poor households unable to connect. Subsidized credit and savings
                schemes, including microfinance, could be an alternative that allows households to
                spread the cost of the connection over time. Better coordination between Hibah and
                microfinance schemes can be achieved through the platform approach, taking
                advantage of a common policy framework regardless of the source of financing and
                greater flexibility at the LG level to partner with private sector actors. In addition, the
                existing targeting mechanism for Hibah beneficiaries that is based on electricity
                usage could be combined with income targeting to better identify eligible low-income
                households for financial subsidies.

         ••     Raise awareness of the benefits of piped water—both among consumers and among
                local government actors—to shift consumer behavior and dependence on alternatives,
                and to build the political will for improvements in water supply to poor households.
                Awareness campaigns have been missing from most water supply programs.
                Although most households treat their water before drinking, either through boiling
                or filtration, they are unaware of the potential for recontamination during storage.
                Awareness campaigns, in accordance with a Water Safety Plan to achieve water
                quality standards, can be coordinated by the Ministry of Public Works and Housing
                (MoPWH) and Ministry of Health (MoH), and implemented in part by PDAMs. These
                campaigns can help to increase demand for clean water and put pressure on
                PDAMs and LGs to expand provision of piped water services to unserved communities
                and/or improve the quality of existing services.

         ••     Adjust the current intergovernmental fiscal transfer system to better align transfers
                to needs. Although current levels of government budget allocation to water supply
                are insufficient to achieve the universal access targets for water supply, existing
                fiscal transfers could be allocated more efficiently to address needs. Basic
                information on water access is readily available; however, data on the Special
                Allocation Fund (Dana Alokasi Khusus, or DAK) transfers show a declining association
                between DAK allocations and water coverage at the district level. Additional
                considerations for aligning fiscal transfers to needs through the General Allocation
                Fund (Dana Alokasi Umum, or DAU) point to population growth in urban centers, and
                in suburban districts in particular. To better align fiscal transfers with population
                growth trends will require adoption of a per capita calculation, as opposed to the
                current per region calculation, to ensure equitable distribution of public resources
                according to population density of cities and districts. This alignment does not
                address the need for more financing to the sector overall. Commercial loans and
                private investment, including business-to-business collaboration, should be explored
                to better understand how these additional sources of financing can help bridge
                the gap.

       Fact 2

       Groundwater quality is not consistently monitored, and representative data are not
       available. However, water quality surveys conducted in several cities show the potential
       risk for contamination is severe. A large share of the B40 uses groundwater sources for
       drinking. In 2015 data showed that over a quarter (27 percent) of the B40 drink unsafe
       groundwater, compared with 14 percent of the T60. Contamination stems from poor quality
       septic tanks and untreated domestic wastewater, as well as from landfill and industrial
       effluent.

    Recommended Action

    Improve the quality of alternative water sources for those who will remain on non-piped
    water supply.

      ••     Enhance monitoring for water quality risks for all source types, and make this
             information publicly available. Consumers are largely unaware of the variable quality
             of drinking water from different sources and the particular risks posed by poor
             household water storage practices and poor fecal waste management. Water sector
             strategy should account for the potential water quality risks of poor sanitation, and
             the respective investments of the water and sanitation sub-sectors should be
             aligned. This alignment is especially important in areas facing technical barriers to
             piped water. The Local Development Planning Agency (Bappeda) at city level can
             ensure that the needed alignment of water and sanitation is reflected in the
             respective strategy documents (the  Master Plan for Drinking Water and the City
             Sanitation Strategy). Bappeda could also oversee integration of data from the two
             sub-sectors into planning, implementation, and monitoring.

      ••     Strengthen regulatory control for small-scale water providers to ensure that
             regulations on drinking water quality are met. For refilled bottled water, enhanced
             control could be achieved by linking water quality monitoring, under the responsibility
             of MoH, with the licensing process, under the Ministry of Industry (MoI).

    Fact 3

    Between 2006 and 2015 access to improved sanitation grew at a rate of 6.5 percent
    annually. However, there were still close to 100 million people without improved sanitation
    in 2015 and the majority of these lived in rural areas. Just 48 percent of the population
    has improved sanitation in rural areas, compared with 76 percent of those in urban
    areas, a gap of 28 percentage points. Rates of open defecation have declined at similar
    rates between the B40 and T60 since 2002, but B40 households were more likely to
    move to basic latrines, contributing to the widening gap in access to improved sanitation
    between the B40 and T60.

    Recommended Action

    Support the bottom 40 percent in gaining access to improved sanitation.

      ••     Strengthen the Sanitasi Total Berbasis Masyarakat (Community-Based Total
             Sanitation, or STBM) strategy by revisiting the zero-subsidy approach in order to
             move up the sanitation ladder. Although global practice suggests subsidies can
             harm sanitation behavior-change efforts, experience shows that when well-targeted,
             delivered through an efficient channel, and affordable, subsidies can be an effective
             mechanism to reach poor households which otherwise cannot afford the high lump-
             sum cost of a toilet. Targeting subsidized credit and savings schemes through
             existing targeting systems that are already working well to identify low-income
             households for social assistance—such as the Unified Database (UDB) operated by
             the National Team for the Acceleration of Poverty Reduction (TNP2K) and the
             Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA)—can be an efficient and transparent way to reach
             households most in need of subsidies and achieve higher levels of service. The
             UDB contains socioeconomic and demographic information for the approximately
             40 percent of the population with the lowest welfare status, the equivalent of
             24 million households, or 96 million individuals. The MoH should take a leadership

                role in adapting the existing policy on sanitation subsidies to address the financial
                constraints of poor households, and MoPWH should work with TNP2K and MoSA
                to adopt the UDB for targeting assistance under the Community-Based Rural Water
                Supply and Sanitation Program (PAMSIMAS).


       Fact 4

       The vast majority of households in urban areas use an improved toilet connected to a
       septic or sewerage system (78 percent), but less than 2 percent of those are connected
       to sewerage. However, a combination of high idle capacity for existing sewerage networks,
       poor performing septage treatment plants, limited improvements to fecal sludge
       management, and poor quality investments in on-site sanitation systems results in
       95 percent of fecal waste making its way into the nearby environment through the process
       of containment, emptying, transport, treatment, and disposal. Conditions of high population
       density and inadequate fecal waste disposal interact to make poor sanitation particularly
       risky to the health of people population health in urban areas.

       Recommended Action

       Bring more households into the full sanitation and fecal waste service chain in urban areas.

         ••     Adopt a more holistic and inclusive approach to planning for citywide sanitation to
                accommodate the range of solutions required to meet universal access targets in
                urban areas. Planning should cover the full fecal waste service chain and outline a
                progressive roadmap for bringing the entire population into this service chain. Local
                solutions are complex, requiring a combination of piped and non-piped technologies,
                such as septic tanks, sewerage, decentralized small-scale wastewater treatment
                plants, and fecal sludge management. District heads and mayors need to be given
                responsibility for ensuring consistency in planning, budgeting, and execution;
                flexible funding arrangements; and technical assistance and capacity building
                where needed. This approach requires a delicate balance between the national
                government’s fiscal leverage to incentivize investment in sanitation, and granting
                greater autonomy to LGs to decide where and how to invest those resources.

         ••     Adapt sanitation behavior change to behavioral issues common in the urban
                sanitation space. The universal access targets will be met primarily through on-site
                sanitation systems with fecal sludge management (72.5 percent); smaller shares
                are planned for centralized and decentralized sewerage (12.5 percent) and basic
                sanitation (15 percent). Low consumer demand for fecal waste management
                services is a reflection of both the lack of integrated services and the lack of
                knowledge about safe management and disposal practices. Part of the solution will
                require generating the necessary demand and changing the behavior of individuals,
                communities, and providers. But behavior change cannot happen in a vacuum—it
                also requires a coherent policy framework, clarity on institutional arrangements,
                and adequate enforcement of LG ordinances for design, construction, and desludging
                (World Bank and Australian Aid 2013). Coordination between MoH and MoPWH will
                be needed for effective implementation of STBM in urban areas, along with the
                Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF) to enforce new regulations on effluent
                standards.

         ••     Elevate the profile of sanitation in political and fiscal discussions, as well as in intra-
                household decision-making. This change could require a shift in the narrative around

             urban sanitation to emphasize not only elements of modernity and competitiveness,
             but also the lifelong effects on intellectual and economic potential of early life
             stunting, caused in part by poor sanitation. AKKOPSI (Regency/City Alliance for
             Better Sanitation) could lead advocacy efforts with mayors and district heads.


    Fact 5

    An estimated 9 million children (37 percent) under five in Indonesia are stunted. Children
    in rural areas are more likely to be stunted than children in urban areas, but a child from
    the lowest income quintile is just as likely to be stunted whether he or she lives in an
    urban area (48 percent likelihood) or a rural area (49 percent). Owning a toilet and having
    access to clean drinking water supply, as well as living in a community where most of one’s
    neighbors own a toilet, are important drivers of child growth and cognitive development in
    Indonesia. Access to WASH is just one key driver of nutrition, with food security, care, and
    access to health care being additional factors. The nutritional impact of WASH investments
    can be  enhanced through multisectoral convergence to ensure that children have
    simultaneous access to all drivers of nutrition.

    Recommended Action

    Champion multisectoral approaches to reduce child stunting.

      ••     Capitalize on synergies of multisectoral approaches. Progress toward reducing
             stunting in Indonesia can be enhanced by coordinated multisectoral interventions
             that address effectively the four key underlying determinants of nutritional status—
             food security, access to health care, child care practices, and access to water and
             sanitation. Geographic targeting can be used to reach areas where undernutrition
             and underlying deprivations are high. In these areas, interventions should be co-
             located to achieve service improvements across multiple sectors that impact
             stunting. PAMSIMAS can serve as the main platform for multisectoral convergence
             between WASH and other programs addressing nutrition outcomes in young children,
             with oversight of implementation coordinated through the National Development
             Planning Agency (Bappenas).

      ••     Crowd in resources until communities achieve near universal coverage of sanitation.
             There is now compelling evidence, both within Indonesia and globally, that sanitation
             levels of a community are more important than those of any one household. The
             evidence shows that health and nutritional benefits mainly accrue after a minimum
             threshold level of coverage is surpassed, and that full benefits may only be achieved
             as sanitation becomes universal. This evidence supports existing sector practices,
                                 defecation free (ODF) areas, and suggests that resources should
             which aim for open-​­
             be spent on bringing as many communities as possible to universal or near-universal
             levels of coverage in order to realize the health benefits of sanitation.

      ••     Adapt water and sanitation interventions to be more “child-centric.” The five pillars
             of STBM ([1] stop open defecation; [2] hand washing with soap; [3] household safe
             water treatment and storage, and safe food handling; [4] safe disposal and
             management of solid waste; and [5] safe disposal and management of wastewater)
             are comprehensive across WASH services, but may still miss some of the dominant
             fecal contamination pathways that affect small children. An emerging approach
             known as “baby WASH” or “child-centered WASH” focuses on interrupting exposure
             pathways that are most strongly associated with subsequent diarrheal disease.



Improving Service Levels and Impact on the Poor	                                                     xv
               The  MoH should adapt existing STBM behavior-change communication materials
               and LG capacity building to incorporate baby WASH, while implementation of the
               approach should be aligned with the current nutrition-sensitive pilot of PAMSIMAS.

          ••   Target slum areas and informal settlements with multisectoral action. Conditions of
               poverty, overcrowding, and poor quality services interact to magnify the risks of poor
               water and sanitation in densely populated urban slums. The speed and scale of
               urbanization in Indonesia contributes to the urgency with which these challenges
               must be addressed. Multisectoral approaches have largely focused on rural areas,
               but the challenge in urban slums and informal settlements is complex, as an
               effective response involves a multitude of actors and is complicated by institutional
               constraints and tenure insecurity. Additional work is needed to understand the
               contamination pathways unique to these settings, and how to effectively engage
               different actors under the National Slum Upgrading Program (KOTAKU).

  Chapter 1
  Introduction and Background
  Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world, with 252 million people spread
  over a vast equatorial archipelago of 6,000 inhabited islands; the country has a total of more
  than 13,000 islands, which extend nearly 6,000 kilometers east to west and across three time
  zones. The population distribution and levels of development vary considerably across the
  islands. The largest population cluster is on Java, which hosts 60 percent of the country’s
  inhabitants, followed by Sumatra, which has a larger land area but hosts less than a third of
  the population. Approximately 118 million people (46 percent of the population) currently live
  in rural areas, where the majority of the poor are concentrated.1


  A Global Mandate for Quality, Sustainability,
  and Equitable Distribution of Services
  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) came to a conclusion in 2015. Worldwide,
  2.1  billion people gained access to improved sanitation, while 147 countries met the
  MDG drinking water target, 95 countries met the MDG sanitation target, and 77 countries
  met both. To continue these efforts and shift the world onto a sustainable path, world
  leaders gathered on 25 September 2015 at the United Nations in New York to adopt the
  2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2030 Agenda comprises 17 new
  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), or Global Goals,2 which will guide policy and
  funding for the next 15 years. Universal access to clean water and sanitation is 1 of
  17  Global Goals that make up the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Goal
  6 aims to “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for
  all,” with two main targets:

    ••   Target 6.1: By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable
         drinking water for all

    ••   Target 6.2: By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene
         for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls
         and those in vulnerable situations

  In this context, the GoI, through the National Medium Term Development Plan (Rencana
  Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional, or RPJMN) for the period 2015–19, has set
  the target of universal access to water supply and sanitation by the end of 2019.3 To achieve
  this universal access target, Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MoPWH) has launched the
  100-0-100 program (100 percent access to water supply, zero urban slums, and 100 percent
  access to sanitation). The 100-0-100 program defines specific service levels to be met for
  universal access by the end of 2019:


  Water Supply
    ••   40 percent of the population with access to piped water and 60 percent to non-piped
         water (in urban areas 60 percent piped and 40 percent non-piped);

    ••   85 percent of urban areas receiving at least 100 liters per capita per day;

                             ••   15 percent of urban areas receiving a basic level of 60 liters per capita per day;

                             ••   all supplies meeting the 4K standards (Kualitas, Kuantitas, Kontinuitas, Keterjangkauan)
                                  for quality, quantity, continuity and affordability


                           Sanitation
                             ••   15 percent of the population having access to basic sanitation (a toilet that ensures
                                  hygienic separation of human excreta from human contact);

                             ••   12.5 percent to centralized and decentralized sewerage systems;

                             ••   72.5 percent to on-site sanitation with improved fecal waste management.

                            Diagnostic
                            The Indonesia WASH Poverty Diagnostic seeks to strengthen the evidence base on inequality of
                            access to, and quality of, water and sanitation services between the bottom 40 percent and the
                            top 60 percent of the population in Indonesia. The World Bank Group’s new goal of boosting
                            shared prosperity shines a spotlight on the welfare of the B40 population. Although growth itself

  will be important to achieve the goal of shared prosperity, it has become increasingly clear that
  promoting equality of opportunities has the dual advantages of fostering fairness and helping
  countries to achieve their aspirations of economic prosperity. Equalizing basic opportunities for
  children today will promote social mobility and reduce income inequality tomorrow.

  The diagnostic tailors a pilot framework developed by the Water Global Practice that focuses on
  a set of core questions. The overall objectives are to (1) deepen understanding of the extent and
  distribution of inequalities in access to water supply and sanitation services; (2) inform policy
  and investment strategy to achieve national and global targets; and (3) increase client capacity
  for identifying and diagnosing service delivery constraints to improving the quality of water supply
  and sanitation services for the poor. The following core questions guide the Diagnostic:

    1.	 Who and where are the poor and bottom 40 percent of national distribution of income?
        This is a fundamental question for identifying the population of interest, and draws
        mainly on evidence and analysis produced under the Poverty Global Practice Indonesia
        country work program.

    2.	 What are the linkages and synergies between WASH and other sectors? This question
        addresses how lack of access to water and sanitation affects early child health, nutrition,
        and development. Inequality in outcomes, such as income, is influenced by inequality of
        opportunity that includes access to basic services such as water supply and sanitation,
        and the inability of households to benefit from the synergies associated with access to
        more than one basic service.

    3.	 What is the level of access and quality of WASH services experienced by the poor and
        bottom 40 percent compared to the non-poor and top 60 percent? Analysis of “access”
        for the diagnostic is based on the WHO/United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Joint
        Monitoring Programme (JMP) global categories of improved and unimproved service
        levels, but prioritizes Government of Indonesia (GoI) methods and definitions to facilitate
        policy dialogue. Where possible, additional dimensions of service quality are analyzed
        to begin to characterize levels of service as defined under the SDG framework.

    4.	 What are the WASH service-delivery constraints and potential solutions to improving
        services to the poor and bottom 40 percent? Addressing the previous core questions
        helps to frame an institutional and problem-driven political economy analysis in one of
        the four sub-sectors.

  The diagnostic draws on a variety of existing data sources. Socioeconomic household
  survey data (primarily Susenas) is used for distributional and geospatial analysis to
  characterize how access to services varies at national and subnational levels. To reflect
  the nature of decentralized service delivery and responsibility in Indonesia, a key unit of
  analysis of the diagnostic is the district. The analysis also investigates differences across
  cities of different sizes (e.g., metropolitan, small, medium, and big cities). Econometric
  analysis using Susenas is used to understand the determinants of access, while the
  Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) is used to model impacts of access to WASH in early
  childhood on later life nutrition and cognitive outcomes; the Indonesian Basic Health
  Research (RISKESDAS) survey is used for distributional and econometric analysis of
  access to the determinants of nutrition. Spatial mapping is used to visualize associations
  between access to WASH, poverty, and health outcomes.

  Stakeholder consultations were conducted throughout the preparation of the WASH Poverty
  Diagnostic. These consultations included Bappenas, MoPWH, Ministry of Health (MoH),
  Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF), several development partners and relevant
  projects, such as UNICEF, United States Agency or International Development (USAID),
  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), IUWASH Plus (Indonesia Urban Water
  Sanitation and Hygiene, or Penyehatan Lingkungan untuk Semua, a USAID-funded project) and
  IndII (Indonesia Infrastructure Initiatives, a DFAT-funded project), as well as the World Bank

         and sanitation
         by 2019.
                             It is increasingly recognized that indicators of access to “improved” services are insufficient
                             for capturing all crucial preconditions for the desired poverty and prosperity outcomes over
                             the long term. Monitoring of drinking water and sanitation services during the MDG period
                             focused on indicators that identify adequate protection from outside contamination,
                             particularly fecal matter (for drinking water), and hygienic separation of human excreta
                             from human contact (for sanitation). The SDG targets, which are more in line with the
                             current indicators used by the GoI, provide further granularity on service levels by including
                             additional dimensions such as availability, accessibility, and quality. Existing socioeconomic
                             household surveys in Indonesia do not yet capture these dimensions consistently,
                             necessitating the use of multiple surveys, which are limited in population representativeness.
                             To overcome data limitations, the WASH Poverty Diagnostic uses a variety of published
                             evidence and secondary data sources. Importantly, the WASH Poverty Diagnostic uses GoI
                             definitions, rather than those of the JMP  , to categorize access to improved drinking water
                             and sanitation (see box 1.1).




                                  Box 1.1: Defining Access to Improved Drinking Water

                                  There are differences in the definition of access indicators used by the Government
                                  of Indonesia (GoI) and the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP).

                                  The GoI defines “access to improved water” as the share of households whose
                                  primary source of drinking water is either: (1) piped water; (2) protected pump/well/­
                                  spring water, at a minimum distance of 10 meters from a fecal disposal site; or
                                  (3) rain water.

                                  Excluded from the definition are: (1) pump/“protected” well/spring water, at less
                                  than 10 meters from a fecal disposal site; (2) “unprotected” well/spring; (3) bottled
                                  water; and (4) others.

                                  Bottled water is regarded as an “unsustainable” source in view of its relative
                                  price compared with other sources, but recent increases in use of bottled water
                                  as the primary source of drinking water prompted the GoI to modify the definition
                                  to include households using a safe and sustainable water source for both cleaning
                                  and cooking (even if their drinking water is not from a sustainable source, such
                                  as bottled water).

                                  The Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) compiles this indicator through the National
                                  Socio-Economic Survey (Susenas), which is conducted annually.

                                  In addition to differences in how access is defined, different data sources and
                                  underlying population data contribute to different estimates.

                                  The JMP uses both the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and Susenas and
                                  applies a linear regression model to estimate coverage, while GoI refers only to
                                  Susenas.

  Roadmap of the Report
  The remainder of this report is structured in 6 parts. Chapter 2 gives an overview of recent
  trends in poverty and the increase in inequality in Indonesia—in particular, inequality of
  opportunity and implications for economic growth and stability. Chapter 3 reviews global and
  Indonesia-specific evidence on the links between water supply and sanitation, and health
  and nutrition, including econometric anlaysis of the impact of WASH on early child health
  conducted under the Diagnostic. In addition, analysis is presented on the role of multisectoral
  interventions to address stunting. Chapter 4 presents a core set of diagnostics of water
  supply and sanitation, including recent trends in access and quality, disparities across
  geography and income groups, and key service delivery challenges facing the sector. The
  chapter begins with a diagnostic of the sanitation sector, both urban and rural, and then
  turns to urban and rural water supply. Chapter 5 outlines the constraints on and opportunities
  for delivery of piped water to the poor in urban settings. A focus on the urban water sector is
  timely and opportunistic given the context of rapid urbanization in Indonesia, the longstanding
  challenges faced by urban utilities to keep up with the resulting rising demand, and the
  current focused efforts by government urban water counterparts to tackle these issues.
  Chapter 6 presents key recommended actions to orient future water supply and sanitation
  policy and investment toward a more inclusive approach. Recommendations are prioritized
  based on their expected impact on the development goals of (1) reducing inequality;
  (2) enhancing health and well-being; and (3) promoting economic growth and prosperity, as
  well as on the strength of the evidence base for the solution. The chapter also presents
  proposed future analytical work on topics that were not fully addressed in the report.

  The evidence summarized in this report has benefited from a set of topical background papers.
  The background papers include:

    1.	 Determinants of Access to Improved Water Sources in Indonesia from a Household
        Demand Perspective, which estimates the influence of households’ socioeconomic,
        demographic, and geographic characteristics on the probability of choosing specific
        sources of drinking water. It then quantifies and synthesizes this understanding of
        determinants, and suggests how this knowledge could be utilized to provide scientific
        evidence in support of the GoI’s efforts to accelerate access to improved water sources
        in Indonesia.

    2.	 Child Stunting and Cognitive Impacts of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in Indonesia, which
        examines the relationship between poor households and community water and sanitation
        services and child stunting, underweight, and cognitive development in Indonesia, using
        a sample of 3,049 children from the IFLS.

    3.	 Operationalizing a Multi-Sectoral Approach for the Reduction of Stunting in Indonesia:
        An Application Using the 2007 and 2013 RISKESDAS, which conducts analysis of the
        distribution, co-distribution, and synergies between the underlying determinants of
        nutrition and their effect on height-for-age outcomes in children under five. The analysis
        provides a practical diagnostic framework for identifying potential “binding constraints”
        in the Indonesian context to support efforts to reduce child stunting and malnutrition.

    4.	 Identifying and Overcoming Binding Constraints to Piped Urban Water Services for the B40
        in Indonesia, which uses problem-driven political economy and institutional analysis to
        examine the WASH service delivery constraints and potential solutions to improving
        urban piped water services to the poor in Indonesia.

  Additionally, a dynamic dashboard accompanies the report, which contains all underlying data.
  The dashboard is intended for use by the GoI, the World Bank, and development partners to
  monitor inequalities in WASH services, along with poverty levels, and prevalence of health
  outcomes among children under five, including stunting. The dashboard can help to inform

     geographic and sub-group targeting for more pro-poor and poor-inclusive WASH interventions,
     as well as identify where further inquiry is needed to understand why service delivery fails
     within certain groups or geographic areas. The dashboard is available at: http://witiestudio​

  Rising Inequality and
  Why It Matters

    Core Question: Who and where are the poor and bottom 40 percent (B40) of national
    distribution of income?

                                              Key facts

    •	 Between   2002 and 2015 Indonesia reduced poverty from 18.2 percent to
        11.2 percent.
    •	 28.6 million Indonesians live below the poverty line and 62 million are vulnerable to
        poverty.
    •	 Poverty rates are higher in Eastern Indonesia, compared with other regions, but the
        largest number of people living below the poverty line are in the islands of Java and
        Sumatra in Western Indonesia.
    •	 Consumption inequality, as measured by the Gini index, increased from 36 to 41
        between 2002 and 2015, one of the largest increases in the world over this
        period.
    •	 The level of wealth inequality in Indonesia is one of the highest in countries for which
        there are data; by some estimates, the richest 1 percent own 50 percent of all
        financial and property wealth.
    •	 The poorest 40 percent now account for only a fifth of total household consumption,
        while the richest 20 percent account for nearly half.
    •	 Around a third of total inequality in Indonesia is due to inequality of opportunity—
        circumstances that give a child an unfairly disadvantaged start in life.
    •	 A key driver of better opportunities for the next generation begins with improvements
        in the delivery of basic services.




  The Evolution of Poverty and Inequality in Indonesia
  Understanding how poverty and inequality have evolved, and exploring the pathways to reducing
  poverty and boosting shared prosperity, are questions of central importance both globally and
  in Indonesia. While Indonesia has achieved solid economic growth and reduced poverty from
  18.2 percent in 2002 to 11.2 percent in 2015, there are still 28.6 million Indonesians who
  live below the poverty line and 62 million people vulnerable to poverty.1 Alongside poverty
  reduction, the GoI recently declared rising inequality the administration’s top priority for 2017
  (Gibson 2017).

      	   Between 2002        Between 2002 and 2015 poverty decreased by more than a third in Indonesia. Urban areas
          and 2015, poverty   experienced a slightly faster rate of poverty reduction, at 4 percent annually, compared to a
          decreased by        reduction of 3 percent in rural areas (figure 2.1).2
          more than a third
          in Indonesia, but
          consumption         Poverty rates are higher in Eastern Indonesia, compared with other regions in the country. Eight
          inequality          out of 16 provinces that exceeded the national poverty rate of 11.2 percent in 2015 are
          significantly       located in Eastern Indonesia. Provinces in Papua Island, East Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku have
          increased.          more than one-fifth of their population below the poverty line (map 2.1). However, the largest
                              number of people living below the poverty line are on the islands of Java and Sumatra in
                              Western Indonesia. This is primarily due to greater population density—in fact, half of the
                              Indonesian population is living in Java.

                              Vulnerability to poverty remains high in Indonesia, with a large share of the population
                              living just above the official poverty line.3,4 This group accounts for 27 percent of the
                              population, so that the poor and the vulnerable together make up 38 percent of the
                              population (that is, the bottom 40 percent). Living standards for households classified as
                              vulnerable remain low, and a small shock to income or expenditures for this group can
                              easily send them into poverty (World Bank 2016a).

                              Inequality in Indonesia has been steadily rising despite rapid growth over the past decade.
                              Between 2002 and 2015 the country’s mean per capita consumption grew an average of
                              4.6 percent per year, and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (measured at 2010
                              constant US$) rose from US$2,259 in 2002 to US$3,834 in 2015 (WDI). During this
                              same period consumption inequality, as measured by the Gini index, increased from 36 to
                              41, as shown in figure 2.2 (Badan Pusat Statistik) (BPS). This places Indonesia among the
                              countries with the highest levels of inequality in East Asia, just below Malaysia, the
                              Philippines, and China.

  (2016a) identified high wealth inequality as a key driver of rising consumption inequality in
  Indonesia, as this high concentration of wealth in the hands of a few provides both higher
  incomes today for wealthy families—affording better health care and education for their
  children, greater opportunities, and better jobs for tomorrow—and wealth that is passed
  down between generations.

  The increase in inequality is the result of the richest 20 percent enjoying the most economic
  growth, while the B40 enjoyed relatively little. While the richest 10 percent enjoyed annual

                            Inequality has been rising rapidly compared to Indonesia’s neighbors, although it has not
                            yet reached the levels seen in some countries. Indonesia started out in the 1990s with the
                            lowest Gini coefficient in the region, but by the late 2000s, inequality had reached the
                            levels seen in its peers (figure 2.3).5 The size of the increase was also larger than that
                            seen in any other country in the region, except China, and most of this increase happened
                            over a short time. Importantly, other fast-growing East Asian neighbors such as Malaysia,
                            Thailand, and Vietnam experienced stable or declining inequality over the same period
                            (World Bank 2016a).

                            Generally speaking, higher income inequality reduces and destabilizes economic growth,
                            according to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) study (Ostry and Berg 2011). When the
                            share of total income held by the richest 20 percent of the population increases by 5 percentage
                            points annually, economic growth falls by 0.4 percentage points. Conversely, when the share of
                            total income held by the poorest 20 percent of the population increases by 5 percentage
                            points, growth increases by 1.9 percentage points.

  The Source of Inequality and Implications for
  Service Delivery
  Sometimes inequality incentivizes people to work hard and take risks, leading to innovation                             	Equitable
  and economic growth. But when not everybody begins life with the same opportunities, due to                              distribution of
  factors beyond their control, inequality is considered unfair. This sort of inequality (inequality of                    services can

  Thus, a society that ensures equality of opportunity for its citizens helps engender greater                             equitable
  trust, more efficient growth, and better institutions. Although it is difficult to guarantee equality                    outcomes

  ensuring equitable distribution of basic services and interventions can “level the playing field,”
  which can make equitable outcomes more likely.

  Around a third of total inequality in Indonesia is due to inequality of opportunity—that is, when                       	   About one third

  A key driver of better opportunities for the next generation is improved delivery of basic services.                    	   Improved delivery
  In Indonesia, responsibility for delivery of basic services, including water supply and sanitation,                         of services is key

  effectively deliver these services. As a result, service delivery breaks down—despite supportive
  policies and high-level political commitment. Addressing the critical gap between policy and
  implementation that impedes service delivery requires doing business differently: understanding
  the functioning of the public sector and the politics of reform, and taking action in the context
  of those constraints.

  The following chapter reviews global and Indonesia-specific evidence on the links between
  water supply and sanitation and human development outcomes, illustrating the ways in which
  water and sanitation services, along with other key determinants of nutrition, can safeguard a
  child’s future health, and social and economic well-being.

      1.	 The poverty line used throughout the report is Indonesia’s national poverty line, currently
          approximately 330,000 IDR per person per month, set by BPS unless stated otherwise.
      2.	 The poverty rate increased by nearly 2 percentage points between 2005 and 2006 due to
          sharply higher rice prices, a result of a ban on rice imports (World Bank 2006a Making the
          New Indonesia Work for the Poor).
      3.	 The official method used by the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) to set the poverty
          line is the basic needs approach, begun in 1984. Since poverty is defined as the
          inability to meet basic food and non-food needs, the “basic needs approach” is based
          on the consumption module of Susenas that is collected annually from around 65,000
          households. Currently, the consumption module includes 216 food items and 94 non-
          food items. Based on the “basic needs approach,” the indicator used to measure
          poverty is the Head Count Index, defined as the number or percentage of poor people
          living under the poverty line.
      4.	 Vulnerable is defined as households with at least a 10 percent chance of being below the
          poverty line in the following year. Using this definition, the World Bank calculated the
          vulnerability line based on Susenas panel data 2008–10. The calculated vulnerability
          line is approximately 1.5 times the poverty line (World Bank 2012).

  The Role of WASH in Human
  Development

    Core Question: What are the linkages and synergies between WASH and other sectors?

                                             Key facts

    •	 Children living in an environment contaminated by feces are more likely to be
        infected by disease-causing pathogens, leading to diarrhea, poor gut function, and
        stunting.
    •	 An estimated 9 million children (37 percent) under five are stunted in Indonesia, and
        children in the lowest quintile (49 percent) are more likely to be stunted than children
        in the highest (29 percent).
    •	 Stunting is higher in rural areas (42 percent) than in urban (33 percent), but children
        in the lowest quintile are just as likely to be stunted whether they live in urban areas
        (48 percent) or in rural (49 percent).
    •	 Owning a toilet and having access to clean drinking water supply, as well as living in
        a community where most of one’s neighbors own a toilet, are important drivers of
        child growth and cognitive development.
    •	 Poor access to WASH is just one key driver of stunting and malnutrition, with food
        security, child care practices, and access to health care being additional factors.
    •	 Children who have simultaneous access to multiple determinants of nutrition are
        taller on average, but very few children meet this criteria, suggesting that the
        nutritional impact of sector-specific interventions may be limited by poor access to
        the other drivers of nutrition.




  Pathways of Exposure and Impacts on Health
  and Nutrition
  Poor quality latrines, inadequate fecal waste management, and open defecation are the main
  sources of environmental fecal contamination that cause disease. Pathogens in the environment
  are spread through drinking and washing water, hands, vectors (such as flies), and the soles of
  the feet or shoes. The “F-diagram” (figure 3.1) illustrates how these fecal pathogens can enter
  into the open environment, and illustrates the role that sanitation, clean water supply, and
  hygiene each play in blocking these contamination routes.

  The evidence underlying the F-diagram has recently expanded to show how children, in
  particular, face high risk of exposure (Mahmud and Mbuya 2015). For instance, a recent

                         study in Bangladesh found that 98 percent of soil samples from areas where small children
                         play tested positive for E. coli at extraordinarily high levels. Structured observations of
                         children in the study showed them frequently mouthing hands and objects that had touched
                         the soil, and 18 percent of children were observed putting soil directly into their mouths
                         (Ercumen et al. forthcoming). Infants and children also risk being fed water and food that has
                         become contaminated by poor hand hygiene, and by dirty utensils and containers used for
                         preparation, storage and serving. Food and water can be contaminated at a more macro level
                         due to inadequate management and disposal of feces, disposal of untreated wastewater
                         into water supply sources, and storm runoff. Due to a pregnant woman’s immune response,
                         and the permeability of the placenta to disease-causing pathogens, researchers hypothesize
                         that these risks can affect an unborn fetus (see box 3.1) (Campbell et al. 2015).

      	Stunting          Access to a safe water supply improves the overall disease environment and enables behaviors
       is caused         that influence child health and nutrition. Access to piped water in urban areas has been shown
       by multiple       to decrease infant mortality. For example, privatization of water services in Buenos Aires led to
       determinants,     improved access and service quality, resulting in an 8 percent reduction in child mortality from
       and sector-
       specific
                         infectious disease. In the poorest areas that benefited the most from the service expansion,
       interventions     child mortality declined by 26 percent (Galiani, Gertler, and Schardrogsky 2005). Lack of
       may have          access to a continuous source of safe water can have negative health consequences if
       limited impact.   households revert to using unimproved sources of water for even short periods of time (Hunter,
                         Zmirou-Navier, and Hartemann 2009). Adequate quantities of water are also needed to practice
                         hygiene behaviors such as handwashing, washing utensils and containers, and cleaning
                         objects and surfaces used by children (Howard and Bartram 2003).

                         A child who lives in an environment contaminated by feces is more likely to be infected by
                         disease-causing pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. An estimated
                         58 percent of diarrheal disease is due to poor water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (Prüss-Ustün
                         et al. 2014), causing the loss and malabsorption of nutrients. Protozoa and helminths (worms)
                         live in feces and are transmitted in water (schistosomiasis) and soil-transmitted helminths
                         (STH), causing infections that lead to anemia, malnutrition, stunted growth, and impaired physical
                         and cognitive development. These outcomes are associated with lower school attendance and
                         educational attainment—factors that limit future economic productivity (Victora et al. 2008).

       Box 3.1: Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene and their Effect on
       Maternal Health

       Poor water supply and sanitation can contribute to maternal outcomes through
       factors such as hygiene and quality of piped water and sewerage systems in the
       home or at a health facility where antenatal care or delivery takes place (Campbell
       et al. 2015).

       Direct evidence about the effect of household-level water supply, sanitation, and
       hygiene (WASH) availability on maternal outcomes in Indonesia is limited to a 2003
       study in Surabaya (Taguchi et al.), which found that lack of a toilet facility in the home
       more than doubled the probability of maternal mortality.

       Using panel data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), a sample of 456
       women who were pregnant at the time of the survey were tracked to a subsequent
       wave, and their pregnancy outcomes (live birth or miscarriage) observed. After
       controlling for other confounding factors, preliminary results suggest that having
       access to improved water at the time of pregnancy is associated with a 7 percentage
       point increase in the probability of a live birth. The increase is particularly associated
       with women living in rural areas where access to clean water is lower. Access to
       improved water also reduces the probability of miscarriage by 2 percentage points.
       Having an improved toilet in the home, or living in a community with high coverage of
       toilets at the time of pregnancy, was not associated with pregnancy outcomes.




  There is robust evidence that access to WASH decreases the incidence of diarrhea in young
  children. Synthetic review and meta-analysis of health impact assessments of water and
  sanitation interventions (Wolf et al. 2014) show water interventions reduce diarrhea morbidity
  by 34 percent, sanitation interventions reduce it by 28 percent, and promotion of handwashing
  with soap results in a 40 percent reduction (Freeman et al. 2014). The largest health effects
  for improved water are for piped water supply, with a greater benefit associated with higher
  quality piped water—water that is safe and continuously available (Wolf et al. 2014).

  Open defecation and poor sanitation are harmful not only to those who lack access to toilets,      	   Stunting reflects
  but—due to externalities—to other households in the community as well. Researchers have                the cumulative
  demonstrated across countries and data sets that the health benefits of sanitation mostly              effects of
  accrue as sanitation becomes universal (Andres et al. 2014; Hunter and Prüss-Ustün 2016;               infection and
                                                                                                         undernutrition,
  Larsen et al. 2017). A number of randomized controlled trials of household sanitation                  and is regarded
  interventions have failed to demonstrate health impacts (Clasen et al. 2014; Patil et al. 2014),       as the non-
  and researchers hypothesize that this is due to insufficient community-wide coverage and               income face
  behavior change. The implication is that sanitation interventions that fail to adequately reduce       of poverty.
  the pathogen load in the environment will not achieve substantial nutritional impacts.


  Growing Tall and Smart with WASH
  Researchers have recently begun to look at the impacts of WASH on stunting. This work points
  to environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), or poor gut function, caused by repeated ingestion
  of fecal bacteria (Humphrey 2009) as the primary pathway linking unsafe WASH to poor health
  and nutrition outcomes, especially stunting. A child who suffers from EED is less able to

                                    becomes more porous, and disease-causing pathogens enter the bloodstream more easily,
                                    activating an immune response and diverting energy from human growth. These conditions do
                                    not produce overt symptoms like diarrhea, making them harder to track and quantify, although
                                    estimates suggest that up to 43 percent of stunting may be due to these silent infections

  The Stubborn Problem of Child Stunting in
  Indonesia and Linkages with WASH
  Stunting is a severe and persistent problem in Indonesia, where an estimated 9 million children        	   In a six-year
  under five (37 percent) are stunted (RISKESDAS 2013). This situates Indonesia just behind                  period (2007–13),
  India in terms of the share of children who are stunted.1 Stunting is chronic undernutrition—              rates of stunting
  defined as a child whose length/height is below minus 2 standard deviations of the median                  in the poorest

  overall human development. Stunting has lifelong adverse consequences for cognitive
  development, human capital, productivity, earnings, and intergenerational transmission of
  poverty (Victora et al. 2008).

  The prevalence of stunting is widespread and distributed across the Indonesian archipelago
  (map 3.1). In rural areas the prevalence of stunting is 42 percent, while in urban areas it is 33
  percent (Skoufias 2016). Although stunting rates are higher in rural areas, research has shown
  that slum populations are particularly at risk—more so than rural and urban (total) populations
  (FAO 2017).

  The prevalence of stunting varies by wealth quintile (figure 3.3). A striking 29 percent of children
  in the topmost quintile are stunted, while 49 percent are stunted in the bottommost (Skoufias
  2016). Furthermore, more children in the poorest households were stunted in 2013 than in
  2007, rising from 43 percent in 2007 to 49 percent in 2013; the same is not true for wealthier
  households, where rates of stunting are declining.2 Children in wealthier households were
  5 percentage points less likely to be stunted in 2013 than in 2007. Therefore, whereas in 2007
  the difference in stunting rates between children from the poorest households and those from
  the wealthiest households was 10 points, by 2013 it had increased to 20 points.

  There is no clear pattern in trends of stunting prevalence across districts between 2007
  and 2013. In the maps below (map 3.2), the upper panel shows changes in stunting rates for
  those districts where the stunting rate in 2007 was above the national stunting rate of
  36.8 percent; the lower panel shows changes in stunting rates for those districts where the
  stunting rate in 2007 was below 36.8 percent. In both panels, districts in green saw a more
  than four percentage point decrease in stunting between 2007 and 2013, while those in red
  saw a more than four percentage point increase in stunting. Many of the districts with stunting
  rates above the national average in 2007 had lower stunting rates in 2013, and many of the
  districts with stunting rates below the national average in 2007 had a higher prevalence of

  Child Stunting and Cognitive Impacts of Water and
  Sanitation in Indonesia
  The WASH Poverty Diagnostic used panel data from the IFLS to analyze associations between             	   Stunting has
  access to WASH in utero and in the first 2 years of life, and nutrition and cognitive outcomes for        lifelong effects

  was used to explore the relationship between community open defecation and child nutrition and            development,
                                                                                                            earnings, and
  cognitive outcomes. The analysis shows that children living in villages (urban and rural combined)

  score higher on cognitive tests than children in villages with a lower proportion of toilets. Two-
  thirds of the gains in average height-for-age z-scores (HAZ)3 accrue after a threshold of around
  60 percent coverage of improved sanitation is surpassed (figure 3.4). Data from the 2013 round
  of RISKESDAS show that just 27 percent of children in rural settings and 62 percent in urban
  settings are living in communities where coverage of sanitation is at adequate levels of 75 percent
  or above (Skoufias 2016), putting the majority of children, especially in rural areas, at risk.

  Regression analysis was used to examine the effect of three independent variables of
  interest on the nutrition and cognitive outcomes of Indonesian children. The three variables
  are: household-level sanitation, community-level sanitation, and access to improved
  household-level water sources during the window of opportunity (from the time a child is in
  utero until 2 years of age). Outcomes include a child’s cognitive test scores from the 2007
  round of IFLS when a child is between the ages of 7 and 16, and anthropometric outcomes,
  including stunting, underweight, HAZ, and weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ), measured when a

  Not by WASH Alone: How Multisectoral Interventions
  Help Improve Nutrition

  Operationalizing a Multisectoral Approach for the Reduction of
  Stunting in Indonesia
  Stunting is widely understood to be caused by multiple underlying factors, including
  food insecurity, poor child care practices, and lack of access to health services, water, and
  sanitation. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) conceptual framework of child
  undernutrition, initially proposed in 1990 (UNICEF 1990), was one of the first attempts to
  emphasize household food security, WASH services, and maternal and child care practices as
  the main underlying determinants of child nutrition in developing countries. A fundamental
  premise of this conceptual framework is that increases in access to adequate services in
  any  one of the drivers of nutrition—for example, food security alone—cannot substitute
  for  inadequate levels of access to the other determinants. While there is widespread
  acknowledgment of the key underlying determinants of nutrition, there is limited quantitative
  information on the interdependence of adequate (or inadequate) access to the determinants
  for child nutrition.

  The WASH Poverty Diagnostic undertook an econometric analysis to quantify the relationships
  between and interdependence of the determinants of child nutrition outcomes using the
  2007 and 2013 RISKESDAS surveys. Indicators were constructed for four groups of child
  nutrition determinants proposed in the UNICEF framework—child care practices, health,
  environment (water and sanitation), and food security (CHEF).6 Each indicator is comprised of
  various components, depending on the data available in the survey, with the definition of
  “adequacy” based on national and/or accepted international standards.7 In consideration of
  the complexity of the linkages between the underlying determinants of nutrition and the
  economic situation of the family, the analysis is also carried out separately for urban and rural
  households, and for resource-rich T60 and resource-poor B40 households, as well as for
  districts with high stunting rates and those with low stunting rates. A more holistic view is
  provided regarding the extent to which adequate levels of the four determinants—food
  security; adequate caregiving resources at the maternal, household, and community levels;
  access to health services; and a safe and hygienic environment—are, both on their own and
  in combination, associated with better nutrition as measured by HAZ and stunting rates.

  In Indonesia, survey results indicate overall low levels of access to the key drivers of nutritional
  health. Nationally, in 2013, just 7 percent of children under 5 had access to adequate child
  care practices—defined by factors such as early and appropriate breastfeeding, handwashing,
  a smoke-free home environment, and complementary feeding. A similarly low percentage of
  children (14 percent) had access to adequate food, such as protein, calories, exclusive
  breastfeeding, and nutrition of the mother. About 56 percent of children had access to basic
  drinking water and improved sanitation, including adequate levels of community coverage of
  sanitation, and 46 percent had access to adequate health services such as prenatal care,
  vitamin A, and immunizations.

  Substantial inequalities in access to adequate levels of CHEF determinants remain between              	   The health
  rural and urban areas, between districts with high and low stunting rates, and between poorer              benefits of
  and wealthier households. In 2013 fewer children in rural areas had access to all four drivers             sanitation
  of nutrition than children in urban areas. The largest discrepancy was in access to an adequate            mostly accrue
                                                                                                             as sanitation
  environment, with only around 40 percent of those in rural areas having access and around                  becomes
  70 percent of those in urban areas having access. Access to an adequate environment is also                universal and
  the nutrition driver showing the largest differences between wealth quintiles. Only 1 percent              pathogens in
  of children in the lowest wealth quintile had access to an adequate environment, whereas in                the environment
  the highest quintile 92 percent of the children had access to an adequate environment                      are adequately
                                                                                                             reduced.

Improving Service Levels and Impact on the Poor	                                                                               23
      Access to all four CHEF determinants is exceedingly uncommon, suggesting that nutritional
      impacts of sector-specific interventions may be limited by inadequate access to the underlying
      drivers of nutrition. In 2013, 23 percent of children between 0 and 5 years of age did not have
      adequate access to any of the four determinants of nutrition, while less than 1 percent of
      children had simultaneous access to all four key underlying determinants of nutrition. For the
      poorest 20 percent of children, 68 percent lack adequate access to all four determinants.

      Children under 5 in Indonesia with simultaneous access to adequate levels of two of the four
      drivers of nutrition have higher mean height for age z-scores. Stunting rates are even lower
      among children with simultaneous access to adequate levels of three of the four drivers of
      nutrition (figure 3.5). These children had a 13.4 percent lower likelihood of stunting, compared
      to the reference group without access to any drivers, whose rate of stunting is 41.4 percent.
      This pattern is consistent across rural and urban areas, and for children living in households
      in the top 60 percent of the wealth distribution. These results illustrate the importance of
      coordinated multisectoral policies and suggest that the success of “sector-specific nutrition-
      sensitive” initiatives could be enhanced by better coordination and integration across sectors
      to effectively address multiple underlying determinants of nutrition.

      In the next chapter, the report turns to the core diagnostics of the water supply and sanitation
      sector in Indonesia, including recent trends in access and quality, disparities across geography
      and income groups, and key service delivery challenges facing the sector. The chapter begins
      with a diagnostic of the sanitation sector, both urban and rural, and then turns to urban and
      rural water supply. The trends and patterns described provide overall guidance on sector policy
      priorities, particularly as they relate to the B40. However, the list of challenges described is not
      necessarily exhaustive, and is limited in the sense that it uses existing data and evidence
      (primary data collection was not part of the WASH Poverty Diagnostic in Indonesia). These
      trends and patterns, along with recent sector studies and reports and global experience and
      evidence, form the basis of the policy recommendations in chapter 6. For the urban water sub-
      sector, the policy recommendations benefit from an in-depth institutional and political economy
      analysis described in chapter 5. Additional analytical work could shed further light on some of
      the challenges discussed for urban sanitation, rural sanitation, and rural water, and lead to
      more targeted policy recommendations (see chapter 6).

  WASH Service Delivery
  Progress and Challenges
  in Indonesia

    Core Question: What is the level of access and quality of WASH services experienced
    by the poor and bottom 40 percent as compared to the non-poor and top 60 percent?

                                                Key facts

      ••   Since the launch of the STBM, access to improved sanitation has grown at
           6.5 percent annually, but there are still 47 million people defecating in the open and
           another 52 million using sanitation that is considered unsafe.

      ••   76 percent of the population in urban areas has improved sanitation compared with
           just 48 percent in rural areas, a gap of 28 percentage points.

      ••   District poverty rates do not neatly correspond with either levels of access or equity of
           access to improved sanitation at the district level; some poor districts are doing a better
           job than wealthier districts, and a far better job than some of their poorer peers.

      ••   Despite there being no significant difference in poverty levels between Java and
           non-Java districts, Java districts have achieved higher levels of coverage overall for
           both B40 and T60 households.

      ••   B40 households are not achieving higher levels of service in rural areas, which is
           contributing to the widening gap in access to improved sanitation between the
           B40 and T60.

      ••   In urban areas, 95 percent of fecal waste makes its way into the nearby environment
           through the process of containment, emptying, transport, and disposal, despite
           high coverage (78 percent) of on-site septic tanks.

      ••   While trends in access have increased in parallel since 2002, 80 percent of the
           population in urban areas has access to improved drinking water supply, compared
           to just 60 percent in rural areas.

      ••   Gaps in access to improved water between B40 and T60 households remain, most
           starkly in urban areas.

      ••   Hibah-participating kotas demonstrate higher, but not necessarily more equitable,
           access to piped water supply.

      ••   Data on water quality suggest that the potential risk of contamination is severe,
           especially in more dense urban settings.




Improving Service Levels and Impact on the Poor	                                                         29
                            In 2015 the WHO/UNICEF JMP estimated that access to improved drinking water was
                            87  percent in Indonesia, a 39 percentage point increase since 1990, and access to
                            improved sanitation was 61 percent, a 36 percentage point increase. Indonesia achieved
                            the MDG target for water, and while good progress was made towards the sanitation goal, it
                            was not achieved. There are still close to 100 million people without improved sanitation
                            and 33 million without improved drinking water, according to the JMP for global monitoring
                            purposes WHO and UNICEF (2015). When considering inequalities in access, Joint
                            Monitoring Programme (JMP) estimates show that overall access levels to sanitation are
                            lower among the poor and lower in rural areas. The B40 households—especially those in
                            rural areas—have not gained access to improved sanitation at the same rate as their T60
                            counterparts. Trends for drinking water appear more equitable, although a relatively low
                            share of the rural population drinks piped water on premises (figure 4.1). The sharp increase
                            in unimproved drinking water is partly due to households—particularly those in the upper
                            wealth quintiles in urban areas—drinking bottled water as their primary source, which JMP
                            does not categorize as improved. As discussed in this report, the vast majority of bottled
                            water users have access to another source of improved water, reflecting a change in
                            preferences rather than access.


                            Stopping Open Defecation in Indonesia:
                            A Global Success Story
                            In 2015 the WHO/UNICEF JMP estimated that access to improved sanitation was 61 percent,
                            a 36 percentage point increase since 1990 (WHO and UNICEF 2015).1 Although this increase
                            was substantial, it fell short of achieving the MDG sanitation target of reducing by half the
                            proportion of the population without access to sanitation. While there are still close to 100
                            million people without improved sanitation, Indonesia has become a global success story due
                            to the rapid and sustained reduction in the practice of open defecation that was achieved in
                            less than a decade.

                            Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) was adopted nationwide in 2005, leading to the launch
                            of the STBM by MoH in 2008. These combined approaches and programs heralded a major
                            shift in the trajectory of sanitation in the country, and between 2006 and 2015 access to
                            improved sanitation grew at 6.5 percent annually, up from an annual growth rate of 3.4 percent
                            in the years between 2002 and 2004. STBM is a community-based total sanitation strategy
                            focused on behavior change at the household and community levels to cut off contamination
                            pathways for E. coli, a primary pathogen causing diarrheal disease. STBM includes 5 pillars:
                            (1) stop open defecation (including using a community “triggering” approach to motivate people
                            to stop open defecation); (2) handwashing with soap; (3) household safe water treatment
                            and storage, and safe food handling; (4) safe disposal and management of solid waste; and
                            (5) safe disposal and management of wastewater. The open defecation pillar of STBM was a
                            major departure from previous publicly funded toilet construction programs in Indonesia as it
                            explicitly shunned household subsidies and embraced a community mobilization approach to
                            stopping open defecation.

      	STBM                 The STBM program approached the open defecation problem from three directions, with the
       prioritized an       aim of achieving “total sanitation.” It aimed to improve the enabling policy environment to
       improved policy      make sanitation a priority for LGs, to create demand for safe sanitation and hygiene through
       environment,         community empowerment and behavior change, and to improve the supply of sanitation
       demand
       creation, and        products and services so that households had access to the materials they needed at a price
       sanitation service   they could afford. The program only provided subsidies to build communal sanitation facilities
       improvement          and implemented a community award to incentivize achievement and sustainability of total
       to address the       sanitation. STBM has mainly been a rural-focused program, but was recently expanded to
       open defecation      urban settings.
       problem.

                            Sanitation Coverage and Associations with Poverty
      	   Where people      At provincial level, there is no clear correlation between poverty and access to improved
          live—not just     sanitation, pointing to the presence of other factors affecting sanitation coverage. The following
          how much          map (map 4.1) shows the geographic dispersion of poverty and access rates at provincial level
          they earn—        for the most recent year data are available (2015). Some provinces with above average poverty
          determines
          access to         rates have above average sanitation coverage, while others with below average poverty rates
          improved water    have below average sanitation. For example, the provinces that make up the island of Java
          and sanitation.   mostly have above average poverty levels, but also enjoy above average access, while the
                            Western Indonesian island of Sumatra generally has lower levels of access irrespective of
                            poverty levels. Eastern Indonesia—especially Papua, Maluku, East Nusa Tenggara, and Central
                            and West Sulawesi—has high poverty levels and low access, while Southeast Sulawesi and
                            West Papua have above average levels of access despite having above average levels of
                            poverty. These findings point to the presence of factors other than poverty that influence
                            sanitation coverage. These are explored in map 4.1.

                            At district level there is a trend toward improvement in sanitation coverage over time, but
                            there is wide variance across districts and not only according to poverty levels (figure 4.2).
                            There are some poor districts that are doing a better job than wealthier districts with
                            regard to sanitation coverage, and a far better job than some of their poorer peers. The
                            implication of these discrepancies is that strategies that improve coverage in low-poverty
                            districts may be vastly different from those that would work in high-poverty districts. To
                            date, the national STBM program has relied on community empowerment and behavior

  change—an approach that may work better in some areas than others due to many
  underlying factors, including the quality of program implementation (Cameron et al. 2017),
  levels of social capital in the community (Cameron et al. 2015), and participation of local
  champions. Another contextual factor could be population density. Lower population
  density may make it more difficult to mobilize households and bring the community together
  to “trigger” behavior change. For rural sanitation, district investment priorities and fiscal
  capacity likely play a smaller role, since government expenditures on infrastructure and
  implementation of STBM are minor.

  Poverty rates do not neatly correspond with either levels of access or equity of access to
  improved sanitation at the district level. Each pair of bars in figure 4.3 illustrates the share of
  the T60 and B40 with access to improved sanitation in the district (n=412) and the district
  poverty rate (the national average poverty rate in 2015 of 11.2 percent is represented by the
  red line). Almost all districts show higher coverage among the T60. While a larger concentration
  of high-poverty districts are clustered in the left side of the figure, where overall access levels
  are lower, both above average and below average poverty districts are found across the
  distribution of coverage levels.

  Distinguishing between Java and non-Java districts reveals a noticeable difference in coverage
  levels between B40 and T60 households (figure 4.4). Despite there being no significant
  difference in poverty levels between Java and non-Java districts (12 and 13 percent, respectively),
  Java districts have achieved higher levels of coverage overall for both B40 and T60 households.
  The average level of improved sanitation coverage among B40 in non-Java districts is 35 percent,
  compared with 51 percent in Java districts, while it is 67 percent among T60 in Java districts,
  compared with 51 percent in non-Java. While the average gap between B40 and T60 households
  is similar across Java and non-Java districts, there is more variation in the gap in non-Java
  districts. In addition, there appears to be a slight downward trend in the gap in Java districts
  as higher levels of coverage are achieved.

      Place seems to be a stronger driver of access to sanitation than poverty. Both urban and rural
      areas have achieved substantial progress in sanitation since 2002, with the steepest gains
      seen in rural areas—a difference likely due to those areas having had lower levels of access
      to begin with. In 2002 just 18 percent of the rural population had improved sanitation and
      41 percent were defecating in the open. In 2015 these figures were 48 percent and 20 percent
      respectively. While these gains were large, rural areas have not yet reached the levels of
      access seen in urban areas. The most recent data for 2015 show that 76 percent of the
      population in urban areas have improved sanitation compared with just 48 percent in rural
      areas, a gap of 28 percentage points (figure 4.5).

      Moreover, households in the T60 of the income distribution are more likely to have access to
      sanitation facilities within urban or rural areas, but the same is not true across these areas
      (figure 4.6). The B40 in rural areas are most likely to defecate in the open—29 percent do
      not have a toilet, compared with 15 percent of the T60; in urban areas, 12 percent of the
      B40 and 3 percent of the T60 do not have a toilet. In other words, households belonging to
      the top 60 percent of the income distribution in rural areas are worse off than those in the
      bottom 40 in urban areas. A possible explanation could be the fundamental assumptions of
      the STBM approach, requiring LGs to conduct community empowerment and behavior
      change activities, and households to seek out and procure their own materials to improve
      their sanitation. Low-density rural settings can make these requirements particularly
      challenging.

      While coverage of sanitation is higher in urban areas, the location within a city seems to
      have an effect on access. Cities in Indonesia face challenges to service delivery driven
      by rapid population increase, inadequate planning, and underinvestment in infrastructure.
      In four of Indonesia’s largest cities—Jakarta, Medan, Surabaya, and Makassar—the
      suburban or peripheries of these cities have both higher levels of poverty and lower levels
      of access than core urban centers (figure 4.7). In Makassar coverage is 25 percentage

  points lower in suburban areas than in the city’s core. In Jakarta the difference is
  15  percentage points. Suburban areas of Makassar also have higher levels of poverty
  (8 percent) than does Makassar’s core (1 percent). In contrast, there is a 15 percentage
  point gap in access between the Jakarta core and Jakarta suburban areas, yet rates of
  poverty are the same (3 percent). In all cities, progress is notable in the periphery areas—
  doubling or near doubling access since 2002. These areas now enjoy higher levels of
  access than the national average, although they still lag behind the urban cores. Urban
  slums remain a major challenge in Indonesian cities and are a visible marker of urban
  poverty and the gaps in access to basic infrastucture. An estimated 22 percent of
  Indonesia’s urban population (approximately 29 million people) is living in slums with low
  levels of access to basic services. In 2014, it was estimated that 30  percent of slum
  dwellers (9 million people) lacked safe drinking water, and 37 percent (11 million people)
  lacked sanitation.2

  Second Generation Challenges for Rural Indonesia:
  Moving up the “Sanitation Ladder”
  There are still 47 million people defecating in the open in Indonesia and another 52 million using                	   Despite improved
  sanitation that is considered unsafe, most of these living in rural areas. When access to improved                    access to
  sanitation began to accelerate in 2007 on the heels of the new national strategy and total                            sanitation in
  sanitation program, the acceleration for rural households was higher in the top three consumption                     urban areas, high
                                                                                                                        levels of fecal
  quintiles, and that gap has persisted to the present (figure 4.8). The most recent evidence                           contamination
  points to a gap in access to improved sanitation in rural areas of 20 percentage points (2015).                       persist.

  Open defecation has declined at similar rates in the B40 and T60 since 2002, but B40 households
  were more likely to move to basic latrines,3 contributing to the widening gap in access to improved
  sanitation between the B40 and T60. This finding is consistent with a 2011 Impact Evaluation
  of STBM in East Java, which found that poor households— defined in the study as those in the
  bottom 20 percent of the distribution of non-land assets—did not improve their sanitation as a
  result of the program, while those in the top 80 percent were more likely to construct toilets, stop
  defecating in the open, and correctly dispose of child feces (Cameron and Shah 2011).

  In 2015 more than half (55 percent) of the households in rural areas either had no toilet or were
  using unimproved latrines. Poor quality pit latrines fail to adequately isolate human waste from
  the environment and create breeding grounds for flies and other vectors that spread disease.
  The largest share of unimproved sanitation for the most recent year of data (2015) are facilities
  that dispose of waste into fields, water bodies, or open land, essentially equivalent to open
  defecation. Analysis using RISKESDAS data for 2013 shows that in rural settings only 27
  percent of children live in communities with sanitation coverage greater than 75 percent, but
  evidence from Indonesia shows that two-thirds of the gains in average height-for-age z-scores
  (HAZ) accrue after a threshold of around 60 percent percent coverage is surpassed, and that
  full benefits may only be achieved when coverage becomes universal. As a result, the majority
  of children in rural areas are exposed to a contaminated environment even if they themselves

      US$119, equivalent to 94 percent of one month’s average (reported) household income (Chase
      and Briceno unpublished report). Such a large lump sum outlay can be impossible for poor
      households to afford, but credit and formal savings products that would allow households to
      spread payments over time are not widespread, limiting the ability of poor households to invest
      in improved sanitation.



      Why High Levels of Sanitation in Urban Settings
      Have Not Fully Eliminated Fecal Contamination
      Despite high levels of access to improved sanitation in urban settings, low levels of service
      quality and a heavy reliance on households to manage their fecal waste result in massive
      levels of environmental contamination. The vast majority of households (78 percent) in urban
      areas use an improved toilet connected to a septic or sewerage system (“septic tanks” or,
      more often, pit latrines or soak pits); of this 78 percent, less than 2 percent are estimated to
      be sewerage connections. Lateral sewers and household connections are often excluded from
      central government and development partner investments, resulting in 50 percent idle capacity
      on average for existing networks in 13 cities (World Bank 2015). At the same time, while there
      has been an increase in construction of septage treatment plants, these investments have not
      been followed by improvements to fecal sludge management or upgrades to on-site sanitation.
      An assessment conducted by MoPWH in 2012 found that over 90 percent of existing sludge
      treatment plants built since 1990 (n=150) are no longer operational or are poorly performing.
      As a result of these conditions, most fecal waste (95 percent) makes its way into the nearby
      environment through the process of containment, emptying, transport, and disposal (figure 4.9).
      The remaining 5 percent of fecal waste is delivered to a treatment plant, but even these plants
      are in desperate need of improvement.

      Conditions of high population density and inadequate fecal waste disposal interact to make
      poor sanitation particularly risky for the health of populations in urban areas. Thirty-eight percent
      of children in urban settings live in communities with coverage of sanitation below 75 percent
      (Skoufias 2016). However, the measure of “community” used in this study is less meaningful
      in urban settings, where biological contaminants can rapidly spread among urban populations
      through groundwater supplies and piped water systems, and during heavy rains and flooding.

  For example, in Jakarta, where an estimated 63 percent of waste is being discharged into the
  ground untreated, four-fifths of the economic losses associated with existing sanitation
  conditions—estimated at US$1.4 billion per year (or US$139 per person)—can be attributed
  to health-related impacts (World Bank 2016c). A  recent study shows that children living in
  households with poor fecal waste disposal practices, such as toilets that discharge directly into
  drains, had 3.78 times higher prevalence of enteric infection than children in other households,
  including those without toilets (Berendes et al. 2017).

  On-site sanitation systems in Indonesian cities do not achieve effluent quality standards,
  especially in challenging environments.4 Recent research has shown that not one of the seven
  types of on-site sanitation systems sampled in five cities was in compliance with effluent
  standards of less than 3,000/100 mL fecal coliform (figure 4.10). Most on-site sanitation in
  Indonesia is based on the anaerobic system, which does not reduce microbiological content,
  allowing untreated or partially treated wastewater to seep into the ground. The absence of
  practical national standards for on-site sanitation systems in challenging areas, inadequate
  quality of construction, and lack of knowledge on operations and maintenance are additional
  factors leading to high fecal coliform counts (World Bank 2017 Forthcoming).


  The Evolution of Drinking Water Supply in Indonesia
  In 2015 the WHO/UNICEF JMP concluded that Indonesia had achieved the MDG target on
  drinking water supply. An estimated 87 percent of the population had access to improved
  drinking water in 2015—a 39 percentage point increase since 1990. Due to different calculation
  methods, GoI estimated 70 percent coverage of improved drinking water (see box 1.1 for an
  explanation of the calculation method),5 which translates into annual growth of 2.7 percent
  between 2002 and 2015.

  Still, there are notable disparities in access to improved water supply and type of water source
  between urban and rural settings. While access to improved water supply has increased in
  parallel for urban and rural areas since 2002, in urban areas 80 percent of the population has
  access, compared with only 60 percent in rural areas (figure 4.11). A small share of the
  population (3 percent) continues to use surface water in rural areas, down from 5 percent in

            Box 4.1: Increased Bottled Water Usage Distorts Trends in Access to Piped
            Water Supply: Data and Definitions

            The rapid expansion of bottled water usage and household preferences for drinking
            bottled water can distort access trends if analyses fail to account for other household
            sources of water.

            Until 2011, bottled water for drinking was not considered an improved or sustainable
            source of drinking water in official statistics. However, as bottled water use began to
            increase—from less than 2 percent in 2002 to 29.5 percent in 2015—the rise led
            to distorted access figures for other water sources, most notably piped water.

            In response, Susenas began collecting data in 2011 on the source of water used for
            bathing and washing for households whose primary drinking water source is bottled
            water. These surveys show that the vast majority of bottled water drinkers use
            another source of improved water in the home for bathing and washing (surveys
            available for the years 2011 to 2015). Since 2011, bottled water has been classified
            as an improved source if the household uses a safe and sustainable water source
            for bathing and washing. Thus, 92 percent of bottled water users are classified as
            having improved water.

  2002; a larger share of rural households uses protected wells (28 percent) and springs (15
  percent) than use them in urban areas (16 and 3 percent, respectively). Just 6 percent of rural
  households use tap water as their primary source of drinking water, compared with 16 percent
  of urban households. Notably, 44 and 14 percent of urban and rural households respectively
  drink bottled water as their primary source (box 4.1).


  Drinking Water Access and the Poor
  As of 2015 there are still an estimated 20 million households in Indonesia using unimproved                       	   Disparities persist in
  drinking water sources. Of these 20 million unserved households, the majority—13.5 million—                           access to improved
  are located in rural areas, and 43 percent of these (5.8 million households) were classified as                       drinking water
  poor and vulnerable. Nevertheless, inequalities in access to improved drinking water by income                        between poor and
                                                                                                                        wealthy households,
  distribution are modest and have lessened over time. Figure 4.12 shows the extent of income-                          and between
  related inequality in access to improved drinking water between households at different points                        urban and rural
  along the income distribution. The diagonal line in the graph represents perfect equality—in                          populations.
  other words, when the share of the population in the first 20 percent of the income distribution
  accounts for a 20 percent share of access to drinking water. Between 2002 and 2007 there
  was no change in inequality in access, but a trend towards greater equality in access can be
  seen between 2007 and 2015. In 2015 the bottom 20 percent accounted for approximately
  17 percent of those with access to drinking water.

  Despite these improvements, there are still gaps in access to improved water between B40
  and T60 households. While the gaps are greater in urban areas, they are growing in rural areas.
  In 2015 the gap in access to improved water in urban areas dropped to 14 percentage points—
  returning to its 2002 level—although the gap had been trending at around 17 percentage
  points since 2010. In rural areas, there was a 10 percentage point gap between B40 and
  T60 in access to improved water in 2015. The gap has steadily increased from 6 percentage
  points in 2002.

  The driver of the growing gap in access to improved water sources in rural areas is not clear
  from existing data. The government’s main platform for expanding access to rural water supply,

      PAMSIMAS, targets underserved and low-income communities. The program began in 2006,
      and by the end of its second phase in 2015 it had reportedly provided access to clean drinking
      water for an estimated 9 million beneficiaries, or 3.5 percent of the population in Indonesia
      (PAMSIMAS 2015). Program data for the years 2012 to 2015 indicate the vast majority of
      water services provided were piped, with nearly equal numbers of beneficiaries identified as
      poor and non-poor6 (figure 4.13).

  Whether improved or unimproved, the source of drinking water reported by households differs
  by consumption quintile. Household data by consumption quintile show that the use of piped
  (tap) water for drinking has declined across all quintiles, but most dramatically in the top-most
  quintile. There were also large declines in the use of well water, both protected and unprotected,
  across all quintiles. Using bottled water for drinking has increased by 50 percentage points
  in  the top quintile and 12 percentage points in the poorest 20 percent of households by
  consumption (figure 4.14).


  Location Matters: Subnational Estimates of Access
  to Water Supply and Associations with Poverty
  As with sanitation, access to improved drinking water is strongly determined by geographic
  location. Coverage of improved drinking water is higher in T60 households than in B40
  households. However, being in an urban setting is a stronger determinant of access: B40
  households in urban areas are better off than T60 households in rural settings (figure 4.15).
  In 2015, 37 percent of rural households drank unimproved water. Households in high-poverty
  rural districts were less likely to drink piped water as their primary source, and the overall
  proportion of piped water (including public taps from small rural piped systems) is low
  (7 percent) compared with urban areas.

  There is not a clear association between district poverty rates and access to piped water in
  urban districts (kotas). Each pair of bars in figure 4.16 illustrates the share of T60 and B40
  households with access to piped water (including primary and secondary sources) in that
  district, with the district poverty rate represented by a diamond. In the majority of kotas there
  is little to no gap; 29 percent of kotas have higher levels of access among the T60, and 34

                                                 percent of kotas have higher levels of access among the B40. Districts with above average
                                                 poverty rates are mostly clustered in the lower half of the distribution, but most of the kotas
                                                 have below average poverty. Some districts are doing much better than others, irrespective of
                                                 poverty.

                                                 Hibah-participating kotas show higher, but not necessarily more equitable, access to piped
                                                 water supply. The performance-based Water Hibah program has contributed to an estimated
                                                 265,000 piped water supply connections for poor urban households in 151 LGs since 2012
                                                 (Indii 2014a). For the 26 Hibah-participating kotas, access to piped water supply is significantly
                                                 higher (5 percent) than in non-Hibah participating kotas for both T60 and B40 households.

  However, there is no statistically significant difference in the average gap in access between
  T60 and B40 households (figure 4.17) across the two groups of districts.7 Hibah-participating
  districts had a larger gap in access between T60 and B40 than non-Hibah participating districts
  did in 2012 (13.5 percent vs. 10.3 percent p=0.13). The gap declined for both groups
  of  districts in 2015, but remained larger in Hibah-participating districts (11.0 percent vs.
  8.4 percent p=0.20). However, this does not necessarily imply that the Hibah program is not
  achieving its pro-poor objectives, since the evidence suggests that the program indeed targets
  kotas with larger gaps in access to begin with.

  Small and big cities increased the share of households with piped water connections between
  2011 and 2015, despite rapid population growth averaging around 2 percent per year
  (figure 4.18). Piped water connections in metropolitan areas declined by 2.8 percentage points
  over the period between 2011 and 2015, and these cities also experienced growth of
  2.5 percentage points per year. While Jakarta experienced one of the lowest population growth
  rates (1.2 percent) among cities categories,8 the share of households in Jakarta with piped
  connections declined by 1 percentage point. Medium-sized cities of between 100,000 and

                                                  coming from wells, boreholes and protected springs; 73 percent for piped water; and 52
                                                  percent for bottled water. The fact that 73 percent of samples from piped water sources
                                                  were contaminated even after reported treatment suggests that the water is not being
                                                  properly treated, is not treated to the same degree as water from other sources, or is
                                                  becoming re-contaminated due to unhygienic storage (not covered and/or exposed to direct
                                                  contact with flies, dust, and dirt).

                                                  Available evidence suggests that PDAM water quality is likely to be a significant problem,
                                                  especially with dilapidated piped networks, groundwater contamination, intermittent service,
                                                  and low pressure. There is limited public transparency regarding PDAM water quality results,
                                                  and MoH reports that only 23 percent of drinking water is currently tested for quality, with a
                                                  target of just 50 percent by 2019 (MoH 2015). Indeed, District water utility (PDAMs) are not

  legally required to provide clean water: the current Regulation on Drinking Water Supply
  Systems (Government Regulation No. 122/2015) allows PDAMs to provide water that requires
  one further stage of treatment before drinking, placing the burden on households to treat piped
  water before drinking.

  Groundwater quality is not consistently monitored, but available evidence indicates that the
  potential risk for contamination is severe, especially in dense urban settings. A study of
  groundwater quality in large cities in Java shows high levels of contamination from septic

      tanks and untreated domestic wastewater, as well as landfill and industrial effluent
      contamination.10 In 2015, 57 percent of the B40 in urban areas used groundwater sources,
      a decline from 73  percent in 2002. A smaller proportion of the T60, 32 percent, used
      groundwater sources (figure 4.20). Although use of groundwater for drinking is declining,
      estimates show an increasing share of households are using a protected groundwater
      source for purposes other than drinking. Leaving aside industrial and other forms of
      contamination, nearly half (43 percent) of “protected” groundwater sources used by the
      B40 are less than 10 meters from an excreta disposal site such as a cubluk (wet pit latrine)
      or septic tank (often poorly constructed and not properly sealed). Adding these to the
      unprotected sources implies that in 2015 over a quarter (27 percent) of the B40 drink
      unsafe groundwater, though this has fallen from over half (52 percent) in 2002. For the T60,
      meanwhile, the share has fallen from 35 to 14 percent. Contaminated groundwater is
      particularly an issue in urban settings where there is overcrowding, poor quality septic tanks,
      and lack of fecal waste management.

      Building on the challenges identified in this chapter, the following chapter will outline the
      constraints on, and opportunities for, delivery of piped water services to the poor in urban
      settings. Although piped water service delivery in urban settings is not the only challenge
      facing the water sector and the GoI, it was prioritized for deeper investigation on the basis of
      current patterns in equity of access, rapid urbanization in Indonesian cities, and the underlying
      financial and performance hurdles in the urban water sector, which together present a unique
      challenge to extending access to low-income households.


      Notes
      1.	 The GoI applies stricter criteria to classify improved sanitation and only considers private
          or shared pour flush latrines that dispose of feces in a septic tank as improved, estimating
          that 62 percent of the population had access to improved sanitation in 2015.

  Urban Water Service
  Delivery Constraints on
  and Opportunities for
  Reaching the Poor

    Core Question: What are the WASH service-delivery constraints and potential solutions to
    improving services to the poor and bottom 40 percent?

                                              Key facts

    •	 The GoI’s 100-0-100 target is for universal access to improved water supply, but
        current patterns in equity of access to piped water suggest that low-income
        households are likely to remain on a non-piped service for longer than T60
        households.

    •	 The   barriers preventing low-income households from accessing piped water
        connections include (a) government budget allocation and spending; (b) financial
        sustainability and performance of PDAMs; (c) perceptions and behavioral constraints;
        and (d) legal frameworks for equitable service delivery.

    •	 At current levels, government budget allocation to water supply is insufficient to
        achieve the universal access target by 2019; it is also dominated by central
        government financing and is limited in the extent to which it can incentivize
        subnational spending on poor-inclusive investments.

    •	 A large share of PDAMs perform poorly on core sector diagnostics and face a number
        of challenges to turning around performance, including political and financial
        interdependencies between local government and PDAMs, lack of incentives to
        improve performance, and limited mechanisms to sustain service delivery for the
        poor.

    •	 Low-income consumers are viewed as costly and risky to serve. They are perceived
        as unwilling to pay for piped water services, despite the fact that they pay a higher
        price for water in the informal market. The Hibah scheme is designed to counteract
        some of these perceptions, but analysis suggests it is not necessarily leading to
        more equitable coverage.

    •	 There is a lack of overall legal frameworks for equitable service delivery, complicated
        by the fact that poor residents in urban areas often live in informal settlements,
        lacking the formal registration and legal documents required for utility service.

      Why Urban Water?
      The focus on urban water for in-depth institutional and political economy analysis is timely and
      opportunistic. There is a clear historical trend of utilities facing challenges in trying to keep up
      with rising demand resulting from population growth and rapid urbanization. Half the population
      of Indonesia resided in urban areas in 2010, and this figure is projected to rise to 68 percent
      by 2025 (UN-DESA 2014). In the absence of adequate planning, the growth of cities can
      introduce a number of challenges, including disparities in income and access to services,
      which exacerbate inequalities.

      Despite these trends, focused efforts are being made by urban water government counterparts
      to tackle the issue of utility underperformance in order to meet universal access targets for
      improved water by 2019. Reaching the target of 60 percent coverage of piped and 40 percent
      coverage of non-piped improved water sources in urban areas will require 16.5 million new
      household piped water connections by 2019. But non-piped sources, such as groundwater, will
      remain a key means for extending improved access in order to reach the target. Currently, of
      the 29.6 percent of urban households with access to piped water supply, the B40 make up just
      7.5 percent, while the T60 make up 22.1 percent. Given current patterns in equity of access
      to piped water (figure 5.1), B40 customers may be more likely to remain on a non-piped service
      for longer than T60 customers. This disparity indicates an urgent need to support the water
      sector and the GoI to develop viable strategies to help overcome challenges to increasing
      piped water access among the poor, as well as to ensure that the groundwater sources that
      make up the other 40 percent of improved coverage meet the 4K standards of quality, quantity,
      continuity, and affordability (kualitas, kuantitas, kontinuitas dan keterjangkauan).

      The current challenges facing the urban piped water sector have negative impacts on poor
      people, whether they have a connection or not. Piped water, especially that provided by PDAMs,
      represents the most economically efficient route to safe, affordable, and environmentally
      sustainable water services in urban areas. At present, alternative sources such as wells and
      boreholes are unlikely to be consistently safe in urban areas (Foster, Lawrence, and Morris
      1998), especially given the large share of urban households (78 percent) using on-site pit
      latrines and soak pits that are a source of groundwater contamination. Moreover, the poor
      already pay several times more than the official tariff for vendor-supplied water; a piped water
      connection could thus result in substantial cost savings for poor households, if they are able
      to overcome the initial connection fee barrier through subsidies (World Bank 2006b).

52	                                                        Improving Service Levels and Impact on the Poor
  The aim of this chapter is to outline the current insitutional and service delivery context
  for urban water supply and the constraints on extending piped water access to the poor in
  urban settings. The chapter will provide key recommended actions for improving the delivery of
  this service.


  Urban Water Institutional and Service
  Delivery Context
  Responsibility for basic service provision, which includes water supply and sanitation, has
  been decentralized to the district level through laws such as 23/2014 on Regional Government
  and 33/2004 on Fiscal Balance between Central Government and Regional Governments. In
  the case of water supply, it is now well established in legal terms that local (District) governments
  must provide a minimum standard of water service to citizens. Provincial governments are
  required to mediate on issues spanning district government boundaries, and central government
  retains a mandate for overall coordination, strategy, and policy formulation, as well as for
  safeguarding the availability of services to all. Within this broad framework, roles and
  responsibilities in the sub-sector are distributed across a wide variety of actors at different
  levels of government (figure 5.2).

  National level: The Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MoPWH) and the Ministry of Energy
  and Mineral Resources (MoEMR) have, respectively, responsibilities for policy and technical
  standards of surface and ground waters. MoPWH, and particularly its Directorate General of
  Human Settlements (DGHS) and Support Agency for the Development of Drinking Water Supply
  System (BPPSPAM), is the key ministry for technical and implementation issues on water
  supply and sanitation. DGHS has responsibility at the national level for facilitating the provision
  of water throughout the country—key units within it include the Directorate of Water Supply
  Systems (DITPAM). The BPPSPAM focuses more on monitoring the performance of the PDAMs.
  Standards for drinking water quality are set by Ministry of Health (MoH), whereas the Ministry
  of Environment and Forestry (MoEF) monitors the quality of water bodies, especially river water.
  A set of high level “4K” standards has also been issued by the National Development and
  Planning Agency (Bappenas) and enforced by Presidential Regulation No. 185/2014, and
  covers quality, quantity, continuity, and affordability (kualitas, kuantitas, kontinuitas dan
  keterjangkauan). The Ministry of Finance (MoF) has a key role in determining national budget
  envelopes, and is therefore central to water supply (and sanitation) planning. Preparation of
  National Plans (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional, RPJMN), including the
  current RPJMN 2015-2019, is led by Bappenas and reflects the vision of the elected president.
  Finally, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) is responsible for promoting institutional
  improvements in subnational governments, setting up the monitoring on minimum service
  standards, and supporting the financial management for local government (LG) enterprises,
  including PDAMs (ADB 2012; key informants).

  Provincial level: A Technical Implementation Unit (Satker), appointed by MoPWH, is required to
  receive and consolidate requests from district governments for water and sanitation
  infrastructure investment projects. These form the basis for most of MoPWH’s investment
  programs (strategic projects can also be determined by central government). The Satker
  coordinates with the national level to select projects to be supported (World Bank 2016b).

  District governments: Governments at district level are assigned powers over their own budget
  and planning processes in a manner that broadly reflects the national process, involving LG
  working units (Satuan Kerja Perangkat Daerah, SKPD), which include district-level planning and
  finance departments (equivalent to MoF and Bappenas at national level) and relevant dinas or
  local service offices (e.g., for public works, dinas pekerjaan umum, or for health, dinas
  kesehatan). The district head wields significant influence over investment priorities within the
  sector at the local level, whereas the local parliament (DPRD) works with the district head on
  budgeting, and also monitors implementation.

                                       With decentralization, governance responsibility for basic services falls under the category of
                                       “concurrent government affairs” (Urusan pemerintahan konkuren), implying a division of
                                       responsibility between central and district governments (Law 23/2014). Ultimately, the district
                                       head/mayor has significant oversight authority as a result of his/her influence over strategic
                                       human and financial resource decisions, if not day-to-day operations and management of
                                       PDAMs. District heads also have regulatory responsibility for water tariffs, which involves
                                       signing off on proposals submitted by the PDAM directors and approved by the supervisory
                                       board. Some mayors also draw up performance contracts with PDAMs as a basis for more
                                       clearly defined oversight responsibilities.

  In urban areas, the provision of clean drinking water is undertaken predominately by PDAMs,1
  each providing clean water connections to households within a single district or city. Out of a
  total of 512 districts across Indonesia, 423 have water utilities providing services in their area.
  Although the majority (386) are PDAMs, owned and managed by district/city governments, an
  additional 37 water companies are owned and managed by MoPWH or by the private sector.
  Taken together, these 423 water utilities have reported serving more than 9 million households
  as of 2015—equivalent to about 42 million individuals, or 16 percent of the total population
  of Indonesia (MoPWH, 2015).


  Constraints On and Opportunities for Connecting
  the Poor to Urban Water Services

  Why Urban B40 Households Have Lower Access
  to Piped Water than T60 Households
  There are a number of barriers preventing low-income households from accessing piped
  water connections. These include (a) government budget allocation and spending; (b)
  financial sustainability and performance of PDAMs; (c) perceptions and behavioral constraints;
  and (d) legal frameworks for equitable service delivery.


  Government Budget Allocation and Spending
  Despite decentralization of water and sanitation service delivery to the district level                  	Government
  beginning in 2001, financing continues to be dominated by central government investments.                 budget allocation
  Finance from both national and local governments to urban water services has been                         for water supply
                                                                                                            isn’t enough to
  increasing in recent years, but it remains a small share of total and infrastructure spending.            meet universal
  Coordinating between investments by different parts of government—with central                            access targets,
  government mainly investing “upstream” in urban water networks, and LGs funding                           and local
  “downstream” components—is a continuing challenge. In 2013 government expenditure                         government
  for water supply totaled US$476 million (IDR7.0 trillion), and was largely sourced from the               spending is
                                                                                                            insufficient

  water supply is still a modest share of total infrastructure spending, at less than 10
  percent (table 5.1).2

  The available data on sector financing suggests that current levels of government
  spending, although they have significantly increased, are inadequate to achieve universal
  access. The cost of universal access to water supply is estimated by the Directorate
  General of Human Settlements, MoPWH (Cipta Karya) to be approximately US$26 billion
  (IDR254 trillion), of which central government contributes US$1.4 billion (IDR13.5 trillion)
  annually up to 2019 through national budget allocation (APBN), for a total expenditure of

      US$7 billion (IDR67.5 trillion) (MoPWH 2015).3 Bridging the financing gap will require
      accessing provincial and LG budgets (APBD), PDAM internal resources, public multilateral
      and bilateral development financing, commercial loans, and private investments—as well
      as household out-of-pocket spending, which is currently estimated to be approximately
      one-third of total expenditure on water supply from all sources (World Bank 2016b). In
      particular, the government aims to attract US$1.5 billion in private sector financing
      through PPPs and business-to-business schemes, and US$860 million in commercial
      financing. The efforts to mobilize diverse funding sources in partnership toward achieving
      the shared goal of universal access has led the GoI to adopt common sectoral policies
      through national platforms of delivery that apply regardless of the source of funds.

      Current local government spending for water and sanitation is not sufficient to meet the
      financing gap for universal access. Provincial and district (subnational) government is expected
      to finance nearly half (47 percent) of expenditures required to meet universal access targets
      for water supply—a total of US$12.4 billion (IDR119 trillion), or US$2.5 billion (IDR24 trillion)
      annually (MoPWH 2015). Although subnational expenditures for the water and sanitation
      sector have doubled in real terms since 2001, by 2013 they were US$0.9 billion (just over
      IDR9 trillion) (figure 5.4). Taking these past expenditures for water supply and sanitation as a
      guide, a substantial financing gap remains.

      National Government has limited leverage to incentivize subnational spending on urban water
      supply. The vertical imbalance characteristic of the Reformasi-era4 fiscal-federal system has
      helped to promote state cohesion (Harris & Foresti 2010), but has also had important
      implications for investments in urban water supply—including the extent to which national
      government can push for prioritization of pro-poor investments by district governments. Most
      transfers to LGs (General Purpose Grants or Dana Alokasi Umum, DAU) go to support general
      expenditure, and are not earmarked (figure 5.5). The Special Allocation Fund (Specific Purpose
      Grants or Dana Alokasi Khusus, DAK), on the other hand, is allocated by region and earmarked
      for specific projects according to national priorities. It also includes some pro-poor criteria

      regarding how it is distributed among districts. The DAK, however, is relatively modest in relation
      to total LG financing, and the portion that is earmarked to water supply and sanitation is even
      smaller (most recently 0.15 percent) (World Bank 2016b). The national government’s ability to
      incentivize subnational governments to target poor households is, in particular, even more
      limited; it has increased with the national roll-out of the Water Hibah program from 2015, but
      eligibility criteria for LGs and PDAMs (such as sufficient raw water supplies and adequate
      treatment) has, along with other issues, limited the expansion of the program.

      Despite an increase in DAK transfers from central government, transfers are still not aligned
      to needs and there is limited accountability for fund allocation. DAK transfers have increased
      significantly over the past several years. In 2013, DAK for water supply was approximately
      US$62 million (IDR600 billion), and increased to US$104 million (IDR1 trillion) in 2015 and

  US$118 million (IDR1.14 trillion) in 20175. The number of districts receiving DAK also declined,
  from 430 cities/districts in 2015 to 269 in 20176. Two challenges persist with DAK transfers.
  The first is that DAK water supply allocations are not aligned to needs.

  Figure 5.6 shows the correlation between the DAK allocation for water in 2015 and 2017, and
  the coverage of improved water in districts in 2013 and 2015. As DAK allocations have
  increased over time, there is a weaker association between allocations and improved water
  access figures. The second challenge is that DAK allocations are not based on performance—
  though this appears to be changing as of 2017. Funds are released upon submission of
  reports on absorption, rather than on the basis of how funds have been used and what has

  Efforts to incentivize poor-inclusive service delivery need to factor in the overall financial health,   	   PDAMs play
  efficiency, and performance of PDAMs. A major challenge to extending connections to low-                     a big part in
  income households is the perception that doing so would put the financial and technical health               the provision
  of the PDAM in jeopardy, especially if not accompanied by targeted technical assistance and                  of drinking
                                                                                                               water, but they
  capacity building. Utilities require economies of scale for sustainable operation and cost                   lack incentives
  recovery from across the customer base. However, as illustrated in this section, a large share               to improve
  of PDAMs perform poorly on core sector diagnostics and face numerous challenges to turning                   performance and
  around performance—including the political and financial interdependencies between LGs and                   are not obligated
  PDAMs, and the lack of broader incentives to improve performance.                                            to serve the poor.



  Financial Sustainability

  Current PDAM water tariffs are not economically efficient in managing demand and resources,
  do not raise enough revenues for the PDAMs to become financially independent, tend to
  benefit high-income rather than low-income households, and are complex and difficult to
  administer effectively, creating opportunities for fraud and corruption. District heads have
  regulatory responsibility for water tariffs. For water utilities this is guided by the recent MoHA
  Regulation 71/2016, which requires tariffs to achieve full cost recovery and includes specific
  measures to protect poor customers to ensure that tariffs do not exceed 4 percent of
  household income. The new regulation lacks detail, however, on how compliance will be
  enforced across districts. Increasing Block Tariffs (IBTs) have been criticized for failing to
  achieve cross-subsidy, because high-volume consumers are not necessarily wealthier than
  lower volume consumers. The Regulation acknowledges this and allows for charges to vary
  according to a household’s classification. Households classified as MBR (Masyarakat
  Berpenghasilan Rendah or low-income household) would pay lower rates across the
  consumption blocks. Government Regulation 122/2015 includes more general provisions on
  tariff-setting, including affordability and the provision that national government should retain
  an overarching responsibility for ensuring access for low-income groups.

  The rationale behind the tariff calculation is generally not well understood by local governing
  bodies, creating an incentive to push tariffs down rather than allow for cost recovery. In some
  cities water tariffs for the poor (“social tariffs”) are set so artificially low (US$0.03/m³) that
  even with cross-subsidies from higher paying customers, PDAMs are forced to sell water to the
  poor at a loss. This ends up disadvantaging the poor because PDAMs are discouraged from
  serving predominantly poor areas. PDAMs can propose tariff levels and structures based on
  guidelines issued by MoHA, with the head of local government given the authority to approve
  them. Although no DPRD approval is needed, LGs, and even the PDAMs’ management, still
  prefer to seek DPRD agreement on tariff increase, so as not to be responsible for the decision.
  Guiding legislation and processes for tariff approval may be insufficient to mitigate the strong
  political incentive of elected officials to suppress tariffs. However, a new MoHA regulation, No
  70/2016, will require LGs to subsidize the difference if tariffs are set below cost-recovery levels.


Improving Service Levels and Impact on the Poor	                                                                                    59
      Whether or not tariff increases are approved may still depend on the nature of the relationship
      between an individual mayor and the respective PDAM, and the level of understanding of both
      PDAMs and LGs on the need for cost-recovery tariffs.

      Connection fees required to fund capital investments are a barrier for low-income households,
      but have so far only been addressed through the Hibah. The government’s output-based grant
      (Hibah) scheme for household water connections is meant to circumvent this barrier, by
      reimbursing district government for connection fees for low-income households. The program
      was rolled out nationwide in 2015, but still only covers a fraction of the eligible population. In
      part, this is due to strict eligibility criteria that LGs and PDAMs are required to meet in order to
      participate. The criteria includes PDAMs achieving “healthy” performance status, and having
      adequate spare production capacity and the ability to pre-finance capital investments. Other
      barriers to participation include a lack of tools and information to identify eligible low-income
      households, concern that targeting such households under the water Hibah will damage the
      financial position of the PDAM, and a generally limited understanding of the purpose of the
      Hibah and how to incorporate the program into an overall business plan.


      Technical Aspects
      Available performance data7 suggest that a large share of PDAMs lag on key sector performance
      indicators, but that some progress has been made. For the three years shown in table 5.2, a
      little over 50 percent of PDAMs are classified as “healthy” based on the multi-indicator rating
      system of BPPSPAM, whereas around 20 percent are classified as “sick.” Data available for
      2015 indicate water consumption of 18.9m3 per household (connection) per month, and an
      average number of operating hours per day of 19.2. Water losses hovered at around a third of
      the distributed total in 2015,8 and only around 26 percent of PDAMs evaluated in 2014 and
      2015 were applying full cost-recovery tariffs. The financial position of most PDAMs remains
      precarious, with the majority loss-making.9

      There is wide variation in performance measures between “top performers” and the rest of
      PDAMs. Using BPPSPAM data for the period 2011–14, utilities were categorized as top, bottom,
      or middle performers on each performance indicator, using the following composition:

        i.	 The Top 10 percent performers—utilities whose average performance on an indicator for
            the period 2011–14 (or 2010–15, depending on availability of data) was greater than the
            90th percentile (or less than the 10th percentile in the case of non-revenue water);

        ii.	 The Bottom 10 percent performers—utilities whose average performance on an indicator
             was less than the 10th percentile (or greater than the 90th percentile in the case of
             non-revenue water) for the same period; and

        iii.	 The Middle 80 percent performers—utilities whose average performance on an indicator
              was between the 10th and the 90th percentile.

      As shown in figure 5.7, the top 10 percent performers on each indicator are doing much better
      than the middle 80 percent and bottom 10 percent—achieving full performance on quality and
      duration of supply hours. Service coverage, average revenue, and number of connections for
      the top 10 percent performers increased between 2011 and 2014, whereas other indicators
      remained stable. On the other hand, PDAMs in the bottom 10 percent of performers for duration
      of supply did worse over time, and none passed quality standards under MoH regulations. The
      middle 80 percent of performers on water quality also showed a sharp decline in the percentage
      of samples meeting the required standards over the period.

      Despite the poor performance of many PDAMs, most PDAMs and their owners lack incentives
      to improve performance. Although performance targets are included in some GoI programs,
      these are only for the duration of the program and there is no incentive to maintain performance

   a. Tariffs are assessed to provide full cost recovery on the basis of an assumed 100% billing collection efficiency. As can be seen from the table, collection
   efficiency has fallen below 100% in recent years. The calculations also assume a generic level of non revenue water (NRW) of 20%, which is lower than recorded
   levels. As such, the proportion of PDAMs achieving full cost recovery is likely to be lower than the figures reported here suggest.



  levels. In addition, although BPPSPAM conducts performance audits of PDAMs, there is no
  systematic monitoring or evaluation of performance in relation to program participation, resulting
  in broken feedback loops. With regard to LGs, the power of the district head to approve budget
  allocation and tariffs, and to appoint PDAM leadership, appears to be a key source of dysfunction
  in the former’s oversight role—resulting in a reluctance to raise tariffs to full cost-recovery levels
  or to disconnect illegal connections, and leading to losses in revenue. Consequently, utilities
  are often caught in a negative downward spiral of poor cost recovery, low investment in existing
  infrastructure (let alone network expansion), deteriorating service levels, and falling customer
  satisfaction and willingness to pay. These factors constrain the ability of PDAMs to sustainably
  serve low-income customers.

        ••   perception that low-income households are unwilling to pay cost-recovery tariffs, and
             that “social” tariffs will damage the financial position of the PDAM;

        ••   uncertainty around tenure and ownership rights (largely left to LGs to resolve);

        ••   perception that low-income communities are more territorially dispersed within the
             administrative area;

        ••   perceived lack of sophistication in filling out forms;

        ••   perception that poor households do not understand PDAM constraints and are quick to
             protest when service delivery fails to meet expectations.

      It is not known to what extent these perceptions reflect unconscious bias or the actual situation.10

      The Hibah scheme is designed to counteract some of the tendencies on the part of district
      government to view poor households as costly and risky to serve. The Hibah incentivizes PDAMs
      and district government to overcome governance and financial barriers (real and perceived) to
      serving low-income households, since connection fees are reimbursed to PDAMs once the
      connection has been independently verified. Analysis of Hibah- versus non-Hibah-participating
      kotas does not indicate more equitable coverage between T60 and B40 in Hibah-participating
      kotas, although this could be due to different baseline coverage among the two groups, as
      previously discussed. Moreover, because the Hibah only reimburses for connection fees, LGs
      and PDAMs participating in the program tend to target expansion to areas where additional
      capital investments in piped networks would not be needed11—a tendency that could result in
      some remote low-income settlements being excluded. It appears that the purpose of the Hibah
      program is still not well understood by some LGs and PDAMs, which also limits expansion.

      Poor households are likewise at a disadvantage as a result of their own perceptions and behaviors.
      They may lack awareness of the risks of drinking contaminated water (whether groundwater
      or  vendor-supplied) and so do not demand improvements in public services. Although poor
      households perceive water tariffs as costly, they fail to calculate the full cost of buying water from
      informal vendors, both in terms of direct expenditure and time spent. Analysis of cost-recovery
      tariffs suggests that low-income households paying tariffs would save between 5 and 12 percent
      of their income compared to expenditure on vendor-supplied water (World Bank 2006b).


      Legal and Regulatory Frameworks for
      Equitable Service Delivery
      Currently, there is no clearly stated poor-inclusive mission underlying the 2019 universal
      access target for water supply. Although the 100-0-100 program target is universal access,
      given current trends, and in the absence of an explicit approach for reducing inequality in
      access, it is likely that B40 households will remain on non-piped sources for longer than T60
      households. Moreover, although affordability targets for water supply aim for water tariffs that
      do not exceed 4 percent of household income, and regulations are in place for achieving this
      (Regulation 71/2016 and Regulation 122/2015), an explicit strategy to enforce this at LG
      level has not yet been outlined.

      There are no laws, regulations, or contractual requirements for PDAMs to consistently serve
      the poor. The lack of legal guidance on equitable service delivery is further complicated by the
      fact that poor residents in urban areas are more likely to live in informal settlements, lacking
      formal registration and legal documents required for utility service. If these settlements occupy
      government-owned land, utilities do not have legal authority to build infrastructure or extend
      services. In such cases, PDAMs rely on LGs to pave the way to service delivery. However, in
      most cases LGs do not articulate any poor-inclusive or pro-poor strategy as part of the planning
      process required by MoPWH in its Master Plan for Water Supply System (RISPAMS).

  Regulatory control of alternative water service providers is fragmented, with local government
  responsible for enforcing the regulations. Currently B40 households are more likely to use
  alternative sources for drinking (with the exception of bottled water, now the preferred drinking
  water source for T60 households in urban areas), which are harder to regulate—most notably
  groundwater sources such as private wells and boreholes, and branded or non-branded
  (refill) bottled water. There is little clarity on who holds ultimate responsibility for regulation of
  abstraction and quality of water resources, on which all forms of urban access depend. Law
  7/2004 on Water Resources and a new government regulation (PP No.122/2015 on Cultivation
  for Water Resources) left ground/surface water management coordination unresolved, with
  responsibility for surface water assigned to MoPWH, and for groundwater to LGs, in coordination
  with MoEMR. Though the annulment of Law 7/2004 in 2015 and resinstatement of the
  previous Law on Water Resources (11/1974) provides an opportunity for a more integrated
  approach, signs are not promising that the annulment is leading to greater integration,
  particularly with regard to the relationship of water resources to urban water supply. Regulations
  do exist for bottled water, including under MoI Decree 705/2003 for branded bottled water,
  and MoH Decree No. 492/2010 for unbranded/offered by refill kiosks. There is, however, no
  regulatory control of private tanker operators, smaller mobile vendors, or piped customers
  who resell water informally to neighbors. The full extent of this informal water market is not
  clear—Susenas data imply it is a minor component of service provision, but it may be
  significant in some cities, such as Jakarta (Kooy 2014).

  In the following chapter the report will conclude with a presentation of key recommended
  actions to orient future water supply and sanitation policy and investment toward a more
  inclusive approach. Recommendations are prioritized based on their expected impact on the
  development goals of (a) reducing inequality; (b) enhancing health and well-being; and (c)
  promoting economic growth and prosperity, as well as on the strength of the evidence base for
  the solution proposed.


  Notes
  1.	 There are also small urban water utilities that are not constituted as PDAMs (that is, as
      LG-owned but officially independent enterprises), including community-based organisations,
      and technical units housed within District Government with varying degrees of autonomy:
      “A UPTD (Unit Pelaksana Teknis Daerah) is a Regional Technical Implementation Unit
      attached to an LG agency that is responsible for service provision but has no autonomy to
      retain income for expenses. A BLUD (Badan Layanan Umum Daerah) is also a technical
      operation unit of an LG agency that is allowed to operate with flexibilities or exemptions
      from rules applicable to the Dinas. It has some additional degree of autonomy to a UPTD,
      but is more complicated to establish.” (World Bank and AusAid 2013, 21). We nonetheless
      focus on PDAMs in this study, as the most prominent form of piped water provider.

      model of decentralization for service delivery.

  6.	 The smaller number of districts receiving DAK funding in 2017 may be due to changes in
      the procedures on submission of requests and evaluation of proposals by Bappenas,

      covering the number of beneficiaries, alignment with national priorities, readiness criteria,
      local fiscal capacity, and prior performance.

  Priorities for Future Policy and
  Investments in Water Supply
  and Sanitation

                                    Key Recommended Actions

      ••   Expand piped water services to a larger share of the B40 in urban areas.

      ••   Improve the quality of alternative water sources for those who will remain on non-
           piped water supply.

      ••   Support the B40 in gaining access to improved sanitation.

      ••   Bring more households into the full sanitation and fecal waste service chain in
           urban areas.

      ••   Champion multisectoral approaches to reduce child stunting.

      ••   Enhance water supply and sanitation interventions to have greater impact on
           nutrition outcomes.




  The water and sanitation sector in Indonesia is at a pivotal juncture in the post-2015 SDG era,
  where success will be defined by service quality, sustainability, and equitable distribution of
  services. The GoI has established its own ambitious target to achieve universal access to
  water supply and sanitation by 2019–11 years ahead of the SDG target. The existing challenges
  to achieving these targets, let alone achieving them on schedule, are compounded by rising
  income inequality and rapid urbanization in Indonesia. The recommendations outlined in this
  chapter aim to support the GoI in achieving its universal access target, with a particular focus
  on the needs and constraints of the B40. The goal is to orient future water and sanitation
  investments around three sector priorities: (a) reduce inequalities in access and quality of
  water and sanitation services; (b) enhance the health and nutritional impact of water and
  sanitation investments; and (c) promote economic growth and vibrant cities through more
  sustainable service delivery in urban areas.

  Going forward, the Government of Indonesia will establish several national platforms of service
  delivery to bridge the gap between policy and implementation. These platforms include (a) rural
  water supply—community-based and institutionally driven; (b) urban water supply through LGs
  and PDAMs; (c) regional water supply systems1; and (d) urban sanitation2 (figure 6.1). The
  platforms allow for (a) one national policy applicable to all sources of financing; (b) common
  planning documents at LG level; and (c) one monitoring system. In addition, the platforms
  include flexible funding arrangements and management that will no longer rely solely on
  national government funding (APBN); support for the development of regulations and guidelines;

      and capacity building at all levels of government. This common policy framework will provide a
      consistent basis to inform all infrastructure investments, regardless of the source of financing
      (APBN, APBD, bilateral and multi-lateral development banks, and local banks). Additionally,
      local government will be in the driver’s seat with the flexibility to involve communities and other
      donors, NGOs, universities, and private sector actors.

      The 100-0-100 program and strategy to achieve universal access should adopt a poor-inclusive
      approach to ensure that Indonesia not only achieves its service delivery targets, but that water
      supply and sanitation become key drivers of reduced inequality, enhanced health and well-
      being, and economic growth and prosperity. A poor-inclusive approach is one that improves the
      ability and opportunity of the poor and vulnerable to benefit from water supply and sanitation
      services, using the tools of financing, targeting, legal frameworks, and institutions. For water
      supply, this implies the need for a fifth standard of keadilan (equity) alongside the 4K standards
      of quality, quantity, continuity, and affordability (kualitas, kuantitas, kontinuitas dan
      keterjangkauan), as well as an explicit strategy for achieving this standard. The evidence in this
      report aims to provide an empirical basis for shifting the approach toward more inclusive and
      equitable service delivery in the water and sanitation sector. A key input for policy and
      recommendations is a dynamic dashboard that provides visual perspective of the overlaps
      between poverty, lack of access, and child health and nutrition (see appendix A).3 Disaggregation
      to sub-district level, and mapping capabilities for informal settlements and urban slums, could
      further advance poor-inclusive service delivery.

      Recommendations are grounded in the findings of the WASH Poverty Diagnostic and, for urban
      water, in the institutional and political economy analysis described in chapter 5. Even though a
      similar in-depth analysis was not conducted for urban sanitation, rural sanitation, or rural water
      as part of the WASH Poverty Diagnostic, the recommendations that are specific to these

  subsectors benefit from recent sector studies and reports, as well as global experience and
  evidence. Future analytical work could address these subsectors in depth, especially regarding
  targeted financial subsidies and urban sanitation service delivery challenges.



  Key Recommended Actions

  Expand Piped Water Services to A Larger Share of
  the B40 in Urban Areas
  Improve the efficiency and performance of PDAMs to generate a virtuous cycle of performance,
  tariff increases, cost recovery, and expansion of connections, especially to poor households.
  NUWSP is the delivery mechanism for the urban water supply platform and already includes a
  robust emphasis on performance improvement of PDAMs through a number of program
  components, including:

    ••   Incentives and performance-based approaches, including a comprehensive framework
         of performance incentives that tie sources of additional financing to achievement of
         performance targets;

    ••   Joint performance monitoring assessment of LGs and PDAMs using a universal and
         integrated monitoring and information system accessible to financing partners;

    ••   Capacity building and technical assistance to LGs and PDAMs, covering technical, human
         resources management, utility reform, financing, good water governance, citizen
         engagement, and the identification, development, and preparation of projects and project
         proposals;

    ••   Performance-based contracts/agreements between LGs and PDAMs to formalize the
         relationship and provide reassurance to central government that performance of PDAMs
         is being monitored by asset owners.

  These components of the NUWSP framework will be tested by the GoI, especially MoPWH,
  under the Directorate General of Human Settlements, and Bappenas, in select provinces that
  are home to a wide range of PDAMs with various capabilities.

  A critical input into the performance-improvement cycle of PDAMs will be the establishment of
  cost-recovery tariffs, but tariff schedules need to adopt realistic affordability benchmarks for
  low-income households. The affordability target under the 100-0-100 program aims for water
  tariffs that do not exceed 4 percent of household income. More evidence is needed to evaluate
  whether 4 percent is a reasonable expectation for households living below the poverty line.
  Capacity building for LGs and PDAMs on tariff-setting must include specific provisions to
  incorporate equity and social concerns into tariff structures, as well as guidance on how tariffs
  can be structured to allow for cross-subsidization between customers in order to protect the
  poor and vulnerable. Additional capacity building on project preparation and project proposal
  development, undertaken through the CoE program managed by the MoPWH, should cover
  (a) how to assess affordability of water tariffs; (b) willingness among poor households to pay
  for piped water connections; and (c) incorporation of low-income households, including Water
  Hibah customers, in the overall performance improvement and investment plan.

  Additional financing mechanisms are needed to ease the financial and liquidity constraints
  faced by the poor. Piped water connection fees are unaffordable for households living near or
  below the poverty line. These costs, and the ability of poor households to pay them, need to
  be factored into investment decisions. The output-based grant Hibah scheme for piped water
  has incentivized more poor-inclusive service delivery, but not all PDAMs are eligible to

                              participate, leaving a large share of poor households unable to connect to piped water services.
                              Subsidized credit and savings schemes are alternatives that allow households to spread the
                              cost of the connection over time. Over the past several years, microfinance for household water
                              facilities has become more common. An initiative of USAID’s IUWASH program has financed
                              connection fees for approximately 15,000 households in low-income communities of North
                              Sumatra, DKI/West Java/Banten, Central Java, East Java, and South Sulawesi.4 Despite
                              government support for microfinance, the scale-up of the approach has been constrained by
                              chronic raw water shortages (particularly in Java and Sumatra), the protracted development of
                              distribution networks, and the availability of alternative mechanisms (such as Hibah) covering
                              the connection fee. Firstly, better coordination between Hibah and other microfinance schemes
                              can be achieved through the platform approach, taking advantage of a common policy
                              framework regardless of the source of financing and more flexibility at the local government
                              level to partner with private sector actors. Secondly, the existing targeting mechanism for
                              Hibah beneficiaries that is based on electricity usage could be combined with income targeting
                              to better identify eligible low-income households for financial subsidies.

      	   Improving the       Increasing demand and raising awareness of the benefits of piped water—among both
          performance         consumers and local government actors—is needed to shift consumer behavior and dependence
          of PDAMs and        on alternatives, and to build the political will for improvements in water supply to poor households.
          setting cost-       Awareness-raising could increase demand for efficient, sustainable water supply services, but
          recovery tariffs

          increase piped      storage. Awareness and behavior change campaigns, coordinated by MoPWH and MoH, and
          water access for    implemented in part by PDAMs, can help increase demand for clean water and put pressure on
          the poor.           PDAMs and LGs to expand provision of piped water services to unserved communities and/or
                              improve the quality of existing services. Importantly, technical assistance provided through
                              NUWSP should emphasize the health and economic benefits of supplying clean water to poor
                              households to help raise the profile of WASH investments in district decision-making.

      	   The current         Adjustments to the current intergovernmental fiscal transfer system are needed to better align
          intergovernmental   transfers to needs. While current levels of government budget allocation to water supply are
          transfer system     insufficient to achieve the universal access targets for water supply, existing fiscal transfers
          must better         could be allocated more efficiently to address needs. Basic information on water access is
          align transfers     readily available; however, data on DAK transfers show a declining association between DAK
          to needs.
                              allocations and water coverage at the district level. Additional considerations for aligning fiscal
                              transfers to needs through DAU point to population growth in urban centers, and suburban
                              districts in particular. To better align fiscal transfers with population growth trends will require
                              adoption of a per capita calculation—rather than the current per region calculation—to ensure
                              equitable distribution of public resources according to population density of cities and districts.
                              This alignment does not address the need for more financing for the sector overall. Commercial
                              loans, private investment, and business-to-business collaboration should be explored to better
                              understand how these additional sources of financing can help bridge the gap.

                              who Will Remain on Non-Piped Water Supply
                              Drinking water supplies, whether piped or non-piped, need to be consistently monitored for water
                              quality risks, and this information made publicly available. Consumers are largely unaware of the
                              quality of drinking water from different sources and the particular risks posed by poor household
                              water storage practices and poor fecal waste management. Water sector strategy should
                              account for the potential water quality risks of poor sanitation, and the respective investments
                              of the water and sanitation sub-sectors should be aligned. This alignment is especially important
                              in areas facing technical barriers to piped water. At city level, Bappeda can ensure that the
                              needed alignment on water and sanitation is reflected in the respective strategy documents
                              (Master Plan for Drinking Water and City Sanitation Strategy). Bappeda could also oversee
                              integration of data from the two sub-sectors into planning, implementation, and monitoring.

  Support the B40 to Gain Access to Improved Sanitation
  Indonesia achieved substantial progress in reducing open defecation and now faces the
  second generation challenge of moving households up the sanitation ladder. Achieving universal
  access will require Indonesia to strengthen the STBM program by revisiting the zero-subsidy
  approach to sanitation and linking it with subsidized credit and savings mechanisms to reach
  the poorest households. Global practice suggests that subsidies can harm sanitation behavior-
  change efforts; however, experience shows that when subsidies are well targeted, delivered
  through an efficient channel, and affordable, they can be an effective mechanism for reaching
  poor households who otherwise cannot afford the high lump sum cost of a toilet. Septic tanks
  are a desirable level of service, but the cost is often prohibitive for poor households. Targeting
  subsidized credit and savings schemes through existing targeting systems that are already
  working well to identify low-income households for social assistance (e.g., the UDB operated
  by TNP2K and MoSA) can be an efficient and transparent way to reach households most in
  need of subsidies in order to achieve higher levels of service. The UDB contains socioeconomic
  and demographic information for approximately 40 percent of the population with lowest
  welfare status, the equivalent of 24 million households, or 96 million individuals. Moreover,
  this approach would accommodate a multisectoral strategy for targeting poor households,
  since the UDB is used for targeting other social assistance, including Subsidized Rice for the
  Poor (Raskin), Public Health Insurance (Jamkesmas), Cash Assistance to Poor Students
  (Bantuan Siswa Miskin), and the Family Hope Programme (Program Keluarga Harapan, or PKH),
  which has a nutrition component. The MoH should take a leadership role in adapting the
  existing policy on sanitation subsidies to address the financial constraints of poor households,
  whereas MoPWH should work with TNP2K and MoSA to adopt the UDB for targeting assistance
  under PAMSIMAS.


  Bring More Households into the Full Sanitation and Fecal
  Waste Service Chain in Urban Areas
  The range of solutions required to meet universal access targets in urban areas in a cost-           	   A holistic
  effective manner demands that cities and towns take a more holistic and inclusive approach to            and inclusive

  septic tanks, sewerage, decentralized small-scale wastewater treatment plants, and fecal                 households into
  sludge management. District heads and mayors need to be given responsibility for ensuring                the service chain.
  consistency in planning, budgeting, and execution; flexible funding arrangements; and technical
  assistance and capacity building where needed. This approach requires a delicate balance
  between the national government’s fiscal leverage to incentivize investment in sanitation, and
  granting greater autonomy to LGs to decide where and how to invest those resources.

  Behavior change has been the cornerstone of a successful effort to stop open defecation in
  Indonesia, but needs to be adapted to behavioral issues common in the urban sanitation
  space. The universal access targets will be met primarily through on-site sanitation systems
  with fecal sludge management (72.5 percent), whereas smaller shares will be met by centralized
  and decentralized sewerage (12.5 percent), and basic sanitation (15 percent). Currently,
  although 78 percent of the population in urban areas uses a septic tank, 95 percent of fecal
  waste ends up in the nearby environment. Low consumer demand for fecal waste management
  services is a reflection of both the lack of integrated services and the lack of knowledge about
  safe management and disposal practices. Part of the solution will require generating the

                                   behavior change cannot happen in a vacuum—it requires a coherent policy framework, clarity
                                   regarding institutional arrangements, and adequate enforcement of local government
                                   ordinances for design, construction, and desludging (World Bank and Australian Aid 2013).
                                   Coordination between MoH and MoPWH will be needed for effective implementation of STBM
                                   in urban areas, along with enforcement by MoEF of new regulations on effluent standards.

                                   Elevating the profile of sanitation in political and fiscal discussions, as well as in intra-household
                                   decision-making, will be crucial to achieving universal access targets. This change may require
                                   a shift in the narrative around urban sanitation to emphasize not only elements of modernity
                                   and competitiveness, but also the lifelong effects on intellectual and economic potential of
                                   early-life stunting, caused in part by poor sanitation. AKKOPSI could lead advocacy efforts with
                                   mayors and district heads.


                                   Champion Multisectoral Approaches to Reduce Child Stunting
      	   A multisectoral          Efforts to improve early-life outcomes for children, especially reducing stunting in Indonesia,
          approach is              should capitalize on the synergies of multisectoral approaches. Progress toward reducing
          critical if early life   stunting in Indonesia can be enhanced by coordinated multisectoral interventions that address
          outcomes are to          effectively the four key underlying determinants of nutrition.5 Evidence shows the effects will
          be improved and
          stunting reduced.        vary by the wealth status of the household, and across rural and urban areas. Thus, a one-size-
                                   fits-all approach to multisectoral programming is not likely to be as effective as multisectoral
                                   programs that are tailored and targeted to specific geographic locations and poverty levels.
                                   Geographic targeting can be used to reach areas where undernutrition and underlying
                                   deprivations are prevalent. In these areas, interventions should be co-located to achieve
                                   service improvements across multiple sectors that impact stunting (see box 6.2). PAMSIMAS
                                   could serve as the main platform for multisectoral convergence between WASH and other
                                   programs addressing nutrition outcomes in young children, while implementation across
                                   relevant sectors could be coordinated through Bappenas. In addition, the strengthening of
                                   social and behavior-change communication, including development and execution of country
                                   plans and communication strategies for improving nutrition as part of the Scaling Up Nutrition
                                   (SUN) Movement, is needed at national level (see box 6.1).

                                   An overarching message of the WASH Poverty Diagnostic in Indonesia is that existing WASH

                                        Indonesia plans to attain Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2019, whereby all

       Box 6.2: Strengthening Nutrition-Sensitive Actions in PAMSIMAS to Reduce
       Stunting in Children under 5

       PAMSIMAS, which targets 27,000 villages, is the GoI’s platform approach for bringing
       sustainable clean drinking water and sanitation services to rural communities. The
       program adopts the STBM approach, focused on behavior change at the household
       and community level, including 5 pillars of (a) stopping open defecation; (b)
       handwashing with soap; (c) household safe water treatment, storage, and food
       handling; (d) safe disposal and management of solid waste; and (e) safe disposal
       and management of wastewater.

       Nutrition-sensitive actions will be piloted through PAMSIMAS across four districts in
       two provinces. The objective of the pilot is to gain implementation knowledge,
       strengthen the evidence base, and derive lessons for scaling up multisectoral
       interventions impacting child nutrition outcomes. The key performance indicators are:

            	
       a. Increased coverage of WASH interventions for households with pregnant women,
          lactating mothers, and children under five

         	
       b. Increased number of ODF villages
       c.	 Increased number of villages practicing all five pillars of STBM
       d.	 Increased demand and uptake of health and nutrition services in the pilot villages
       e.	 Increased number of villages leveraging village funds (Dana Desa) for WASH and
                nutrition activities

       The proposed pilot will leverage the operational mechanisms instituted under
       PAMSIMAS, combining the strengths of STBM with Infant and Young Child Nutrition
       (IYCN) practices implemented at the village level by:

            	
       a. Prioritizing villages with high malnutrition rates

            	
       b. Enhancing the community-action planning process of PAMSIMAS to prioritize
          households with pregnant women, lactating mothers and children under five
       c.	 Implementing Community-wide Behavior-Change Communication campaigns for
                ODF, embedded with nutrition messages; reinforcing WASH messages through
                local health/nutrition centers (Puskesmas, Posyandu, etc.)

            	
       d. Monitoring progress of WASH access and usage by target groups and nutrition
          programs using citizen engagement tools such as social audits, community
          score cards, feedback loops, etc.



  Evidence from the Diagnostic shows that one way to enhance sanitation interventions for greater
  nutritional impact is to crowd in resources until communities exceed a high threshold of coverage
  of improved sanitation. There is now compelling evidence, both within Indonesia and globally,
  that sanitation levels of a community are more important than those of any one household. The
  evidence shows that health and nutritional benefits mainly accrue after a threshold level of
  coverage is surpassed, and that full benefits may only be achieved as sanitation becomes
  universal. This evidence supports existing practice, which aims for ODF areas, and it suggests
  that resources should be spent on bringing as many communities as possible to universal or
  near universal levels of coverage in order to realize the health benefits of sanitation.


Improving Service Levels and Impact on the Poor	                                                      73
                              Water and sanitation interventions could have a greater impact on nutrition by adopting a
                              “child-centric” approach. The five pillars of STBM are comprehensive across WASH services,
                              but may still bypass some of the dominant fecal contamination pathways that affect small
                              children. An emerging approach known as “baby WASH” or “child-centered WASH” focuses on
                              interrupting exposure pathways that are most strongly associated with subsequent diarrheal
                              disease. Sanitation interventions need to include measures that ensure cleanliness of a child’s
                              play environment (such as safe disposal of child and animal feces), and separation of livestock
                              and domestic animals from the main housing compound. Equally important are washing hands
                              with soap before preparing food and feeding/breast feeding, and after handling child feces,
                              and using only treated drinking water for preparation of liquid and solid food for infants and
                              young children. Importantly, these recommendations go deeper and are more targeted to child-
                              related exposures than the existing pillars of the STBM program. MoH should adapt existing
                              STBM behavior-change communication materials and local government capacity building to
                              incorporate baby WASH, while implementation of the approach should be aligned with the
                              current nutrition-sensitive pilot of PAMSIMAS.

                              Multisectoral approaches need to be adapted to work in densely populated urban slums,
      	   Resources need      where conditions of poverty, overcrowding, and poor quality services interact to magnify the

          to impact health    (48 vs. 33 percent) and higher than those for children in rural areas (42 percent). Multisectoral
          and nutrition       approaches have largely focused on rural areas, but the challenge in urban slums and informal
          outcomes.           settlements is complex, as an effective response involves a multitude of actors and is
                              complicated by institutional constraints and tenure insecurity. Additional analytical work is
                              needed to investigate the WASH characteristics and other nutritional determinants in urban
                              slums and informal settlements and to determine how to effectively engage different actors
                              under the National Slum Upgrading Program (Kotaku). In particular, a better understanding is
                              needed of the contamination pathways unique to these settings, where the typical play
                              environment of children includes solid waste disposal sites and contaminated water bodies,
                              and the disease vectors include not just flies, but also cockroaches and rats.

                              universal access target, with a particular focus on the needs and constraints of the B40.
                              Suggestions are made as to the appropriate responsible agency/stakeholder, based on
                              consultation with government actors and stakeholders.

                              The WASH Poverty Diagnostic in Indonesia covered a broad range of challenges facing the Water
                              Supply and Sanitation Sector in meeting the Universal Access Targets. However, the diagnostic
                              is not exhaustive. Specific challenges recommended for further analytical work include:

                                ••   Water tariff affordability and impact of changes in tariffs on households living below the
                                     poverty line;

                                ••   Economic benefits of WASH provision for reducing income inequality, to include benefit
                                     incidence of net public spending on WASH;

                                ••   Relationship between poor WASH, disease environment, and child nutrition in dense
                                     urban informal settlements, and implementation of multisectoral approaches in these
                                     settings;

                                ••   Water Resources and Water Security Diagnostics, and the relationship with poverty;

                                ••   Institutional and political economy analysis of service delivery of urban sanitation, and
                                     of rural water and sanitation.

  Notes
  1.	 The Regional water systems platform is still at early development stage. These systems
      are planned for areas facing water scarcity. Despite Indonesia having relatively high rainfall,
      water shortages may result from insufficient storage capacity, poor water quality, and
      competing water demands. If a PDAM has insufficient water resources within its jurisdiction,
      it may seek water from neighboring LGs. Regional water systems would fall under the
      mandate of the Province, which may develop the system to supply multiple PDAMs. The
      facilities are constructed by DG Cipta Karya and then managed by provincial water
      institutions.
  2.	 The urban sanitation platform is centered around three major areas of activities: (a) national
      community-based sanitation program (SANIMAS); (b) national urban sewerage; (c) septage
      management, including upgrading on-site sanitation and developing new septage treatment
      plants (IPLTs).

      Indonesia. The MNFAP identifies specific opportunities for multisectoral action, incorporates
      nutrition activities into multisectoral programs and analytical work, strengthens integration,
      and develops concrete implementation plans. The MNFAP is aligned with the recommendations
      of the WASH Poverty Diagnostic.

Improving Service Levels and Impact on the Poor	                                                        77

  Spatial Analysis to Guide Pro-Poor and Poor-Inclusive Water
  and Sanitation Interventions in Indonesia
  Two of the main challenges in implementing pro-poor and poor-inclusive water supply, sanitation,
  and hygiene (WASH) interventions and adopting a multisectoral approach to reducing stunting
  is the coordination of multiple stakeholders across many sectors and the use of many different
  data sets. Ensuring that decision-makers have the tools to identify locations with multiple
  deprivations—high poverty, low access to improved water, lack of access of improved
  sanitation—is essential for the future well-being of these disadvantaged communities. Data
  and analysis can inform and facilitate actions that optimize efforts to reduce poverty and
  stunting along with efforts to increase access to WASH and maximize the use of available
  resources.

  The WASH-Poverty dashboard offers a new tool that provides information through maps—at
  both province and district levels—that visualize access to improved water and sanitation,
  poverty rates, and health outcomes (diarrhea and stunting) to help monitor inequalities in
  WASH services; this information can be used by the government, the World Bank, and other
  development partners. The dashboard illustrates how such data can inform geographic
  targeting to extend coverage and improve service quality for more pro-poor and poor-inclusive
  interventions (and the associated sanitation and hygiene efforts) to have the most impact on
  Indonesia’s health. Furthermore, the dashboard can be used to identify areas where further
  inquiry is needed to understand why service delivery fails within geographic areas. The
  dashboard can also model how changes in variables might influence the districts in which
  poverty, access to WASH, and health outcomes would overlap.

  For each variable presented, the dashboard provides different choices to allow the user to
  select the scope (overall, urban, or rural), category (all population, T60, B40), data year (from
  2102 to 2015), and data unit (households or individuals). For easier selection, each column
  has a drop-down button with choices (see figure A.1).

  There are two different types of spatial analysis:

    a.	 Double Maps
    	 The double map screen (maps A.1–A.3) allows the user to make a comparison of
        two  different variables in a particular year, such as “access to improved water—all
        population—2015—urban—households” with “poverty rate 2015,” or “open defecation
        2013” with “stunting 2013,” or “access to piped water 2014” with “access to improved
        sanitation.” Once both variables have been selected, the dashboard will automatically
        display the variables next to one another. Map keys are provided in the bottom left-hand
        corner of each map as a guide to the color coding. In addition, the map will show the title
        of each province or district and its numbers for easier identification.

        and provinces or districts that meet the second parameter are highlighted in green.
        Provinces or districts that meet both variables are highlighted in blue and will be displayed
        in tabular form. Changing the variables or ranges allows the user to explore different
        dimensions of poverty, WASH access, and health outcomes, which may impact geographic
        targeting of the poor with water and sanitation interventions.

  The datasets were taken from Susenas (for poverty rate and access to water and sanitation)
  from 2012 to 2015, and from RISKESDAS (for diarrhea and stunting rate) for 2013, and data
  on open defecation is taken from STBM monitoring data. The dashboard was designed to be
  open to future improvement, such as (a) adding more time series for existing data sets;
  (b)  adding new data sets, such as nutrition and health data; (c) lowering the level of data
  analysis below district level (e.g., village); (d) translation into Bahasa Indonesia; or (e) fully
  customized index/rating for legend.

  To ensure its sustainable operation and maintenance, the dashboard will be linked to, and
  integrated with, the Government-led National Water and Sanitation Information Services
  (NAWASIS) under Bappenas leadership. Bappenas has agreed to host the dashboard.
