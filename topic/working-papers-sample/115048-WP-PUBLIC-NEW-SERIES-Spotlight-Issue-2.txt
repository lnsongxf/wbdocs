﻿L  How can solar powered products provide electricity at night. when
there isn't any sunshine? The secret is the batteries. Batteries can
store the electricity made during the day so you can use it whenever
you want, Here are some other solar facts that are interesting to
know:.
HERE'S ANOTHER
AMAZING FACT: REMOVIN&
SALT FROM SEA WATER IS ONE
OF THE OWOSTeCOMMERCIAL
USES OF SOLAR ENERGY
It takes less than 9 mmutes for sunlight to travel the
150 million kilometres between the sun and the earth.
2.
In one hour, the sun provides Earth with more energy
than the entire world uses in a year. In 20 days the sun
could provide as much power as all of the world's
fossil fuels combmned,
Food can be cooked or dried and water can be
disinfected using solar energy. In fact, when you hang
your washing in the sun, you are using solar energy to
dry your clothes,
.~ ~ ..  ....  .  ........  .4...... ...
Using salar powered products causes no pollution or
harmful environmental effects.

﻿MORE REASONS WHY
YOU SHOULD
CHOOSE PORTABLE
SOLAR POWER
* Portable solar products let you study later
at night for an improved education.
* It also gives you the power to choose your
own working hours, for a thriving
business.
* Many can even charge cell phones so you
can stay in touch with loved ones,
* There's no need to buy fuel or batteries as
the battery charges off the sun, which is
free, saving you time and money.
* Portable solar products are safer than
other lighting solutions because they do
not negatively affect your health (like
kerosene) and they won't cause fires (like
candles).
* Portable solar products are good for your
community as they help to reduce         A
pollution (you don't have to throw1
out old batteries anymore).
TIPS FOR USING YOUR PORTABLE
SOLAR PRODUCT
* To make the most out of your portable solar product, you need to leave the solar panel
in direct sunlight, storing the battery and light safely.
* Move your solar panel out of shady areas to ensure it gets the maximum charge.
*, If the solar panel is dirty, wipe it clean with a soft cloth, to ensure it absorbs more energy.
Portable solar products should be reliable, affordable, and warranted, For a list of quality-verified
solar products visit the Lighting Africa website: www.lightingafrica.org/products
