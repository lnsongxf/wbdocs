I. INTRODUCTION

Energy efficiency in industry is a crucial topic for Turkey. The country has a structural trade
deficit, which in some years in the last two decades reached as much as 9% of its GDP1. Among
the contributors of the trade deficit, oil and natural gas imports have the lion’s share. Having
an import dependency of around 80% in energy, US$55 billion of a total of US$84 billion trade
deficit in 2014 was due to energy imports (Turkstat). A significant factor underlying such a
high energy dependency is that Turkey’s manufacturing industry is relatively energy intensive.
While every US$1,000 of GDP requires 0.18 ton of oil equivalent (toe) energy consumption in
the OECD, it takes 0.26 toe in Turkey (WB, 2012). Therefore, there is large room for and great
benefits associated with policy effort to increase energy efficiency in Turkish manufacturing
industry.

The importance of energy efficiency is recognized by both the Turkish government and the
World Bank. The 2012-2014 Medium-Term Program of the government states that “…The
systematic pursuit of energy efficiency is therefore a priority and critical for Turkey’s energy
security,   macro/fiscal     stability,   competitiveness,       climate    change     mitigation     and
environmental sustainability…” (Ministry of Development, 2012). Identifying the energy
efficiency one of the priority areas the Country Partnership Strategy, the World Bank
considers greater energy efficiency and diversification of energy sources keys to reducing
Turkey’s reliance on external finance (WB, 1012).

Although the energy inefficiency problem in Turkey is broadly acknowledged, there is a lack
of credible studies to be consulted for designing policies aiming at increasing energy efficiency
in the country. This is particularly a problem for energy use in industry, which accounted for
33.5% of total final energy use in Turkey in 2014 (GDEA) 2. Being one of a few studies on the
topic, Turkay et al. (2012) compares sectors by their share of energy consumption in total
manufacturing costs. The study lists a long series of recommendations to increase energy
efficiency in manufacturing facilities. The World Bank report (2015), on the other hand,
outlines an institutional and legal framework to enhance energy efficiency in Turkey.

  In fact, the unsustainable current account deficit was the main reason for severe financial crises in the
country in 1994 and 2001.
2
  Shares of other areas of energy use are as follows: Residential, commercial and public buildings (35%),
transportation (29%), and agricultural production (2%).

                                                                                                         2
Motivated by the importance of energy efficiency for Turkey, the lack of credible studies in
this area and the existence of a unique firm-level data set that covers all manufacturing
industry over the 2005-2012 period, this study aims to understand how energy efficiency
evolved in Turkish manufacturing industry by its components.

Implementing a decomposition analysis, specifically, this study examines the roles of:

       Change in energy intensity of firms (technical efficiency, firm intensity effect),
       Shift of production across firms in the same sub-sector (within sector reallocation -
        firm structural effect),
       Shift of production across sub-sectors (across sector reallocation – sector structural
        effect)
       Production change (activity effect)

in the change in energy consumption of Turkish manufacturing industry over 2005-2012.

The first and second components above can be calculated only by using firm level data. To
our knowledge, there is only one study (Petrick, 2015) that used a firm level data set (for
Germany) and investigated these two components in the literature. Moreover, to our
knowledge, this is the first decomposition analysis for Turkish manufacturing industry in the
literature.

Findings in this paper are expected to provide useful insights to design more effective and
focused policies to increase energy efficiency in Turkish manufacturing. Therefore, the study
aims to indirectly serve to policies for more favorable external balances and better climate
results of the energy consumption in the country.

The organization of the paper is as follows: The second section discusses the literature. The
third section describes the data set and provides several preliminary figures. The fourth
section introduces the firm level decomposition methodology. The fifth section presents the
decomposition findings. Finally, the sixth section discusses the findings.




II. LITERATURE

Since their first application in late 1970s, index decomposition analyses have been
increasingly used to study the impacts of structural change (i.e. changes in industry product
mix) and sectoral energy intensity change in the energy economics literature. They are also
widely used by national energy institutions around the world for policy-making purposes.

                                                                                             3
Decomposition methods can be broadly categorized in two groups: methods based on the
Laspeyres index and methods based on the Divisia index.

Employing a Laspeyres index based decomposition, Jenne and Cattell (1983) report that
during 1973-1982, structural change accounted for half of the 18% decrease in energy
intensity of UK industry. The remaining residual of 9% implies a 1% annual improvement in
energy efficiency. Following a similar methodology, Marlay (1984) finds that part of the
reduction in the energy consumption of US industry over 1973-1983 resulted from
improvements in the efficiency of industrial process technologies. Most is attributed,
however, to slower growth in industrial economic activity and unprecedented changes in the
composition of industrial output away from industries that consume large amounts of energy.

In another study, Howarth et al. (1991) examine trends in manufacturing energy use in eight
OECD countries, decomposing the changes that occurred between 1973 and 1987 into the
effects of changes in aggregate manufacturing activity, industry structure and energy
intensities measured at the industry level. They conclude that structural change led to modest
reductions in most countries studied.

Underlining theoretical weaknesses of decompositions based on the Laspeyres index, Boyd
et al. (1987) propose the Divisia index approach as an alternative to the Laspeyres in energy
decomposition analysis. They present substantial empirical support for the hypothesis that
sectoral shift in manufacturing production is an important factor in explaining changes in
energy intensity. Moreover, Boyd et al. (1988) make some comparisons between energy
intensity decomposition and the formulation of economic indices. They illustrate the useful
properties of the Divisia index in performing energy intensity decomposition.

Thereafter, extensions and refinement of methods based on the Divisia index were made. Liu
et al. (1992) develop two general parametric Divisia index methods. They also extend the
Divisia based index methodology to the environment field. To overcome the two commonly
encountered problems - existence of a residual after decomposition and the handling of the
value zero - with the existing Divisia index based decompositions; Ang and Choi (1997) modify
the Divisia index decomposition method by replacing the arithmetic mean weight function by
a logarithmic one. This transforms the Divisia index method into a perfect decomposition with
no residual. The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index decomposition is formalized by Ang and Liu
(2001) in multiplicative form.

As for empirical applications of decompositions based on the Divisia index, to decompose the
reduction in energy intensity in China between 1978 and 1995 into technical change and


                                                                                            4
various types of structural change, Garbaccio et al. (1999) employ input-output tables. They
conclude that between 1987 and 1992, technical change within sectors accounted for most
of the fall in the energy output ratio and structural change actually increased the use of
energy. An increase in the import of some energy-intensive products also contributed to the
decline in energy intensity.

Greening et al. (1998) apply the Adaptive Weighted Divisia rolling base year index to total
carbon emissions from the manufacturing sector of 10 OECD countries for the period 1971–
1991. They find that declines in aggregate carbon intensity for these countries may be
primarily attributed to decreases in energy intensity, i.e. increases in the average factor
productivity of energy.

Using data of 2,582 large and medium-size Chinese enterprises over the period 1997-1999
and employing the multiplicative Divisia index, Fisher-Vanden et al. (2004) decompose the
intensity of three types of energy – coal, refined oil, and electricity into the contributions of
sectoral shift (i.e., changes in the sectoral composition of total industrial output) and
subsector productivity change (i.e. changes in energy intensity within individual industrial
sectors). They document that while subsector productivity change emerges as the dominant
factor driving declines in oil and electricity intensities, sectoral shift plays a near equal role in
declining coal and refined oil intensities.

Applying logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) techniques, Ma et al. (2008) investigate the
role of inter-fuel substitution in the decline in energy intensity or the causes of the rise in
energy intensity in the period 1980-2003 for Chinese manufacturing industry. They find that
technological change is the dominant contributor to the decline in energy intensity and
structural change at the industry and sector (sub-industry) levels actually increased energy
intensity over the period. On the other hand, structural change involving shifts of production
between sub-sectors decreased overall energy intensity with inter-fuel substitution
contributing little to the changes in energy intensity3.

Finally, being the only firm level study in the literature, Petrick (2015) decomposes changes
in total CO2 emissions in German manufacturing industry to changes in activity level,
structural change between sectors, shifting market shares within sectors, energy intensity at
the firm level, fuel mix, and emission factors, applying an LMDI index decomposition
technique. He reveals that shifts in production across firms in manufacturing sub-sectors and
shift of production across sub-sectors play larger roles in determining the path of energy use

in German manufacturing industry over the 1995-2007 period than the change in firm energy
intensity does.

Although there has been no attempt so far to decompose energy consumption/CO2 emissions
in the Turkish economy by using firm level data in the literature, there are several papers that
covered the topic for Turkey by employing data at more aggregated levels. Following the
LMDI methodology, Turut Asik et al. (2008) reveal that the main cause of the change in the
energy intensity in Turkish manufacturing intensity over the 1992-2001 period is change in
the energy intensity at the sub-sector (industries at 4 digits) level instead of a structural effect,
i.e. production shift, across sub-sectors. In another study, Tunc et al. (2009) document that
over the 1970-2006 period, economic activity was the main component that determined the
changes in CO2 emissions in Turkey. Moreover, the sectoral intensity effect had a significant
role in the CO2 change, unlike the sectoral structural effect.

Employing a refined Laspeyres methodology, Kumbaroglu (2011) show for the 1990-2007
period that the energy intensity effect has a dominant impact on CO2 emissions in Turkish
manufacturing industry. Applying the LMDI methodology on a Turkish manufacturing industry
data set at the ISIC 4-digit level, Yilmaz et al. (2016) document that the activity effect was by
far the most contributing effect in the increase in energy consumption in Turkish
manufacturing industry over the 1981-2011 period. The structural effect had a slightly
negative effect and the intensity effect had a slightly positive impact on energy consumption
during the period.

III. DATA SET AND PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS

This study makes use of Annual Industry and Services Surveys (AISS) of the Turkstat for the
2005-2012 period. AISS is divided into two parts, based on firm employment size: (i) a census
of firms with at least 20 employees in that year and (ii) a large sample of firms with fewer
than 20 employees with sampling based on region and NACE 4-digit sector.

The variables used for this study are:

       Firm random codes to identify firms (codes change across firms in a year but are the
        same over time for the same firm),
       Year and 2-digit NACE sector codes,
       Value of energy consumption,
       Value of production (gross output).




                                                                                                   6
In order to prepare the data set for computations, monetary variables were deflated by
applying sector level wholesale price indices and energy price indices. Table 1 below presents
some annual key figures from the data set. The figures are consistent with those officially
announced by Turkstat.

       2007              317                2.78             14.0               372
       2008              322                2.78             13.4               392

       2010              300                2.79             12.8               415
       2011              333                3.08             14.0               488
       2012              310                3.32             14.6               495
     Average             315                2.25             13.1               399

Since we can properly track only firms that employ 20+ employees every year within the
period (due to the fact that firms with fewer than 20 employees are not subject to the census
sample), we have to limit the firm level decomposition to firms existing in the data set every
year over the period. The number of these firms (all period 20+ firms) is 9,379. Although they
represent a very small share of all firms by count (3%), their average shares over the 2005-
2012 period in total manufacturing employment, energy consumption and production are
45.6%, 72.5% and 66.5%, respectively. (Corresponding figures of 20+ firms and those of 9,379
all period 20+ firms are provided in the Appendix.)

Next, we provide sector level statistics in the following three figures. First, Figure 1 provides
an Index that compares total energy consumption of sectors in 2005 and 2012 and also shows
how energy consumption of each sector changed over the 2005-2012 period. In the figure,
the total energy consumption of all sectors is set to 100. The total of all sectors in 2012 is
computed as 127.8, indicating a 27.8% increase in the total energy consumption of the
manufacturing industry over the 2005-2012 period. (This can be verified in Table 1 as well.)

As for sectors, classified by NACE (rev.1.1) 2-digit sectors, other non-metallic mineral products
(cement, glasses, ceramics etc.) manufacturing, textile manufacturing and basic metals
manufacturing were leading sectors in terms of energy consumption with a total share of 56%

                                                                                               7
in 2005. Increasing their energy consumption by around 35% over the period (e.g. from 19.8
to 27.0 and 16.9 to 23.2), other non-metallic products and basic metals manufacturing
strengthened their leadership position in energy consumption. Besides, recording a 39%
increase (from 12.7 to 17.6), food products and beverages sector became the third sector in
terms of energy consumption in 2012. On the other hand, the share of textiles in
manufacturing industry energy consumption decreased significantly over the period.

     Figure 1: Energy Consumption Index of Manufacturing Sectors (2005 total=100)




In parallel to Figure 1, Figure 2 below demonstrates the production index values of sectors.
Once the total manufacturing production index is set to 100, the corresponding index is
computed as 154.0, indicating a 54% increase in the manufacturing industry production over
the period. As for sectors, food products and beverages was the sector with the highest
production share (14.1%) in 2005. It was followed by textiles (%11.4) and motor vehicles
(10.4%) manufacturing sectors. Recording an increase from 14.1 to 21.2, the food products
and beverages sector strengthened its leading role in the manufacturing industry production
over the period. While the motor vehicles and trailers manufacturing maintained its position,
textile manufacturing lost momentum as its index value increased only from 11.4 to 13.9, an
increase less than that is observed in the manufacturing industry. On the other hand, other
transport equipment, machinery and equipment, recycling, electrical machinery and
apparatus, rubber and plastic products manufacturing sectors increased their share in the

                                                                                           8
manufacturing industry production as the growth in the production of these sectors have
been higher than the average growth of the production of the manufacturing industry during
the 2005-2012 period.




           Figure 2: Production Index of Manufacturing Sectors (2005 total=100)




Finally, we present energy intensity by sector in Figure 3. Energy intensity is calculated as
100*energy consumption value divided by the production value. In 2005, other non-metallic
mineral products were the most energy intensive sector (13.1%) by a wide margin. It was
followed by basic metals, textiles and pulp and paper products. On the opposite end, office
machinery & computers, television & other telecommunications equipment, motor vehicles
& trailers, and medical, precision and optical instruments had an energy intensity of less than
1%. Out of 23 sectors, only in 3 of them energy intensity increased over the 2005-2012 period.
The increase was particularly significant in coke and refined petroleum products
manufacturing, from 1.5% to 3.0%. Although the energy intensity of the other non-metallic
mineral products decreased by 1.8% points, it continued to be the highest energy intensive
sector with 11.3%.

IV. METHODOLOGY

As for the methodology, we develop an extension of the multiplicative version of the Log-
Mean Divisia Index Method-I (LMDI-I) decomposition introduced by Ang and Liu (2001). There
are three main reasons for preferring this method over some others in the literature4:

       The Divisia index uses logarithmic change, unlike the Laspeyres index, which makes use
        of the concept of percentage change. Tornqvist et al. (1985) present the merit of using
        the log change and point that it is the only symmetric and additive indicator of relative
        change, whereas the ordinary percentages are asymmetric and non-additive.
       Among those based on Divisia, the Arithmetic Mean Divisia Index (AMD) methods fail
        the factor reversal test and can yield a large residual, which may significantly limit the
        usefulness of the decomposition for policy purposes5.
       Although the log-mean Divisia Index Method-II (LMDI-II), proposed by Ang and Choi
        (1997), solves the problem of the residual, it is not consistent in aggregation6.


4
  See Ang et al. (2009) for other desirable properties of LMDI-I.
5
  The factor reversal test requires that multiplying a price index and a volume index of the same type should
be equal to the proportionate change in the current values.
6
  Introduced by Diewert (1980), consistency in aggregation implies that an index value calculated in more
than one step is equal to that calculated in a single step. See Ang and Liu (2001) for the proof that LMDI-I is
consistent in aggregation.

                                                                                                            10
LMDI-I has all the desirable properties of perfect decomposition and consistency in
aggregation. Perfect decomposition ensures that the decomposition results obtained do not
contain a residual term7.

Adapting the Log-Mean Divisia Index-I decomposition, originally developed for sector level
analysis, to firm level data, the general formula of our decomposition methodology becomes
the following8:

                                                                 Qf E f
                                           E   Q Q
                                                    Q
                                                             S
                                                                 QS Q f
                                                 S   f



where s, f, E and Q stand for sector, firm, energy consumption and production, respectively.

Then, change in the energy consumption of the manufacturing industry between the base
year (0) and the end year (T) can be decomposed into components as follows:

                                     E T / E 0  Dman  Dact DstrsDstrf Dint f

In the equation above:

         Dman is the total change in the energy consumption in the manufacturing industry,
         Dact is the activity effect, the change in the aggregate associated with a change in the
          overall level of the activity in the manufacturing industry,
         Dstrs is the sector structural effect, the change in the aggregate associated with a
          change in the relative shares of sectors in overall manufacturing,
         Dstrf is the firm structural effect, the change in the aggregate associated with changes
          in the relative shares of firms within sectors,
         Dintf is the intensity effect, the change in the aggregate associated with changes in the
          firm energy intensities.

V. DECOMPOSITION RESULTS

Firm level decomposition results are provided in Figures 4 to 8. Over the 2005-2012 period,
energy consumption in Turkish manufacturing industry increased by 27.3% (Figure 4). Out of
7 years covered, energy consumption decreased only in 2008 and 2009, by 2.8% and 12.9%,
respectively. This is not surprising because the Turkish economy contracted in the Q4 of 2008
and the whole 2009 in parallel to the global economic crisis.




                                                                                          12
               Figure 4: Change in Aggregate Energy Consumption (Dman)




The sharp increase in production activity was the main factor behind the rise in energy
consumption in the manufacturing industry. Over the whole period, production activity
increased by 51.1%. The increase was particularly noteworthy in 2010 (14.5%) and 2011
(15.6%), following a 10.0% decrease in 2009.

             Figure 5: Effect of Activity Change on Energy Consumption (Dact)




                                                                                    13
On the other hand, sectoral structural effect (Figure 6), change in the aggregate energy
consumption due to shift of production across sectors with different energy
intensity/efficiency levels, and firm structural effect (Figure 7), change in the aggregate
energy consumption due to the shift of production across firms with different energy
intensity/efficiency levels within sectors were both very small over the period. Specifically,
the shift of production towards more energy efficient sectors in the manufacturing industry
and more efficient firms within sectors had a 2.1% and 1.6% contractionary impact on the
aggregate energy consumption in 2012 relative to the aggregate energy consumption in year
2005.

             Figure 6: Sectoral Structural Effect on Energy Consumption (Dstrs)




We do not detect a statistically significant correlation between the sectoral structural effect
index and the firm structural effect index, indicating that these two effects do not necessarily
act in coordination.




                                                                                             14
               Figure 7: Firm Structural Effect on Energy Consumption (Dstrf)




Finally, Figure 8 presents the firm intensity effect. As we define the energy intensity as energy
consumption*100 divided by the energy consumption, energy intensity is the opposite of the
energy efficiency term. Figure 8 demonstrates that the decrease in the energy intensity of
firms had a significant contractionary impact on the aggregate energy consumption over the
2005-2012 period. Specifically, the same firm, on average, produced the same value of output
by using 12.5% less energy in 2012 relative to 2005. In fact, among all four effects covered,
the intensity effect has been by far the most contractionary effect on energy consumption in
the manufacturing industry.

                                                                                              15
Effect of Firm Selection on Firm Level Decomposition Findings

Remember that for conducting firm level analysis we had to work only with 9,379 specific
firms that exist every year over the 2005-2012 period. One consideration pertaining to the
firm level decomposition findings is the degree to which they are representative of the energy
patterns of the whole manufacturing industry. Since these firms account for 72.5% of energy
consumption and 66.5% of production the manufacturing industry, we do not expect firm
selection has a significant negative impact on the quality of our findings above. However, in
order to get an educated idea about this, we below run traditional sector level decomposition
by first using the whole universe of firms and second by using only those specific 9,379 firms9.

The decomposition findings presented in Table 2a and Table 2b are very similar. Therefore,
we conclude that not being able to cover all firms in the firm level decomposition does not
pose a big problem for the representativeness of that decomposition of the whole
manufacturing industry.

VI. DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS

In this section, we first discuss our firm level decomposition findings by comparing with the
findings of the only firm level study in the literature - Petrick (2015) for the German
manufacturing industry. Although the time period of that study is different from ours, we still
conduct such a comparison as it is the only firm level decomposition analysis in the literature
and we believe that energy dynamics in an industry is not likely to change significantly over a
short period of time. Comparison by each decomposition component is given in Table 3. First,
unlike a significant 27% increase in the energy consumption in Turkey over the 2005-2012
period, energy consumption in Germany increased by a much smaller amount (5%) over the
2000-2007 period.

 We use the multiplicative version of the Log-Mean Divisia Index Method-I decomposition introduced by
Ang and Liu (2001).

                                                                                                  16
                      Table 3: Comparison of Turkey and Germany Findings
                                            Turkey (2005-2012)   Germany (2000-2007)
     Activity Effect                               51%                   15%
     Sectoral Structural Effect                     -2%                  -6%
     Firm Structural Effect                         -2%                  -4%
     Intensity Effect                              -13%                   1%
                                    10
     Aggregate Energy Consumption                  27%                   5%

Second, although their magnitudes by country differ significantly, the activity effect has been
the main driver of the change in aggregate energy consumption in both countries with 51%
for Turkey and 15% for Germany. Third, both the sectoral structural effect and the firm
structural effect had a more contractionary effect on aggregate energy consumption for
Germany (-6% and -4%, respectively) than for Turkey (-2% for both effects). This implies that,
although across-sector and across-firm within-sector production reallocation has been
towards energy efficient sectors/firms in both Germany and Turkey, these effects were much
stronger in Germany. Finally, while the energy intensity effect for Germany was almost
stagnant over 2000-2007 with a mere 1% increase, the energy intensity of a specific firm
decreased by on average an impressive 13% over the 2005-2012 period.

To recap, using a firm level decomposition methodology, we documented that, rather than
across sectors structural change, and within sector across-firm structural change, the activity
effect and the firm intensity effect were the drivers of the change in energy consumption in
Turkish manufacturing industry over the 2005-2012 period. With the superiority of firm level
analysis over sector level analysis, we could show in this study that the energy efficiency
increases within sectors seen in Table 2a and Table 2b are from the increase in firm level
efficiency rather than shift of production towards more energy efficient firms within sectors.

As for policy implications, we believe that there are two areas that need to be investigated
further for designing policies aiming at higher energy efficiency in Turkey. First, the very small
role of the production shift from higher energy intensive sectors to lower energy intensive
sectors (sector structural effect) as well as from higher energy intensive firms to lower energy
intensive firms within-sectors (firm structural effect) might be indicating serious market
failures and barriers that prevent more energy efficient firms from increasing their share in
total production in Turkish manufacturing industry. Therefore, addressing the source of this
low-level dynamism could yield useful results for enhancing energy efficiency.

  In Petrick (2015), the aggregate CO2 emissions is decomposed, instead of the aggregate energy
consumption. We calculated aggregate energy consumption for that study by deducting the effects of fuel
mix change and emission factor of fuels from the aggregate CO2 emissions presented in that study.

                                                                                                    17
Second, and in contrast to the structural change, the significant decrease in the firm level
energy intensity over the 2005-2012 period can be considered an impressive progress
towards energy efficiency in the manufacturing industry. Although there are several potential
candidates as the source of this progress such as increasing openness to trade and
technological development11, exact reasons can only be revealed by research designed and
conducted solely for this purpose.
