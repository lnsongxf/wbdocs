5.	 Inadequate reduction of operating and fiscal risks. Although
    the Budget System Law defines the role of the Fiscal
    Council as a critical advisory body, its recommendations
    and opinions, particularly on public and state-owned
    enterprises and state guarantees, are often neglected.
    The assessments and conclusions of the Fiscal Council
    and other experts have minimal impact on decisions on
    loans, guarantees, and major publicly financed projects.
    Assessments by the Fiscal Council should have a greater
    impact on decisions made by the government in the
    area of fiscal risk management. Additionally, actions
    taken by the government to mitigate fiscal risks should
    be transparent and publicly disclosed, to allow leading
    experts to provide advice and input on these actions.

6.	 Understaffing of government institutions in charge of fiscal
    risk management. A lack of sufficient resources strains the
    staff currently involved in fiscal risk management. This
    problem is difficult to address because of restrictions that
    prevent the hiring of new staff, including both the Law
    on Determination of Maximal Number of Employees in
    the Public Sector and the Decision on Maximal Number
    of Employees in State Administration.34 However, in
    the short-term, understaffing could be addressed by
    rearranging existing capacity within the GoS.

7.	 Lack of a disaster risk financing framework. The GoS
    currently has no comprehensive, forward-looking
    strategy for managing the fiscal risk posed by natural
    disasters, leaving the government reliant on ex post
    budget reallocations, emergency borrowing, and
    donor assistance—all of which can lead to a delayed,
    unpredictable, and underfunded emergency response.
    In order to integrate disasters into a broader contingent
    financing framework, a comprehensive national disaster
    risk finance strategy could be developed in coordination
    with the Public Investment Management Office.

Process Mapping:
Macro Processes
The proposed FRMD should work closely with existing
entities involved in fiscal risk management. It is critical that
the responsibilities of all these actors be clearly defined
and delineated, and that the interactions between them be
clearly mapped out. The macro process maps shown for
each of the proposed FRMD units (figures 4–6) outline the
inputs each unit should receive and from whom, the key
activities of each unit, and each unit’s key outputs. For a
more detailed, indicative mapping of micro processes that
each FRMD unit could follow—related to data collection,
risk reporting, etc.—please see the micro process maps in
appendix C.

assessments were complete, the FRMD's personnel would
develop recommendations on how to effectively mitigate
a specific risk. The FRMD should also coordinate the
information flow between the existing relevant institutions
and should produce standardized and comprehensive
reports on key fiscal risks facing the government of Serbia.
The department could more actively manage risks that are
not currently covered by existing entities.

Furthermore, the FRMD should draft a Fiscal Risk
Statement identifying and describing existing fiscal risks in
detail. It should also develop the government’s fiscal risk
management strategy. In situations when urgent mitigating
actions are required, the FRMD should be authorized to
prepare and submit an ad hoc report assessing the situation
and proposing mitigating measures.

Appendix C. Process Mapping:
Micro Processes

To assist the GoS in translating these recommendations into actual tasks, behaviors, and actions, three micro processes have
been detailed for each of the three FRMD units:

1.	 Data collection, which involves gathering of information from all relevant stakeholders

2.	 Risk processing, which involves identifying and analyzing risks, developing risk mitigation strategies, and updating the
    risk register

3.	 Risk reporting and mitigation, which involves submitting periodic and ad hoc reports to the MoF state secretary

Micro processes by Unit A are presented in figures 7–9.

        possibility for ensuring the involvement of all
        required stakeholders.
