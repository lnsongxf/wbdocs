Executive Summary

1.	     The Lao economy is estimated to have grown at around 7 percent in 2016, a slight
moderation from 7.4 percent in the previous year. A marked increase in power sector
contribution and some from the manufacturing sector was partly offset by slight moderation
in construction, flat mining output, and stable public spending. Around 1,350MW of installed
capacity was estimated to have come on stream in 2016 increasing the installed capacity of
the power system by more than 20 percent to above 6,000MW. Output in agriculture recovered
following last year’s drought. Recent investments in agriculture have also resulted in greater
commercialization of the sector and increased exports. Output in manufacturing continued to
expand, albeit from a low base and mostly confined to the Special Economic Zones. Construction
activity remained resilient in 2016 supported by the pipeline power projects as well as real estate
development. On the other hand, mining output remained largely flat as ongoing operations
reached maturity and no new projects of a more significant size were initiated. The number
of tourist arrivals declined in the nine months of 2016 mostly due to fewer arrivals from the
region; however, the impact was offset partly by an increase in western tourists who typically
stay longer and have higher spending per day.

2.	     Inflation pressures remain low, though prices increased faster in the second half of
the year as oil prices recovered. The overall annual inflation averaged 1.8 percent in 2016
compared to 1.3 percent a year earlier as oil and food prices recovered toward year end. Food
inflation averaged at 4.5 percent compared to 4.7 percent in the same period while core inflation
was 1.1 percent in 2016.

3.	      The fiscal deficit widened significantly in FY15/16 due to a revenue shortfall. The
deficit is estimated to have reached 6.2 percent in FY15/16, from below 4 percent of GDP in the
previous two fiscal years. Revenues, as ratio to GDP, are expected to have declined to 19 percent
of GDP in FY15/16 from about 23 percent in FY14/15 due to lower commodity and oil prices
(affecting royalties and taxes on mining, and excises and import duties on oil), and moderating
economic activity and imports. In response, the authorities canceled tax exemptions on fuel
imports for investment projects and put increasing focus on administration. At the same time,
spending cuts were less commensurate to the revenue shortfall, in part due to spending related
to Lao PDR’s ASEAN Chairmanship in 2016 with the expenditure to GDP ratio declining to 25
percent in FY15/16 from 27 percent in FY14/15.
8   Lao Economic Monitor April 2017



    4.	     The deficit was financed by increased public borrowing, pushing up total public debt
    stock and the risk of debt distress. The Government has increasingly resorted to bilateral and
    commercial borrowing. Total public debt outstanding was estimated around 68 percent of GDP
    in 2016, up from 66 percent of GDP in 2015 and 57 percent of GDP in 2011. In response, the
    2016 Joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis moved Lao PDR to high risk of debt
    distress. Furthermore, the issue of public sector arrears still remains. While the total stock of
    arrears is unclear, the Government has allocated 30 percent of annual capital spending to clear
    arrears.

    5.	     Monetary policy was directed towards stimulating credit growth, with some success.
    The Bank of Lao PDR (BOL) further reduced the policy rate in August 2016 after the last
    reduction in July 2015. With limited effectiveness of the interest rate channel, at the same time,
    BOL also reduced the interest rate caps on kip deposit and lending rates. By September 2016,
    credit growth picked up to 21 percent year-over-year (y-o-y) compared to 17 percent y-o-y in
    last December. This was driven by increased lending to the industry, commerce and service
    sectors as well as consumer credits that compensated for a decline in credit to construction
    and transport sectors. Still, growth rates remain well below the unsustainable rates seen in
    the past few years of about 35 percent annually. Most recently, BOL relaxed the conditions on
    lending in foreign currencies to also include importers of some products in addition to exporters.
    BOL also provided long-term loans to some banks.

    6.	     While the number of banking institutions and their assets increased, some banks still
    face inadequate capital and weak loan portfolios. Overall, the banking sector is profitable;
    however, only around one quarter of the banks have return on assets of around 2 percent and
    above. The authorities have announced plans for restructuring of two state-owned banks and
    have requested the weaker private banks to prepare plans to meet the minimum required capital
    levels over the medium term. Still, a stronger system is needed to deal with the challenges in
    the banking sector, including improving the disclosure of financial information and risks by
    commercial banks, enhancing market discipline, broadening the tools available for financial
    authorities to deal with distressed banks, strengthening the deposit insurance function.

    7.	     Exchange rate policy remained focused on tight management of the kip/US dollar
    exchange rate. The official kip exchange rate depreciated against the US dollar and the Baht in
    the second half of the 2016. Nevertheless, the nominal effective exchange rate stabilized in 2016
    compared to faster appreciation in 2015. With inflation pressures subdued, the appreciation
    of the real effective exchange rate moderated during 2016; however, the appreciation over
    the last five years is estimated to have reached about 30 percent. With insufficient buffers
                                                                  Lao Economic Monitor April 2017    9



to maintain the exchange rate regime and restrictions on foreign exchange by commercial
banks, the kip came under pressures at the parallel market in the last quarter of 2016 with
a 3-5 percent difference emerging between the official reference rate and the exchange rate
at the exchange offices. Allowing greater flexibility of the exchange rate within the band and
greater consideration of the exchange rate developments in key trading partners can help
reduce the pressure on the reserves and the real appreciation of the Kip, but will also need to be
accompanied with supportive monetary and fiscal policies.

8.	     The current account deficit improved in 2016. Higher exports of electricity and
manufactures and lower fuel imports more than offset the impact of lower copper prices and
the significant decline in timber exports in response to more stringent implementation of
measures to reduce illegal logging. Foreign reserves were almost US$940 million in September
2016 and is expected to slightly increase by December but still cover less than 2 months of
imports and about 25 percent of foreign currencies deposits implying limited buffers against
shocks, particularly in the context of a tightly managed exchange rate of the kip to the US
dollar.

9.	     The economic prospects remain favorable overall. GDP growth is projected to remain
at around 7 percent in 2017 and 2018, supported by the healthy pipeline of power projects and
growing opportunities for the non-resource sector resulting from closer ASEAN integration and
efforts to improve the investment climate. Around 20 power plants are at different stage of
construction with about 600 MW expected to come on stream over the next two years which
are expected to continue to stimulate the domestic economy and to increase power exports.
Recent trends in the rest of the economy are expected to continue. For example, tourism will
benefit from improved air transport connectivity, retail trade will grow as regional franchises
further expand, and recent entrants into the insurance sector are expected to result in
deepening of the sector. The start of the construction of the railway line connecting Vientiane
to the border with China (Lao-China railway) as part of the Kunming-Singapore railway will
also add to domestic demand but also lead to widening of the fiscal and external balances.
The fiscal deficit is projected to stabilize in 2017 resulting from the Government’s effort in
strengthening non-resource taxation, reviewing exemptions and improving public finance
management. However, the borrowing to finance equity participation in the railway project will
keep the fiscal deficit high.

10.	   Fiscal consolidation and strengthened public debt management will help keep the
debt burden sustainable. The reduction in fiscal deficit will require a wider tax base (increasing
some tax rates, introducing new revenue sources, eliminating exemptions) as well as improved
10   Lao Economic Monitor April 2017



     tax administration (updated tax payer registries, e-filling, tax audits and so on). On the
     expenditure side, it will require improving efficiency of public spending and preventing off-
     budget projects. On public debt management, the revised Budget Law increases the public debt
     reporting and analytical requirements, while the Public Debt Law, expected to be promulgated
     during 2017, will strengthen the role of the Ministry of Finance in managing public debt. Further
     efforts are needed to ensure increased awareness of risks of non-concessional borrowing and
     prioritization to ensure borrowing for priority and credible projects with highest rates of return.
     Adopting a medium-term debt strategy is a priority.

     11.	     Risks have increased. The degree of uncertainty over the external outlook has increased
     considerably. Greater disturbances in the region in response to a growing list of potential triggers
     (economic policies in the US, evolution of the UK exit from the European Union, a more difficult
     rebalancing in China etc.) could affect Lao PDR’s main economic partners and lower external
     demand and investment flows. Further weakening of copper, gold, coffee and rubber prices could
     lower mining and agriculture output, affect livelihoods negatively and put further pressure on
     fiscal accounts. Domestically, if not addressed, continued pressures on the exchange rate risk
     igniting inflation, testing the stability of the financial sector and sustainability of public debt.
     Sustainability of fiscal accounts can be tested in case the announced fiscal consolidation is
     derailed and if public debt management function is not upgraded promptly, including steps to
     limit the government’s exposure to contingent liabilities (off-budget spending, cost overruns
     etc.). Similarly, failure to address weaknesses in the financial sector can trigger a larger risk
     to stability and create a significant fiscal burden that the budget cannot absorb. Also, the
     caps on commercial banks’ interest rates may prevent banks from adequately pricing risk and
     result in exclusion of small-medium size borrowers who tend to have higher risks; a more robust
     financial system and stronger creditor rights are a more efficient way to improve the terms
     of financing provided by banks. Finally, to fully reap the benefits of its hydropower potential,
     Lao PDR needs to secure markets for the rapidly growing power generation and develop the
     required transmission systems or risks ending up with significant liabilities.

     12.	    While the country has achieved strong economic development over the past decade,
     higher investment on human development, particularly on health services, has become
     one priority. The total health expenditure in Lao PDR is still characterized by low levels of
     Government spending leading to still high level of out-of-pocket (OOP) spending and reliance
     on external finance. The average health spending per capita is among the lowest in the region,
     which also resulted in slower progress in improving health outcomes such as maternal and
     child mortality. The high levels of OOP spending, which account for as high as 39 percent of
     total health spending in 2014, deter health service utilization by the poor, reduce the potential
                                                                  Lao Economic Monitor April 2017    11



redistributive capacity of the health financing system. Health sector financing is also reliant on
external assistance, which has declined in its share in recent times. These have put a greater
pressure on public financing and improving the efficiency in public spending on service delivery.
To make greater progress toward attainment of Universal Health Coverage by 2025 in Lao
PDR, a warranted increase in government spending on health services provision, particularly
from domestic revenue sources, is essential for reducing the financial burden on households and
the vulnerability associated with the uncertainty of external financing and external technical
assistance.

     Part I: Recent Economic Developments
     Growth

     1.	     The Lao economy has been one of the fastest growing economies globally over the last
     decade. GDP growth averaged 8 percent per annum since 2000 with Gross National Income
     (GNI) per capita reaching the lower-middle income country threshold in 2011 and further
     increasing to around US$1,740 in 2015. Natural resources including mining, hydro power and
     forestry, (accounting for 44 percent of total wealth in 2014) were a key driver of growth during
     this period. During the 2000s, growth was driven by mining; but a decline in prices, lower grade
     reserves, as well as sector regulation issues lowered its contribution more recently. The power
     sector expanded significantly since mid-2000s, and the associated construction activities and
     subsequent commercial operation, largely expected to meet demand in neighboring countries,
     drove growth. Lao PDR’s installed capacity increased ten-fold between 2000 and 2016 to
     above 6,000MW, mostly through engagement with the private, mostly foreign, investors.

     2.	      Growth has recently become more broad-based. Services expanded due to some
     liberalization of the economy (trading, tourism, banking, transport, etc.) and spillovers
     from natural resource projects. Services account for about 36 percent of GDP, but remain
     concentrated in low-value added sectors. Agriculture, where two thirds of the labor force
     was engaged in 2012, remains characterized by low productivity; though there is evidence
     of diversification away from subsistence (largely) rice production towards commercial cash
     crops, including coffee, banana, rubber, beans etc. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 9
     percent of GDP, traditionally concentrated in garments, also grew and diversified to equipment
     parts, albeit from a low base and mostly confined to special economic zones. Rapid growth
     and a growing consumer base also boosted construction of commercial and residential real
     estate. Strong growth rates in electricity consumption of around 26 percent during 2014-2016
     confirm the rapid expansion of economic activity. The industrial sector accounted for most
     of the increase in electricity consumption (11 percentage points), followed by residential and
     commercial sectors (9 and 5 percentage points, respectively).

     3.	     In 2016, the economic growth moderated slightly to around 7 percent, from 7.4
     percent in 2015. The marked increase in power sector contribution and some manufacturing
     sector is partly offset by slight moderation in construction, flat mining output, and stable
     public spending (Figure 1, 2). The installed capacity in the power sector is expected to have
     increased by more than 20 percent compared to the previous year to above 6,000 MW as the
                                                                    Lao Economic Monitor April 2017    15



remaining units of Hongsa Lignite power project and other projects came on stream in 2016.
This helped boost power exports to Thailand by more than 70 percent in 2016. Construction
activity moderated as a few projects’ construction were completed in 2015 and contained
public investment; however, activity remains robust supported by the pipeline projects as
well as real estate development. Output in manufacturing continued to expand resulting in
continued growth in exports of equipment parts, albeit from a low base and mostly confined to
the Special Economic Zones (SEZ). Output in agriculture is expected to have recovered following
the previous year’s drought. According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates,
rice output is estimated to have increased by 5 percent in 2016 compared to 2015. Also, output
of other crops increased (banana, maize, rubber) reflecting recent investment in agriculture
plantations; though, concerns have been raised about the environmental sustainability of
the practices used at some of the plantations. A number of services sectors performed well,
including retail trade, and insurance as the number of companies increased.

4.	    Output in copper have declined slightly due to lower grade ore at one of the two large
mines while no new projects were initiated, partly due to the continuation of the moratorium
on new concessions. Stronger controls on logging and strict implementation of Government
decision No. 15 issued in May 2016 banning the export of unprocessed wood resulted in reduced
wood exports. The number of tourist arrivals from the region declined but this was offset by the
increase of western visitors who stay longer and spend more.

     5.	     Despite the recent growth in the private sector, including the Special Economic
     Zones, the sector remains small, low value-added and inward oriented. A burdensome
     operating environment, including a difficult procedure to start a business, complex licensing
     and compliance requirements, creates incentives to stay small and informal and limits firm’s
     investments. Lao PDR was ranked 139, out of 190 economies, on the 2017 Ease of Doing Business1
     rankings, reflecting weak and inconsistent enforcement of regulations, as well as complicated
     and burdensome procedures. Other surveys confirm these findings and some recent findings
     from the Enterprise Survey in 2016 are summarized in Box 1. This generates uncertainty,
     high costs, affects investment and encourages informality. Consequently, markets remain
     characterized by an uneven playing field and limited competition. While some companies
     and actors might be able to navigate such an environment (characterized by negotiation and
     discretionary decisions), it particularly places burden on new entrants and smaller, including
     women-owned and innovative, companies, reducing the scope for inclusive growth.



            Box 1: Key findings from the Enterprise Survey 20162

            1.	 According to the 2016 Enterprise Survey (based on 2015 data), the practices of
            the informal sector are the biggest obstacle to business operation, followed by tax
            rates and shortage of skilled workers (Figure 3). Practices of the informal sector
            was the biggest obstacle for 27 percent of the interviewed firms, up from 18 percent
            of firms in the previous round of the Enterprises Survey in 2012. Furthermore, 77
            percent of firms in Lao PDR reported that they competed against unregistered firms
            compared to an EAP average and global average of 53 and 52 percent, respectively.

            2.	 Tax rates were also cited among the biggest obstacles, particularly for small
            businesses, foreign owned and those with female top manager. This could be
            prompted by strengthened application of tax rates against the backdrop of the
            shortfall of revenue collection. The interviewed Lao PDR firms are more frequently
            visited by tax officials and the visits last longer (compared to EAP and global
            averages), but they still do not report tax administration as a major constraint like
            the previous survey.

            3.	 Thirdly, skills shortages remain a persistent constraint for the business growth,
            significantly more acute compared to the regional average. Around 13 percent of
            firms identified the lack of educated workforce as the biggest constraint, compared

to 7 percent in the EAP, on average. The constraint appears to be more severe for
large firms that export and those are in the service sector. This is confirmed by
the 2012 STEP Employer Survey showing that in almost 40 percent of recruitment
attempts, applicants lacked the required skills. This is true for many levels – i.e. for
manager positions, specialists as well as elementary positions. Factors contributing
to the lack of skills and skill demand-supply mismatch come from the disconnect
between the curricula, business needs and quality of education. More importantly,
weak early childhood education does affect children’s ability to learn during their
adult life and their skill development, exacerbated by relatively low government
spending on operation and maintenance, teaching and learning materials. On
the other hand, the wages offered in the private sector may not be sufficiently
attractive making it challenging to attract workers as the wages that firms are
willing to pay (determined by firms’ productivity) are only somewhat higher than
effective wages in the agricultural sector.

4.	Other commonly cited obstacles are infrastructure-related, including in
electricity. While costs of electricity in Lao PDR are not excessive, especially
compared to the region, and electrification has been very successful, the views
of the firms could reflect a relatively difficult process of getting an electricity
connection (According to the 2017 Doing Business report, Lao PDR was ranked
155th, out of 190 economies, on getting electricity indicator).

5.	 Interestingly, even though almost three quarters of respondent firms in Lao PDR
report that they are expected to give gifts to secure government contracts and
to get things done, compared to an EAP average of below 50 percent and global
average of below 30 percent, few Lao PDR firms consider corruption as a major
obstacle. These could be indicative of a business environment in which incumbents
have learned to navigate the complex environment that doesn’t encourage entry
and competition. However, the practice has implications on the cost of investment
projects and the effectiveness in the selection process.

6.	 At the same time, Lao PDR has been given relatively favorable scores on the
country’s business environment in the areas of crime, theft and disorder, labor
regulations and customs regulations. Also, the rapid expansion of the financial
sector appears to have lowered the importance of access to finance as a constraint
18   Lao Economic Monitor April 2017




          to doing business. However, business do need loans at better terms, including longer
          maturity, lower collateral requirements and interest rates.

6.	     While GDP growth has been strong, sharing the benefit of growth could be improved.
Growth was, to a large degree, driven by natural resources which are capital intensive and
create fewer jobs, while low productivity in agriculture and weak performance in manufacturing
limited the income generating opportunities for most Lao people. As a consequence, the
growth elasticity of poverty3 was around -0.4 during 2007-2012. Only the Philippines had a
lower growth elasticity of poverty in the Southeast Asia region. Cambodia for example had a
growth elasticity of poverty of -1.2 during 2004-2011; Vietnam and Indonesia also had higher
growth elasticity of poverty compared to Lao PDR, as well as most resource-rich countries.
With more diversified economic activity in recent years, the link between growth and poverty
reduction may have strengthened. While more recent poverty numbers are not available, the
expansion in labor-intensive sectors, including agriculture, services and light manufacturing, in
an environment of low inflation pressures, may have made growth more pro-poor.

7.	     Making growth more inclusive will also require improved human development
outcomes. Despite economic progress, Lao PDR still lag behind regional peers on social
outcomes. Malnutrition and stunting remains high and have long term impact on human
capital potential. The social sectors, health and education, could further benefit from more
investments and redistribution of resources. Currently the financing of the health sector is
characterized by low public investment and reliance on donor financing and patients’ out of
pocket spending. Part II of this edition of the Lao Economic Monitor provides a discussion on
the health expenditures in Lao PDR.

3
    The growth elasticity of poverty means the percentage reduction in poverty rates associated with one percentage change in
    GDP per capita. In the case of Lao PDR, for one percent increase in GDP per capita, poverty fell by around 0.4 percent during
    2007-2012. On the other hand, Cambodia had poverty reduced by 1.2 percent for every 1 percent growth in GDP per capita during
    2004-2011.

     Inflation

     8.	      Low oil prices kept inflation below 2 percent in 2016 (Figure 5). Retail fuel prices have
     been increasing gradually after reaching their six-year low in April 2016, in line with recovery
     of oil prices at global markets (Figure 6). Still, fuel prices in October 2016 were 3 percent below
     their level in October 2015. Lower fuel prices are likely to benefit consumers, given that fuel
     accounts for about 8 percent of consumption basket. Energy inflation may further pick up
     in 2017 if the recently announced agreement among major oil producers succeeds in limiting
     production.

     9.	     Food inflation slightly moderated in the second half of 2016 following slower growth
     in vegetable prices. Food prices remain high with food inflation averaging 4.5 percent during
     January-October 2016 (Figure 7). Vegetable prices increased by more than 15 percent in the first
     half of 2016 following high domestic demand for consumption, particularly in urban cities, and
     more expensive imported fruits and vegetables from Thailand. Food prices started to moderate
     in the second half following declining import prices. Although fuel is a key cost component of
     food production and transportation, fuel price developments do not appear to have a direct
     and immediate impact on the direction of the local food prices, partly due to layers in supply
     chains and high consumption demand. Core inflation remains low at an average of 1.1 percent
     during January-October 2016.

     Fiscal Development

     10.	    The fiscal position deteriorated in FY15/164 due to revenues falling short of target.
     Total revenues were revised down by kip 2.4 trillion kip (2 percent of GDP) in May 2016. According
     to preliminary estimates, total revenues as ratio to GDP are estimated to have declined to 19
     percent in FY15/16 (about 20.4 trillion kip or US$ 2.5 billion) from 23 percent of GDP in FY14/15
     (Figure 8). The shortfall is mostly attributed to lower copper and oil prices (affecting royalties
     and taxes on mining, and excises and import duties on oil), the slight moderation of economic
     activity, weaknesses in tax administration as well as lower grants, which was due to under-
     disbursement of the project grants. Mining revenue is estimated to have declined to 1 percent
     in FY15/16 (about US$ 130 million) from 1.6 percent of GDP in FY14/15. Grants declined from
     5.4 percent to 2.3 percent. Spending cuts were less commensurate resulting in considerable
     widening of the deficit from 3.7 percent in FY14/15 to 6.2 percent in FY15/16 (Figure 9). At the
     same time, non-mining fiscal deficit5 is estimated to widen from 5.3 percent in FY14/15 to 7.2
     percent in FY15/16.

     11.	   In response, the authorities introduced measures to support revenues. As of early
     2016, the authorities moved from reference pricing of imports to invoice valuation. Furthermore,
     in August 2016, the authorities canceled tax exemptions on fuel imports for most investment
     projects and took measures to strengthen and facilitate administration such as e-payment,
     e-meter for monitoring oil imports, etc. These measures helped boost revenue in the last
     quarter but still short of the revised target plan by about 5 percent.

12.	    However, spending cuts were less commensurate to the revenue shortfall. Public
spending was revised downward by kip 1,100 billion (about US$ 130 million or almost 1 percent
of GDP), with almost equal amounts being lowered on both capital and recurrent spending.
According to the authorities, further cuts would have limited the ability to service social
obligations, undertake key investments as well as activities needed to support Lao PDR’s
hosting of the 2016 ASEAN Chairmanship. The total expenditure to GDP ratio is estimated to
have declined to 25 percent in FY15/16 (about 27 trillion kip or US$ 3.3 billion) from 27 percent
in the previous year (about 26.3 trillion kip) (Figure 10). Wages and benefits to GDP declined
to 8.1 percent6 from 8.7 percent of GDP in the previous year, reflecting the wage freeze and
continued controls on public recruitment (5,000 new quotas for the past two years compared
to 15,000 earlier). Wages and allowances already account for about 67 percent of non-resource
sector revenue, which is less susceptible to commodity price volatility and about 39 percent of
the total expenditure. Coupled with considerable capital spending, this already crowds out the
allocation for non-wage recurrent spending, which is essential for operation and maintenance,
purchase of materials and equipment to improve quality of public services, which receives
only 37 percent of total recurrent cost in FY15/16. Therefore, revenue measures should also be
coupled with improving efficiency and prioritization of public spending.

13.	   Lao PDR recently transitioned to a fiscal year that is based on the calendar year.
Previously, Lao PDR’s fiscal year started October 1 and ended on September 30 the following
year. As of 2017, the fiscal year will be the same as the calendar year (the October-December
2016 period was a transition quarter). The new schedule is expected to better align the budget
process with the other decision-making processes in Lao PDR, including the sessions of the

    This measure may be underestimating the total wage bill as some benefits are recorded separately from wages and allowances.
    Taking these into consideration could increase the wage-bill up to 9.3 percent of GDP in FY2015/16.

     National Assembly. The improved revenue performance from the last quarter of FY15/16
     appears to have continued in the transition quarter. Regular recurrent budget, mostly wages,
     has continued in the transition period of October-December 2016, while no new capital spending
     has been allocated for the transition quarter.

     14.	 Capital spending declined. Public investment as ratio to GDP fell to 8.1 percent
     (about 8.6 trillion kip or US$ 1 billion) from 10.5 percent as there was stronger control on
     new investment projects, greater focus on ongoing projects and clearance of arrears as well
     as under-disbursement of project grants. The authorities continue to address arrears for
     completed on-budget public projects as a priority by instructing spending units to allocate
     at least 30 percent of annual allocation for capital spending to clear arrears. However, the
     information on the total stock of arrears is unclear. Around 50 percent should be allocated to
     on-going projects and the rest go to new projects. The Government has instructed a halt in off-
     budget spending; however, the stock of arrears remains sizeable. Off-budget spending in the
     forms of quasi-fiscal spending on infrastructure projects financed by the Bank of Lao PDR’s
     direct lending (shown as BOL lending to SOEs) declined from 6.4 percent at year end in 2015 to
     about 5.8 percent of GDP in mid-2016 reflecting the phase out of such direct lending. However,
     BOL lending to banks increased by 21 percent by September 2016 compared to last year.

     15.	    The widened fiscal deficit has led to higher public borrowing, elevating the risk of
     debt distress. The outstanding public debt at end 2015 was almost 66 percent of GDP, up from
     62.5 percent in 2013. With higher budget deficit in FY15/16, public debt is expected to increase
     to 68 percent of GDP in 2016, a relatively high level compared to regional and income peers
     (Figure 11). At the end of 2015, external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt accounted
     for about 52 percent of GDP while the rest is domestic debt (comprising of T-bonds and T-bills,
     capitalization bonds, BOL’s direct lending to local authorities for off-budget infrastructure
     projects) (Figure 12). As a consequence, the 2016 Joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability
     Analysis (DSA) elevated the risk of debt distress from moderate to high. Under the baseline
     assumptions, some of the external and public debt distress indicators breach the policy-
     dependent indicative thresholds on three indicators: a) the net present value (PV) of public and
     public guaranteed external debt (PPG) as a percent of GDP, b) PV of debt to revenue ratio and
     c) debt services to revenue ratio (Annex 1). Risks are mitigated to a certain extent as around a
     quarter of external PPG is for projects, mostly in the energy sector, which are expected to be
     economically viable and self-financing.

16.	    With Lao PDR reaching the threshold for high risk of debt distress, the fiscal space
for future borrowing has narrowed significantly. Even in FY15/16, interest expenditures are
expected to be around 1.4 percent of GDP (1.4 trillion kip or US$ 180 million), for example,
double of the budgetary allocation for the agriculture sector and compared about 74 percent
of the allocation for the health sector. Debt servicing needs (interest and principal repayment)
increased from 1.7 percent of GDP in FY11/12 to around 2.8 percent of GDP in FY15/16 (Figure 13).
Furthermore, the number of large infrastructure projects being considered raises concerns over
debt sustainability and over the country’s capacity to absorb the new financial commitments.
An example is the proposed US$6.7 billion Lao-China Rail Project (in which Lao PDR will need to
participate with around 9 percent of the project cost or around US$700 million into the equity
capital of the join stock railway company). About 65 percent of that Government’s equity
share in the Lao-China railway project or US$480 million is expected to be financed by external
borrowing.

     17.	    The Government has increasingly resorted to bilateral and commercial sources
     to finance its spending needs. Notably, borrowing from China increased rapidly in recent
     years making China the largest creditor of Lao PDR with around 45 percent of total external
     public debt stock at end 2015 (up from 20 percent five years ago). Despite the increase in
     the amount of lending from multilateral institutions, their share of lending, particularly the
     Asian Development Bank and the World Bank Group more than halved from 48 percent of
     total external debt in 2010 to only 21 percent in 2015 (Figure 14). Currency composition has
     moved significantly towards U.S. dollars at end-2015 compared with end-2014, from about
     51.1 percent of total outstanding debt to 59.8 percent (Figure 15).

     18.	    The authorities have also resorted to issuing government bonds at market terms to
     finance the budget. Since the first issuance in 2013, bonds issuance (ranging from 3 to 12 year
     maturity, indicating the authorities’ goal to establish a yield curve) increased significantly to
     reach 12 percent of total external public debt stock in 2015 (almost US$ 840 million). The
     bond proceeds have financed the budget deficit as well as the government’s share in power
     projects. With the first 3-year bond issued in 2013 maturing in 2016 and the issuance of a
     US$ 310 million bond in late-2016, the stock of bonds issues at the Thai market at the end
     of 2016 is estimated to reach more than US$ 1 billion. As a result, debt services (interest and
     amortization) are projected to rise from around 13 percent of non-resource domestic revenues
     during 2013-2015 to almost 24 percent in the next five year period. Given that a large part of
     debt is concentrated in the power sector, returns on power projects, improving governance and
     ensuring financial solvency of Electricite du Laos (eliminating account payables, tariff system
     restructuring etc.) will be critical to the sustainability of the fiscal accounts.
                                                                Lao Economic Monitor April 2017    27



19.	 Ensuring that the debt burden remains sustainable will require gradual fiscal
consolidation as well as strengthened public debt management. It would be important to
put in place policies that will lead to stabilization of the public debt burden and its gradual
reduction consistent with fiscal sustainability level. Gradual fiscal consolidation could come
through improving revenue collection and improved efficiency in public spending. This should be
coupled with enhancing capacity in debt management, debt sustainability analysis and project
viability appraisal. The presidential decree on Public Debt Management and the institutional
strengthening of Public Debt Department are important in facilitating this work. Also, this will
require increased awareness of risks of non-concessional borrowing as well as prioritization to
ensure borrowing for priority and credible projects with highest rates of return.

     External Sector

     20.	 The current account deficit narrowed in 2016 to an estimated 14 percent of GDP,
     largely due to a lower trade7 deficit (Figure 16). Exports increased slightly, as growing export of
     electricity, equipment parts and agriculture produce (e.g. bananas, maize) offset the decline in
     wood exports as a result of stricter enforcement on the ban on illegal logging and the stagnant
     mining exports due to low copper prices. Power export to Thailand doubled from almost US$ 400
     million in the first ten months of 2015 to about US$ 800 million in the same period of this year,
     largely attributable to the operation of all three units of Hongsa Lignite power project (Figure
     17). According to MPI data, exports of banana increased by more than three folds, followed by
     doubling of cassava mostly coming from recent investment in commercial plantations.

     21.	    On the other hand, imports fell due to lower fuel prices as well as completion of
     construction of one large project construction in the previous year. The appreciation of the
     kip against the regional currencies also contributed to a lower import bill. Imports from the
     three main partners fell by about 10 percent in the first nine months. Fuel import bill declined
     by about 30 percent in the first nine months due to lower fuel price for most of 2016 despite the
     volume increase. The lower import oil prices help improve the trade balance and lower energy
     inflation, but affect the Government revenue collection. Imports of machinery and construction
     materials also slowed due to completion of large power projects in 2015. Imports of vehicles
     declined, also reflecting a high base from 2015 when imports increased in anticipation of the
     higher costs of imports resulting from the move in the valuation from reference to invoice prices
     introduced at the start of 2016 (Figure 18).

22.	 Foreign direct investment and growing external borrowing financed the current
account deficit. External debt stock (public and private) is estimated around 98 percent of
GDP in 2016, up from 95 percent in 2015, according to the 2016 debt sustainability analysis.
Foreign exchange reserves were almost US$ 940 million in September 2016, slightly up (4
percent) compared to last September, but still below the peak level registered in January 2016.
Reserves are expected to have increased further by end-2016 reflecting the proceeds of the US$
310 million bond issuance in November 2016. Still, the reserve coverage remains low by most
widely used metrics8. It can cover up to 2 months of imports, 12 percent of broad money an only
25 percent of foreign currencies deposits (Figure 19) or about 2 years of projected debt service
(interest and amortization) which imply limited buffers and macroeconomic vulnerability,
particularly in the context of a tightly managed exchange rate of the kip to the US dollar.
Therefore, building up reserves through allowing greater exchange rate flexibility within the
band ±5 percent, gradual fiscal consolidation, prudent monetary policy and export promotion
can increase the cushion against shocks and is critical for maintaining macroeconomic
resilience and stability.




8
    The rules of thumb include reserves cover of imports for 3 months, reserves to M2 of 20 percent.

Exchange Rate

23.	 The official exchange rate policy continues to focus on tight management of the
exchange rate, particularly with the US dollar. The Bank of Lao PDR views the exchange rate
as the main intermediate target in the pursuit of its objective of stability. While the current
exchange rate policy allows for a flexibility of +/- 5 percent per year in the exchange rate, the
authorities have in practice targeted a much narrower band. Overall, the average exchange
rate of the kip against the US dollar slightly depreciated by 0.5 percent in December 2016
compared to the same period last year and it also depreciated against Thai Baht by 1.1 percent
in the same period (Figure 20, 21).

24.	   Still, in an environment of limited international reserves, the exchange rate of the kip
came under pressure at the exchange offices’ market. Restriction on the availability of foreign
exchange in commercial banks9 as BOL limited its interventions to protect reserves, and higher
transactions costs introduced at commercial banks boiled over at the exchange office market
where a gap between the official rate and the informal market has been around 3 percent
on average since September 2016. Going forward, the exchange rate policy may benefit from
greater consideration on the exchange rate development in key trading partners.

25.	 The appreciation of the Kip’s real effective exchange rate moderated. The nominal
effective exchange rate appears to have stabilized in 2016, which is a welcomed development,
compared to sharper appreciation in 2015 (Figure 22, 23). The pace of real effective exchange

    need for foreign currency. For personal exchange, some banks do not sell foreign currency in practice in late 2016.
32   Lao Economic Monitor April 2017




     rate appreciation started to moderate by mid-2016 as regional currencies stabilized and
     inflation pressures remained low. However, the real effective exchange rate has still appreciated
     by around 30 percent over the last five years, signaling a loss of competitiveness of Lao PDR’s
     exports; though wage and unit labor costs indicators appear to remain within ranges expected
     from the country’s income level.

Monetary Developments

26.	    Monetary policy was directed towards stimulating credit growth, with some success.
The BOL reduced the policy rate by 50 basis points in July 2015, and further by additional
25 basis points in August 2016 (Figure 24). However, given the identified weaknesses in the
interest rate transmission channel, in mid-2015, BOL also introduced more direct controls over
commercial banks’ rates. The interest rate cap on the deposit rate for kip deposits was set
at the previous year’s inflation rate (excluding oil) plus 2 percentage points. Furthermore, the
maximum spread between weighted deposit and lending rates was set at 4 percentage points.
In August 2016, in line with the decline in the annual inflation in 2015, the interest rate caps
were further lowered (for example, by 40 basis points on kip deposits with 1-year maturity10).
As a result, the commercial banks’ kip deposit and lending interest rates have been adjusting
since the third quarter of 2015. By August 2016, kip deposit rates on 1-year deposits were
down 60 basis points while lending rates declined by 170 basis points and lower the spread
between lending and deposit rates 110 basis points (Figure 25). The lending and deposit
rates on baht and US$ also declined, though at more moderate pace. Most recently BOL also
amended the regulations to allow commercial banks to provide credit in foreign currency to
importers, in addition to exporters. Also, BOL, while apparently phasing-out lending to sub-
nationals governments, has increased lending to commercial banks in the form of loans on-
lend to finance private sector projects.

10
  The reductions in the caps were bigger for deposits with higher maturities. For example, the cap on a five-year kip deposit was
 lowered from 11.7 percent to 7 percent.

     Figure 25: Commercial Banks’ Interest Rates

     27.	    The growth rate of deposits decelerated to about 10 percent year-on-year compared
     to 26 percent a year ago. This appears to be affecting both kip and foreign currency deposits
     and could be linked to the reduction in the banks’ deposit rates. Kip deposits continued to
     grow slower at 9 percent in September 2016 compared to 20 percent in last September (Figure
     26). Foreign currency deposits grew at 12 percent compared to 33 percent in the same period.
     Consequently, coupled with a shaper reduction in long-term deposit rates, there was a sharp
     deceleration in longer-than-1 year term deposits growth, particularly in Kip while short-term
     (up to one year) foreign currency deposits accelerated in March 201611. This implies that the
     limited growth in long term deposits could limit the supply of long-term credit available to the
     private sector. A stronger deposit protection fund could help strengthen the confidence in the
     system and encourage longer-term savings.

28.	    Credit growth picked up in 2016, though remains below levels seen earlier this decade.
Lending accelerated by 20 percent y-o-y by September 2016, compared to 17 percent y-o-y
last September, but well below the unsustainable growth rates of around 35 percent per annum
three years ago (Figure 27). Credit ratio to GDP increased to 52 percent of GDP in September
2016 from 45 percent in September last year while total deposits slightly rose to 54 percent of
GDP from 53 percent in the same period, pushing the overall loan to deposit ratio in commercial
banks to 95 percent from 86 percent in the same period. With deposit growth slowing down,
credit expansion has also been driven by more foreign currency lending, supported by banks’
foreign borrowing, especially by foreign branches and joint venture banks. This resulted in a
significant buildup of foreign liabilities of commercial banks by 80 percent during 2014-2016.
Net foreign liabilities significantly increased by almost more than two folds in September 2016
to 15 percent of GDP from only 6 percent two years ago. In addition, following the restrictions
on foreign currency lending to only exporters, the BOL recently extended allowance for

     commercial banks to lend to importers of certain products. The timing of the measure may
     add to the pressure on the reserves.

     29.	    Most of the increase in lending from commercial banks went to the industrial sector.
     The credit to the industry sector grew by 34 percent in June 2016 compared to end 2015 or
     64 percent compared to last June, mostly from a state-owned bank, some private banks
     and foreign branches (Figure 27). A considerable portion goes to power projects development.
     Lending to construction has significantly decelerated (Figure 28), in part due to a constraint in
     public investment in the recent time.

     30.	 Microfinance institutions (MFIs) have started to expand rapidly, albeit from a low
     base. Microfinance institutions12 expanded by almost 500 percent in the past two years with
     their assets increasing to 1.5 percent of GDP (US$ 200 million) in June 2016 from just 0.3
     percent of GDP in 2014. During the same period, lending by MFIs increased by 300 percent,
     though, it still accounts for less than 1 percent of GDP in 2016. Despite the expansion of the
     bank and non-bank financial institutions, financial inclusion is still limited. Only 20 percent of
     the population has borrowed, and only half of them from the formal financial sector. Options
     on financial products and services are still limited.

     31.	    Despite the pickup in lending and increasing banking sector assets, parts of the
     banking sector continue to face challenges. The rapid expansion of the sector in an environment
     of nascent supervisory and regulatory capacity created challenges in monitoring quality of
     bank performance and loan portfolios. Capital buffers are thin in state-owned and some small-
     medium size private banks. For instance, the state-owned bank group had a capital-to-asset
     ratio of 2.9 percent in mid-2014. Non-performing loans, officially at slightly above 3 percent,
     are most likely understated and have increased. According to unaudited reports from the
     banks, the sector remains profitable; though only a handful of banks have return on assets
     in the range of 2 percent and above (considered as an average for emerging and developing
     economies).

     32.	    Against the backdrop of remaining macroeconomic vulnerability, monetary policies
     may need adjustment to better respond to the objective of preserving stability. Firstly,
     monetary policy decisions may need to be reconsidered in light of the need to limit the
     pressures on the exchange rate. In general, the rationale for direct lending by BOL needs to be
     reconsidered as it is putting public funds at risk. Strengthening the supervisory and regulatory
     frameworks for the financial sector, including restructuring the weak state-owned banks
     (improving governance, recapitalization), and enforcing the minimum capital requirements in
     all banks should help keep risks manageable.

       Microfinance institutions in Lao PDR include deposit taking, credit and saving cooperatives, pawn shops, leasing companies,

Outlook

33.	 The medium term growth outlook remains broadly favorable, but not without
challenges. Growth is expected to be around 7 percent on average in the medium term (Table
1), considering the domestic potential in the power projects currently under construction13 and
their subsequent operations projected to add around 500 MW of installed capacity annually.
The challenge for Lao PDR is to secure markets for the rapidly increasing power generation. The
authorities recently negotiated an increase in the electricity that could be sold to Thailand from
7,000MW to 9,000MW, however, actual export contracts have not yet been signed. Vietnam is
also a potential market with discussions being initiated recently between the two countries on
potential electricity export from Lao PDR.

34.	 Recent trends in the non-resource sectors such as manufacturing of parts and
components and services are expected to continue as Lao PDR foster regional integration
under the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and business environment gradually improves.
Addressing constraints to business environment (as explained in Box 1) including providing
level playing field in regulatory enforcement, simplifying tax administration, building human
resources will help foster growth of the non-resource sector. Externally, China’s growth rates
are expected to moderate but remain high and Thailand is expected to recover (Table 2). External
demand may be affected if these major trading partners grow slower than expected. At the
same time, copper prices are expected to pick up although gold price outlook will be subdued.
The realization of the Lao section of the Kunming – Singapore railway project14, assumed to
start construction some time in 2017, will boost economic activities if managed carefully.
However, such large scale projects need extensive evaluation of the economic and financial
costs, particularly impacts on the debt outlook, as well as environment and social impacts.

35.	   The fiscal balance is expected to stabilize in 2017 and gradually consolidate over the
medium term. The medium-term fiscal framework was recently revised to reflect assumptions
that are more realistic regarding the growth outlook. The authorities plan to expand tax
base (continue to implement the removal of exemptions on fuel imports for projects, review

   Projects under construction include Xayabury (1,285MW), Nam Ou 2 (120MW), Nam Ou 5 (240MW), Nam Ou 6 (160MW), Nam
  Khan 3 (60 MW)
14
   The project has been estimated at US$6.7 billion, out of which 30 percent will be provided by a joint venture company formed
  between Lao PDR and China. Lao PDR will need to contribute with 30 percent in the capital of this company (or around US$700
  million), of this, US$480 million will be borrowed from China, while the remaining funds will be provided by the budget in annual
  installments over the medium term. The joint venture company will need to secure the remaining 70 percent of the project costs.
  Lao PDR MOF has noted that no sovereign guarantee will be provided. According to the 2012 Feasibility, the IRR is 5 percent and
  the repayment period of investment is 23 years.
38   Lao Economic Monitor April 2017



     remaining exemptions, introduce new taxes, increase excise taxes in 2018 and 2019 as in the
     tax law and improve revenue administration (updating tax payer registries, e-filing, payment
     facilitation etc.). Revenue from the power sector is also expected to double by 2020 and more
     capacity comes on stream and exemptions expire. At the same time, control on public spending
     will be put in place including i) lower new public recruitment and maintain control over wage
     growth; ii) stop all off-budget projects unapproved by the National Assembly; and iii) reduce
     non-essential spending. The allocation of 30 percent of the annual capital spending for clearing
     past arrears will gradually help address the issue of arrears. While these measures will create
     some fiscal space, this will be offset by the Government’s investment in large infrastructure
     projects including the Lao-China railway project. No sovereign guarantee is envisaged. As a
     result, the stock of public debt is expected to increase over the next few years before levelling
     off below 70 percent in 2020 onward.

     36.	 As Lao PDR public debt increases and the country increasingly resorts to less
     concessional borrowing, ensuring that the debt burden remains sustainable will require
     adherence to the announced fiscal consolidation as well as strengthened public debt
     management. On public debt management, the revised Budget Law increases the requirements
     for the public debt reporting and analytical work, while the proposed presidential decree on
     public debt management, expected to be promulgated during 2017, strengthens the role of the
     Ministry of Finance in managing public debt. Further efforts are needed to ensure increased
     awareness of risks of non-concessional borrowing and prioritization to ensure borrowing for
     priority and credible projects with highest rates of return. Adopting a medium-term debt
     strategy is a priority and building capacity within MOF to for debt sustainability analysis and
     debt management will be important.

     37.	    On the external front, the current account deficit is also likely to widen reflecting
     the large import content of the infrastructure projects including the railway project. The
     construction of the railway project will require high import content, particularly exacerbated by
     projected rebound in fuel prices in the medium term. The current account deficit will continue to
     be financed by FDI and external borrowing, increasingly on less concessional term. The reserves
     level are expected to increase, but under current policies will provide limited support to the
     tightly managed exchange rate.

     38.	   Adjustments in monetary and exchange rate policies, coupled with strengthening the
     bank supervision capacity of the BOL would help in maintaining macroeconomic stability. A
     combination of accelerating credit growth and tight management of the exchange rate policy
     may continue to put pressure on reserves which already provide thin buffers in an event of

an adverse shock. Allowing greater exchange rate flexibility within the band set by the BOL
can help lessen such pressure. The exchange rate policy should give greater consideration
to exchange rate developments in key trading partners. This will need to be accompanied by
complementary monetary and fiscal policies. The rapid expansion of the financial sector calls
for strengthened bank supervision capacity. The BOL’s effort in strengthening the supervisory
and regulatory framework and plan to restructure some weak state-owned banks can help
manage risks in the financial sector.

PART II: Health Sector Financing in Lao PDR16
Health Financing Situation

1.	     Budgetary government spending on health has increased in recent years, albeit from
a very low level and erratic base. According to the MOF Official Gazette, the total Government
spending on health17 more than doubled to about US$182 million in FY13/1418 (about 1.5 percent
of GDP or 6.3 percent of total Government spending19) from US$70 million (1.1 percent of GDP
or about 5 percent of Government spending) in FY09/10 (Figure 29, Table 3). Nevertheless, the
public spending on health per capita is still one of the lowest in the region, which contributes
to slow progress in achieving health outcomes (Figure 30). For instance, based on WHO data
that allows for cross country comparison, public health spending per capita in Lao PDR was
US$16 in 201420, similar to the level in Nepal and Cambodia but less than Bhutan (US$65),
Vietnam (US$77), and Thailand (US$177). Both regionally and globally, health’s share of the
national (that is, combined central and local) budget is considered very low in Lao PDR. The
Government has committed to increasing the budgetary spending on health to 9 percent of
total public expenditure (or about US$ 290 million in FY15/16 or 2.2 percent of GDP), which

  Gazettes data and population data from the Lao Statistics Bureau). It should be noted that the reported data on Government
  health expenditure in the WHO database is different from the Government Official Gazettes and Budget plans partly due to
  adjustment from the Government’s fiscal year to calendar year and methodology that allow international comparison.

     is yet to be met. The FY15/16 budget plan provides a higher allocation to the health sector of
     about US$237 million (1.8 percent of GDP or 7.4 percent of total Government expenditure) which
     would increase public spending on health to about US$36 per capita in FY15/16, according to
     the national data (Figure 29).

     2.	   Most Government health spending in Lao PDR has been allocated towards wages
     and capital expenditure leaving little room for critical non-wage recurrent spending. In
     FY13/14, about 70 percent (about US$130 million) of the government health expenditure went


     21
      The share of capital expenditure is distorted by the fact that all foreign financed projects are categorized as capital expenditure.
      Usually capital spending covers the construction of buildings and infrastructure including building health centers, renovations,
      development of pipe lines in case of water supply projects, etc.
                                                                                  Lao Economic Monitor April 2017   47



to wage-related recurrent expenditure (33 percent) and capital expenditure21 (37 percent). The
remaining 30 percent (about US$ 55 million) was available for non-wage recurrent expenditure,
including purchasing critical health-related commodities and financing the implementation of
plans. The low level of non-wage recurrent expenditure, particularly at the facility level, has
serious implications for the provision of health care and supply-side readiness. Such limited
financing resulted in the introduction of user fees and drug revolving funds in order to raise
revenues at the facility level. Recently there is a welcome trend of increasing planned allocation
in FY15/16 for non-wage recurrent health spending to about 35 percent (US$84 million) of
total government health spending while the wage spending share slightly declined as the
Government contained public recruitment and wage increases in FY15/16 (Figure 32). While
expenditure had been concentrated on wages, the supply of critical human resources for
health (HRH) is maldistributed (by geography, level, and type) and low – just over half of WHO
recommen¬dations. At the facility level, Health Centers (HCs) were staffed typically with four
health workers who were relatively underutilized, with only six consultations per health worker
per day on average. While redistribution of staff may be one option, investments are needed

to reduce demand-side barriers (physical, cultural, and financial) to increase the extremely low
utilization of essential health services, especially in rural areas, as underutilization is driving
low productivity and low clinical ability.

3.	    At the same time, Lao PDR has substantial dependence on external finance in
the health sector. Nearly 30 percent of the Government spending on health was financed
by external funding. Foreign financed projects include health governance and nutrition
48   Lao Economic Monitor April 2017



     development project supported by the World Bank Group, health governance project, control
     of communicable disease project supported by the Asia Development Bank, construction of the
     Friendship hospital supported by Austria, etc. Similarly, about 32 percent of the total health
     spending, which covers both domestic and external sources, public and private spending on
     health, in 2014 was covered by the external source (greater than that in Cambodia, Myanmar,
     Nepal and Bhutan, for example). Most notably this dependency effects specific health programs
                  Figure 33: Share of Overall Expenditure for Immunization, 2014 (percent)




                   Source: GAVI Annual Progress Reports 2014.


     that are operated as vertical programs: 69 percent of spending on HIV (2015) derived from
     external sources, 78 percent of spending on tuberculosis (2013), 90 percent of spending on
     malaria (2014), and 72 percent of spending on immunization (2014) (Figure 33).

     4.	     While external financing will continue to play an important role in providing both
     financial and technical resources to key health programs, including HIV, TB, malaria and
     immunization, the level of donor funds is expected to decline in coming years. Some key
     donors have initiated the transition process out from Lao PDR and encourage co-financing
     from domestic sources. According to Gavi eligibility criteria, Lao PDR has entered Gavi’s final
     phase of support, known as the accelerated transition phase in 2017 and is expected to fully
     transition out from Gavi support in December 2021. The Global Fund (Global Fund Strategy 2017-
     2020 ) has also indicated its intention to increase direct investments in high-burden countries
     with the least ability to pay, and Lao PDR is, therefore, likely to graduate from Global Fund
     funding within the next few funding cycles. Therefore, the country expects a decreased funding
     allocation from some development partners and therefore needs to consider contribution
     or co-financing from domestic revenue sources during the transition process. Meeting co-
                                                                  Lao Economic Monitor April 2017    49



financing requirements for various donor funded programs and ensuring sustainable financing
of essential commodities including vaccines, drugs and family planning supplies will be a main
challenge during the transition period.

5.	     The low budgetary spending implies a low level of protection against financial risk,
which is highlighted by the high out-of-pocket spending from households and high incidence
of catastrophic health spending. Out-of-pocket-spending still accounts for about 40 percent
of the total health expenditure despite a declining trend from 61 percent in 2000 (Table 3). The
relatively high level of out-of-pocket-spending deters health service utilisation by the poor and
reduces the potential redistributive capacity of the health financing system. The poor and the
near poor are impoverished or pushed deeper into poverty as a result of high out-of-pocket-
spending spending. At a threshold of 10 percent or more of the total household consumption, 5
percent of households incurred catastrophic health spending in FY12/13 (up from 3.8 percent
in FY07/08), and about 2 percent of households had to spend more than 20 percent of their
total consumption on health. There are further socio-economic, regional, and urban-rural
variations in financial protection, which likely reflect the inequitable utilization and access of
households to health services. For example, households living in urban areas spend on average
2.3 percent of their total consumption on health services compared with 1.7 percent in rural
areas; and about 6.6 percent of urban household incur catastrophic health spending compared
to 4.6 percent in rural areas. Ironically, due to inequitable utilization and access to health
services, the poorest quintile of households has a much lower incidence of catastrophic health
expenditure (1.1 percent) compared with the richest quintile (9.5 percent). Underutilization and
limited access to health services among the poor remains a main challenge for achieving the
health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals in Lao PDR.

6.	     Overall, the total health expenditure in Lao PDR has increased over time, but it still
remains low comparatively. According to WHO National Health Account estimates that
allows cross country comparison, the total expenditure on health (public and private household
spending on health services) in Lao PDR increased from about US$56 million in 2000 to almost
US$190 million in 2010 and to almost US$ 220 million in 2014. However, compared to the
economic development of the country, the ratio of the total expenditure on the health sector to
GDP is among the lowest regionally and globally. Lao PDR recorded at 1.9 percent of GDP (about
US$ 220 million) compared to 7 percent of GDP in Vietnam (about US$13 billion), 6 percent
in Cambodia (about US$940 million), 6 percent in Nepal (US$1.1 billion), 4 percent in Bhutan
(US$68 million) and 2.2 percent in Myanmar (US$1 billion) in 2014. Total health spending per
capita in Lao PDR was one of the lowest in the region at US$33 in 2014 compared to US$40 in
Nepal, US$61 in Cambodia and US$142 in Vietnam (WHO).

7.	     The national health financing context is reflected at the health center level. Health
center revenues are largely sourced from Revolving drug funds collected through the sale of
drugs to patients at facilities (58 percent), development assistance (20 percent), followed by
11 percent from the government budget, 7 percent from insurance scheme reimbursements,
and 3 percent from technical revenues or user fees collected from patients at point-of-service.
The availability of essential medicines at health centers is generally poor indicating problems
with planning, budgeting, and/or supply-chain management. Particularly low across all health
centers is the availability of enalapril (38 percent), procaine benzyl penicillin (38 percent),
metronidazole (33 percent), diazepam (28 percent), zinc tablets (20 percent), folic acid tablets
(18 percent), and magnesium sulphate (9 percent).
52   Lao Economic Monitor April 2017



     8.	     Substantial challenges remain. This is especially true for maternal and child health
     outcomes in Lao PDR which are worse in comparison globally as well as in the East Asia and
     Pacific region. While under-five and infant mortality rates are below average relative to GNI
     per capita, the maternal mortality ratio is still high at 197 per 100,000 live births, significantly
     higher than for example in neighbouring Cambodia (161) which has started from a higher level
     in 1990 (Figure 29). The maternal mortality ratio is still high at 213 per 100,000 live births in
     2014. One factor contributing to the current high maternal mortality ratio is the difficulty for
     women to access family planning and maternal health services, especially in rural areas. Only
     42 percent of married women were using a modern method of family planning and one fifth
     of married women had an unmet need for contraception in 2011. In addition, undernutrition
     remains a significant challenge. In 2011 more than a quarter of children under 5 years old (26.5
     percent) in Lao PDR were underweight and 44 percent of them were stunted. Corresponding
     to the poor maternal and child health outcomes are low quality of health care and low levels of
     coverage and utilization of key interventions such as antenatal care, skilled birth attendance,
     and immunization (Figure 33).

     9.	     Poor child growth outcomes are not just a public health problem, but also carry an
     economic cost, which are perpetuated in the long term. Undernutrition during pregnancy and
     the first two years of life (“The First 1,000 Days”) affects physical growth, impairs cognitive
     development, and affects educational performance, thus reducing the ac¬cumulation of human
     capital, hence the productive potential and lifelong trajectory of the earnings of affected
                                                                   Lao Economic Monitor April 2017     53



children. Poor child nutrition outcomes also contribute to child mor¬tality and morbidity. So
there are also costs associated with lost potential workforce due to early mortality and excess
costs of care for otherwise preventable illness. These have economy-wide effects. Adding them
together, a 2013 analysis estimated that the burden of undernutrition may cost the country up
to about US$200 million annually (approximately 2.4 percent of GDP).

10.	     Socio economic and geographic disparities in health outcomes in Lao PDR remain
very high, and especially inequalities related to wealth and ethnicity are pronounced (Table
1 in Annex 2). In 2011/12, for example, infant mortality and under-5 mortality rates were four
to five times larger in the provinces with the highest rates (131 per 1,000 in Khammuane and
151 in Phongsaly) compared to the province with the lowest rates (27/ 1,000 and 32/1,000 in
Vientiane Capital).

11.	     Against this backdrop, the Government has committed to achieve Universal Health
Coverage–an SDG for health–by 2025 by expanding population and service coverage, and
improving financial protection. The 8th National Health Sector Development Plan 2016-
2020 strives for an acceleration of the health sector reform, in particularly, the development
of human resources, the improvement of governance and financing, and the completion of the
comprehensive health information system. Phase 2 (2016–2020) of the Health Sector Reform
Strategy aims to ensure essential health services of reasonably good quality are accessible for
the majority of the population. The Government of Lao PDR aspires to cover 80 percent of the
population with an essential package of services and appropriate financial protection by 2020
and to achieve the Universal Health Coverage by 2025. It is expected that over 95 percent of
the population will be covered by the prepayment scheme, and that out-of-pocket payment
will be reduced to less than 30 percent of health expenditure.

12.	     Some progress has been made and efforts are ongoing to promote pro-poor Government
spending by expanding coverage of social health protection schemes and reducing out-
of-pocket payments for health. In 2012, a Free Maternal and Child Health (MNCH) program
(consisting of antenatal care, postnatal care, and institutional deliveries, and well-baby clinic
examination including inpatient and outpatient services for children under five) was rolled out,
initially in poor districts and expanded to 142 districts across all provinces. The free MNCH policy
provides fixed-fee reimbursement to health facilities depending on the type of service and the
location of service provision. Health services are available for the poor population (estimated at
35 percent of the poor or 20 percent of the total population) through Health Equity Fund (HEFs)
funded by the government, NT2 revenues and donors. In 2015, it is estimated that about 36
percent of the country’s population is covered by social health protection schemes.
54   Lao Economic Monitor April 2017




     13.	     There are considerable challenges to the expansion of contributory health insurance/
     coverage schemes in Lao PDR, such as the size of the informal sector and lack of capacity
     to enforce compulsory enrolment of private employees. The rate of poverty which is still high
     despite significant improvements over the last decades (the share of people living under the
     poverty line decreased from 45 percent in 1992 to 23 percent in 2012). The low level of financial
     protection and high reliance on out-of-pocket payments in Lao PDR result in considerable
     financial barriers to the utilization of health services, contributing to low and inequitable
     utilization. Utilization of health services vary substantially between the poorest and richest
     quintile and the discrepancies are not only caused by differences in the incidence of reported
     illness as the inequity remains even among those reporting an illness (Table 5). The social
     health protection schemes remain fragmented, and in addition to creating confusion in health
     facilities and beneficiaries around eligibility and coverage, they also duplicate administrative
     infrastructure. To tackle these challenges, MOH has launched an ambitious national health
     insurance scheme, tax-based, for the whole informal sector through integration of three
     schemes for the informal sector, namely HEF, voluntary community-based health insurance,
     and the Free MNCH policy. With this non-contributory system with very low co-payment when
     using health services, the MOH hopes to rapidly increase the coverage to reach the target of
     80% by 2020.

     14.	    As in many countries in the region Lao PDR also has to face the epidemiological
     transition from burden of disease being dominated by communicable diseases to a pattern
     in which non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have taken a leading role. In 1990 65 percent of
     the burden of disease was caused by communicable diseases and only 28 percent by NCDs. By
     2013 the repercussions of NCDs (46 percent) had surpassed those of communicable diseases
     (43 percent). The country faces double burden from increasing NCD burden while addressing
     unfinished agenda for meeting health MDG targets and challenges of malnutrition and stunting.

Challenges and Policy Recommendations

15.	   To make greater progress toward attainment of UHC by 2025 in Lao PDR, a warranted
increase in government spending on health services provision, particularly from domestic
revenue sources, is essential for reducing the financial burden on households and the
vulnerability associated with the uncertainty of external financing and external technical
assistance. Several key programs currently rely on very high levels of technical assistance
and funding from external sources, and a managed transition would be vital for institutional
sustainability as external funding reduces.

16.	   In moving towards UHC and in order to reap the economic and social benefits of improved
health status and greater financial protection, Lao PDR will need to decrease reliance on out-
of-pocket spending, increase domestic government health financing, and increase pooled
and pre-paid financing through strengthened social health protection schemes. Concurrent
commitments to expand coverage and financial protection for the poor, via the use of pooled
and prepaid financing, with an overall policy aim of attaining UHC by 2025, are important
adjuncts to ensure that spending results in equitable coverage for health service and reduced
out-of-pocket payments for health.	

17.	    Considerable challenges remain in ensuring not just an increase in the quantum of
spending, but also to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of spending to achieve desirable
population health outputs and outcomes while ensuing sustainability of financing for health.
A key focus here would need to be on the defragmentation of financing and implementation,
and mainstreaming of multiple, often parallel, implementation modalities. While the expansion
of integrated national health insurance would be a good starting point, a process of gradual
merger and functional integration of various schemes is imperative for effective implementation
of national health insurance scheme.

18.	    As in many countries in the region Lao PDR also faces the epidemiological transition
from burden of disease being dominated by communicable diseases to a pattern in which NCDs
have taken a leading role accounting a half of the total disease burden in 2015. The country
faces double burden from increasing NCD burden while addressing unfinished agenda for
meeting health MDG targets and challenges of malnutrition and stunting. This double burden
will require the health systems to manage a diverse range of diseases and to respond to growing
demand for services.
