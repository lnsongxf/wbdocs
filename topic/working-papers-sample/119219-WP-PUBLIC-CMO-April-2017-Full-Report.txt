Executive Summary
Prices for most industrial commodities strengthened further in the first quarter (q/q), while global agricultural prices
remained broadly stable. Crude oil prices are forecast to rise to an average of $55 per barrel (bbl) in 2017 from $43/
bbl in 2016. The oil forecast is unchanged since October 2016 and reflects balancing forces: upward pressure on prices
from production cuts agreed by Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producing
countries, and downward pressure from persistently high stocks, supported by the faster-than-expected rebound of the
U.S. shale oil industry. Metals prices are projected to increase 16 percent as a result of strong demand in China and
various supply constraints, including labor strikes and contractual disputes in the case of copper, and environmental and
export policies for nickel. Agricultural commodity prices, which gained 1 percent in the first quarter, are anticipated to
remain broadly stable in 2017, with moderate increases in oils and meals and raw materials offset by declines in grains
and beverages.

Notes: n/a implies data not available. Roundwood (which refers to Industrial roundwood), reported in cubic meters solid volume underbark (i.e. exclusing bark), is an aggregate comprising
sawlogs and veneer logs; pulpwood, round and split; and other industrial roundwood except wood fuel. Sawnwood, reported in cubic meters solid volume, includes wood that has been
produced from both domestic and imported roundwood, either by sawing lengthways or by a profile-chipping process and that exceeds 6mm in thickness.

P   rices for most industrial commodities strengthened further
in the first quarter of 2017 (q/q), while agricultural prices
remained broadly stable. Crude oil prices are forecast to average
$55 per barrel in 2017 from $43/bbl in 2016. The oil forecast is
unchanged since January and reflects balancing forces: upward
pressure on prices from production cuts agreed by Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producing
countries, and downward pressure from persistently high
stocks, supported by the rebound of the U.S. shale oil industry.

Metals prices are projected to increase 16 percent as a result
of strong demand in China and various supply constraints,
including labor strikes, contractual disputes, environmental and
trade policies. Agricultural commodity prices, which gained 1
percent in the first quarter, are anticipated to remain broadly
stable in 2017, with moderate increases in oils and meals and
raw materials balanced by declines in grains and beverages.

The World Bank’s Commodity Markets Outlook is published
quarterly, in January, April, July, and October. The report
provides detailed market analysis for major commodity groups,
including energy, metals, agriculture, precious metals, and
fertilizers. Price forecasts to 2030 for 46 commodities are also
presented together with historical price data. Commodity price
data updates are published separately at the beginning of each
month.
