Executive Summary

1.      A key factor affecting the business climate in BiH is the poor performance of the
courts. The court system appears to impact the business climate in BiH more than almost
anywhere else in Europe and Central Asia. For businesses with administrative or judicial cases
before the courts, delays and inconsistency in decision-making causes frustration and uncertainty
that impacts business operations. For businesses without cases before the courts, fear of the court
system deters them from seeking resolution and they negotiate as best they can in the shadow of
the law. Micro, small and medium -sized enterprises (MSMEs) suffer the most from poor court
performance. Governments at all levels have committed to improving the management of
commercial cases as a key reform to improve the business climate.

2.       Against this background, stakeholders in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
(FBiH) requested the World Bank to conduct a feasibility study on how best to improve the
processing of commercial cases in the FBiH. This Feasibility Study analyzes the performance
of FBiH courts and presents options for improving their efficiency and quality. The Study is based
on the results of more than 60 key informant interviews, analysis of statistical caseload data,
finance and human resources data, desk research and a small survey of business representatives
(See Annex 1: Methodology). The Study offers in-depth analysis of the problems facing case
processing, analyses performance by case type and court type, and compares existing procedures
for commercial cases in FBiH and Republika Srpska (RS). The Study draws on international and
regional good practices and lessons from countries with different models of commercial
specialization. The Study then outlines a series of policy options and analyzes the constitutional,
legal, operational and financial implications, associated risks and opportunities of each option.

3.      Based on this analysis, the Bank recommends that FBiH reorganize and strengthen
its existing commercial case departments by implementing a package of reforms to
improve the efficiency and quality of case processing. Other options that require
restructuring the court system are cost-prohibitive and there is no sound evidence that they
would improve efficiency in any meaningful way. Experience and results from comparator
countries demonstrate that court performance and quality of services are not as dependent on
the court structure as on effective implementation. Improvements in case management within
the existing structure (Option 3 in the Study) would be the simplest and most cost-effective option
and requires only limited legislative changes. Also, a majority of stakeholders favor this option,
which is likely to result in successful implementation. The medium-term cost of this option would
also be manageable.

4.     The Study lays out a series of next steps to implement this package of reforms over
the next eighteen months or sooner. This reform could improve the business climate in the
short to medium term. In FBiH, all of the next steps proposed in this Study should be
implemented. In RS, policymakers may also consider adapting and implementing a subset of these
reform measures to strengthen the performance of Commercial Courts in RS, in particular to fast-
track small claims, incentivize court performance, strengthen training, close procedural
loopholes and ease bottlenecks in case processing.

Courts and the Business Climate in BiH

5.     According to the Investment Climate Statement 2016, investors are deterred by a
number of obstacles including complex legal and regulatory frameworks, corruption, non-
transparent business procedures, insufficient protection of property rights and a weak
judicial system. 1 The Investment Climate report cites the poor business climate as the
predominant cause for the stagnation of private investment in BiH over the last five years

6.       The court system is more of a problem for businesses in BiH than almost anywhere
else in Europe or Central Asia (ECA). According to the Business Environment and Enterprise
Performance Survey (BEEPS) in 2014, 18 percent of firms report that the court system is a
moderate, major or severe obstacle to their business operations in BiH – a response that is higher
than the average for either the Western Balkans or ECA. 2 The BEEPS survey identifies several
dimension of perceived poor court performance in BiH: only 37 percent of firms reported that the
court system is fair and impartial; only 13 percent of firms reported that the court system is quick,
less than half the average for the Western Balkans and ECA; only 46 percent of firms reported
that the courts are able to enforce their decisions; and 8.2 percent of firms reported that
corruption in the courts was a major constraint to operations, almost double the ECA averages. 3
These findings are corroborated by other surveys and reports. The World Justice Project 2016
identifies the duration of cases as the most serious issue facing the judiciary in BiH, followed by
inefficient enforcement mechanisms. 4 The FIC Business Barometer for BiH also argues that
improvements in the rule of law should be the top priority to improve investor confidence. 5 BiH
ranked 81 out of 190 economies in the 2017 Doing Business Report, the lowest ranking in the
Western Balkans. 6

7.      All businesses operating in BiH are affected by the court system. For businesses that
have administrative or judicial cases before the courts, long delays and inconsistency in decision-
making cause frustration and uncertainty. 7 According to data from the High Judicial and
Prosecutorial Council (HJPC), the average time taken to resolve commercial cases is 528 days in
Municipal Courts. The time taken to resolve a dispute of small value (under 5,000 BAM) is even
longer, at an average of 702 days. This is six times longer than the Council of Europe median of
177 days. Businesses report that such delays hinder business affairs. For those businesses
without active cases before the courts, fear of the court system deters them from seeking
resolution for what may be valid claims, so they negotiate as best they can in the shadow of the
law.

8.     MSMEs are likely to suffer the most from poor court performance. Their relative
power imbalance makes them less able to equitably resolve disputes and uphold their rights

5 See Foreign Investors Council Business Barometer Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo, October 2015;

http://www.fic.ba/uimages/udocs/FIC%20Business%20Barometer.pdf. The FIC also states that shortcomings in
enforcement of court rulings are among the top five things that affect business operations in BiH. The FIC argues that
adequate and harmonized legislation with efficient and transparent implementation of the law will attract
investments and create new jobs.

Reports/English/DB17-Report.pdf.
7 According to the 2015 Insolvency and Creditor/Debtor Rights Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes

(ICR ROSC 2015), businesses report that judicial proceedings as “very slow, too complex and decidedly ineffective.”

either in or out of court. They are less likely to have in-house legal expertise and less likely to be
able to afford attorney and expert fees. Where legal disputes affect their operations, they have
less capacity to absorb the long wait times for adjudication of disputes. This makes them more
vulnerable to vexatious litigation and abusive practices. With less of a buffer, they are more in
need of protection by an effective court system.

9.      In recognition of the importance of courts to the business climate in BiH, the Reform
Agenda for BiH 2015-2018 and the Arrangement with the IMF under the Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) commit all levels of Government in BiH to deepening judicial reforms to
create a more competitive economy that will attract private investment and create jobs. The
performance of the judiciary is also a key element of the EU accession process and, as a potential
candidate country, BiH will be expected to boost justice system performance significantly in
coming years to meet EU benchmarks.



Court Performance in Commercial Cases and Factors Undermining
Performance

1.1      Caseloads, Workloads and Resources

10.     Jurisdiction over commercial cases in FBiH resides in ten Municipal Courts, ten
Cantonal Courts, and the Supreme Court of FBiH. Only certain Municipal Courts have
jurisdiction over first instance commercial cases within a Canton; 8 commercial departments exist
in Municipal Courts in Bihać, Orašje, Tuzla, Zenica, Goražde, Travnik, Mostar, Široki Brijeg,
Sarajevo, and Livno. However, all Municipal Courts have jurisdiction over commercial
enforcement cases.

11.    Commercial cases comprise a significant share of the total workload of courts in
FBiH. In 2015, commercial cases comprised approximately 12.4 percent – or one-eighth – of all
incoming cases in FBiH. Although a relatively small share of the total workload, commercial cases
are important for the business climate and the economy, as outlined in Section 1 above. The
commercial jurisdiction also handles a large share of contentious and complex cases, and these
require a considerable about of judicial work to resolve.

12.     According to HJPC data, 224 judges and 45 legal associates 9 worked on at least one
commercial case in Municipal Courts in July 2016. This is approximately half of all judges in
FBiH. However, only a small percentage of those judges and associates truly specialize in
commercial cases – many of them worked on only a handful of commercial cases that year.
Specialization is more common in larger Municipal Courts. The HJPC appoints legal associates to
work independently on certain types of cases (e.g., enforcement, small claims) in Municipal
Courts, and in Cantonal Courts they are appointed as civil servants by the Court President to assist
the judges.



8 In FBiH there are 31 Municipal Courts, 10 Cantonal Courts and the Supreme Court of FBiH. There were 576 judges

appointed to these courts in 2015. Article 23 of the FBiH Law on Courts determines which Municipal Courts have
jurisdiction in commercial matters for each Canton. Commercial cases are disputes between legal entities or entities
that carry out economic activity. Commercial cases relate to the rights and obligations arising from the trade in goods,
services, securities, property rights, maritime rights, intellectual property rights, competition violation, bankruptcy
and liquidation
9 The total number consists of 224 judges and 45 legal associates in July 2016 assigned to at least one unresolved

commercial case.


                                                          10
13.     Commercial cases are not equally distributed between Municipal Courts or
between the Cantonal Courts. Caseloads correlate to concentrations of economic activity in
FBiH. As shown in Figure 2, the Cantonal Courts in Sarajevo and Tuzla carry the largest caseloads
by far, while Cantonal Courts in Odžak and Goražde handle few commercial cases.

14.    As of June 2016, the amount at issue in unresolved commercial claims amounted to
approximately 4.3 billion BAM. 10 As of December 31, 2015, there were 63,020 unresolved
commercial cases in FBiH. Ninety percent of these (57,565) were pending in the Municipal Courts,
4,996 at Cantonal Courts, and 459 at the Supreme Court.

15.     At a national level, courts are not under-resourced, but resources are not allocated
effectively or executed efficiently. Court expenditure in BiH is approximately 0.85 percent of
GDP, which is more than double the averages in the EU (0.3 percent) and four times the average
of Council of Europe countries (0.21 percent) according to data from the European Commission
for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ). However, budgets are fragmented: courts and prosecutors’
offices are financed from 14 different budgets. As a result, courts’ resources are unpredictable,
uneven and not linked to performance or needs. This problem is more severe in FBiH where
capacity for planning remains weak. Data on how much is spent specifically on commercial cases
is not available.

1.2      Efficiency, Timeliness, and Productivity

16.      In FBiH, Municipal Courts proved more efficient in resolving commercial cases than
higher instance courts. Between 2012 and 2015 the number of unresolved commercial cases in
FBiH decreased by six percent, largely due to resolutions at the Municipal Courts. 11 Municipal
Courts in Tuzla and Livno steadily resolved more cases than they received, tackled backlogs and
improved timeliness. Other courts’ performance varied, with backlogs increasing and decreasing
at different times. The Municipal Court in Sarajevo, which carries the largest caseload, struggled
with performance: backlogs increased in all years but 2014, causing delays in case processing. 12

17.     In Municipal Courts, backlogs mostly comprise utility bill enforcement (27,021 of
57,565 backlogged cases), small claims (18,184 cases) and bankruptcy (480 cases).
According to the CEPEJ, the disposition time for utility bills enforcement was 8,897 days in
2012. 13 The clearance rate 14 in that year was only 33 percent. Occasional progress can be seen
but the problem remains immense.

18.    Efficiency in Cantonal Courts and the Supreme Court of FBiH decreased from 2012
to 2015, increasing backlogs and prolonging disposition times. While Cantonal Courts in
Bihać and Novi Travnik continually reduced their backlogs and shortened disposition times, other
Cantonal Courts (e.g., Sarajevo) generated growing backlogs or had a negligible influx of
commercial cases (e.g., Odžak and Goražde). Growing cantonal backlogs were primarily the result
of appeals from Municipal Courts in litigation and enforcement cases. The Supreme Court of FBiH
also experienced a growing backlog and prolonged disposition times, predominantly due to
extraordinary legal remedies cases which comprise the main share of the court’s caseload. If


11 Municipal Courts decreased their stock of unresolved cases by 9 percent. By contrast, Cantonal Courts increased
the number of unresolved commercial cases by 53 percent and the Supreme Court of FBiH by 37 percent.
12 When observing non-utility commercial cases in Municipal Court in Sarajevo, backlog in 2014 and 2015 was

reduced. Unfavorable results are primary attributed to utility cases.
13 WB calculation based on data provided by HJPC. Disposition time is calculated by comparing the number of

resolved cases during a reporting period with the number of unresolved cases at the end of that period. It measures
how frequently a court turns over the cases received or how long it takes to resolve a case. CEPEJ Guidelines are
available at http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/cepej/textes/Guidelines_en.pdf.
14 WB calculation based on data provided by HJPC. Clearance rate is calculated by dividing the number of resolved

cases by the number of incoming cases. It shows the ability of a court(s) to handle the inflow of cases. CEPEJ
guidelines are available at http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/cepej/textes/Guidelines_en.pdf.

improved performance in Municipal Courts is not mirrored by higher courts, backlogs will simply
relocate to a higher court, as seen between Cantonal Courts and the Supreme Court of FBiH.

19.     FBiH courts have significantly reduced the number of unresolved commercial cases
older than five years. This number fell from 8 percent in 2012 to 2 percent in 2015 as a result
of disciplined resolution of older cases. Under EU standards, the share of “old pending cases”
would be higher than in the HJPC Analysis. 15 Although the number of old cases was reduced
significantly, individual older cases should be constantly monitored to ensure persistence of
positive trends.

20.     According to HJPC data for 2015, the average duration of resolved commercial
cases in Municipal Courts was 528 days. 16 Six courts had average durations of both resolved
and unresolved commercial cases of over 500 days: the Cantonal Court in Sarajevo, Municipal
Court in Tuzla, Municipal Court in Mostar, Municipal Court in Sarajevo, and Municipal Court in
Livno.

21.    The most problematic commercial case types in FBiH are enforcement, business
registration, small claims and bankruptcy cases. In general, processing these case types is


15 In applying Article 6, the European Court of Human Rights may consider trials not reasonably timely even if carried
out within five years, depending on the case type, circumstances and complexity of the case and the conduct of the

especially lengthy, causing frustration among courts and parties alike. There are idiosyncratic
reasons why these case types cause problems, and they warrant particular attention and special
measures. The oldest unresolved cases (started between 1997 and 2005) are predominantly in
enforcement, small claims, and utility cases, and to a lesser extent litigation, and bankruptcy and
liquidation cases. For further detail, see Section 3.

22.    Neighboring RS established specialized commercial courts in 2010 in an effort to
improve efficiency and quality of commercial case management. RS established five District
Commercial Courts and one Higher Commercial Court in Banja Luka. 17 Prior to specialization, the
clearance rate of commercial cases in RS Basic Courts was variable and unsatisfactory (see Table
2 below).

23.    The results of specialization appear to be mixed. RS courts have been able to handle
incoming cases and keep the clearance rate over 100 percent. 18 In some case types, RS courts
process cases more quickly than in FBiH, such as in appeals of litigious cases where the average
case duration is four times shorter. However, first instance litigation cases take longer in RS. So
from the perspective of a court user with a two-instance litigation case, the wait is equally long
and frustrating. Resolution of bankruptcy cases takes twice as long in RS as in FBiH (688 days).




17 As of May 1, 2010, all commercial cases in the general jurisdiction in RS were transferred to these newly established

commercial courts. There are 39 appointed judges in commercial courts in RS, 32 in District Commercial Courts and 7
in Higher Commercial Court in Banja Luka. The number of appointed judges has not increased since 2010. In October
2016, the HJPC passed a decision to increase the number of judge positions in District Commercial Court in Banja Luka
by 8 judges; these positions will be filled only after the budget is provided.
18 The specialized District Commercial Courts achieved clearance rates of 105 percent in 2012 and 101 percent in 2015.

24.     From 2012 to 2015, both FBiH and RS reduced their backlogs, but FBiH focused
more of its efforts on resolving the oldest backlogged cases. 19 Across RS, the backlog of all
cases decreased by 18 percent. This was largely due to efforts to resolve commercial litigation
cases. Meanwhile the backlog of enforcement cases grew. The Higher Commercial Court in Banja
Luka showed strong results in terms of backlog reduction (54 percent) in 2010 and 2011.
However, from 2012 to 2015, the number of unresolved commercial cases at the RS Higher
Commercial Court level increased by 51 percent. In all, the courts in RS have performed
marginally better with separate court structures but there remains much room for improvement.

1.2.1    Procedural Bottlenecks in Case Processing

25.    Procedural bottlenecks undermine court efficiency and efficacy in BiH. Court
performance is deeply affected by court management and organization, practice and procedure,
and party discipline. Despite a general opinion that performance can be improved simply by
hiring more judges, more significant improvements in FBiH could be achieved through
procedural changes.

26.     Delays in scheduling court hearings are a significant procedural obstacle
influencing efficiency and timeliness in FBiH courts. Several years may pass (in certain cases
over five years) between case filing and the first hearing. Hearings are cancelled or adjourned
frequently and without strong justification. Case management systems (CMS) available in courts

19 Of all backlogged cases in RS, the District Commercial Courts reduced the share of cases older than five years by three

percent, while the number of backlogged cases older than three years fell by six percent. In FBiH, the share of
backlogged cases older than five years fell by six percent, and the share of cases older than three years fell by five
percent.

should be used to monitor the efficiency of hearings and detect irregularities to enable competent
authorities, such as the Court President, the HJPC, and the Federal MOJ, to respond. When called
for, appropriate disciplinary measures should be taken.

27.     Court Presidents and heads of departments should actively monitor case flows to
prevent cases from becoming inactive. The World Bank team heard of several instances where
judges had left or taken long-term sick leave or maternity leave without their cases being
reassigned. The CMS enables courts to monitor and respond to these issues, and procedures are
in place to re-assign cases. Court Presidents and heads of department could do more to use their
systems and relevant rules to prevent unnecessary delays.

28.    Often, proceedings lack clearly defined procedures, so practice is inconsistent
between courtrooms and courthouses. Attorneys complained of different procedures for
accessing case files in different locations and of courts requiring different information for the
same case type. This is of particular concern in simple cases, like business registration, where the
same information should be required in each case. Simplification of processes, compliance with
regulatory deadlines and regular consultation with judges would lessen party-court interaction
and reduce delays.

29.     Stakeholders report that abuse of process is extensive and that judges do little to
control it. In particular, parties represented by attorneys reportedly use delay tactics to ‘bleed
out’ their opponents. Abuses include avoiding service of process, failing to appear at hearings,
requesting adjournments without sufficient justification, and interferring with witnesses prior to
giving evidence. Procedural tools are available to judges to tighten control of proceedings but
judges rarely deploy them. Stakeholders report that certain cases tend to take priority over others
and that powerful parties find ways to have their cases heard faster (or slower) as desired.
Disciplinary measures against attorneys and judges are rare and ineffective. This undermines
parties’ trust in the integrity of the system.

30.     Expert witnesses are also a source of delay. Expert witnesses are commonly appointed
by judges to prevent their cases being overturned in appellate courts. However, there are
instances where expert opinions add little or no value to the case. Expert witnesses are costly, so
their excessive use drives up the cost of the case for the parties. Stakeholders also report that
expert witnesses are a common source of adjournments and delays (i.e., their reports are not
timely, they do not appear at hearings, their evidence is contested) and this extends the duration
of the case. Furthermore, heavy reliance on expert witnesses creates opportunities for other
procedural bottlenecks, including disputes over the choice of expert and over their testimony.

31.     Users also express frustration that related procedures are conducted in parallel
without coordination. This problem manifests most commonly in enforcement cases where
courts often fail to join new cases to cases that have already been initiated. For example, a creditor
may have no knowledge of whether another creditor has already initiated enforcement against
the same property. As a result, a full procedure can be conducted by one creditor and in the end
the profits from sale of the property must be paid to the creditor who filed a prevailing motion
for enforcement. 20

1.3      Quality and Consistency in Decision-making

1.3.1    Structural Fragmentation and the Use of Case Law Harmonization Tools

32.      Effective harmonization of case law is a complex task in all court systems and is
especially complex in BiH. 21 Each Canton has its own case law and practice. Not all cases are
eligible to seek extraordinary legal remedies from the Supreme Court of FBiH to harmonize case
law between the Cantons. Furthermore, there is no supreme body to harmonize case law on
similar matters between Cantonal Courts in FBiH and District Commercial Courts in RS.

33.     Practices within the courts exacerbate this problem. Although commercial
departments exist in FBiH, very few judges are truly commercial law specialists and judges move
between departments. Many judges receive only a handful of commercial cases each year while
also working on civil or administrative cases. Court Presidents reallocate judges and legal
associates in and out of departments at will, sometimes rotating judges each year.

34.    Tools for case law harmonization exist, but are not effective. These include
departmental meetings, issuing of legal opinions, and the establishment of a Judicial
Documentation Center at the HJPC. However, none of these have significantly contributed to a
more uniform application of the law in FBiH. Practices within courts are uneven and often lack
coordination. During the Feasibility Study, the team heard of several different practices that were
unique to individual courthouses.

35.      Firms find this lack of harmonization particularly frustrating. Businesses report that
if their operations straddle several Cantons or both entities, they may be subject to different
regimes in the same country without their knowledge. When disputes arise, firms and attorneys
are often unable to predict the outcome of the case. This makes it difficult for firms to decide to
litigate, and makes negotiation and out-of-court settlement unpredictable. Lack of case law
harmonization creates the impression of unequal treatment, leading to suspicion and mistrust of
the judiciary.

1.3.2    Appeals and Confirmation Rates

36.     From 2012 to 2015, appeals rates in Cantonal Courts in commercial cases varied
between 11 and 14 percent, depending on the individual court and case type. First instance
courts in both entities had appeal rates in commercial cases ranging from 6 to 8 percent. 22 Higher
than average appeal rates were recorded in Municipal Courts in commercial litigious cases, with
22 to 30 percent and bankruptcy cases with 12 to 24 percent. Lower or average appeal rates were
recorded in enforcement (4 to 6 percent), liquidation (1 percent), small claims (5 to 10 percent)
and registration cases (0.2 to 0.4 percent). Generally in undisputed case types or cases of small
value, appeal rates were lower. Higher appeal rates are more common in higher value contentious
cases, when more is at stake between the parties, and parties are more likely to have the finances
to hire attorneys and wait for longer periods for appeal cases to be resolved.



21 In BiH, case law is not a formal source of law. By applying provisions of prior decisions in current decisions the
courts give direction for the practical application of law to others. Case law then becomes an important tool for
interpreting the law, filling legal gaps, and establishing rule of law and legal certainty.
22 Municipal and Cantonal Courts presented similar confirmation rates in commercial and non-commercial civil cases.

Both Cantonal and Municipal Courts retained slightly more confirmed decisions in commercial matters. There were
more reversed decisions in commercial matters while in non-commercial matters more decisions were modified by a
higher court.




                                                         17
37.    In period from 2012 to 2015, the share of confirmed decisions varied between 76
and 81 percent in Municipal Courts and between 80 and 89 percent in Cantonal Courts. 23
Confirmation rates recorded per case type in Municipal Courts varied from 73 to 79 percent in
commercial litigious cases and from 75 to 97 percent in bankruptcy cases. In other case types,
confirmation rates ranged from 58 to 94 percent (78 to 91 percent in enforcement, 58 to 87
percent in liquidation, 80 to 87 percent in small claims and 74 to 94 percent in registration). The
percentage of modified decisions was under 10 percent for both instances. Partially reversed
decisions were almost negligible at under 1 percent.

38.    Cantonal Courts displayed higher appeal and confirmation rates than the Municipal
Courts. Higher appeal and confirmation rates with Cantonal Courts indicate that parties may be
abusing the appeals system as a delay tactic or to re-litigate their claim.

39.     Municipal Courts in 2015 had the lowest number of confirmed decisions in the last
four years (76 percent) and the highest number of reversed decisions (14 percent)
although the appeal rate was unchanged through the period. The data points to a gradual
decline in the quality of decision-making in these courts.

40.     The rate of confirmation of commercial cases in District Commercial Courts in RS is
lower than in FBiH. From 2012 to 2015 the share of confirmed decisions ranged from 72 to 79
percent in the RS District Commercial Courts and 70 to 79 percent in the Higher Commercial Court
in Banja Luka. BiH’s Cantonal Courts had 10 percent more of their cases confirmed than the High
Commercial Court in Banja Luka. This suggests that establishing separate court structures does
not necessarily guarantee better quality decisions.

41.     A range of measures would improve the quality of decision-making. These include
the education of judges, better use of the case law database and a structured process to harmonize
case law in difficult areas. Appellate judges should, wherever possible, replace the decision of the
lower court with their own rather than sending back decisions for review. In case of reversal,
higher instance decisions should contain a precise explanation and instructions to be followed in
subsequent proceedings.

1.3.3    Judicial Independence and Accountability

42.     The Global Competitiveness Index 2015-2016 ranks BiH 97 out of 142 economies
on judicial independence. The principle of independence of courts is enshrined in the Entities’
constitutions, laws on courts, and in the statutory and regulatory framework of Brcko District,
although not in the BiH Constitution. 24 In the Country Report for BiH 2016,, the European
Commission stresses that there are no formal procedures carrying penalties that offer legal or
constitutional protection against undue influence or threats to judicial independence, resulting
in unlawful and politically motivated attacks against the judiciary. 25 Judicial independence is
compromised in individual cases, including through politically motivated threats on the
judiciary. 26 .


23 The highest rate of confirmed decisions in commercial cases was recorded in 2013 in both Cantonal and Municipal
Courts: 89 percent in Cantonal Courts and 81 percent in Municipal Courts.

43.     While the appointment processes for judges are based on procedures which
evaluate candidates’ professionalism and competence, these processes are reportedly
politicized. Independence of the judiciary is further undermined by the appointment of
“additional judges” who do not enjoy the permanent status of a judge but are appointed for two
year periods and subject to successive extensions.

44.      The accountability of judges also needs to be improved. According to the European
Commission Country Report for BiH 2016, 27 sanctions for breaching disciplinary and ethical rules
fail to deter unethical conduct. The GRECO Fourth Evaluation Round Report 2016 also reports
shortcomings in conflict of interest rules and in performance appraisals for promotion.

45.     The performance management system in the judiciary is sophisticated, but it has
not generated incentives for improved performance. The Criteria for Evaluating the
Performance of Judges and Prosecutors combines the type and number of cases a judge resolved
in one year with the qualitative results and other work achievements, including backlog reduction
and timeliness. 28 The same performance criteria are applied to legal associates. Performance is
evaluated by the Court President. The Court President is in turn evaluated by the President of the
higher court. At the court level, 29 these criteria are used to measure court performance, and the
results are attributed to the court president and used for statistical monitoring and comparing of
courts. Unlike judges and legal associates, performance of staff is not specifically monitored and
is graded in the same way as other civil servants. In this complex system, an overwhelming
majority of judges meet or exceed performance standards, notwithstanding the long case
processing times and high backlogs. This suggests that the criteria are set too low to meet the
needs of users. There are no formal incentives to encourage courts as a team to work together to
innovate, solve problems or boost court performance.

46.      The lack of independence in FBiH is partially due to fragmented budgetary
planning. Up to 14 institutions are involved in budget planning which causes inefficiency and
makes it difficult to ensure available funds are targeted appropriately to meet needs equitably
across the system. Independent judicial system evaluations argue that this fragmentation masks
attempts by politicians to control and interfere in the judicial process. 30 The Government's
attempts to reduce corruption by increasing the salaries of judges have yet to produce positive
results.

1.3.4    Training of Judges, Lawyers, and Court Staff

47.     The quality of justice delivered by courts depends in large part on the quality and
consistency of the education that judges and staff receive. In a survey of over 2,500 legal
academics and practitioners by the World Justice Project, the inadequate selection and training
of judges was ranked among the most serious problems facing the BiH judiciary. 31


27 Ibid note 26, see p.13.
28 The purpose of the system is to objectively evaluate the performance of judges and legal associated to inform
future advancement and disciplinary measures. See http://vsts.pravosudje.ba/vstv/faces/vijesti.jsp?id=7907;

48.     Judges serving on complex commercial cases do not have to be specialized or
accredited. Indeed, human resource practices discourage specialization of judges in commercial
matters. The Court Rulebook, the Court President adopts the annual schedule of judges and
judicial assistants, associates, and advisers. 32 In practice, this means that judges can be moved
each year to different departments (e.g., commercial, civil, non-contentious, enforcement) based
on the Court President’s decision.

49.      The quality and quantity of training for commercial cases is inadequate. In FBiH, the
mandate for judicial training rests with the Public Institution Centre for Judicial and Prosecutorial
Training of FBiH (CJPT). Judges and prosecutors are obliged to attend at least three days of
training organized by CJPT each year. However, there is no obligation to choose trainings in one’s
field of work. Stakeholders report that attractive training venues are often the decisive factor in
selecting trainings.

50.     According to the CJPT, approximately 80 percent of judicial education is financed
by donors. Commercial law trainings have been delivered by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, Commercial Law Development Program, and Deutsche
Stiftung für Internationale Rechtliche Zusammenarbeit. Currently, the IPA 2012 project “Capacity
Building for Judicial Reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina” is completing implementation. Specific
trainings were delivered in the fields of commercial law and European law and a new training
curriculum was drafted for the training centers. A possible new donor-funded project that would
aim to strengthen the capacity of judges to resolve commercial cases through specialized
trainings is in the design and proposal phase. This project is welcomed and could boost the
modest coverage on commercial matters in FBiH.

51.    The CJPT does not provide any courses on financial literacy covering the basics of
accounting, finance and economics. Limited knowledge of business transactions and
commercial practices remains an issue among newly appointed judges, according to ICR ROSC
2015. Businesses complain that judges often lack sufficient expertise in and understanding of
complex commercial transactions.

52.    Although regulations recognize that commercial law is a separate domain for
educators, little progress has been made in creating a pool of expert educators for
commercial matters. Trainers are chosen by donors and/or the CJPT. Trainers chosen by the
CJPT are usually judges and university professors who are enlisted by HJPC as permanent
educators. This list was last updated in 2013 and contains only one trainer for commercial law.
The CJPT is authorized to choose ad hoc educators if necessary, so they could add commercial law
educators to the existing list.

53.     Training focuses on criminal law, leaving commercial law on the margins. Of the 202
trainings that the CJPT will conduct in 2016 only eight cover commercial matters. The six courses
offered in the first half of 2016 were attended by 116 judges and legal associates. 33 In 2015, there
were five trainings in commercial matters attended by 105 judges and legal associates. The
highest participation (91 judges) occurred at five regionally organized trainings on the new
Companies Law of FBiH. This was likely because extensive legislative changes in the Companies
Law piqued the interest of judges and because regional venues made the trainings more
accessible. Although this example seems to be positive, the number of attendees in Sarajevo (only
14) was low in comparison to other regions.


32 Article 25 Court Rulebook.
33 This number is even lower if one notices that out of eight education five are identical but organized trough CJPT
educational centers in FBiH (Lukavac, Zenica, Mostar, Bihać, Sarajevo). Having that in mind there are only three types
of education in commercial matters organized in 2016.


                                                         20
54.     Only about half of judges and legal associates assigned to commercial cases attend
commercial trainings. HJPC data as of July 2016 indicates that there are 269 judges and legal
associates working on commercial cases. The number of commercial trainings attendees was just
over 100 in 2015 and 2016.

55.     Surveys show that judges would appreciate more training in this area. The quality
of trainings appeared to be high, but diversity and the number of trainings was considered
insufficient. The CJPT carries out anonymous, optional surveys and analyzes satisfaction with
trainings. In 2015 and 2016, all of the trainings in commercial matters were rated highly—
between 4.47 and 4.93 out of 5—and they all met or exceeded expectations. However, surveys
show that there needs to be more trainings on practical application in commercial matters and
encompassing different areas of the economy and business, including international regulations.

56.     There is no effective quality assurance process for training. Trainings do not include
entrance or exit quizzes which would enable training assessment, contribute to motivation,
influence personal engagement, and could be connected to certification.

1.4      Accessibility of Courts for Businesses

57.     Stakeholders report that access to justice for businesses in FBiH is inadequate,
particularly for MSMEs. Due to their size, MSMEs are particularly constrained by an ineffective
and inefficient judicial system and cumbersome court procedures in setting up, operating, and
growing a business. Unclear and/or complex requirements for court registry entries, inconsistent
application of open access to public registries, inconsistent legal practice, excessive length of
proceedings, and non-compliance with legal deadlines are only some of the factors that hinder
access to justice for businesses. Small claims cases take an average of 702 days to be resolved. It
would not be unusual for a court case to be adjudicated long after an MSME has been liquidated.
Even small claims values can represent a significant part of an MSME’s income. The removal of
these constraints would ease operations and stimulate growth.

58.      Lack of access to court decisions contributes to unpredictability and inconsistent
jurisprudence. Not all judgments are published. Public access to online case law is limited and
judicial professionals seeking access must pay a subscription fee.

59.     The cost of litigation is high and increases as delays occur. According to the World
Justice Project, while dispute resolution time is the most pressing issue facing the BiH judiciary,
court fees, attorney fees, and legal aid also present significant challenges to the judicial system.
Together, these factors impede individuals’ and businesses’ access to the courts. According to the
World Justice Project Rule of Law Index 2016, BiH scores 0.56 out of 1 on accessibility and
affordability of civil justice. 34

60.     Court fees are extremely complex in FBiH, making it difficult for parties to estimate
likely costs. There are 14 laws on court fees and fee tariffs which apply in BiH depending on court
jurisdiction. For proceedings at the Supreme Court of FBiH, court fees are regulated by a Federal
law. For proceedings under Municipal and Cantonal Courts, individual Cantonal laws are applied.
Some fees are several times larger in one Canton compared to another. 35 The fees for decisions in
merit and appeals are sometimes the same value as fees for claims, but can be up to double that
amount. The biggest range in fees is in business registration cases where, for example, the fee in

34 See p.5 Rule of Law Index 2016,
http://worldjusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/media/wjp_rule_of_law_index_2016.pdf
35 For dispute values of 1,500 – 3,00035 BAM in observed Cantons35 fees range from 80 to 100 BAM. This is equal to

0.7 percent of GDP per capita in Sarajevo and double that—1.4 percent of GDP per capita—in Goražde.




                                                         21
Mostar is approximately four times higher than in Goražde. 36 Furthermore, the 10 separate laws
for fees at Municipal and Cantonal levels have each undergone several amendments over the
years. Even if parties knew where to research, there is no official consolidated information
available. As a result, parties are unable to make an informed decision to pursue litigation, and as
a result many are deterred from lodging valid claims.

61.     Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) provides an imperfect alternative to filing in
court. According to the World Justice Project, inefficient ADR methods are a serious problem
facing the BiH judiciary. BiH scores 0.66 out of 1 for the accessibility, impartiality, and
effectiveness of ADR mechanisms, which is lower than the average of the 97 countries assessed.

62.    Firms can self-represent in FBiH courts, but most firms choose to hire an attorney
to represent them. Firms report hiring attorneys mainly because the relevant legal expertise
cannot be found among their employees. Some stakeholders also report that firms hire an
attorney to get them good connections in the judiciary.



Analysis of the Most Problematic Case Types

63.     Business registration, small claims, enforcement and bankruptcy tend to be the
most problematic commercial cases in FBiH. These cases suffer from large backlogs, long
processing times, low clearance rates, and unsatisfactory court service. They cause the most
frustration for court users. There are particular reasons why each of these case types under-
perform. The following section unpacks these issues to arrive a specific measures to improve
performance in these areas.

1.5      Business Registration Cases

64.     The 2017 Doing Business report ranked BiH 174th on ease of business
registration. 37 Given that business registration accounts for 51-55 percent of all incoming cases
in FBiH, 38 improvements in this category could lead to a significant improvement in overall court
performance.




36 This is equal to 4.3 percent of GDP per capita in Mostar and 1.4 of GDP per capita in Goražde.
37 See http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/bosnia-and-herzegovina/
38 The average number of incoming business registration cases from 2012 to 2015 was stable at 32,000 to 33,000

cases per year.




                                                       22

                    Source: Foreign Investment Promotion Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina

65.     At FBiH level, the business registration procedure is regulated by a range of laws 39
and other regulations, leading to inconsistent practice. 40 Registration of a business entity is
the responsibility of the competent court, determined by the location of the business entity. The
procedure for starting a business is explained in Figure 4. Businesses are required to provide a
range of approvals and other documents in order to initiate a business registry procedure, and
laws are still not clear and are subject to local interpretation. As a result, the disposition time for
business registration procedures in the Municipal Court in Sarajevo was 25 days, while the
Municipal Courts in Livno and Orašje resolve them in a single day. There is no legal reason why
business registration cases should take 25 days.

66.      There is a backlog of business registration cases in courts in FBiH, probably
because of abandoned registrations. Consultations with court staff and judges reveal that this
is likely because the party which initiated the procedure decided not to pursue registration,
leaving the case “open” in the system. It is not known whether these cases are abandoned because
parties became frustrated by the complex procedure or for other reasons. Nonetheless,
abandonment seems to be a frequent occurrence, especially at the Municipal Court in Sarajevo,
and perpetuates high levels of informality in the economy. On the positive side, clearance rates in
business registration cases in all FBiH courts approximate 100 percent, indicating that courts are
not falling further behind over time in processing these cases.

67.     Businesses are required to undergo the full registration procedure any time there
is a change in their documentation. The competent court must verify any change, be it a change
in business operations or change of address. There is no special procedure for amending
registration documents, so courts and firms must complete the full registration procedure again.
Full fees are charged for making these minor changes.

68.    Many countries in the region have moved business registration from courts and
created separate entities 41 to deal with this procedure. Business registration cases do not
require much judicial work, but in FBiH, judges argue that there is a role for them in this

39 There are two laws regulating establishment of business entities in FBiH (Framework Law on Registration of
Business Entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Law on Registration of Business Entities in the Federation Bosnia
and Herzegovina) and the Law on Companies of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is a separate
legislation for Republika Srpska and Brcko District.
40 One positive aspect of the legislative framework in FBiH is that there is no difference between a domestic and

foreign business entity.
41 For example, in Serbia there is a Serbian Business Registration Registry. In Macedonia, there is a central registry of

the Republic of Macedonia.


                                                           23
procedure that should not be delegated to anyone else. There are also financial incentives for the
courts to retain these cases. Businesses are required to pay a court fee which cannot be waived
and so courts see this as a lucrative operation that they are eager to retain.

69.     The quality of processing in business registration case is declining. Few registration
cases are appealed. But when they are, their confirmation rate is only 74 percent at the higher
court in 2015, which is comparatively low in the Western Balkans region. This rate is down from
a peak of 94 percent in 2014.

1.6        Small Claims Cases

70.      FBIH applies simplified procedures to disputes involving small claims. Small claims
are disputes involving sums up to a threshold of 5,000 BAM. 42 Small claims can be resolved
through a dedicated procedure in which self-representation is allowed and appeals against
judgments are limited. 43 In the first instance, cases are handled by an individual judge or by a
judicial assistant. There are no specialized small claims judges strictly speaking but, in practice,
courts assign judicial assistants to deal with this type of case and a judge provides oversight of
their work. Bigger courts usually have small claims departments: in the Sarajevo Municipal Court
a judge is president of the department and 19 judicial assistants.

71.     Small claim cases make up a decreasing proportion of commercial cases. The
number of incoming small claims cases has fallen by more than 45 percent over the last four years.
As a result, there has also been a 35 percent decrease in pending small claim cases over the same
time period. 44 In 2015, of Sarajevo’s 22,652 incoming commercial cases only 1,736 were small
claims cases (43 percent of all incoming small claim cases in FBIH). This was a significant decrease
from almost 5,000 in 2012.




42 Disputes involving small claims also include cases that are not of a pecuniary nature for which the plaintiff has
accepted a sum of money not exceeding that amount, as well as disputes relating to the transfer of property not
exceed that amount. Notably, plaintiffs can also obtain a temporary security over the defendant’s movable assets if
there is a risk that assets may convey.
43 Civil Procedure Code, small claims procedure is regulated by articles 428-433.
44 In 2012 the number of unresolved small claims cases in FBiH Municipal Courts was 12,107, while in 2015 it was

7,940.

72.     However, a backlog remains due to the lengthy processing times for unresolved
small claim cases, which average 655 days. The number of resolved small claims fell from
3,700 in 2012 to 2,365 in 2015, increasing the backlog. This is most significant in Sarajevo
Municipal Court where there are 6,171 unresolved small claims cases. One would expect small
claims to be dealt with much more quickly.

73.      Small claim cases have the longest disposition time among all cases, possibly due to
judicial discretion. The average disposition time for small claim cases is 702 days. This is
extremely high compared to the CEPEJ average of 127 for civil and commercial non-litigious
cases. 45 Stakeholders report that judges may be choosing to deal with the more complex cases
first and not prioritizing small claims cases. 46

74.     More could be done to expedite the resolution of small claims in FBiH. Many
countries have faster small claims processes. 47 Some EU member states have developed high-
performing systems to fast-track these cases. Applying lessons from those states may be
warranted. Reforms to this procedure would deliver faster justice to many more people, and
would particularly help MSMEs, the poor and the middle class. Such reform would also
significantly improve judicial statistics across the FBiH judiciary, free up the time of judges to deal
with more complex cases, and improve the perception of the courts among citizens and
businesses. 48

75.     Small claim cases show a relatively high percentage of confirmed decisions (83
percent compared to an average of 78.5 percent). However, the highest percentage of
modified decisions was also among small claim cases (10 percent). The rate of modified decisions
suggests that there are opportunities for second instance courts to unify court practice and signal
the correct practice to the Municipal Courts. Where possible, appellate courts should reduce the
percentage of reversed decisions by replacing the decision of the first-instance court.




45 Majority of CEPEJ countries include bankruptcy cases in the group of civil and commercial non-litigious cases.

47 According to Doing Business data, 128 economies worldwide have either a small claims court or a simplified

procedure. In the EU, all but five EU jurisdictions have some form of small claims or simplified procedure.
48 Over time, the low thresholds could also be lifted to allow more citizens and business to make use of the procedure.

For example, in the EU the highest threshold can be found in the Netherlands (25,000 EUR), while in Portugal, Spain
and Austria ranges between 15,000 and 20,000 EUR. In Slovenia, threshold is 4,000 EUR.

1.7         Enforcement Cases

76.    Enforcement of unpaid claims is inefficient and is one of the biggest challenges of
the legal system in FBiH. According to the FIC Business Barometer 2015, investors consider
enforcement of court rulings among the top five constraints impacting operations in BiH.
Businesses consider enforcement as the weakest link of the credit legal system in BiH and cite it
as one of the main reasons for not offering better conditions for loans and credits. In addition,
according to the 2011 Global Integrity Report, judicial decisions are often ignored and are not
enforced by the state.

77.     Enforcement of commercial decisions needs to be streamlined, accelerated and
made more consistent. Flaws in the execution system are the result of the general economic
situation, ineffective legislation and poor implementation of execution procedures. Substantial
court backlogs are mainly caused by enforcement cases, predominantly deriving from utility bills.
According to the Doing Business 2017 Report, enforcement of commercial contracts involves 37
procedures, costs 36 percent of the claim value, and takes on average 595 days. The Investment
Climate Statement 2015 finds that enforcement of courts and government agencies’ decisions is
often unpredictable and intermittent. ICR ROSC 2015 reports that most judges do not sanction
procedural bad faith or the abusive use of procedural mechanisms in enforcement cases, which
further delays the proceedings.

78.    Court performance data in FBiH for enforcement cases reveal that the courts
demonstrate little capacity to manage the caseload. No clear progress was seen from 2012 to
2015. The backlog of utility enforcement cases 49 - which make up the majority of enforcement
cases - is increasing. Absent pending enforcement cases in courts without commercial
departments, there are 32,500 pending enforcement cases (see Figure 7). In addition, 7,512
enforcement and utility enforcement cases were pending in Municipal Courts with no commercial
departments.




49   Utility enforcemet cases are registered under Ip kom.

79.     In 2015, two of the oldest unresolved commercial cases were enforcement cases
initiated in 1997. The average duration of unresolved enforcement cases in 2015 was 608 days,
and for utility bill enforcement cases it was 887 days. In the same year, the average disposition
time was 296 days for non-utility enforcement and 4,244 for utility enforcement cases.

80.     Confirmation of enforcement cases by higher instance courts was in line with the
average for commercial cases. Confirmed decisions ranged from 75 to 81 percent. Depending
on the year, the percentage of reversed decisions was up to 8 percent higher than the average for
commercial cases.

81.     Large creditors and debtors play an important role in the enforcement caseload. As
these are mostly publicly-owned companies that do not screen cases according to the likelihood
of successful collection, there is extensive double-counting and inflation of cases. Government
agencies are also the debtors in a significant number of cases. The role of large creditors and
debtors on the judicial system should be taken into account in developing a strategic approach to
the resolution of this backlog.

82.    The chronic problems with enforcement cases have been recognized by the BiH
authorities. Donor activities have attempted to address the question of enforcement, but with
few results. Resources should be invested and appropriate strategies adopted to tackle the
volume of utility cases in enforcement. Only by a coordinated and pragmatic approach can
improvements be achieved through a reasonable set timeframe.

83.      The USAID Justice Project in BiH 51 reports the main areas that need to be addressed
to improve the efficiency of the enforcement system are: legislation, organization,
technology support, and resources. Legal framework issues include a lack of uniformity, legal
gaps and inefficiencies, and faults laws such as statute of limitations, registration of legal entities,
mortgage for tax debts, and enforcement of tax claims. Organizational problems include excessive
formalism in the role of the judge, inconsistent organization of work in different courts, recruitment
and status of court bailiffs, lack of capacity development of judges and bailiffs, and belief among the
public that non-payment will not result in collection. Shortcomings of the enforcement process also
include excessive reliance on movable assets, inefficiency of auctions and sales, and unclear
definition of fees and costs. Access to information still remains complex and labor intensive.
Information technology solutions should be used to facilitate enforcement proceedings since
retrieval of information about the debtor and his or her assets is of crucial importance. Further
efforts should be made in order to fully utilize the benefits of the various information systems in
use.

84.      Three possible avenues are available, based on the analysis above: maintaining
enforcement in the courts; introducing public agencies or services for enforcement; or
introducing a self-employed enforcement system. First and foremost, the roles of judges and
bailiffs need to be reconsidered. The creation of a highly qualified legal professional of enforcement
bailiffs could have a positive influence on the efficiency and effectiveness of the enforcement
system. The central role of judges and court intervention could be reduced to a minimum. An
organized structure for court bailiffs and judges with training and opportunities for exchange of
case law, experience and practices should be provided. Mechanisms would also need to be put in
place to ensure the integrity of the work of bailiffs and minimize corruption risks in the
profession.

85.     Next, legal gaps and inefficiencies should be addressed through amendments to
legislation, improved court practice through harmonization, and interpretation of legal
provisions to increase efficiency. The distribution of tasks and responsibilities between judges,
legal associates and clerks/typists needs to be reorganized. Tasks which are purely
administrative or procedural in nature should be delegated to enable judges to focus exclusively
on contested matters in enforcement procedure. Web services for data exchange between the
data holder and the CMS should be developed and introduced. Finally, a strategic approach to
enforcement case backlog reduction should be adopted.

1.8      Bankruptcy Cases

86.      Refinements to the Bankruptcy Law in FBiH are needed. The regime is relatively
comprehensive, but the regime is biased towards piecemeal asset liquidation in law and practice.
52 Bankruptcy proceedings are slow and cumbersome. They often do not maximize the value of a

firm’s assets and recoveries by the creditors as a whole. Amendments of the Bankruptcy Law are
being developed with the support of the International Financial Corporation (IFC). The draft law
is at an advanced stage of preparation.

87.      Disputes related to bankruptcy cases are heard before the Municipal Courts’
Commercial Departments, Cantonal Courts hear appeals. Bankruptcy proceedings in the first
instance are handled by an individual judge. There are no specially-designated bankruptcy judges
but, in practice courts designate judges to deal with these cases. Three judges in a panel session

51 USAID Justice Project in BiH has in March 2016 published Diagnostic Assessment of the Enforcement Regime of Final

Civil Claims in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Diagnostic Assessment identified the utility bills backlog is significant in a very
limited number of Municipal Courts in the FBiH.

decide on appeals. Appeals on decisions in bankruptcy proceedings are very rare. Given the
complexity of bankruptcy legislation, further specialized training through CJPT should be
available for judges presiding over these cases.

88.     Although the number of bankruptcy proceedings remains quite low in proportion
to total commercial cases, the number of incoming bankruptcy cases has increased by 65
percent over the last four years. Over 85 percent of bankruptcy cases are heard in the Municipal
Courts in Sarajevo, Mostar, Zenica, Tuzla and Bihać.

89.    The number of pending bankruptcy cases has increased by 23 percent over the last
four years. 53 In 2015, 94 bankruptcy cases were filed at the Sarajevo Municipal Court. At the end
of December 2015 the same Court had 118 unresolved bankruptcy cases.

90.      The HJPC’s Ageing List of unresolved cases enables Court Presidents to analyze
pending bankruptcy cases and follow timeliness and implementation of a backlog
reduction plan. The Ageing List reveals that many unresolved bankruptcy cases remain caught
in the justice system. Of 480 unresolved bankruptcy cases at the end of 2015, 66 cases are older
than five years and 30 cases are older than 10 years. Any case older than four or five years is likely
to violate Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as well as other
international and European standards.

91.      One of the reasons for the backlog is the duration of unresolved bankruptcy cases
in FBiH (on average 879 days). 54 FBIH scores poorly on disposition time of resolved bankruptcy
cases, with an average of 322 days compared to the EU average of 220 days for insolvency cases. 55
According to the Doing Business Report 2017, most delays in proceedings are due to delays in the

92.     The HJPC is addressing the problem of unresolved bankruptcy cases before courts
in BiH. 56 Since 2014, courts have been obliged to develop action plans for resolving bankruptcy
cases and cases derived from bankruptcy procedures. These action plans are updated regularly
and a HJPC working group monitors their implementation. In addition, the HJPC organized a
number of specialized trainings on bankruptcy issues for judges. A new round of specialized
trainings will include bankruptcy trustees. These actions may have helped curtail the increase in


53 In 2012 the number of unresolved bankruptcy cases in FBiH Municipal Courts was 391, while in 2015 it was 480.
54 Doing Business 2017 reports that resolving insolvency in Bosnia and Herzegovina takes 3.3 years in comparison to
2.2 years in Europe and Central Asia. In comparison, the average length of unresolved commercial cases in FBiH is
602 days.
55 CEPEJ 2016 Report has a separate chapter on specific categories of civil cases (litigious divorce, employment

dismissal and insolvency cases). It should be noted that limited number of countries provided data for specific
categories of civil cases..

these cases.

93.     88 percent of bankruptcy decisions are confirmed compared to an average of 78.5
percent for all cases. Most of the decisions that are not confirmed are sent back to the first
instance court to start again rather than amended by the appellate court. Bankruptcy cases make
up the lowest percentage of amended decisions (1 percent). Stakeholders report that this very
low rate of amended decisions is a cause for concern, suggesting that appellate courts are not
taking the opportunity to signal correct court practice to lower courts and thereby harmonize
court practice.

94.     Divided competence between bankruptcy and litigation judges contributes to the
delay of bankruptcy proceedings and creates the risk of inconsistent interpretation of
similar conflicts related to the same bankruptcy case. 57 One of the challenges in bankruptcy
cases is the limited competence of the bankruptcy judge in making the main decisions to be
issued. Other disputes that may (and typically do) arise in the course of bankruptcy are referred
to other judges in the Litigation Department. Court practice should be clarified and enhanced by,
for example, adopting a system of attraction of jurisdiction to ensure that the bankruptcy process
is not halted due to ongoing disputes.

95.    The fact that appeals stay the bankruptcy process 58 can further cause significant
delays. Indeed such delays are occurring in practice. The Bankruptcy Law should be amended to
provide that only appeals in particular instances be permitted to stay the bankruptcy process.

96.     Responsibilities of trustees are not clearly defined and liabilities are rarely
enforced. Bankruptcy judges may appoint, supervise and may remove a trustee from a particular
bankruptcy case at their own discretion. The Federal Ministry of Justice (MOJ) may cancel the
license if a trustee is twice removed from bankruptcy proceedings by a judge. Legislation should
be amended to limit judges’ discretionary power to appoint a bankruptcy trustee through use of
random or alphabetic rotation of trustees and by requiring the rotation of trustees. This would
also improve public perception of fairness.

97.     The lack of a clearly specified remuneration system for bankruptcy trustees in the
Bankruptcy Law impedes efficiency in these proceedings. 59 Judges use several criteria at their
discretion for establishing trustee remuneration, such as the value of the bankruptcy estate,
number of creditors and complexity of the case. Usually, monthly remuneration for the trustee is

established in the early stages of the procedure. There is no ceiling on the trustee’s remuneration
over the course of proceedings. This can act as an incentive to delay bankruptcy proceedings. A
remuneration system with appropriate incentives for efficient performance by the bankruptcy
trustee and prompt completion of bankruptcy proceedings needs to be established.

98.     Bankruptcy trustees come from different professions, may lack a legal background
and are not required to seek legal assistance. Since legal assistance to bankruptcy trustees is
not mandatory, judges do not require that trustees request legal advice. Legislation should be
amended to empower the bankruptcy judge to require the bankruptcy trustee request legal
assistance where needed.



Models of Specialization and Lessons from Comparator Jurisdictions
99.     A growing number of countries have chosen to specialize commercial cases in one
form or another. Of the 190 economies considered in the Doing Business Report 2017, 99 have
a specialized commercial jurisdiction, whether in the form of dedicated stand-alone courts,
specialized commercial departments within existing courts, or specialized judges within general
civil courts. 60 According to the Doing Business methodology, countries that have specialized in
some way are awarded points towards the score for ease of enforcing contracts.

100. In 2013, the World Bank published guidance on how policymakers can determine
if specialization is warranted and what model of specialization may be most appropriate. 61
That guidance emphasizes that the decision to specialize jurisdictions should be informed by the
opportunities and risks arising in the particular context.

101. The 2013 World Bank Guidance reviews the available evidence on specialization
and emphasizes that its impacts are not straightforward and should not be assumed. 62 The
impact of judicial specialization depends on the conditions under which generalist and
specialized courts operate, such as the mechanisms for selection of judges, the degree of
technicality of their work, the substantive and procedural legal rules that govern the court, the
configuration of interest groups in the field, and whether focused and systematic training is
provided. As a result, the relationship between specialization and the outputs that courts produce
is highly complex. It is also possible that judicial specialization might ease the pressure of heavy
caseloads on courts by enhancing judicial efficiency but these gains in efficiency are assumed
rather than measured.

102. Specialization is justified where it promotes the efficient administration of justice
and ensures the quality of proceedings and judicial decisions. 63 Proponents for
specialization generally argue that it has three advantages: improved efficiency, higher quality
and uniformity of case law. Diverting a class of cases to specialized courts takes some of the
burden of growing caseloads off the shoulders of courts of general jurisdiction. A specialist court

enhances the quality and uniformity of decisions, particularly in complex areas of law. 64 Arguably,
these gains are made by increasing judges’ experience and skill through specialization. Judges
may elect to work in these courts due to their interest and skill set and they become experts as
they specialize. In turn, this expertise can foster greater efficiency in deciding cases and greater
effectiveness in reaching high-quality decisions.

103. However, strict specialization has several drawbacks that can reduce efficiency and
quality of justice. 65 There is a greater chance that specialized judges will be captured by special
interests and, if this occurs, their decisions can systematically undermine the field of law. Strict
judicial specialization can also create a two-tiered system where repeat court users gain an
advantage 66 through more informal engagements which increase the risk of favoritism and
corruption. 67 Specialization can lead to judicial tunnel-vision, in which a judge focuses on only
one area of law and is unaware of relevant legal changes outside of their field. 68

104. The creation of specialist chambers or courts should be strictly regulated. Both
generalist and specialist judges and courts must continue to meet all fair trial requirements set
out in Article 6 of the ECHR and provide the same safeguards and quality. Distinct procedures for
specialist courts should be avoided unless they respond to the needs which led to setting up the
court (e.g., specific rules for examining cases involving children). All courts should enjoy the same
conditions in terms of resources, again recognizing variances that occur because of the specific
purpose of the specialized court. 69


1.9      Different Models of Specialization

105. Across Europe, there are different types of commercial specialization. 70 Some
countries have separate commercial courts in each province or district while others have just
one or two in the whole country. The structure of chambers in most countries is a mix of
professional and lay judges who are practitioners in business. 71 In some countries, commercial
courts’ jurisdiction is limited to commercial disputes or bankruptcy (e.g., Denmark), while in
others they also have competence over disputes related to industrial and intellectual property
(e.g., Austria).

106. Distinctions regarding models of specialization are important since any
generalization about impacts of specialization applies more accurately to some forms of
specialization than others. 72 The assessment of comparator jurisdictions found three distinct
specialization models based on comprehensiveness: a) a specialized court department or bench
within a court of general jurisdiction; b) a specialized separate court, or c) a mixed model.

1.9.1    Specialized Departments in Courts of General Jurisdiction

107. The most common method of specialization is through specialist chambers or
departments. 73 This can be achieved by means of internal court rules. In Europe, this model is
increasingly used, but tends to take a more formal approach, such as through amendment of the
law pertaining to courts and sometimes a change in the procedural code. 74

108. Special departments can be a highly flexible way of pursuing specialization without
significantly increasing administrative effort and costs. A specialized department of an
existing court may be established with less formality than by special legislation. Depending on
the legal regime, sometimes it can be done only by administrative direction or by rules adopted
by the court itself.

109. Specialized judges may work in a specialized department or unit within the court
of general jurisdiction. The division of tasks in the particular court may be invisible for the court
users, as they will only be required to approach the territorially competent court, while the
distribution of the cases to a “specialized” department or unit within the court is done internally,
as a matter of administrative routine within that court. A court department of this kind can have
several judges, staff members and courtrooms. This requires engagement of specialized staff.
Judges may be allocated to a special department either indefinitely or as needed to meet
temporary needs.

110. A good example is the Companies and Business Court which is an independent
section of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam. The cases are heard by chambers consisting of
five people, three of whom are professional specialized judges. The other two have financial
experience as auditors, businessmen or labor union officials, depending on the case at hand. 75 The
experience from The Netherlands shows that having judicial assistants working together in teams
can be a major advantage allowing for specialization. 76

111. Ireland has also successfully applied the model of specialized commercial
departments. Ireland’s High Court has a commercial division which hears exclusively
commercial disputes of high value and all intellectual property cases. Judges in commercial cases
manage the litigation and impose short deadlines, allowing the court to fast-track disputes. 77

1.9.2    Separate Commercial Courts

112. Separate specialized commercial courts can be part of the jurisdiction’s general
court system or a separate hierarchy of courts that may include distinct specialized
appeals courts. This form of specialization requires division of work among courts, which
operate as several branches of jurisdiction with separate appellate instances, eventually meeting
(or not) with other branches of jurisdiction at the top level (the level of ‘supreme’ court). These

separate specialist courts in commercial cases are less common than other types of separate
specialist courts in Europe.

113. Specialized courts are established to better respond to differences in the
procedural codes (commercial vs. civil procedural rules), or because administrative
processes and internal court rules are adjusted to better address the special needs of the
cases the courts handle. 78 Specialization of this kind means not only that a special institution or
individual will deal with this special type of case, but also that there may be differences in the
ways cases are treated. If these methods are regulated and prescribed by law, they may grow into
special procedural codes.

114. Separate court structures require specialized judges and their assisting staff (e.g.,
professionals with knowledge and training in specific areas). 79 It also assumes that users are
aware they are required to address the appropriate court, facing risks that their case will
otherwise be dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction, and that time will be lost transferring cases
between courts.

115. There is little evidence that establishing standalone courts improves the
processing of commercial cases any more so than specialized departments within courts.
For example, many countries enforce contracts quickly without any specialization. Iceland and
Lithuania (with a similar population to BiH 80) do not specialize commercial cases but are still
faster in enforcing contracts (417 and 300 days, respectively, versus 595 in BiH). Several Nordic
countries that have strong economies do not specialize in commercial cases and have low average
durations for contract enforcement. 81 On the other hand, Croatia (with an economy three times
larger than BiH) specializes commercial cases but contract enforcement time is only marginally
shorter at 572 days. 82

1.9.3    Mixed Models

116. Some countries have mixed models, notably Austria and Switzerland. Often, the
mixed model involves one or several specialized courts in the country’s economic centers, along
with specialized departments in courts of general jurisdiction in the rest of the country. For
example, in Austria, only the capital, Vienna, has specialized civil courts for commercial cases. 83
In all other districts, commercial cases are heard by commercial departments (Handelssenate)
within the courts of ordinary jurisdiction. In Switzerland, the Cantons of Aargau, Bern, St. Galen
and Zurich have each established a Commercial Court (Handelsgericht) to deal with national and
international commercial disputes in the first instance. In other Cantons, courts of general
jurisdiction are competent for commercial disputes. 84

80 Iceland’s GDP is also similar to that in BiH.
81 For example, Norway ranks 10th on the 2016 Doing Business report at 280 days, Sweden ranks 14th at 321 days,

and Finland ranks 23rd at 375 days.
82 According to the latest statistical yearbook for 2015 in Croatia, where standalone commercial courts exist, the

duration in commercial litigation was 324 days (288 in FBiH), while in the bankruptcy procedures 1304 days (420 in
FBiH). In Republika Srpska duration in commercial litigation was 789 in 2015.
83 These are the District Court for Commercial Matters (Bezirksgericht für Handelssachen) and the Vienna Commercial

Court (Handelsgericht Wien), which has the status of a regional court.

Options for Improving Commercial Case Processing in FBiH
117. Stakeholders agree that there are three policy options for improving commercial
case management in FBiH. The section below analyzes the constitutional, legislative,
operational, and financial implications of each option. The three options are:

     Option 1: Establish separate first-instance and second-instance Commercial Court in
     each Canton.
     Option 2: Establish separate first-instance courts in select Cantons and a second-instance
     commercial court at the level of FBiH.
     Option 3: Reorganize and strengthen existing commercial case departments without
     establishing separate structures.

     Commercial Courts in each Canton

                                                                established separate court structures
                                                                reveal little improvement in efficiency and
                                                                quality of services




1.10.1 Constitutional and Legislative Implications

118. This option would not require constitutional amendments, but would require
amendments to the FBiH Law on Courts. The FBiH Constitution allows for Municipal Courts to
be established for the territory of one or more municipalities. 85 The Law on Courts in FBiH would
require amendment to define the jurisdiction of the Municipal commercial courts.

119. Legislative amendments would also be required in each of the ten Cantons in FBiH.
The FBiH Constitution requires that the creation of Municipal Courts is regulated by Cantonal
legislation and funded from Cantonal budgets. So specialized commercial courts would need to
be included in each Canton’s legislation and aligned with the FBiH Constitution. This would be
costly and time consuming process and would require political consensus among all ten Cantons.


85Article VI.7. The FBiH Law on Courts has a similar article, Article 16, Official Journal No. 38/05, 22/06, 63/10,
72/10, 7/13, 52/14. So there is no legal obstacle to establishing one first-instance commercial court in the territory of
a whole Canton.




                                                           35
120. In addition, the HJPC’s decision on the number of judges would need to be amended
to include the number of judges in first-instance and second-instance commercial courts.
The decision of the Federal MOJ on the number of employees in courts would also require
amendment to provide staff for the commercial courts. 86

1.10.2 Operational and Financial Implications

121. Establishing a first-instance and second-instance Commercial Court in each Canton
is estimated to exceed 11 million BAM in the first year and 10 million BAM each year
thereafter. It is unclear whether FBiH budget or Cantonal budgets would provide funds for
establishment and functioning of newly established courts. The problem of funding was
highlighted during meetings with Ministries of Finance in the Cantons of Tuzla and Sarajevo, and
each made it clear that their Cantonal budgets cannot bear additional costs related to
establishment of commercial courts. Calculation of total costs is presented in Table 6.

judges and court staff. Based on the Law on High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council, the HJPC
determines the minimum number of judges required for functioning of a court. A Municipal Court
should have at least five judges and a Cantonal Court must have at least three judges. 88 Assuming
that Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica and Mostar would need a larger number of judges than the others,
then up to 105 judges would be required under the Option 1. If judges from the existing
commercial departments are moved to the new specialized courts, the impact on the wage bill
under the Option 1 would be significantly lower. However, Court Presidents consulted during the
Study were adamant that they would have to hire new judges to fill positions vacated by judges
who are moved to the specialized courts. In the latter case, the HJPC would need to amend the
decision on the number of judges in FBiH. The fiscal impact of implementation of Option 1 on the
wage bill for judges is estimated at 5.45 million BAM (see Table 7). 89

87 Calculations presented in this study are based on nominal value and are not adjusted to inflation.
88 This figure of five judges in Municipal Courts is not regulated by legislation, but is based on a minimum number

required for a court to function and respect procedural requirements.
89 The calculation presented here is conservative and does not include allowances and other elements of pay.

123. However, there is insufficient work to support commercial courts in every Canton.
Cantons other than Sarajevo, Tuzla, and to a lesser extent Zenica and Mostar, do not have
sufficient caseloads to justify the establishment of specialized first and second instance courts. So
workloads for these judges would be far below the standards of the Framework Criteria.

124. Court staffing would also need to increase. The most recent Rulebook for determining
the number of court staff in FBiH, from 2003, stipulates that the ratio of staff to judges in
Municipal Courts should be 3:1 while in Cantonal Courts it should be 2.5:1. 91 In practice, according
to the 2015 HJPC report, in Municipal Courts the ratio of staff to judges was 3.5:1, approximately
17 percent above the norm. 92 In Cantonal Courts, the overall ratio of staff to judges is 2.5:1, in
accordance with the norm. However, in those Cantonal Courts that have commercial departments,
the ratio is lower than the norm, at 2.24:1. The norms were used to calculate the fiscal impact on
the wage bill for court staff. The difference in ratios between the Cantonal Courts and Municipal
Courts is presented in Tables 8 and 9. The ratios in Cantonal Courts and Municipal Courts that
have commercial departments is shown in the Figure 11 and Figure 12 below.

125. The average monthly wage of court staff in Cantonal Courts with commercial
departments is 1,193 BAM, while in Municipal Courts it is 1,123 BAM. Court staff are hired
as civil servants by Cantonal governments and their wages vary significantly. Wages of court staff
in cantons are regulated by different wage bill laws. The difference in wages of court staff in
Municipal Courts and Cantonal Courts are shown in Figures 13 and 14.

126. The impact on the wage bill for court staff is estimated to exceed 4.72 million BAM
per annum. 93 Based on the calculation of average wages and ratios of court staff to judges, the
team assesses that specialized commercial courts under Option 1 would require the hiring of an
additional 266 staff in first-instance courts and 68 staff in second-instance courts.

127. There would also be infrastructure costs, as there is little available space in existing
courts to house these new courts. In some Cantons, there are available facilities, but facilities
would require renovation. Another option would be to rent office space, however this would be
difficult in smaller Cantons. The Study was unable to assess the total amount of office space
required, but price ranges indicate that this would be costly (see Table 11).

128. These new personnel would require training. All newly appointed judges should carry
out eight days of introductory training during their first year, as specified by the CJPT Induction
and Professional Development Training Program for 2016. In addition, induction training for
legal associates and advisors takes place in 12 two-day modules over the course of three years.
An estimated 131,000 BAM would be needed for induction training, plus 92,000 BAM for
specialized training for the additional 105 judges and 21 legal associates in the first year of new
specialized courts, and then 92,000 BAM every year for their continuous development (Table 12
presents these calculations). For the induction training for legal associates and advisors, an
additional 23,000 BAM would be required in the second and third year of operation. These
minimum training costs are based on the assumption that the new judges and staff will participate
in the training program as prescribed by the CJPT Training Program and that an additional five
days of specialized training will be provided to strengthen their capacity in commercial matters.
To improve the pedagogic effects of the training, testing of knowledge and skills acquired (in a
form of case study) should be organized for both induction and specialized courses.

131. Such a significant reform also carries a range of transaction costs. Experience from
other jurisdictions shows that productivity and efficiency in a court decreases from the moment
that a transfer of competence is announced to when it is executed, which is often more than one
year. In addition, new courts would need time to focus on organizational and logistical issues
before becoming fully functional. Commercial case files would also need to be physically
transferred and cases reallocated among judges and staff.

94This estimation is based on the current ratios of judges and staff to it devices in Cantonal Courts (0.04 for scanners
and 1 for all other devices) and the average market price of ICT equipment in FBiH.


                                                           43
1.11.1 Constitutional and Legislative Implications

132. Option 2 requires Constitutional and legislative amendments. The FBiH Constitution
does not recognize the possibility of transferring competence from one Canton to another. 95
Therefore, amendment to the FBiH Constitution would be required to establish Cantonal
commercial courts competent for several Cantons, along with amendments to the Law on Courts.
Constitutional amendments would also be required to establish a second-instance commercial
court at the Federation level. 96

133. To avoid further Constitutional amendments, a second-instance commercial court
could be established as a special department of the Supreme Court of FBiH. However,
experience with the 2014 Law on Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime demonstrated
that this is not easy. That law envisaged a new department within the Federal Prosecutor Office
and FBiH Supreme Court, but a lack of resources caused several postponements in
implementation and this department is still not operational. The Administration for Management
of Seizure Assets is facing similar challenges in operation.

1.11.2 Operational and Financial Implications

134. Establishing first-instance courts in selected Cantons and a second-instance
Commercial Court at the level of FBiH is costly. Based on the number and location of incoming
cases, Option 2 would require up to 4 first-instance commercial courts in FBiH (in Sarajevo, Tuzla,
Zenica and Mostar). If newly established courts are staffed with new judges and staff, total cost is
estimated to be 10.5 million BAM in the first year and 9.7 million every year thereafter. In case
that judges and staff are transferred to new courts and vacant positions in the courts of general
jurisdictional are not filled, the estimate is 4.3 million BAM in first year and 4 million every year
thereafter (see Table 15).

95 Article V.2 of the Constitution recognize possibility to transfer Cantonal competence to municipality or town at own
territory or to federal Government.
96 Article C.1 states the judicial functions in the Federation shall be exercised by the courts specified in the

Constitution itself. Currently, the only courts at the level of the Federation are the Constitutional Court and the
Supreme Court.

135. The Federation and the various Cantons would need to develop a cost-sharing
arrangement to finance this expense, which is theoretically possible but unlikely. Such cost-
sharing arrangements have been attempted in FBiH in the past, but each time have broken down.
For example, in the health sector, several Cantonal ministries of health had agreed to share the
costs of a tertiary medical center, noting that such a facility provides an essential life-saving
service but is not needed in every Canton. Although an agreement was reached, not all Cantons
have contributed their allocations and the center has accumulated large arrears that impact
service delivery. Following consultations with a number of ministries of finance at Cantonal level,
the team concludes that such an arrangement is not feasible in the case of commercial courts.

136. Assuming the challenges above could be overcome, the fiscal impact of
implementation of Option 2 on the wage bill for judges is estimated at between 2.4 and 5.2
million BAM. The calculation depends on whether the four newly established courts would be
staffed with new judges or judges who are already working on commercial cases will transfer to
new courts. 97 The Study concludes that it is highly unlikely that judges and staff would transfer.
Such transfers would require extensive coordination among HJPC, the MOJs and MOFs of Cantons
and Court Presidents. Court Presidents, in particular, would likely resist the transfer or would fill
the resulting vacancies. Furthermore, the decision on precisely which judges and staff should
transfer is not straightforward because HJPC data does not readily distinguish between judges
who work exclusively on commercial cases and judges who may work on only one commercial
case per year. This option would also require amendment to the HJPC’s decision on the number
of judges in FBiH. The impact of implementation of Option 2 under both scenarios is presented in
Table 16.




97Based on the anticipated workload, the first-instance Commercial Court in Sarajevo would have 25 judges, Tuzla
would have 20, Zenica would have 15 and Mostar up to 10 judges who would work exclusively on commercial cases.
However, if vacant positions are filled by judges from the Commercial Departments in existing courts, the first-
instance commercial court in Sarajevo would then need to recruit only 7 new judges, Mostar and Tuzla would need
additional 2, while Zenica would have to hire 1 more judge. The second-instance commercial court at the level of the
FBiH would employ up to 30 judges. In this scenario, the impact on the wage bill is approximately 2.4 million BAM.

137. Under Option 2, the impact on the wage bill for court staff is estimated at between
1.5 and 4.4 million BAM. 99 Using the same calculation for court staff as for Option 1, the
implementation of Option 2 would require hiring of additional 247 staff in the first-instance
courts and 67 staff in the second-instance court. In case that court staff already working on
commercial cases are transferred to new courts additional 42 staff in first-instance court would
be required. Calculations are presented in Table 17.

138. Investment in ICT under Option 2 is estimated between 250,000 to 700,000 BAM,
pending on whether ICT will be purchased for all new employees or just for additional
judges and court staff. This includes procurement of computers with operating systems,
monitors, uninterruptible power supply (UPSs), and printers for all additional 414 judges and
staff together with 17 scanners under the first alternative. Under the second alternative this

139. Implementation of Option 2 would also require the renovation of existing facilities
or leasing of new facilities. Prices for leased office space range from 13 BAM/m2 in Mostar to
29 BAM/m2 in Sarajevo.

140. Investment in training an additional 100 judges and 20 legal associates in the first
year of new specialized courts would exceed 200,000 BAM, and additional 88,500 BAM
would be required annually for their continued professional development. 100 If 42 judges
and nine legal associates are hired, in the first year of specialization courts would need 150,000
BAM. An additional 88,500 BAM would be required for continuous professional development.
Implementation of the remaining eight modules of CJPT induction training for 20 legal associates
would require additional 45,000 BAM, while for nine legal associates would require 28,500 BAM.

1.12.1 Constitutional and Legislative Implications

141. Option 3 would not require constitutional amendments. The Law on Courts in the
FBiH regulates commercial departments within Municipal Courts and their territorial and
material competence. 101 In addition, the Court Rulebook allows courts to establish court
departments where three of more judges can decide on matters within the same or related legal
fields.

142. Amendments to laws and bylaws to ensure the specialization of judges in
commercial departments should be considered. According to the Court Rulebook the Court
President adopts the annual schedule of judges and judicial assistants, associates and advisers. 102

1.12.2 Operational and Financial Implications

143. Reorganizing and strengthening existing commercial case departments would
require an investment of 1.65 million BAM in the first year and up to 4 million BAM in Year
4. Four year financial projections are presented in Table 20.

144. The impact on the wage bill would be more manageable than under Options 1 or 2.
The HJPC has estimated that an additional 79 judges would be required, all other things being
equal, to deal with the incoming cases and to support backlog reduction (see Table 21). 103 The
analysis assumes that procedures and practices in managing the commercial caseload would
remain as they have been in the past, including with the various problems identified in the
analysis above.

145. Rather than 79 judges, the Study assesses that up to 40 new judges may be needed,
together with a package of reforms to improve case management. Based on the analysis in
the previous sections, reforms in case management have the ability to produce more significant
improvements in performance than adding more judges to the same system. Reforms are likely
to have the greatest impacts in the areas of business registration, enforcement small claims and
bankruptcy. Procedural reforms can also ease bottlenecks in case processing, as outlined above.
Greater delegations of cases between judges and courts should also be investigated to build more
flexibility into the system for distributing caseloads.


  The criteria on which the calculation is based include the average influx of these cases for the period 2013 – 2015,
103

and the average annual indicative quota according to the manners of disposition in the period 2013 – 2015.

146. Also, it should be noted that it is neither feasible nor desirable to hire 80 judges in
the short term in FBiH. Given the relatively small size of FBiH labor market and the
requirements for appointment as a judge, it is not possible to attract a sufficient number of high-
quality candidates. Such a reform would likely undermine the aims of improving quality and
efficiency in dealing with these cases.

147. The appointment of up to 40 new judges should be phased over four years. First,
courts should encourage existing judges to move to commercial departments within the same
court. Under this Option, transfers would be easier to manage because many of them could be
internal transfers from within the same court. Efforts should focus on courts where case demand
is highest. After transfers have been exhausted, the Bank estimates that up to 15 judges may be
required in 2017, another 15 in 2018, and the remaining 10 would be recruited in 2019. Further
analysis is needed to determine precise numbers of judges to be appointed in each location. This
phased approach would also enable the HJPC to monitor results before further resources are
invested. The impact on the wage bill of this approach is presented in the Table 23.

149. Option 3 would require investment in ICT equipment of approximately 300,000
BAM. This includes procurement of computers with operating systems, monitors, UPSs, and
printers for all additional 181 judges and staff, and 7 scanners, as shown in the Table 27. As with
the other options, this estimation is based on current average ratios of judges and staff to it

  150. Option 3 would require a total investment of 260,000 BAM for induction and
  specialized training program for the first 4 years. An investment of 46,500 BAM for training
  additional judges and legal associates in year one, 69,000 BAM in the year two, additional 84,500
  BAM in the year 3 and 56,000 BAM in year 4. Additional 36,400 BAM will be required for the
  continuous development each year thereafter. See Table 26.

 151. A more systematic approach to training is needed. Option 3 would require the
 development of a Training Needs Assessment (TNA) to outline additional specialized trainings
 for both judges and court staff. The TNA should map a program of continuous professional
 development for employees in commercial departments and focus on the skills and management
 of commercial cases. The TNA will look at the existing training program delivered through the
 CJPT and other training programs for commercial court judges available in the region. The TNA
 should be prepared by an external partner in cooperation with the HJPC and CJPT. Based on the
 Bank’s experience with similar assignments in other countries, a TNA would cost approximately



                                                       53
200,000 BAM and take six months. Consideration should also be given to requiring all judges in
commercial departments to participate in training and become accredited. Accreditation could
then feed the algorithm for random case assignment in the CMS.

152. Placing additional judges and court staff in existing commercial cases departments
would require either renovating available facilities or renting offices, as there is no
available space in the existing courts. Renting office space would be very difficult in some
smaller Cantons and municipalities and also expensive due to high costs of leasing office space.


Conclusions on Feasibility of Improving Commercial Case Processing

153. Below is a brief summary of the implications of each option and an assessment of
its feasibility. The study concludes that Option 1 and 2 are not feasible and that Option 3 is
feasible.

154. Option 1 - Establishing first-instance and second-instance Commercial Courts in each
Canton - is not a feasible solution for FBiH. No constitutional amendment would be required.
However, this option would require extensive legislative amendments at the Federal level and in
each Canton. Operationally, the intensity of effort needed to implement this option in a Federation
of just over 2 million people is not warranted. Dozens of courts would need to be created, and an
additional 300+ judges and staff hired, along with intensive investments in ICT and infrastructure.
There is not sufficient workload to justify the effort required. Financially, this option is neither
viable nor sustainable. The fiscal impact on the wage bill for judges is estimated at 5.45 million
BAM and for court staff at 4.72 million BAM. Significant funding would also be required to build
new courts or lease office space. These investments are beyond the capacity of the Federal and
various Cantonal budgets to absorb. Court expenditure in BiH is already higher than EU and CEPEJ
averages, at approximately 0.85 percent of GDP, which suggests that stakeholders should select
an option offering better value for money. Furthermore, lessons from comparator states show
little evidence that the establishment of separate commercial courts would ensure significantly
better efficiency and quality of commercial case processing. Finally, none of the justice sector
stakeholders interviewed for this feasibility study advocated for Option 1, so significant reform
effort and change management would be required to generate the political will to ensure its
implementation.

155. Option 2 - Establishing first-instance courts in selected Cantons and a second-
instance commercial court at the level of FBiH - is also not a feasible solution for FBiH. This
option would require Constitutional amendments, which is a difficult and protracted process.
Option 2 would also require legislative amendments at the Federal and Cantonal levels.
Operationally, this Option requires close and continued coordination, cost-sharing and
personnel-sharing among the Cantons. This has failed in FBiH in the past and is unlikely to
succeed in this case. Financially, this option would likely be as expensive as Option 1, given that
the transferal of judges and staff would likely be difficult to coordinate between stakeholders and
strongly resisted by courts of general jurisdiction. As with Option 1, the cost of renovation,
refurbishment, or leasing of office space would be high, and there is insufficient evidence that
separate court structures would significantly improve efficiency or quality of commercial case
processing. The Study concludes that it is not feasible in FBiH at this time.

156. Option 3 - Reorganizing and strengthening existing commercial case departments
without establishing separate court structures - is the most feasible solution for FBiH.
Option 3 would require only minor amendments to procedural laws to enable the equal
distribution and delegation of cases between Cantons and the accreditation of specialist
commercial judges. Operationally, this option has the highest likelihood of improving the


                                                54
efficiency and quality of work because it focuses on the substantive work involved in processing
commercial cases and targets the key bottlenecks through better management, more systematic
training, and incentives for performance. This option includes a comprehensive TNA and the
delivery of specialized commercial training programs for judges and staff in commercial
departments, leading to an elite accreditation as commercial specialists. Option 3 causes the least
upheaval, and implementation could start immediately. Furthermore, all justice sector
stakeholders consulted for this Study support this option, which suggests it requires the least
amount of political capital and change management, and has a higher likelihood of being
successful. Financially, the medium-term cost of this option would be manageable. Hiring
additional judges and court staff, with a phased approach, would cost 1.6 million BAM in the first
year, and approximately 3 to 4 million BAM each year thereafter. This option would require some
additional investment in court infrastructure; however, infrastructure costs would be lower than
under the other options. Ultimately, Option 3 is the easiest to implement and the most cost
effective available.


Recommendations and Next Steps

157. Implementation of Option 3 would require an integrated package of reform measures that
are time bound. Actions would need to be implemented in their entirety to be fully effective.

1.13 Strengthen Commercial Departments in Municipal Courts in FBiH

158. Strengthening commercial departments would require undertaking a series of measures
to ensure they have the capacity to resolve commercial cases in a timely manner and with high
quality within the existing organizational model. This includes ensuring a sufficient number of
dedicated and trained judges and legal associates, along with closer monitoring of backlog
reduction plans and case law harmonization tools.

159. Over the next 18 months, the following steps should be taken, led by the HJPC in
coordination with the courts and MOJs in FBiH:
   a. Strengthen the managerial role of Presidents of commercial departments. Stop the
       periodic rotations of judges in and out of those departments to enable departments to
       develop a cadre of commercial specialists. Revise, analyze and strengthen backlog
       reduction plans for commercial cases.
   b. Analyze unequal caseload distribution, review rules on the delegation of cases, and
       prepare amendments to procedural rules to enable swift delegation of cases between
       Cantons. Within courts, review the distribution of tasks and responsibilities between
       judges, legal associates, court bailiffs, and clerks/typists, ensuring that administrative and
       procedural work is effectively delegated to non-judge staff.
   c. Strengthen the role of the FBiH Supreme Court commercial department in issuing legal
       standpoints, and further refine the case law database.
   d. Review the existing allocation of judges to cases and offer incentives to judges to move to
       commercial departments. Appoint new judges for the remaining vacancies. Investigate
       the possibility of (temporary or permanent) relocation of judges to more burdened court
       locations.

1.14 Fast-Track the Resolution of Small Disputes

160. More could be done to fast-track the resolution of small claims in FBiH. A rudimentary
system exists, but it does not operate well and processing times for small claims are longer than




                                                 55
for other cases. Several EU member states have adopted high-performing systems for the fast and
fair resolution of small claims, lessons from these States should be applied to FBiH.

161. Over the next 18 months, the following steps should be taken, led by the HJPC but in
coordination with the courts and MOJs in FBiH:
   a. Analyze bottlenecks in processing small claims cases;
   b. Identify lessons from EU member states in small claims processing (including possible
       study tours to Estonia, the U.K. and Denmark);
   c. Adopt a model to further fast-track small claims processing;
   d. Prepare amendments to procedural law;
   e. Roll out changes in procedure and practice and deliver training for providers; and
   f. Implement an information campaign and guide to raise awareness among small
       businesses of fast-track procedures.

1.15 Incentivize Performance

162. There is a wealth of research on the role of incentives in public sector performance,
including how institutions can boost performance by rewarding teams through non-financial
awards and recognition. Applying these lessons, the judiciary in FBiH could do more to recognize
and incentivize better performance of Municipal and Cantonal Courts. Awards programs vary but
often require little or no legislative change and can be implemented consistently with ethical
rules. Programs require reliable and objective data, which the HJPC has through the CMS, and only
a small budget for prizes and dissemination costs. The World Bank team can share know-how and
recent lessons from comparator countries.

163. Over the next 12 months, the following steps should be taken, led by the HJPC but in
coordination with the courts and MOJs in FBiH:
   a. Analyze recent global innovations in incentivizing court performance;
   b. Design a rewards program that recognizes and incentivizes performance in Municipal and
       Cantonal Courts based on CMS data;
   c. Prepare and pass a decision of the HJPC to adopt the rewards program; and
   d. Launch the inaugural rewards program.

1.16 Develop and Deliver a High-Quality Training Program for Commercial
     Judges

164. Comprehensive and high-quality training should be provided to judges and associates
working in the commercial departments. First, a training needs analysis should be conducted
using a problem-solving approach which analyses common issues of appeal and causes for case
overturn, as well as reviews law and procedure and consults with judges, attorneys, businesses,
bankruptcy trustees, and expert witnesses. Based on the training needs analysis, a curriculum
and learning tools should be developed, adopted, and delivered. That training should then be
compulsory for all judges and associates working in the commercial departments.

165. Over the next 18 months, the following steps should be taken, led by the CJPT in FBiH in
coordination with the HJPC, courts and MOJs in FBiH:
   a. Conduct a training needs analysis for commercial departments;
   b. Develop curriculum and learning tools;
   c. Launch the inaugural training program;
   d. Prepare and pass amendments to procedural laws requiring that from 2018 judges in
       commercial departments must be accredited through training.

1.17 Close Procedural Loopholes and Ease Bottlenecks in Case Processing

166. As outlined above, delays and inconsistency in decision-making are exacerbated by a
range of procedural inefficiencies that could be resolved through targeted reform.

167. Over the next 12 months, the following steps should be taken, led by the MOJ of FBiH in
coordination with the HJPC and courts:
   a. Review the court fee schedule for commercial cases and propose revisions; develop a fee
       calculator that can help parties to estimate their likely costs;
   b. Review existing regulation for expert witnesses and bankruptcy trustees, including their
       methods of appointment, oversight and sanctions, and mechanisms to improve the
       efficiency and quality of their services. Identify reform opportunities, applying lessons
       from EU good practice;
   c. Consider models and policy options to improve the efficiency and quality of bailiff
       services;
   d. Review business processes and rules for the scheduling of court hearings, and identify
       opportunities to reduce the number of adjournments and impose procedural time limits;
   e. Prepare recommendations for amendments to procedural law and practice.

168. Policymakers in RS may also wish to consider adapting and implementing a subset of the
reform measures proposed for FBiH above. In particular, reform in RS could focus on measures
that improve case management, incentivize performance, strengthen training, close procedural
loopholes and ease bottlenecks. The implementation of such reform measures could strengthen
the performance of existing Commercial Courts in RS.

Annex 1: Methodology
This study was conducted by the World Bank Global Governance Practice in consultation with
justice sector stakeholders across BiH. The team conducted a desk review of existing qualitative
and quantitative analyses on justice reform and the business climate in BiH, examined regional
and international practices and lessons learned, and drew on empirical studies of court
specialization. The team collected and analyzed quantitative data, including from case
management systems in close collaboration with the HJPC and training data from the CJPT.
Economic and demographic data was also collected and analyzed. Semi-structured interviews
were conducted with approximately 60 stakeholders from the FBiH and RS. (A partial list of
stakeholders consulted is at Annex 2.) In addition to interviews, the Bank, in collaboration with
the American Chamber of Commerce in BiH, also conducted a small survey of businesses to gauge
their views and experiences with commercial cases in FBiH courts. The survey comprised 16
questions and was completed by nine businesses.

The Study analyzed three scenarios:

   -   Option 1: Establish separate first-instance and second-instance commercial court in each
       Canton;
   -   Option 2: Establish separate first-instance courts in select Cantons and a second-instance
       commercial court at the level of FBiH;
   -   Option 3: Reorganize and strengthen existing commercial case departments without
       establishing separate structures.

The team analyzed the constitutional, legal, operational and financial implications of each
scenario, as well as its associated opportunities and risks.

Stakeholders were consulted on the structure of the report, the development of the scenarios and
the substance of the analysis. Stakeholders were invited to provide comments on an earlier draft
of this report, and feedback was considered in finalizing this report.
