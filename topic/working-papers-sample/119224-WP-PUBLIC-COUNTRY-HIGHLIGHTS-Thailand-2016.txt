                                  team reveal what businesses and firms experience across the world by interviewing representative samples of the formal, non-agricultural, non-extractive, private
                                  sector with 5 employees or more. The resulting globally comparable firm-level data is used to construct business environment indicators and measure firm
                                  performance. The findings and recommendations help policy makers identify, prioritize, and implement policy reforms that support efficient private economic activity.
