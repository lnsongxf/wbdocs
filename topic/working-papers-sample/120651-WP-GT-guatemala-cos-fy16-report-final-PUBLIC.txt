I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Guatemala perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Guatemala
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Guatemala
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From March to April 2016, 367 stakeholders of the WBG in Guatemala were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 279 stakeholders participated in
the survey (76% response rate).
Some respondents received and returned the questionnaires via mail or email. Other respondents
filled out the questionnaire with a representative from the independent fielding agency.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Guatemala; their overall attitudes toward
the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Guatemala; and the WBG’s communication
and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate was 69%, N=62). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’13 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, and E. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown
and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix D (page 87).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister were
       combined with respondents from the office of a minister; respondents from PMUs and
       consultants were combined; respondents from the financial sector/private banks were
       combined with those from private sector organizations; respondents from NGOs/CBOs,

report are questions that are asked in every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey.
These will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.

The World Bank Group’s Overall Effectiveness (Indicator Question)
      Respondents gave significantly higher ratings for the effectiveness of the WBG than that
       of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration and Latin American

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Guatemala,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty one
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Guatemala. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at food security;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at health; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at anti corruption.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Guatemala, suggesting that ratings
       of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The area determined to be key driver from these
       analyses was:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at health;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at information and communications technology; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 57  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 272

By weighting, the FY 2013 data has the same stakeholder composition as it is in FY 2016. Therefore, the two years
are comparable. Respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies, financial sector/private banks, trade unions,
faith-based groups, youth groups, and the judiciary branch were not included in the year comparison analysis,
because there were respondents from these groups in either only one year or neither years. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

development in Guatemala or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey will give the World Bank Group’s team that works in Guatemala, greater insight into how the Bank’s work
is perceived. This is one tool the World Bank Group uses to assess the views of its stakeholders, and to develop
more effective strategies that support development in Guatemala.

A local independent firm has been hired to oversee the logistics of this survey. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid.

MIGA, and ICSID. When responding to the survey, please consider the area of the World Bank Group with which
you are most familiar.

 following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Guatemala? (Choose no more
 than TWO)
