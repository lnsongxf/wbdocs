Executive Summary

Context

This Jordan Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) represents the considered assessment by the
World Bank Group (WBG) of the most important constraints to Jordan’s sustainable achievement
of the twin goals of absolute poverty reduction and improved welfare of the lower 40 percent of the
income distribution. The SCD was prepared during 2014-15 and benefitted from interaction with a
concurrent blueprint exercise being undertaken by the Government of Jordan, the Jordan 2025 strategy.
From the vantage point of the WBG country operational model, the SCD provides the analytical base for
the design of the WBG’s next Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Jordan, which will cover the
period 2017-2022. From the vantage point of the Government and its external partners, the SCD seeks to
offer a comprehensive assessment of developmental constraints which is available to everyone for use in
designing their own interventions. Indeed, given the wide scope of the SCD, it is virtually inevitable that
alleviating some binding constraints will be beyond the scope of the WBG.

It is important to note that as a WBG diagnostic, the SCD incorporates the private sector oriented
insights of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA), as well as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) i.e.
the WBG’s operational and advisory services arm for interactions with the government. In addition
to this broad base, the SCD is intended to reflect analytical insights gained from interaction with a range of
stakeholders during consultations, including with ministries, the Parliament, academia, and the Jordanian
diaspora.

A Risk-Rents Equilibrium

The starting point of the SCD is recognition of Jordan’s exceptionally high exposure to exogenous
shocks, arising from its location and historical role in the MENA region, which is encapsulated in the
Syrian crisis. These shocks arise through spillovers from regional conflict, most recently from Syria and
Iraq, commodity prices, and shifts in geopolitical relations. The shocks have magnified effect when
absorbed in Jordan due to its small size and proximity to major disturbances: when some relief valves are
closed, others have to carry even more weight. Jordan’s location and endowment also give rise to slower-
to-develop vulnerabilities in areas such as water resources and climate change.

The first critical point of the SCD’s macroeconomic assessment is to recognize that this high exposure
to negative shocks has not resulted in below average economic outcomes for Jordan. In fact, relative
to its tumultuous experience of the 1980s, Jordan could be considered a success story. During that decade,
a prolonged period of low oil prices and a high fiscal burden resulted in the fiscal and exchange rate crisis
of 1988-89 which mutated into severe domestic political tensions in response to austerity measures and the
outdated representative structure of the then parliament. However, since 1990 (to 2014), real GDP growth
averaged 4.9 percent, associated with per capita GDP growth of 2.2 percent. Political institutions are far
deeper than they were in the 1980s, and society has proven resilient to several waves of difficult reforms
and shocks since then.



                                                      ii
So if the issue is not generating an apparently adequate level of growth, what is it? As a practical
matter, growth during the next 5 years is projected to be in the 3-4 percent range i.e. a slowdown relative
to the pre-2011 average, and barely enough to generate per capita growth. In fact, growth in 2015 has been
even slower, as the complete closure of trade routes to the north and east took its toll. Even for the previous
higher average, this needs to be placed in global context: per capita growth of around 2 percent is precisely
the long-run global country average identified by Pritchett and Summers (2014). This rate of growth may
be sufficient to generate prosperity if sustained for a very long period of time. But with the crisis of the
1980s having set back Jordan’s GDP level for some time, an inability to generate sustained growth
accelerations since then, and some risk of economic crisis relapse (such as surfaced in 2011), even a quarter
century of solid growth is not enough to have enabled a “Tiger” like transformation of Jordan’s economy.

A striking feature of growth in Jordan is that it has not led to significant private sector job creation
of positions held by nationals. The employment elasticity of growth dropped from 1.16 during 1990-99
to 0.53 during 2000-09. Increases in productivity which occurred in few emerging knowledge–intensive
sectors (ICT, health, financial services, etc.) have proved difficult to scale up, and are certainly not big
enough to absorb the youth bulge. Productivity remained low in labor-intensive sectors, leading to the
creation of low-wage low-skills jobs that do not appeal to Jordanians and were filled by foreign workers
(refugees or migrants from poorer neighboring countries).

The SCD’s macroeconomic, poverty, and sustainability assessments reinforce the perspective that
business-as-usual economic performance will not be enough to regain past performance, let alone
reach the 7.5 percent growth in the targeted scenario of Jordan 2025. SCD findings include an inability
to sustain growth accelerations, a very small export base, persistent fiscal and external balances, and
bottlenecks contributing to a trend decline in investment as a share of GDP. The public debt has risen
through several “red lines” and its scope for any further buffering of shocks is gone, especially with the
financing needs arising from the Syrian crisis. Regarding poverty, the assessment emphasizes the fragility
of Jordan’s low headcount poverty (around 14 percent): one third of the population experiences transitions
into poverty during a year, and lower quintile household expenditures will be squeezed by (needed)
adjustments in energy and transport costs. Furthermore, although access to social sector services is high,
there is considerable variability in quality due to financing and delivery mechanisms, especially in health.

Strains on social sustainability, deepened by the Syrian crisis, are at the confluence of these
difficulties. The fiscal burden of the existing socio-political bargain is increasingly challenging. But if that
socio-political bargain is revisited, for example in terms of its access to public sector jobs and subsidies as
key elements of the government-citizen relations, then fissures in society will become harder to contain.
Elements of this can already be seen in alienation of youth, especially in the lagging regions of the country
outside Amman.

The critical point is that, as with most types of risk, the risks facing Jordan are associated with
opportunity: the possibility of gain. For Jordan, the possibility of gain arises from a demonstrated ability
to mobilize around some reforms and its distinctive role in the Middle East as a country that has remained
politically stable despite having to absorb spillovers from shocks originating in its neighbors. The interest
of western countries in underpinning stability and helping Jordan mitigate spillovers has generated sizable
grant and below-market debt financing for the government, which can be deployed to ease the cost of



                                                      iii
needed economic reforms. In addition, to Jordan’s south, in the GCC, is the world’s most oil-rich region.
The development of oil wealth in the GCC has created beneficial effects for Jordan in terms of remittances,
consumption and investment flows, and official grant support.

Historically, Jordan has defined the opportunity arising from its regional role in terms of access to
financial flows from abroad. The key implication of these flows is that Jordan is earning geopolitical
rents: a financial return to its status and stability role in the region which far exceeds the cost of any
economic activities associated with that status. These flows are thus analogous to a natural resource rent in
that they will permit a level of expenditure that can persistently exceed the output of economic activities
within Jordan. In fact, since a portion of these flows originate in the GCC and are thus financed by oil,
Jordan is an indirect recipient of a classic natural resource rent.

Although these rents are of course beneficial to Jordan, the standard side effects will apply. Income
from rents will be spent in various sectors, including non-traded goods, the price of non-tradables will rise,
and there will be a real exchange rate appreciation which will impede the competitiveness of the traded
goods sector. The essential point: Jordan receives inflows based on an intangible and volatile but highly
valuable asset and is located in a resource rich region which values that asset. Thus we should expect to see
elements of rentier behavior and Dutch Disease.

However, Jordan is not simply a passive recipient of rents and absorber of shocks. The country has a
complex and nuanced domestic political equilibrium which is partly a product of past shocks, but also a
means of coping with them. This political equilibrium goes back to Jordan’s post-1948 compact between
incumbent citizens and the subsequent waves of migration. Part of the coping strategy was a large public
sector which provided needed services to forced migrants while public sector jobs, including in the security
sector, were used to insulate host communities. This led to a tacit job segmentation between incumbent
citizens in the public sector, while migrants sought livelihoods in the private sector. As a result of a rigid
business climate and the presence of dominant family trading companies in commercial sectors, these latter
opportunities were often in the informal sector.

Over time, fiscal constraints made it infeasible for the public sector to absorb all incumbent
Jordanians, while the emerging private sector proved resilient to volatile economic conditions, yet
constrained by factors to be discussed later in the SCD. The result is that the society’s original
occupational segmentation between two different groups has given way to an amorphous middle class
including public sector workers, especially in the administrative layer, employees and proprietors of smaller
firms in the business sector, and longer-term migrant residents (1948 and 1967 refugees and most recently
from Iraq and Syria) who have built livelihoods in the country. The dynamics of this social composition are
imposing increasing strain on the traditional social compact, not least because the grievances of the new
“median voter” are a mix of issues. Indeed, a sense of lack of meaningful choice over critical issues, despite
the growing power of Parliament, has given rise to political apathy which, for the case of youth, risks
deteriorating into alienation.

Having laid out the political economy of rents and social structure in Jordan, the SCD then builds up
two hypotheses which structure the analysis of constraints. The first hypothesis is that Jordan does not
manage risk as effectively as it could, at the level of government, households, or firms. The second is that



                                                     iv
there are major distortions in the functioning of markets for labor and capital, which impede the economy’s
ability to create high productivity job opportunities. Each hypothesis is founded in the preceding discussion
of rents and risk, and deepened by mobilizing the World Bank sector knowledge.

Hypothesis 1: Management of risk

The first hypothesis is the counterpart to the SCD’s focus on Jordan’s coping mechanisms for the
shocks that it faces. It postulates that because of an overreliance on government access to official flows
and below-market debt to manage volatility, Jordan has experienced negative consequences from shocks
that could have been avoided, and has failed to fully capitalize on positive opportunities associated with
these shocks. Since risk is not offset or efficiently shared, households, firms, and the government are bearing
excess risk.

The SCD argues that this excess risk and associated caution is pervasive and provides a unifying
explanation for why problems tend to persist despite progress in certain areas such as the energy
sector and privatization. Decision makers at most levels of government are prone to a short-term and
tactical approach; firms are reluctant to invest; banks are cautious to lend; households are reluctant to seek
economic participation options besides a public sector job. Yet other economies, including in MENA, do
succeed in taking decisions that enhance growth or efficiency, even if these actions have downside risks.
Jordan’s risk appetite seemed to worsen around the time of the global financial crisis (whose knock-on
effect had a large impact on property prices and fiscal revenues) and escalated with the onset of the Arab
Spring.

Why does Jordan exhibit more policy inertia than most? The SCD argues that the answer is rents. These
rents are like a natural resource flow in terms of their domestic economic and political effects, including by
reducing the incentive for taxation and accountability. But they also resemble state-contingent payments to
Jordan, where the events that trigger the payments are somewhat beyond Jordan’s control – major events
in other countries in the region, altered geopolitical calculations, and the price of oil. Indeed, these payments
are a type of insurance: as a rule, they increase when Jordan’s circumstances are worse. As such, these
payments are a disincentive to take complete protective actions against predictable risks (“moral hazard”).

The fundamental cost of the way that rents and the socio-political bargain have reinforced each other
is through a reactive approach to shocks. The relationship between Jordan and its partners – as a
relationship between sovereign states – does not permit precise micro-management and measurement of
the type and cost of shocks which hit Jordan. It is therefore intrinsic to the quasi-insurance characteristic of
these payments that Jordan does not have the incentive to minimize the total cost of adverse events, because
“insurance” will bear some of the cost. At the level of policy, this means the postponement of reforms
which could help reduce exposure to the impact from negative shocks in expectation of ex post partner
financial support. These reforms are in any case difficult due to the domestic political compact discussed
above. But whereas in other countries, the cost of non-reform may rise to a point where action becomes the
preferred option (e.g. with an incipient fiscal crisis), Jordan’s access to external support precisely in the
case of adverse events weakens this weighting of the cost of pre-emptive action compared to ex post
adjustment smoothed by grants.




                                                       v
However, the risk management perspective goes beyond the influence of rents on national strategy.
At the government level, the electricity sector provides a stark example of how foreseeable risks from lack
of diversification of fuel sources were superseded by an opportunistic approach based on near-term fuel
pricing. The consequence was the disruption in gas supply from Egypt resulting in a publicly guaranteed
debt crisis at the electricity distribution company, NEPCO. Macroeconomic risks could also be managed
through financial instruments, many of which are increasingly seen as part of the standard toolbox for debt
management agencies. Yet in Jordan, the main focus of debt management activities was on meeting the
immediate needs of the funding calendar, especially through instruments insulated from sovereign risk (e.g.
US guarantees).

For households, the ability to manage risk is impaired by a social safety net that was largely designed
around categorical transfers and universal price subsidies, though it is evolving towards targeted
subsidies and transfers. However, access to finance remains a major challenge for lower-income
households, and with it, access to instruments which could help them cope with risk. Thus there is a close
link between balanced risk management and equity.  In the private sector, excess risk has limited firms’
willingness and ability to invest, for instance, for capital expenditures or expansion plans, which would
help firm growth and potentially create new employment opportunities. The presence of geopolitical rents
also distorts risk management mechanisms employed by the private sector firms, especially during times of
crisis and shocks.

It is also important to draw out the link between risk management and sustainability. As the SCD
shows, Jordan faces an unusually wide configuration of sustainability risks, from macroeconomic
(especially external balance), water, and social stresses exacerbated by the Syrian refugee influx. A strategic
approach to risk would ensure that these sustainability issues are managed at the highest level of government
and in turn that associated policy responses permeate throughout the administration. In fact, although
government strategies do a commendable job of analyzing these risks, most recently Jordan 2025, it is not
clear that a systematic and integrative approach to sustainability informs daily government business in
guidance from the leadership to an empowered middle management.

Hypothesis 2: Functioning of markets.

Regarding the performance of factor markets, two essential signals of structural impediments are
the low level of investment, especially private investment, and deep labor market segmentation
between the public and private sectors, formal and informal sectors, and the respective roles of
Jordanian males, females, and migrants in the labor market locally and regionally.

The level of investment lacks buoyancy and investment surges have not been sustained. Looking first
at public investment, the general pattern has been for fiscal consolidations to come at the expense of the
public capital program. With the public sector payroll and subsidies (before 2011) seen as rigid, the main
room for budget cuts has been with public investment. However, there are two important qualifications to
this general trend of lower public investment. There are indications that operations and maintenance (O&M)
expenditures have been pared particularly severely to make room for other items. Furthermore, since the
government has the option of donors willing to fund capital projects, it has been possible to mobilize ring-
fenced grant funding for selected projects in the capital program. However, these two factors – inadequate



                                                      vi
O&M and donor funding of capital projects – interact negatively with each other. The capital budget does
not provide comprehensive reporting of O&M expenditures, and the apparent attractiveness of donor-
funded projects comes at the cost of programming for long-term O&M of the associated assets. The fact
that the budget is constructed on a line item basis and cannot be matched to a register of assets makes it
very difficult to manage existing and prospective public assets properly. As a result, there is a double cost
to the way that the public investment program is run: the space for new projects, and especially projects
with diffuse benefits is limited, but the existing asset stock is deteriorating even as more recurrent cost
obligations accumulate for projects that do get through the system.

As for private investment, this is characterized by a general weakness in domestic private investment
and occasional surges in FDI which peter out. The most recent such surge was during 2004-2008, which
was undermined by the belated effect in Jordan of the global financial crisis. The determinants of this surge
are an illustration of Jordan’s regional exposures. A wave of economic reforms related to privatization had
begun in the 1990s, but investor response accelerated after the resolution of the fate of the Saddam regime
in 2003, the uncertainty about which had previously held back confidence. The positive environment was
reinforced by the oil price boom, which contributed to the pool of investment money in the GCC looking
for regional opportunities. Remittances also underpinned a local investment boom. A fragmented
investment promotion strategy involving multiple agencies as well as a zones commission was unable to
maintain the momentum of promising surges.

The successful PPP for Queen Alia International Airport represented the confluence of effective
reform implementation, a favorable regional environment, and investor mobilization. By late 2008,
these factors had run their course and the slowdown in investment flows associated with the global financial
crisis had a severe impact on the economy and fiscal position. Coupled with disruptions in the energy sector,
these weaknesses culminated in a nascent fiscal crisis in 2011, the correction of which has been the focus
of the successfully completed IMF SBA and the Bank’s DPL.

This lack of sustained investment has its counterpart in structural shortcomings in the labor market:
low labor force participation, especially among women (around 12 percent), persistent
unemployment, a combined expectations/skills gap, and deep labor market segmentation. This
segmentation involves rationing of public sector jobs – both by numbers and salary – a lack of alignment
of skills and expectations in the private sector labor market, and simultaneous flows of more skilled
Jordanians to the GCC while lower skilled migrants flow into Jordan.

From the job creation side, Jordan has the “missing middle” syndrome also seen in other countries
with a relatively sparse density of medium-sized firms between micro and small enterprises on the
one hand and well-established large firms with limited contribution to net job creation on the other.
Promising sectors such as ICT, pharmaceuticals, and health tourism have shown what can be done, but
these sectors have faced challenges in scaling up and are under continual competitive pressures especially
from within the region (e.g. Dubai).

   Figure ES 1: Jordan SCD Conceptual Framework




The issues at the sector level

The SCD shows how these hypotheses are both aggregations of sector level issues while also
constituting somewhat autonomous factors that manifest themselves at the sector level. Figure ES1
illustrates the cascading logic of the SCD moving from sustainable achievement of the twin goals to the
SCD hypotheses and then in this section to the manifestations of the hypotheses in terms of implementation
and sectoral constraints.

Consider first the business climate. Jordan’s exposure to regional shocks has had adverse effects on
investor confidence since 2008, but this has been compounded by policy, regulatory, and administrative
uncertainties which are due to shortcomings in public sector performance, as outlined in Jordan 2025. These
erode confidence in the investment framework and confront entrepreneurs with concerns about access to
credit, skilled labor, and a level playing field.

Due to inflexibilities in the functioning of formal markets, informality is prevalent and has
disproportionate impacts on the poor. Indeed, one of the challenges in coping with the Syrian refugee
influx is that a significant part of the non-fiscal response burden is borne by the informal sector, through
additional supply of informal labor and enterprise by refugees. For Jordanians, this deepens the wedge
between formal and informal employment, while shifting more economic activity outside the tax base and
so undermining fiscal sustainability.

Governance provides an essential lens for understanding the complex role of the public sector in
Jordan: the public sector is at once intrinsic to the social compact, through the provision of jobs and



                                                    viii
services, but its role has often been stifling, not least because the size of the public sector dilutes its ability
to incentivize good performance. The upstream issues relate the interaction of geopolitical rents and
domestic politics, discussed earlier. This tends to divert ministry and agency effort into seeking influence
and legitimacy through roles in the allocation of partner financing flows, which are the most discretionary
item in the budget. But this comes at the expense of a more standard role for Parliament and the budget
policymakers in determining the spending envelope and priorities for the overall budget, i.e. a coordinated
allocative process from a single pot of money comprising both domestic and partner funding.

In terms of the functioning of the public policy process and public institutions, there is serious
fragmentation at all levels; besides impeding a strategic perspective in government, the impact of
otherwise worthy transparency and accountability initiatives is diluted. Public investment management
(PIM) has lacked any standardized practice of the “must have” PIM functions. And there are incentives to
keep things this way, because the fragmentation allows the individual players to broker their own informal
relationships and protocols, undermining citizen confidence (Jordan 2025).

The energy sector story is one of several phases of strong reforms that was derailed by a combination
of shocks in 2011. Specifically, a successful unbundling of the electricity sector and attraction of
investment to power generation had given Jordan a fairly modern sector structure by 2008. But this model
contained a huge embedded risk in its growing reliance on a single fuel source, namely natural gas. When
this was interrupted in 2011, precisely at a time of domestic political fragility, the government did not want
to pass high costs through to electricity consumers and a fiscal crisis (cumulating up to 20 percent of GDP)
ensued.

However despite the fiscal difficulties, the overall reform response of the energy sector has been very
strong. Energy price adjustments have begun and are embedded in a multi-year trajectory towards cost
recovery. The operational LNG terminal will diversify the fuel mix, and renewable investment
commitments have been scaled up dramatically – the point where Jordan has electricity export potential.

Water, the environment, and climate present a set of existential issues for Jordan. Jordan does not
have the groundwater resources to meet demand projections even at conservative levels of per capita usage.
Although there has been some progress in adjusting tariffs towards economic cost, the fiscal burden from
water utilities is growing. Attention has increasingly shifted to large and complex investment projects,
including desalination, as part of the solution. But the fragmentation of roles makes it more difficult to
identify the operational elements of the overall water strategy. Similarly, climate change represents a major
but slow-moving risk to Jordan that will require a complex multi-sector response which the public sector
will struggle to deliver.

The common theme to the numerous job market challenges is segmentation and distorted market
signals which compartmentalize the labor market rather than harmonize it. In fact, the job market
seems to exhibit corner solutions both vis-à-vis the labor market status of various groups and with linkages
to other sectors. Examples include: educational choices that seem unresponsive to labor market demands,
massive queuing for positions in the public sector, a very large gap between formal and informal sector
earnings and between reservation wages and prevailing wages in the most available occupations, and
perhaps most strikingly, one of the world’s largest gaps in male-female labor force participation.



                                                        ix
Furthermore, there are significant gross flows in the labor market, of skilled Jordanians out to the GCC and
further afield, and lower skilled migrants, mostly from Arab countries, into Jordan.

There are multi-faceted contributors to this situation on both the supply and demand side. On the
supply side, issues include the wage-hours expectations-setting role of the large public sector, negative
labor participation impact of unearned income sources such as remittances, subsidies and transfers, and
social security taxes associated with formalization. The minimum wage is set in monthly terms (JD 190 or
around US$270) and therefore can be binding precisely in jobs likely to attract less experienced women,
especially those interested in part-time employment. All these factors are reinforced by cultural and social
expectations. On the demand side, Jordan has, like other MENA countries, a “missing middle” regarding
firms i.e. a small number of large and well-established trading companies and a densely populated micro
and small enterprise sector which has difficulty making the transition to mid-size.

There are two particularly discouraging elements of the Jordan labor market picture. First, a solid
government analysis of all the above issues and more is already in place in the form of the National
Employment Strategy (NES). But NES implementation has devolved into a set of small mostly donor-
funded projects. Second, the problems seem to be getting worse over time. Interestingly, one source of
alleviation has been the Syrian refugee influx, as this has brought additional labor supply at both the low
and high skills end of the market; the latter is important given the competition for Jordanian skills in the
GCC.

The social safety net is an area of comparative success for Jordan. The use of cash transfers as
compensation for the 2011 removal of fuel subsidies was an ambitious reform, yet the government was able
to carry through with the scheme while maintaining the commitment that the transfer would only be active
when oil prices were high. The information base for an extensive means-tested safety net is now in place,
and this will be further strengthened by the completion of the National Unified Registry.

Regarding the social sectors (education and health), Jordan has historically performed very well in
both education and health outcomes, with broad access and a reputation in the region for good quality
delivery. The problem now is increasing inequality in provision and erosion of quality and major system
stressed due to the Syrian influx. The health sector has a two-tier or even three-tier provision system and
the education system has struggled to maintain standards at all level, especially tertiary. A very constrained
spending and administrative environment has locked in an outdated delivery model while leaving little
discretion for innovation or returns to good performance. A key exception is health tourism – where the
private sector was able to find a role – but even this segment is not static and new competitive pressures are
emerging, including from increased use of remote healthcare delivery facilitated by the Internet.

A final set of constraints are usefully grouped under economic and political geography. These pertain
to transport and decentralization. The urban poor experience large costs in terms of time and money from
inadequate public transport. And while the road network is substantial, there are concerns about inadequate
operations and maintenance expenditures and the difficulty in implementing more complex projects (e.g.
intermodal or those that would support objectives like regional integration). Jordan’s intergovernmental
delegates selected designated powers to lower tiers of government, which has, for example, limited the
ability of local jurisdictions to address service gaps in lagging regions or respond quickly to the Syrian



                                                      x
influx. The combined effort of the transport and decentralization issues is to distort population flows in the
country, as people move to the urban areas to have better access to jobs and services.

Prioritization

The prioritization exercise for Jordan requires considerable tailoring to the current context: a
substantial reform agenda is already unfolding, albeit at different pace across different sectors. The
key example is the energy sector. A SCD written in 2010 would most likely have identified the energy
sector as the top constraint in terms of risks, fiscal impact, threats to energy supply, and overall urgency. In
2011, the risks that would have been embedded in such an assessment were realized, and a long-discussed
move to cost-reflective electricity tariffs and diversification of the energy mix are now under phased
implementation, while liquid transport fuel subsidies have already been eliminated. As this SCD has shown,
water is now the “next frontier” for such an adjustment, and depletion concerns heighten the importance far
beyond fiscal costs. An associated reform program is currently under discussion with the government within
the framework of a new programmatic DPL.

Implementation is a binding and cross-cutting constraint that needs to be tackled in parallel with the
remaining constraints identified below. As experience shows, implementation constraints can be
overcome. This is illustrated when there is a widely understood mandate, originating from the King, and
ministers who are empowered to resource reform teams with high capacity and motivated members. By
contrast, initiatives have languished when they are left to technical committees without clear criteria for
escalation and when reform teams have experienced staffing and operating constraints (sometimes
rationalized on grounds of a hiring freeze).

Fundamentally, these divergent implementation outcomes reflect policymaker incentives towards
inaction: they see adverse consequences to acting given unclear signals about the authorizing
environment. Furthermore, Jordan’s development partners unwittingly enable this stasis, because
fragmented projects offer the appearance of addressing important structural challenges (with associated
“nameplate” benefit for donors) while actually postponing action. There is also a risk that accountability
initiatives have unwittingly heightened the risk of attracting attention by pushing issues forward.

A second element of the implementation constraint arises from the absence of a strategic management
approach in government. At first sight it seems unusual that a country with so many strategic documents
should lack a strategic management approach. But in fact, the operational implications of the findings of
strategy exercises are often not absorbed. Even where profound sustainability issues are identified, such as
in water or climate change, it has been difficult to get line of sight on how these priorities are being absorbed
in the government apparatus or how they are being monitored and coordinated. Donors have made this
problem worse by cherry-picking the most easily “projectized” elements of strategy, so that the policy
component is left as a shell.

The struggles with implementation call for a high level prioritization filter looking at whether a
particular intervention is reform-resistant or reform-oriented. Reform-resistance means prone to
dilution and reinforcement of the status quo. Reform-oriented means targeting sufficiently deep factors that
it could shift policy to a more pro-active stance. The lack of urgency around many areas of implementation



                                                       xi
is ultimately linked to the moral hazard associated with the insurance element of geopolitical rents. The
public sector contains a large number of organizational entities, which makes a whole-of-government
unified approach difficult. Teams charged with implementing reforms often find themselves inadequately
resourced and operating in a vacuum regarding a path to expected results and sharing of knowledge.
Interventions which contribute to fragmentation or are confined to the project level reinforce this problem;
examples include product-specific export promotion, isolated SME support, and vocational training. A
strong example of an intervention with more sweeping potential is gender, since factors related gender
underlie a range of issues from poverty to labor market dynamics. Investment climate is another area, since
deep and comprehensive opening to new investment would shift the policy focus away from rents and
towards efficiency of the investment framework. Figure ES2 illustrates how various priorities could be
positioned in terms of this high-level filter.

Figure ES 2: Prioritization




Despite the recent positive steps on subsidy reform, addressing Jordan’s fiscal and debt profile
represents a precondition for achievement of the twin goals and sustainability. When combined with
the undiversified export base, the fiscal situation embeds a “sudden stop” risk in terms of reliance on
external inflows to finance the structural savings-investment gap. On the expenditure side, achieving more
fiscal space is linked to the sector priorities discussed further below, notably on private sector job creation
and social safety reform, to reduce the reliance on the public budget for jobs and subsidies. On the revenue
side, there has been considerable analysis of the scope for revenue mobilization and several efforts at
streamlining tax exemptions and broadening the base of the income tax. Implementation constitutes the
major impediment to effectiveness of these measures, a precondition for which is building consensus with
stakeholders about the need for them. Overall, achieving the objectives of the government’s fiscal and
economic reform program provide a strong framework for addressing this constraint.



                                                      xii
With responses to energy and water constraints already part of an emerging consensus in policy
discussion, the remaining constraints lie in the domain of implementation and citizen participation.
Energy and water pricing are at a stage where although there is a technical consensus around the need for
adjustment, there is much less agreement around the modalities, especially in water. Since any adjustment
will involve tariff increases, a lack of confidence of the public in the motivation for or impact of pricing
reforms could seriously undermine reform momentum. Complexity in cost structure is inevitable for major
utilities like NEPCO and the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ), for example in the relationship between
profits on electricity generation and distribution. In many countries, the regulator plays an important role
in improving the transparency of electricity and water pricing. A lack of transparency can undermine the
rationale for price adjustments, especially in terms of a perception of asymmetric price adjustment (i.e.
tariffs adjust upwards when energy costs increase but not downwards when energy costs decline). Plans to
boost water supply (through the Red-Dead link and ancillary projects) are very complex in terms of their
infrastructure and environmental implications. This makes a participatory approach to generating support
for these projects more critical but also more challenging.

In other sectors, the reform agenda is at an earlier stage, and the prioritization filters are very useful
to determine sequencing:

Jordan’s Vision 2025 ambition of sustaining high levels of growth while absorbing significantly more
labor will require significant improvement in the business climate and irreversible structural reforms
to unleash the potential of private sector investment, trade and innovation, increase productivity and
enlarge its small export base. A top priority therefore is providing investors, domestic and foreign, with
confidence that they will face a stable and effectively administered regulatory environment throughout the
life cycle of their investments, and that is implemented and enforced in the same way for everyone.
Important strides are needed to improve regulations for businesses, but the creation of a level-playing field
to all investors is key. Strengthening the dialogue between the Government and the private sector will be
equally important.

In parallel, Jordan needs to reap the benefits of trade integration. Additional entry of small and medium
enterprises on its own will not be transformative; more SMEs engaged in production of non-traded goods
and services will be inherently limited by the size of their local markets. Jordan’s export performance for
new products and new markets is poor, and it has not sustainably increased its exports as a results of trade
agreements or export promotion programs. The government should develop a more concentrated industrial
policy (i.e. avoiding dilution by having too many “priority” sectors and enclave economic zones), and play
an active role in fostering foreign technology transfers matched to human capital, as was achieved in the
pharmaceutical sector. The government should also improve innovation policy and strategy to focus on
competitiveness enhancement policies, not just in knowledge-intensive sectors, but also in labor-intensive
sectors, which, if coupled with an increase in working conditions, can appeal again to young educated
Jordanians and migrants.

A related cluster of issues concerns the financing and management of investment. For this constraint
area, complementarity provides a strong filter because it directs attention to the multiple determinants of
the total stock of physical capital in Jordan and the resulting need for multiple entry points depending on
the nature of the capital. For public capital, getting an effective public investment management (PIM)



                                                    xiii
system operational will enable a comprehensive perspective on existing assets, operations and maintenance
thereof, and a vetted project pipeline to which Jordan’s partner financing inflows can be allocated.
Technical work on the PIM system is already underway. Given the political influence that comes with
control of the capital program, operation of a good practice PIM system will be especially prone to the
implementation constraint.

If one particular area of PIM should be selected as a priority, it is integration of the capital program
into the multi-year budget strategy. This will bring the needed coordination between the allocation of
partner financing resources, domestic revenue mobilization, comprehensive budgeting for new capital
projects, and internalization of incentives which currently contribute to a proliferation of projects.

Structured finance for infrastructure is another area where progress is already being made, due to
the current efforts to build on earlier PPP successes and operationalize the recent PPP law. Because
of Jordan’s risk exposure and complex project needs in certain sectors (e.g. renewable energy), having an
investment framework that attracts high capacity investors is important. These investors will be looking to
share risk with partners in the country (most likely the government) and with fellow investors. In this
setting, the role of a “first mover” investor in signaling good prospects and resolving uncertainty is strongly
warranted. A solid PPP framework provides clear “rules of the game” for such coordination, but other
modes of investment (e.g. loan syndication) may be equally viable depending on the circumstances.

Access to finance for smaller firms and households is not amenable to quick improvement; indeed to
push too far in this direction would lead to proliferation of micro-enterprises with no hope of
expansion and pose risks to financial stability. The priority here is not a single initiative, but rather
phasing of a set of reforms that will alleviate different constraints over different horizons. The current
banking sector structure with two large banks in stable and conservative business lines and major gaps in
credit market infrastructure will struggle to promote access in the short-term. Over time, reduced fiscal
deficits should reduce the appeal of financing the government, and growing experience in the SME sector
should increase the banks’ capacity for the SME segment.

But even with overdue improvement in credit market infrastructure centered on insolvency and
creditors’ rights, banks alone cannot respond with the scale, speed, or scope needed to make the
financial sector more dynamic. This will require better-functioning securities markets, enabled through
improved corporate governance and transparency and disclosure requirements on the Amman Stock
Exchange. Financial markets would be more diversified through the participation of venture capital and
private equity – but these players will want to see good prospects that promising projects can actually move
to implementation and profitability.

Another cluster of issues is around social safety nets (SSNs), education, and health. In fact these are
all part of helping households manage shocks at various horizons and in response to various random and
life-cycle events (income loss, unemployment, health, and livelihood opportunities).

The first key message here is that Jordan has already done a lot to put the technical prerequisites for
strong social sector performance in place, but these need to be completed urgently so that policy
design which relies on them can be activated. The fuel subsidy removal cash transfer compensation



                                                     xiv
scheme showed the ability to scale up the safety net when the right conditions are in place. The ongoing
construction of a National Unified Registry (NUR) will offer a comprehensive platform for SSNs and social
service delivery. In particular, the NUR provides a path to universal coverage in healthcare, and thus is a
foundational initiative for implementation of Jordan’s National Health Strategy. In the long-term, universal
coverage will complement labor market dynamism by weakening the distorted preference for public sector
employment as a means of accessing healthcare.

The direction of SSN policy reform also needs to be maintained. The labor market diagnostic indicates
that the categorical basis and lack of activation measures in the current SSN creates disincentives for labor
market participation. While a realistic time horizon for responding to these shortcomings is long, this policy
area scores highly because of its complementarity with other reforms and, ultimately, its strong link to the
twin goals.

Constraints related to gender ultimately pertain to the ability of women for autonomous participation
in society. Obstacles to women exercising agency in Jordan are caused by a combination of the treatment
of women versus men under applicable legal frameworks, with gaps further widened by restrictive social
norms that can govern women’s behavior and regulations which disadvantage school-to-work transitions
for young women. Recent legislative and regulatory reforms, if implemented effectively, have the potential
to increase women's agency through expansion of rights and improvements in service delivery.

The education sector illustrates the point that the issue is not whether the overall sector is a priority
– it is – but the sequencing of reforms within it. For example, although skills gaps will have to be
narrowed from both the supply and demand side, which will take time, several types of reform can be
frontloaded:

First, high quality general purpose skills will be needed even if some portion of near-term cohorts of
young Jordanians will be looking for jobs in the region rather than at home. Every day that these issues
are not addressed, the pool of difficult-to-employ youth is growing.

Second, the education sector needs more autonomy to be able to flexibly manage core operational
issues such as teacher assignments and implementation of a modern curriculum which fosters critical
thinking and innovation. At the tertiary level, the public universities have a very constricted expenditure
envelope, while private colleges have expanded within a deficient regulatory framework which has adverse
effects on quality. Clear signals can be sent in the short-term to instill confidence in education quality and
relevance at all levels.

The transport sector is at the nexus of several reform areas. The necessary price adjustments in energy
have nonetheless exacerbated constraints to mobility, especially in urban areas. Relaxing constraints in
transport thus scores highly on improving functioning of the labor market. But it also goes directly to the
ability to meaningfully participate in the economy and society. When low income households experience
daily access and quality problems in modes of transport and basic regulatory and planning shortcomings
(e.g. pedestrian facilitation), it contributes to the gap between the general public’s assessment of progress
and the technocratic orientation of policy reforms.




                                                     xv
Public sector reform is perhaps the single most challenging area to prioritize. Some simplification of
this large agenda is achieved by recognizing that certain constraints that normally fall within this domain
have been extracted as cross-cutting implementation constraints, already discussed above. But even with
this reduction in scope, the public sector remains a common element to numerous constraint areas: fiscal
(because of its size and rigid cost structure), labor market (distorted wage setting), and social and
administrative service delivery (performance management). However, the track record of public sector
reform efforts in Jordan is dismal, despite the existence of a dedicated ministry for this purpose. This most
likely reflects that public sector employment is intrinsic to the socio-political bargain, undercutting the
feasibility of this reform. Yet it may be that while a direct large-scale approach to public sector reform
would fail, well-targeted modifications within the current structure might have relatively large impacts.
This would involve a sustained on-the-ground dialogue and learning-by-doing with the upper and middle
management layer in ministries, possibly with a pilot reform for demonstration effects.

The Syrian refugee crisis provides further impetus, using the framework of the Jordan Response
Plan, to address these long-standing constraints in the economy. Overlaps between a developmental
approach to coping with the refugee influx and the aforementioned constraints include the following: First,
enabling investment to allow for higher productivity employment growth that will then absorb the refugees
as well as local workers without lowering wages; this will also help broaden the tax base. Second, strengthen
local service delivery so that additional students and patients do not stretch the health and education systems
to breaking point. Third, as accountability improves, shift funding down the chain (to municipalities and
facilities) increasing flexibility to respond to local demand. Fourth, the emerging experience with cash
transfers to refugees can over time converge with SSN reforms for nationals to create a resilient social
protection system which will improve labor market functioning. And finally, strengthen financial markets
which can more effectively intermediate refugee assets along with local savings and galvanize investment.

Introduction

Jordan is an upper middle income country which has proven remarkably resilient despite decades of
turmoil in its neighborhood. The economy has absorbed recurrent population influx, high vulnerability to
energy and food import prices, and a lack of natural resources. It has generated sustained growth and low
headcount poverty coupled with generally low inflation and a credible exchange rate regime. Jordan has
managed a unique balancing act in the MENA region in terms of maintaining domestic stability despite the
persistence of conflict on its doorstep.

Even with economic stability in the face of massive shocks, the Jordanian government – reflecting
the views of the population – has made clear the need for improvement in the current growth
trajectory. There is considerable public dissatisfaction with the risk of poverty, the lack of job market
dynamism, and the cost of living. More generally there is a popular sense that Jordan should be doing better
in terms of attracting foreign investment and exploiting its human capital, location, and history. Even the
vulnerability to shocks has brought with it a substantial grant inflow from the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) countries, Europe, and the USA and with it a perception of unexploited opportunities from those
funds to transform the economy.

Public dissatisfaction coalesced around a perception, which the government acknowledges, that
previous reform efforts had struggled with implementation, while discretionary decisions and
unequal opportunities remain entrenched. Government, stakeholders and partners alike are quick to note
that Jordan has an overload of previous diagnostics and strategies which have not proceeded to effective
implementation. Just over the last decade, the country has had a National Agenda, a poverty reduction
strategy, and National Employment Strategy, and numerous reviews and country strategies undertaken by
external partners. These strategies have in turn spawned varied project-level interventions across many
sectors of the economy. Likewise, personalized decision-making including widespread wasta is seen as a
fact of life in Jordan despite various efforts to crack down on it.

In response, the government is moving to the implementation phase of its Jordan 2025 strategic
blueprint, a new ten-year strategy formally launched in May 2015. During the design phase of the
Blueprint, the government undertook significant consultative exercises which drew consistent feedback
from the private sector and citizens about fatigue with another strategic exercise given the poor track record
of implementation of previous ones. As a result, Jordan 2025 – which is frank about implementation failures
– has placed particular emphasis on strengthening implementation mechanisms, especially at the center of
government. Implementation of the Vision will unfold through three executive development plans over the
next ten years, the first of which is already being finalized.

The Bank’s Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is therefore unfolding at a critical inflection point
for the government. While the regional picture remains as fraught as ever, external partner support and
the fall in oil prices provide a rare transformational opportunity for economic and social policy. Recent
policy adjustments within the framework of the IMF Standby Arrangement (SBA) and the Bank’s
programmatic Development Policy Loans (DPLs) have already achieved a significant reconfiguration of
fiscal and sector policies towards energy sector structural reforms, a shift from universal price subsidies to
targeted transfer programs, improvements in the business climate, and a broadening of the revenue base. A

                                                      1
new IMF program (most likely under the Extended Fund Facility) and a DPL covering energy and water
are envisaged to be active over the coming year. The SCD can provide a platform for the government, the
World Bank Group (WBG), and external partners to work towards agreed priorities from the substantial
body of reviews and reports, and to support alignment of external partners’ programs with the government’s
Blueprint.

Given existing reform momentum around the energy sector and investment, the substantive
engagement of the Bank Group and other development partners, the SCD will seek added value by
providing an integrative and concise perspective on what Jordan can do to better meet the
expectations of its citizens. The SCD thus builds on the 2011 Development Policy Review (DPR), existing
analyses of poverty and unemployment based on household and labor force surveys, and insights gleaned
from projects in key sectors such as transport, education, and private sector development. These are
complemented by other major reviews and assessments such as for privatization, employment, and gender
and cluster-level analyses for sectors such as pharmaceuticals, tourism, and ICT.

As a multi-sector evidence-based diagnostic, the SCD relies upon consistent and integrated analysis
of data from various sources. This requires maintaining a benchmark for timeliness of information. For
the sector analyses in the SCD, all data is as of the period that internal World Bank corporate review of the
report took place, which is end-June 2015. Selected more recent data is referenced when essential to the
storyline as of September 2015, when the draft was shared with the government.

Chapter 1 Context

External shocks have been especially formidable since the beginning of the millennium. The most
severe of these shocks include the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the global financial crisis of 2008 and
the ongoing “Arab Spring” turmoil that commenced in 2011. In each of these cases, the economy
experienced significant growth deceleration, exacerbating already prevailing macroeconomic
vulnerabilities. Limited policy space deprived the authorities from macroeconomic tools for countercyclical
measures, forcing the government into increased dependence on external aid from political allies and
multilateral institutions.

Jordan has particularly strong exposures to the Arab Gulf (GCC) countries. Macroeconomic
conditions are significantly impacted by the external environment. To begin with, the country is well placed
on the international and the regional tourist map and earns substantial tourism receipts, which averaged
11.8 percent of GDP since 2000. GCC nationals are prime visitors to the country, both in terms of numbers
and their propensity to spend. An increasingly strong political alliance with the GCC governments renders
Jordan a beneficiary of generous grants and selected foreign direct investments (FDI) from the region. As
the SCD will elaborate, these flows can be interpreted as rents to Jordan’s status and location. In fact, Jordan
is one of the world’s largest recipients of grants relative to the size of its economy; from 2000 to 2014,
Jordan received an average of 6.2 percent of GDP in grants, mostly from the US and GCC.

Compared to countries of similar characteristics and income levels, Jordan enjoys relatively high
human development indicators. The population’s access to education and health services is amongst the
highest in the region which points to high levels of “ability” amongst the population. But access is being
eroded by uneven quality and the commitment to equal access does not always readily translate into equality
of opportunity and so possibilities of exclusion exist due to a range of barriers related to gender, geography,
origin etc. In addition, high levels of education have not translated into dynamic labor market outcomes as
unemployment rates are particularly elevated for higher educated youth and women. The Social Progress
Index highlights areas beyond core human development indicators where Jordan faces challenges.1
Jordan’s score is lowest (43.29) on the opportunity dimension (93rd in rank). It scores poorly (28.16) on
the category of “personal rights” measured by indicators related to political rights, freedom of speech and
freedom of movement. It also scores poorly on the tolerance and inclusion dimension (38.32) which
includes a low score on “tolerance of immigrants”.

Jordan is in the very small class of countries exposed to short-term exogenous demographic shocks
which have permanent effects. Regarding human resources, Jordan has both relatively high natural
population growth and an exposure to regional shocks which result in substantial jumps in its total resident
population. Major influxes include from the Palestinian territories (notably following the Arab-Israeli wars
of 1948 and 1967), Iraq (1991 onwards), and Syria (since 2011). This generates substantial short-run
frictions between the demand for and supply of housing, social, and infrastructure services, and the demand
and supply for labor. The history of Jordan has been for a substantial proportion of each influx to remain in
the country for the medium or even long-term. Thus part of the development challenge for the country is to

                                                               3
effectively mobilize this human capital in a non-disruptive fashion while coping with inevitable frictions
and mismatches along the way.

Jordanian youth constitute a significant segment of the working age population – a demographic gift
but also a challenge. The youth, defined as those aged 15-24, forms around 22 percent of the Jordanian
population. The youth bulge was due to the relatively high fertility rates which were around 7 in the 1980’s
until they declined to 3.3 in 2012. Jordan will continue to experience growth in its youth population in the
coming years as currently 34 percent of its population is below the age of 15, while only 3.5 percent are
above 65 years old. It is predicted that the working age population will increase from 3.4 million in 2004
to 4.4 million in 2020 to 6 million in 2030 (NES 2011-2020). The youth bulge can be a demographic gift
and a valuable resource to the economy if more of the working age population is activated and enough jobs
are created for them, but equally a wellspring of alienation if opportunities are not forthcoming.

The SCD takes on board the overarching challenge of sustainability which has emerged from other
assessments. Other than some minerals (and potential shale hydrocarbons), the country has extremely
limited water and arable land. Most food and fuel is imported. Desertification is an ever-present risk, and
climate change will exacerbate existing environmental stresses. Regional politics complicates the joint
management and planning of water resources in the Dead and Red Seas and Jordan River. As many
countries have found, urbanization is a double-edged sword in terms of environmental outcomes: density
can enable efficient and land-conserving growth, but with the wrong policy mix (especially on urban
planning, access to land, and energy subsidies), it can instead result in sprawl and environmental depletion.

The sustainability focus is needed to highlight risks that might be neglected given the day-to-day
preoccupation with exogenous shocks. While many countries could present a list of challenges and
endowments somewhat similar to the above, there are few countries that feature the intensity and breadth
of these risks – and arguably none that are not considered fragile. Vulnerability manifests itself for
individuals as episodic poverty and job loss and for firms as discretionary administrative treatment, rising
costs of, and differential access to, infrastructure and energy, and disruptions in trade. For the country,
vulnerability originates in commodity prices, regional turmoil, and climate shocks. There is also a high
level vulnerability that comes from being on political and economic fault lines: an upper middle income
country next to the high income GCC and (as an eastern Mediterranean country) the EU, but also not far
from much poorer countries in north and east Africa.

Regional developments for 2015 offered at best partial relief from the cumulative strains of shocks
since 2008. On the one hand, the near-50 percent decline in oil prices greatly eased the import bill for
electricity generation and transport fuels, and narrowed the gap between generation and end user costs in
the electricity sector. The same trend however highlights sustainability concerns about GCC grant and
remittance flows. In the energy sector, the mismatch of generation capacity designed for natural gas with
disruptions in the supply thereof will continue, while the lack of a diversified transport system locks in
reliance on liquid fuels for motor vehicles. In terms of regional developments, there is no sign of resolution
of the Syrian civil war, with the result that the large refugee population and trade disruption will continue.
Meanwhile, the crisis in Iraq, having already closed off land trade routes and low-cost oil imports, could
worsen in 2016 as the Baghdad government attempts to reestablish control in areas of northern and western
Iraq lost to ISIS in 2014.

Chapter 2 Major features and emerging challenges

Jordan suffers chronic imbalances in its internal and external accounts. Persistent fiscal deficits are
generated from a relatively small tax base that needs to fund a large public sector, the most costly element
of which is a large military (7.5 percent of GDP) – seen as the ultimate guarantor of national security in a
volatile region. This has led to an accumulation of a large public debt, whose servicing exacerbates the
fiscal strain. A period of high growth (2004-2008) helped facilitate considerable improvements in Jordan’s
debt ratios. Additionally, recent fiscal consolidation measures, motivated by the IMF Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) program, led to the elimination of expensive fuel subsidies during a politically
sensitive period. Externally, a large trade deficit at around 30 percent of GDP necessitates sizable inflows
to meet balance of payments needs. At times, these inflows have been insufficient, leading to exchange
market pressures. To relieve internal and external imbalances, Jordan depends on international aid, making
it one of the largest middle-income country recipients of foreign grants in the world.2

Growth has become markedly less volatile since the early 1990s but the current account is prone to
major swings around a chronic deficit. The improvement in growth performance in the 1990s from the
1980s is clearly visible in Figure 2.1, which also shows that the current account and fiscal balances
continued to be volatile. This illustrates their role in absorbing shocks while their average values (both
around -5 percent of GDP over the full period) is indicative of the dependence on these flows even in
“normal” times.

Since the turn of the century, growth in Jordan has been brisk but volatile. Real GDP increased by an
average of 5.2 percent during the period 2000-2014, which is close to the post-1990 average. Nevertheless,
this growth was subject to large variations around the mean, characterized by a one-standard deviation of
2.3 and ranging from a high of 8.6 percent in 2004 to a low of 2.3 percent in 2010. Relative to a group of

comparator countries that were selected based on a similar nominal GDP per capita in the year 2000, real
GDP growth in Jordan performed modestly (Figure 2.2).4 As illustrated, Jordan’s growth trajectory
specifically steepened between 2004 and 2008.

Fluctuations in growth since the beginning of the millennium were largely induced by external
shocks. A better examination of growth dynamics can be accomplished by scrutinizing three sub-periods
(Figure 2.3).

       1. From 2000 until 2003, average growth was 4.9 percent, which is largely considered close to
          potential for Jordan. This period began with a recovery that was interrupted by the US invasion of
          Iraq, which dragged growth down by 1.6 percentage points (pp) in 2003.

       2. IMF-motivated reforms5 involving economic liberalization and privatization intensified through
          2008, pushing growth beyond previous estimates of potential to an average of 8 percent for the
          period 2004-2008. During this phase, Jordan followed international advice and privatized many of
          its state-owned assets (SOEs), including Royal Jordanian Airlines as well as the country’s lucrative
          mineral companies, Jordan Phosphate Mining Company and Arab Potash Company.
          Simultaneously, the real-estate sector was on the receiving end of sizable FDIs, mostly emanating
          from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, helping to boost private demand.

       3. The global financial crisis marked the end of the high growth era when second degree effects
          reached Jordan. As the crisis spread to the GCC countries in 2009, Jordan suffered from a decline
          in foreign investment and remittances, causing growth to decline from 7.2 percent in 2008 to 2.3
              percent in 2010. 6 While sustained growth remained elusive in the aftermath of the global recession,
              signs of a recovery were emerging in 2010. The Arab uprisings, however, quickly ensued in early
              2011, undermining consumer and investor confidence. Since 2009, growth has averaged 3.1
              percent, significantly below potential.

 To select the group of comparator countries, we used the Find My Friends database and applied the following filtering
criteria: (a) non-high income countries, (b) non-BRIC, non-OECD and non-OPEC countries, (c) not an island state,
(d) not a highly indebted poor country (HIPC), (e) population below global average and (f) a nominal GDP per capita
ranging from $1500 to $2000 in year 2000. This generated the following comparator countries for Jordan: Bulgaria,
Guatemala, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia), Paraguay and Romania. FYR Macedonia
was then disregarded since data do not go back before its 1991 secession.

    Jordan’s GDP per capita in 2000 was $1742.

  Until 2005, IMF programs included three Stand-By Arrangements (SBAs) (approved in 1989, 1992, and 2002), and
three Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangements (approved in 1994, 1996, and 1999).

Economic Structure

Jordan is primarily a service economy with a significant dependence on the public sector. Comprising
mainly of small enterprises, the manufacturing sector accounted for an average of 19 percent of real GDP
growth during the 2000-2014 period. There is very little heavy industry, as the only raw materials available
                                                                                              7
in Jordan are phosphates and potash, which are processed for use as fertilizers. Other leading sectors
included, transport and communication, contributing 15.9 percent of real GDP growth during the same
period, financial services (15.4 percent) and real estate and construction (12.2 percent) (Figure 2.4). Driven
by the tourism sector, trade, restaurants and hotels contributed around 10 percent of GDP. Government
services also constituted 10 percent of GDP, with empirical evidence pointing to a positive and significant
                                8
impact on growth.

The manufacturing sector’s share of growth has been on a downward trajectory, from an average of
25.9 percent for the period 2000-2003, to 21 percent during 2004-2008, and then to 13.8 percent from 2009
to 2014. This retrenchment was largely counterbalanced by the financial sector, whose share of growth
expanded from 11.4 percent to 16 percent to 17.5 percent, respectively for these same periods. Furthermore,
the share of government services saw a decline during the high growth era (2004-2008), replaced by private
sector activity, only to pick up again during the most recent slowdown. The Jordan 2025 Vision clearly
indicates the government’s wish to increase the manufacturing share of the economy to 27 percent by 2025,
but the means to achieve this will only become apparent in the executive development plans of Jordan 2025.

Total Factor Productivity (TFP) was growing, reflecting an efficiency component to the mid-2000s
growth surge, until the recent slowdown. The rising trend was most pronounced during the 2004-2008
period when the private sector developed a more prominent role in the economy (Figure 2.5). This
trajectory, however, was halted and even reversed starting in 2010. IMF (2012) also estimates TFP for
MENA countries during the period 1992-2008 and discerns that Jordan has a lower TFP than any other
country in the region, other than Bahrain and Iraq (Figure 2.6). The study also concludes that countries with
the highest output per worker—Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt—are those with the highest productivity and
highest capital stock. Jordan, Yemen and Syria, on the other hand, have the lowest output per worker, with
Jordan producing less than most countries in the region except for Bahrain and Yemen. More importantly,
productivity gains were only linked to few small knowledge-intensive sectors (ICT, health, financial
services), but remained low in labor-intensive sectors.

Recently, growth has been sluggish as mounting disruption of trade routes and risk perceptions in
sectors including tourism and inward investment take a heavy toll. A retrenchment in private
investment and tourism, left private demand as the principal driver for recent growth in real GDP (Figure

                                                     8
2.7), reinforced by the large influx of Syrian refugees and Jordanian consumption. Public investment has
fluctuated between two offsetting factors. On the one hand, it has been supported by a large increase in
external grants, sourced from the GCC countries and directed toward capital expenditures. On the other
hand, it is subject to headwinds stemming from a large fiscal consolidation program within the framework
of the IMF SBA. Although the SBA itself did not call for cuts in capital spending, the government has
partially accommodated slow progress on the revenue mobilization side by cutting capital expenditures to
                                                               9
keep the fiscal balance on track. Additionally, fiscal consolidation measures have transformed public
consumption from a positive contributor to real GDP growth to a negative contributor.

The inability to sustain growth surges is linked to the inability of Jordan’s factor markets in directing
resources to high productivity traded sectors. This was a key finding of the 2011 Development Policy
Review, which used the McMillan-Rodrik methodology, and has been reconfirmed in the recent MENA
Jobs or Privilege report. This is part of the explanation for why Jordan can cite some promising commercial
sectors such as ICT, pharmaceuticals, health services, and renewable energy: the economy indeed has
potential and presence in these sectors, but it has proven difficult to scale them up.

Scale-up obstacles in turn pertain to severe investment climate problems (Doing Business in 2015 rank
of 117). In a 2013-14 enterprise survey, a set of eight core investment climate factors were collectively
                                                                   10
ranked by close to 50 percent of firms as the largest obstacles to their operation. This ranking was the
same for all firm sizes and ages and for firms in both manufacturing and services sectors. One consequence
is the presence of a large informal sector. Informality is a way of avoiding the rigidities of formal laws and
regulations, and is also tied to the high presence of migrants, most of whom work in the informal sector.
But it also impedes the building of assets and market infrastructure to enable investment.

The merchandise export base is very narrow; a particular anomaly is the absence of a strong labor
intensive export composition despite Jordan’s labor abundance. Of merchandise exports, the top five
products are calcium phosphates (11 percent), potassic fertilizers (6.0 percent), pharmaceuticals (5.6
percent), mixed mineral or chemical fertilizers (3.4 percent), and textiles (3.2 percent). Import composition
is indicative of lack of participation in global value chains other than for pharmaceuticals, with the top
imports being refined petroleum (13 percent), crude petroleum (11 percent), cars (4.0 percent), petroleum
gas (2.3 percent), and pharmaceuticals (2.1 percent). Also, Jordan did not fully reap the benefits of trade
integration. Despite the multiple trade agreements and export promotion programs, the National Export
Strategy 2014-2019 confirms that export performance for new products and new markets remains poor.

Remittances from a large expatriate population, much of which is based in the GCC region, are an
important source of transfers, alleviating external financing constraints. Inflows of remittances have
average 16 percent of GDP since the turn of the century. Official transfers and remittances place secondary
income in Jordan in the top eight percentile for emerging and developing countries and in the top seven

much of which emanates from the Gulf countries, provides a considerable boost to domestic demand. In
fact, while Jordan is an importer of energy, a surge in oil prices can have a positive effect on the economy
as it would generate larger inflows from the Gulf. Evidence toward this effect is presented by Mohaddes
and Raissi (2011).

Inflows are vital to meet persistent current account deficits, and retrenchment can cause a balance
of payments crisis. Jordan has a capital and financial account surplus that averaged 5.0 percent of GDP
during the period 2000-2014. This has been used to run a current account deficit that averaged 6.2 percent
of GDP during the same period. While Jordan’s current account deficit ranks in the bottom 37 percentile
              13
globally , it remains lower than those for the comparator group of countries, other than Malaysia (Figure
        14
2.9). The deficit is largely a consequence of sizable trade in goods deficit, reaching an average of 30

   To select this group of comparator countries, we used the Find My Friends database and applied the following
filtering criteria: (a) non-high and non-low income countries; (b) non-BRIC, non-OECD and non-OPEC countries; (c)
non-land locked countries; (d) not an island state; (e) not a small state; (f) not a highly indebted poor country (HIPC);
(g) does not have a floating exchange rate regime; (h) population below global average; and (i) imports of goods and
services above global average. This generated the following comparator countries for Jordan: Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Bulgaria, Georgia, Lebanon, Malaysia and Panama. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia were then disregarded as
they do not have comparable data for the 1980s.

The Syrian crisis influx exacerbated pre-existing concerns about deprivation and unequal access to
services. Much of the dissent of 2011/2012 seems to have waned – a phenomenon generally explained in
terms of the population’s fear of security breakdowns similar to those in neighboring countries. This has
had a subsequent cost in terms of apathy of the population since support for status quo is partly driven by a
fear of alternatives. Simmering concerns continue to exist in areas outside the capital and, most commonly,
in the southern and northern parts of the Kingdom. Rising tensions in the Northern governorates are partially
linked to the large influx of Syrian refugees and the resulting pressure that this has placed on already
stretched services. Surveys conducted in those areas point to a high level of community dissatisfaction with
availability of water, adequacy of sanitation and solid and waste water services, rising cost of living and
increase in competition for jobs (REACH Surveys contracted by World Bank, DFID and others), all factors
seen as contributing to social tensions in those communities. Despite efforts to address those needs through
donor-funded programs, there does not seem to be a strategy for addressing this situation in the longer-
term.

The successful post-2011 fiscal consolidation was anchored in the elimination of retail petroleum
product subsidies. The unsustainably large fiscal costs of petroleum price subsidies, and their regressive
nature, led the GoJ to implement substantial reforms in November 2012: the complete elimination of
subsidies on gasoline, diesel and kerosene resulting in price increases ranging from 14 to 33 percent. While
subsidies on LPG gas cylinders, used mainly for cooking were not fully removed, their prices rose by 54
percent. To prevent the re-occurrence of subsidies over time, the GoJ also reinstated the monthly automatic
petroleum products price adjustment mechanism that had previously been in place until December 2010.


                                                     11
To compensate for large price increases on petroleum products, the GoJ simultaneously introduced a cash
                                                                      15
transfer scheme for households, contingent on the price of oil. Aside from generating fiscal space, the
shift from subsidizing petroleum subsidies to a means-tested cash transfer significantly improves the
progressivity of public spending.

However, losses at the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) far outweighed savings from
subsidy reform. Pipeline attacks beginning in 2011 led to interruptions in gas supplies from Egypt, which
fueled 80 percent of Jordan’s power generation, forcing Jordan to run its (gas-designed) power plants on
diesel fuel instead, which is a less efficient and more costly process. The GoJ’s initial decision not to pass-
through the higher input costs to final consumers resulted in a significant increase in NEPCO’s operational
costs (and external deficit). Consequently, NEPCO has been running deficits of around 5 percent of GDP
since 2011. Financing these deficits initially did not directly impact the central government as this was done
by borrowing from banks under a government guarantee. In 2013 and 2014, however, the budget directly
paid NEPCO’s debt servicing costs since banks stopped lending in order to limit their exposure to the
company. Nonetheless, NEPCO’s debt, as it is sovereign guaranteed, is entirely accounted for in Jordan’s
public debt stock, which includes government–guaranteed debt. The resulting transfers to NEPCO since
the crisis erupted exceed the capital budget, and gross public debt and gross financing needs have risen
rapidly. NEPCO reverted to commercial bank borrowing and debt service in 2015 thanks to a significant
improvement in its financial standing (reflecting a combination of reforms, policy measures, and lower oil
prices). NEPCO is thus no longer impacting the fiscal balance but its debt is government guaranteed. Gross
public debt is projected to reached 89 percent of GDP at end-2014 (of which 64.5 percent is domestic) and
is expected to increased in 2015 before declining in 2016.

The medium-term energy strategy foresees returning NEPCO to cost recovery by 2017 while
diversifying fuel sources. A medium-term electricity/energy strategy to that effect was announced in
October 2013. Electricity tariff increases and energy sources diversification are key elements of this plan.
The first tariff increases occurred in August 2013 while the new LNG terminal in Aqaba, operational since
July 2015, and the completion of renewable projects would enable Jordan to achieve a major diversification
of its energy sources by the end of 2015. In the meantime, new regulations to improve domestic energy
efficiency have been introduced.

   Households earning less than JD 10,000 annually were since eligible for an annual cash transfer of JD 70 per
household member for a maximum of six members, provided the price of oil is above $100 per barrel. The third
tranche of cash transfers aimed at compensating households for the removal of fuel subsidies, was not be disbursed in
December 2014, as earlier proposed, given that international oil prices were below $100 a barrel for more than two
months. In 2014, the government improved its targeting criteria by proxy means testing looking at asset indicators as
opposed to only wage income.

Social Stresses and Participation

Although Jordan’s vulnerability emanates largely from the fragility of its environment, shocks and
spillovers, the country is also subject to internal pressures associated with a perceived sense of unequal
opportunities, constrained freedoms of expression and political participation, exclusion and lack of
accountability. As is widely documented, poor performance along these factors impacts on the country’s
development outcomes and it undermines opportunities for reducing inequalities and ensuring shared
prosperity. A prevalent sense of lack of public accountability and transparency also generates a level of
popular discontent that, in a regional context of instability, continues to pose a threat on the government’s
legitimacy and, therefore, the country’s overall stability.

Jordan demographic makeup has been influenced by the influx of large numbers of Palestinian, Iraqi
and Syrian refugees. It is estimated that 50-65 percent of the current Jordanian population is of Palestinian
origin, comprised mostly of Palestinians who entered as refugees in 1948, 1967, and 1990-1991 (UNHCR).
While most Palestinians have been granted full citizenship, more than 2 million continue to reside in Jordan
as Palestinian refugees with an estimated 380,000 of these living in ten refugee camps that are managed by
UNRWA. Jordan also hosts around 700,000 Iraqis, 635,000 registered Syrian refugees, and many more
Syrians living in the general population. Although most Jordanians are Arabs, there is a minority of
Circassians, Kurds and Armenians. About six per cent of Jordanians are Christians and the rest primarily
Sunni Muslims.

Transition to constitutional democracy is a work in progress, feeding frustrations about
implementation. Jordan’s political system is described as a constitutional monarchy. However, in reality,
democracy is primarily exercised through the election of the Parliament, the lower house (and more recently
through the election of mayors and municipal council members) while members of the Upper House and
the Prime Minister are appointed by the King. Jordan’s electoral law is widely contested as it provides much
higher representation to scarcely populated rural districts that largely consist of tribes. Despite recent
revisions (2013), the electoral law continues to rely primarily on the one-person-one-vote system (as
opposed to party representation) which undermines the influence of (already weak) political parties in the
electoral process. As a result of these deficiencies in the electoral law, the Jordanian parliament is prone to
being seen as competition within elites and as a result has limited confidence amongst the population.

Market structures should be seen as a legacy of the domestic political bargain in which incumbent
citizens before each regional conflict had access to public sector jobs and opportunities with the older and
larger family trading companies, while the later waves of conflict-driven migrant influx were concentrated
in smaller scale private sector activities. It is important to note that these distinctions have eroded over time,
but the segmented perspective remain strong in terms of bureaucratic inflexibility and a preference for
selectively liberalized investment climate rather than across-the-board reforms.

Most of the Kingdom’s 800,000 public sector employees and army forces – 40 percent of the
Jordanian labor force – are from generations of nationals and, hence, they are the ones to primarily
benefit from public sources of employment, healthcare, pensions, and other welfare services on which the
states spends more than 80 percent of its annual budget. On the other hand, naturalized Jordanians are
mostly employed in the private sector and, until recently, were seen as dominating access to private sector

opportunities. Despite there being other fault lines along which Jordanians remain divided, including
between rural and urban households and between the ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ – Jordan continues to suffer
from the fragility of a common Jordanian national identity; an issue that continues to complicate its reform
efforts and agenda moving forward. The scrutiny of the security services into all aspects of life seems to be
another source of tension and discontent amongst the population.

Unemployment remains a chronic problem and slow growth compounded by the Syrian crisis is
increasingly reflected in the data. Official data published by the Department of Statistics (DoS) show
that the unemployment rate for the third quarter of 2015 reached 13.8 percent, reversing a drop that had
been seen in 2014. The labor market in Jordan suffers from structural weaknesses as the seasonally adjusted
(sa) quarterly unemployment rate has never been below 11 percent during the 21st century and labor force
participation is declining. Two groups that are particularly affected are women and youth. Unemployment
among women stood at 25 percent in Q3-2015 while that among youth between 15-19 and 20-24 years
stood at 37 and 30 percent, respectively. On a regional basis, the northern governorates of Ajloun and Balqa
registered the highest unemployment rates at about 15 and 19 percent while the lowest were recorded in
Zarqa and Amman (capital) governorates at 8.3 and 10.1 percent, respectively.

Unemployment has displayed little responsiveness to growth. For example, annual growth reached 6.7
percent annually in 2000-2008. This growth "generated" a net employment growth of 2.9 percent annually.
In absolute terms, 457,000 net jobs were created. Yet unemployment dropped only slightly, from 14.9
percent to 13.6 percent. A closer scrutiny of the data shows that 42 percent of the jobs were created in the
public sector and 58 percent in the private sector. Among those created in the latter, more than half were
captured by foreign workers. Job creation for Jordanian citizens in the private sector stood at a mere 28
percent of all the jobs created in 2000-2008. In the private sector, job growth was highest in 'foreign worker-
intensive sectors", including tourism and hospitality, construction and retail trade, textiles and clothing. Job
creation in the above sectors was high but real wages were stagnant or declining (textiles). In contrast, job
growth was below average in the telecom and ICT-enabled services, non-textile manufacturing, mining and
other industries (energy, water, etc.). In other words, apart from the financial sector, job opportunities in
the private sector were lowest in these skill-intensive sectors which educated Jordanians predominantly
"target" when seeking jobs. Going forward, the government has identified eight priority clusters in the
Jordan 2025 Vision. If employment patterns persist and if the modernization of traditional sectors does not
take place, the chosen clusters will not absorb the Jordanian youth bulge or meet their aspirations.

Inequality based on gender is widely documented. One driver is reflected in the country’s justice/legal
system and relates to the legal status of women in disputes and the embedding of family power differentials
in legal processes (World Bank Jordan Country Gender Assessment, 2013).16 A second driver relates to
the very low levels of female participation in the labor force and in the country’s political system and relates
to the interaction of cultural factors with market distortions which discourage female participation in a
variety of spheres.

Women face particular obstacles and disincentives to economic participation. Even within the MENA
region, where countries have some of the world’s lowest female labor force participation rates, Jordan’s
participation rate lies in the bottom half, below the regional average of 25 percent. In 2014, the female labor
force participation rate in Jordan was about a fifth of that of males (12.6 percent versus 59.7 percent).
Despite many efforts directed toward enhancing women’s role in the society and in the economy, there has
been little actual progress in women’s economic participation. In 2011, women represented less than 20
percent of the total labor force in Jordan.

Jordan has strong legal protections against marginalization and exclusion based on ethnicity,
religion, and disability. The Kingdom’s small ethnic Chechen and Circassian minorities benefit from legal
equality by virtue of their longstanding residency, and there is little discrimination against them. They also
receive favorable political treatment due to their historic reputation for regime loyalty; for instance,
Circassians are overrepresented in parliament via a 3-seat House of Deputies quota. Individuals with
disabilities also enjoy improving treatment. Jordan leads the region in disability accommodation, as
signified by the 2007 Rights of Persons with Disability Law, even though enforcement throughout private
workplaces and public institutions has been imperfect. In the religious sphere, official statutes ensure
adequate freedoms. More than 90 percent of the country identifies with Sunni Islam, something that
Jordanians of both naturalized and incumbent national heritage share. However, non-Muslim minorities, in
particular the Christian minority, benefit from powerful legal protections guarding the establishment of
their own houses of worship and the practice of their faiths. Christians are also overrepresented in the
political system.

Arab refugees in Jordan face significant obstacles to economic participation. Widespread prejudice
handicaps the social advancement of the kingdom’s several hundred thousand Iraqi refugees, despite
national efforts to extend the provision of public goods like education and healthcare. Professional
employment remains elusive for many Iraqis. Although the Government and the people have been
welcoming of Syrian refugees, building refugee camps and offering basic services, few Jordanians are ready
for large-scale integration of Syrians into their population on a permanent basis.

Chapter 3 Conceptual framework

The SCD posits that geopolitical rent – income that accrues to Jordan because of its stable status over
and above a return to productive activities – is essential to understanding the country’s policy
framework and apparent rigidities therein. Although rents are most obvious when they take the form of
grants and below-market financing from regional and global actors, they are also present in other flows
linked to Jordan’s stability and regional role. For example, Jordan’s proximity to the GCC, its status as a
fellow monarchy and long-standing cultural and social links mean that Jordan receives substantial tourism
and sector investments (notably property) from the GCC. Remittances also underpin the Jordan-GCC
linkage.

In effect, Jordan is exporting stability but importing Dutch Disease. While these flows are in general
beneficial to Jordan, they originate from an oil-rich region and in effect transmit oil sector volatility and
syndromes to Jordan. In fact, a range of factor market phenomena in Jordan including high reservation
wages due to subsidies and remittances, dominance of non-traded sectors, and concerns about
competitiveness of exports all correspond to characteristics of resource-rich countries.

These rents interact with domestic social stresses, deficient risk management, and functioning of
factor markets to generate the development outcomes that we observe. A logical consequence of the
SCD focus on risk management is that insurance and mitigation mechanisms – and possible associated
distortionary effects – need to be part of the analysis. Although Jordan’s dialogue with its external partners
focuses on the need for resources for coping with costly shocks, the resulting resource inflow means that
Jordan’s risk management should also incorporate opportunity – the possibility of gain. But since it is
impossible even for the best-intended partners to design perfectly state-contingent payments for Jordan’s
risk chain, these inflows take on characteristics of unearned income and insurance. As such, they can create
disincentives for protective action (“moral hazard”), weaken accountability, and shorten time horizons for
the purposes of developing and implementing policy reforms. In the extreme, Jordan has poorly designed
insurance: enough to generate serious moral hazard (with whatever is the latest crisis being another reason
to postpone reforms), but not enough to prevent transmission of these risks to households and the private
sector.

The rents-risk link is central to the diagnostic: Jordan has developed institutions and mechanisms
for managing risks which have embedded risk intolerance in the government, private sector, and
citizens, impeding growth and shared prosperity. Given Jordan’s exposure to systemic risk, a strong role
for the government in managing these risks is inevitable – and it has often served the country well. Thus it
is to be expected that the government has taken the lead in mobilizing partner aid as major shocks have
occurred. The problem is that a perfectly sensible lead role for the government in preparing for external
shocks and managing resource constraints related to them has extended into a dominant role in allocative
decisions related to the mitigation and adaptation to all shocks, whether internal or external. Drawing on
the insights of the WDR 2014, the SCD argues that many of these roles could be better handled by
                                                                                               17
households and the private sector, if they were given the means and instruments to do so. At the same

time, because the management of risks has come to be seen as mainly a question of mobilizing resources,
major blind spots in risk management have emerged, especially related to labor market effects of Jordan’s
risk chain.

Financing risks linked to rents are embedded in the macro-fiscal framework. Jordan is structurally
dependent on foreign grants –a portion of which can be interpreted as geopolitical rents -- to meet fiscal
balances. Since the turn of the century, the overall fiscal deficit averaged 4.9 percent, including grants, and
10.1 percent, excluding grants. As with growth, three sub-periods - 2000-2003, 2004-2008 and 2009-2013
- are contrasted. For the early sub-period, the overall fiscal deficit averaged only 2.1 percent of GDP, but
this included substantial budget grants equivalent to 8.4 percent of GDP. In fact, budget grants almost
doubled in 2003 (JD 937 million) compared to 2002 (JD 490 million) as a result of the US invasion of Iraq.
The US and other allies attempted to partially compensate Jordan, whose strong economic ties with Iraq
were heavily compromised by the invasion, incurring large costs. The period 2004-2008 was characterized
by high growth and privatization, both of which helped decrease the country’s dependence on grants.
Hence, despite grants declining to an average of 5.2 percent of GDP during that sub-period, the overall
fiscal balance (including grants) remained low at 3.6 percent of GDP.

Deficiencies in the management of fiscal financing risks point to broader problems in national risk
management. Having a reliable public sector funding program is essential for the sustainability of Jordan’s
development and growth. This would imply that Jordan’s growth is stable and does not mainly rely on
foreign aid; if funding is not predictable, projects tend to start or stop according to funding availability. The
lack of a funding and debt management strategy implies large risks to Jordan and its growth prospects, and
potentially large fiscal uncertainty and volatility. By not having a funding strategy and therefore a reliable
source of inflows, Jordan growth becomes more vulnerable to external shocks and dependent on its access
to foreign aid.

The responsiveness of grants to fiscal deterioration is not automatic, partly because local
developments have also played a role in adverse shocks. Serious deterioration in the fiscal position began
in 2009. Lower domestic revenues, arising to some extent from tax concessions to ease volatility in the
Amman property market, combined, initially at least, with higher social spending drove the overall deficit
to an average of 8.3 percent of GDP, including grants, during the 2009-2013 period. Grants, however, were
not as forthcoming as earlier, averaging only 2.8 percent of GDP. As a result, the government resorted to
borrowing, reversing progress made earlier in reducing the debt burden.

Since rents have enabled misallocation of risk, the outcome is a policy equilibrium where major
change is avoided, and the absence of change is embedded in expectations. Households and the private
sector are carrying too many spillovers from Jordan’s systemic risk, so they compensate with heightened
risk aversion elsewhere. Recognizing the uncertainty and inadequate risk-bearing capacity that reform
would create, and since the government has only imperfect insurance, the government is wary of disruptive
reforms. The net result is inertia and stasis, and since there is no real prospect of lower risks, the expectation
that nothing will change is validated.

The parallel constraints to shared prosperity center on the poor allocative functioning of markets for
capital and labor in mobilizing knowledge and broadening Jordan’s productive economic base. There

are several components to this element of the diagnosis. First, there is a set of policy distortions, seen in
many middle income countries, which impede the flexibility of the economy. These pertain to role and
operating model of the public sector, market failures, and specific impacts from being in a resource-rich
region. Second, the aforementioned systemic risk is transmitted – and sometimes amplified – to the markets
for capital and labor, muting the investment and employment response to opportunities.

Geopolitical rents have made it sustainable to postpone product and factor market policy reforms
which would scale up emerging sources of growth. These effects are particularly pronounced where a
nimble response is required to capitalize on Jordan’s latent advantages in sectors such as in transit and
logistics, knowledge-intensive exports (such as pharmaceuticals and ICT), and renewable energy.

Symptoms of a preference for inaction can be found throughout the functions of government. The
frequency of leadership changes in government creates a short-term tactical approach and a tendency for
caution and working below the radar screen. This uncertainty in the decision-making and policy agenda of
Jordan also affects significantly the confidence of the private sector which seeks some comfort in stability
of policies when having to weigh the risks of investing in a risky environment country like Jordan (Jordan
2025). When a major policy reform agenda is set out, such as in the National Employment Strategy, its
implementation is devolved to the level of projects rather than driving forward with policy change. This
narrowly scoped implementation arrangement accords with both bureaucratic and external partner
incentives, since it facilitates control and attribution, while at the same time containing the scope of the
originally intended reform. In terms of the core systems of procurement and financial management, the
operating philosophy is – as throughout the Middle East – an emphasis on ex ante control of all transactions
and procedures, with correspondingly little focus on substance of processes and their final impact.

The ability to manage financing risk is affected by governance constraints. Because of the lack of
ministerial stability, no authority has incentives to implement a debt management reform, and develop a
debt strategy since ministers perceive their time horizon as short. Rather than develop a financial domestic
market and position Jordan as an international issuer, the government has benefitted from US-backed 100
percent guarantees on principal and interest, including US$1.5 billion of issuance in June 2015. This is very
attractive funding source, but it is unlikely to be available in the medium to long term. There has been some
progress in developing more resilient funding through the sale of an unguaranteed Eurobond and an
expected sukuk.

A risk perspective is essential to understanding implementation failures and governance problems.
Examples are numerous. Financial management and procurement reflect an ex ante control public sector
management approach in which minor administrative transactions endure protracted procedures,
supposedly to minimize risk, while major fiscal liabilities accumulate with little action, as in the electricity
sector prior to 2011. There is an imbalance in delegation authority within the government. Front line tax
and customs officials have discretion in routine transactions, which creates unpredictable obstacles for the
private sector and contributes to perceptions of corruption. But in the management tiers of the public sector,
there is little policy autonomy at all and decisions are referred upwards – or worse still, stagnate without
action at a particular layer.




                                                      19
Even though various financial instruments, including structured finance and PPPs, are available to
improve risk management, their use in Jordan has remained low despite the demonstration effect of
the power sector and QAIA projects. Countries exposed to the range of risks similar to Jordan might
consider various forms of financial market deepening to spread risk more efficiently: the list could include
equity, Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), corporate bonds, a substantial range of maturities on government
bonds, and guarantees. Yet in practice the government has relied primarily on infrequent issuance of
government bonds, many linked to once-off guarantees. This makes it more difficult for the market to
generate a yield curve which can price sovereign risk at various maturities. The equity market is fairly
shallow once one moves beyond established companies in banking and minerals.

PPPs also offer the potential to recapture the private sector development momentum of the
privatization era, but will need to be seen as true risk-sharing between the government and private
sector. PPPs were initially executed within the framework of the privatization law and thus managed by
the Executive Privatization Commission (EPC), which has since been dissolved. The new dedicated PPP
law will help open up the possibility for long-term risk sharing on critical infrastructure. The new law could
also help to address some of the institutional problems that have developed since EPC was dissolved. Jordan
has demonstrated commitment to the PPP agenda in comparison to other countries in the region. However,
to truly leverage more private sector investment through PPPs, Jordan will have to address many of the
developmental/sectoral constraints to growth that are highlighted in sections below. In addition, most
potential projects will require a government financial contribution that goes beyond just guarantees. It
remains unclear whether Jordan has the ability or the willingness to support these kinds of commitments
going forward.

Chapter 4 Macroeconomic sustainability

Jordan’s macroeconomic profile contains highly persistent drivers of vulnerability, manifested in
structural imbalances in the current account and fiscal stocks and flows. These have been successfully
mitigated by a strong focus of monetary policy on credibility signals via reserves and more sporadic
attempts to bring fiscal imbalances under control through debt reduction and budget reforms.

Prolonged current account deficits have been manageable due to complementary factors including
transfers and capital inflows within the framework of an exchange rate peg. The Jordanian currency
has been fixed to the US dollar at a rate of JD 0.709 per USD since October 1995. This has proved to be an
effective monetary policy anchor, while also reinforcing price stability; the inflation rate has averaged 4.2
percent for the period 2000-2014 and with a standard deviation of 3.5 it has not been subject to large
volatilities. Nonetheless, confidence in the Dinar hinges on international financial and political backup.
These come in the form of sizable foreign exchange reserves and support from large financial powers.
Average total reserves since 2000 amounted to 6.6 months of imports, ranking Jordan in the top 20th
percentile globally. Relative to comparator countries’ reserves, Jordan is on equal footing with Malaysia,
but behind Lebanon (Figure 4.1). Political support for Jordan’s regional role is expressed though large
financial aid packages that include grants, concessionary loans and direct deposits in the central bank, from
not only the GCC countries, but also the US, Europe, Japan, the IMF and the World Bank.

Domestic revenues fall short of meeting current expenditures. From 2000 until 2009, the ratio of
domestic revenues to current expenditures averaged 92.3 percent, surpassing 100 percent only in 2007. Tax
revenues averaged 16.7 percent of GDP since 2000, reaching a high of 20.4 percent in 2007 when growth
was brisk. Jordan has high current expenditures with the 2000-2014 average at 28.2 percent of GDP,
consisting primarily of military spending (8.5 percent of GDP), salaries and wages (5.2 percent of GDP)
and interest on debt (2.7 percent of GDP) (Figure 4.2). On the other hand, the government has resorted to

cutting capital expenditures in order to restrain the fiscal deficit. This has been especially the case during
the recent post-crises period. As a result, capital expenditures have averaged only 6.4 percent of GDP since
2000, reaching a low of 3.1 percent of GDP in 2012.

Revenue mobilization has been adversely affected by a limited tax base which has been eroded over
time by the use of the tax system for multiple policy goals, manifested in a range of exemptions and
credits. In effect, public revenue is being foregone to achieve policy goals which otherwise be implemented
through spending; these are called tax expenditures. Some were implemented to achieve social goals or
investment incentives but others have proliferated in response to specific shocks. For example, as fiscal
stimulus in response to the global crisis, Jordan resorted in 2009 to large-scale tax exemptions and cuts.
Total tax expenditures in Jordan were estimated by a USAID study at 7 percent of GDP in 2012 or around
JD 1.6 billion. While some positive change has occurred to streamline the complex exemptions scheme in
Jordan, other changes have contributed to the upsurge in the level of tax expenditures, indicating that the
underlying tendency is structural. Tax expenditures in Jordan affect the following tax categories: Personal
Income Tax (PIT), Corporate Income Tax (CIT), General Sales Tax (GST) and Special Sales Tax (SST),
Custom Duty, and Real Property Tax. The special economic zones (SEZs) and the legislation supporting
them offer tax exemptions and reduce other fees, especially those related to labor.

The largest single tax expenditure (2012 figures) is for households: the single and family deduction
allowance (JD 455 million), followed by zero rated items in the domestic sales tax (JD 263 million). The
2010 tax reform further weakened revenue buoyancy. The tax reform simplified the tax code and removed
many specific rates and treatments to groups, sectors, or companies that had been burdening tax
administration and blurring the system. However, in practice, the high exemption thresholds on individual
incomes have exempted over 95 percent of Jordanian households from taxation. Moreover, the highest
bracket of individual income is now taxed at 20 percent, which is low even by Middle East and North
Africa‘s standards. But firms also benefit from goods exempted from customs through various provisions
especially relating to capital goods and petroleum products. Though smaller in magnitude, tax expenditures
from municipal taxes amount to JD 48 million and remain an important quantity relative to municipalities’
budgets which depend on municipal tax revenues to deliver basic services at the local level.



                                                      22
Public expenditure adjustments have likewise seen erosion of gains in fiscal space. The country first
responded to the price shocks of 2003–07 by increases in subsidies, made possible due to substantial
revenue increases in 2004–07 fueled by strong economic growth. In 2008, these subsidies largely were
eliminated. They were replaced however by salary increases for public and private sector employees and
military personnel, both active and retired. The more recent subsidy reform was mitigated by a cash transfer
linked to the oil price, and thus in principle will not be subject to the same offsetting effect that formerly
operated via the wage bill.

Spending on public sector pay and numbers has proven especially difficult to control, due complexity
and loopholes in the pay and employment structure. Given long-standing concerns about the size and
cost of the public sector, the government has implemented hiring freezes, filling only vacancies in existing
positions. However, sector exemptions such as education, health, and military have undermined the freezes.
For example, after being recruited to teach in the public schools, new teachers often shift to other posts in
the civil service. With military spending near 8 percent of GDP, exempting the military from a hiring freeze
blunts the gains from it. Numerous allowances are provided as part of the wages of civilian personnel in
the public sector. These allowances add up to more than 2.5 times the salaries bill. These allowances are
scattered among 10 categories, the largest being the cost of living expenses, additional allowances, basic
allowances, and bonuses. On average, in 2010–11, these represented respectively 37 percent, 16 percent, 9
percent, and 3 percent of the total civil servants wage bill. In 2011 these allowances were increased by as
much as 17.4 percent, whereas base salaries increased by only 7.3 percent.

Ambitious public sector reform strategies have lost momentum by the point at which substantive
allocative choices would have to be made, while upfront costs remain embedded in the pay structure.
In 2011, the government launched a comprehensive reform program, overseen by the Ministry of Public
Sector Development, to tackle civil service employment. The reform objectives were four-fold (a) to
consolidate the compensation schemes of independent institutions and defining unified governance and
wage policy principles across these institutions; (b) to align civil service and own-budget agencies salaries
to increase equity; (c) to increase productivity, re-examining terms of reference for all functions of civil
service employment; and (d) to identify vacant positions that need to be filled through new recruitment or
reallocation of staff, and vacant positions that need to be eliminated. As a result of the alignment of salaries,
around JD 80 million in additional costs was incurred annually during 2012-2014. Savings were envisaged
to begin in 2015, when public sector employment would be streamlined – but there is no sign of this having
taken place.

Debt Trajectory

High growth, privatization proceeds and debt restructuring temporary reduced Jordan’s debt
profile. This drove gross public debt from a high of 104.7 percent of GDP in 2000 to a low of 60.2 percent
in 2008. Starting in 2009, foreign grants were not forthcoming in sufficient amounts to offset costs
associated with the successive twin crises, forcing Jordan to revert to increased borrowing. This pushed
gross debt back up to 89.0 percent of GDP at end-2014 and is projected to further increase in 2015 (Figure
4.5). Despite being mostly denominated in local currency, the share of external debt out of total public debt
has been rising steadily over the last two years, increasing from 28 percent at end-2012 to 38 percent by
July 2015. However, and in order to take advantage of the low international interest rates and political

support, Jordan issued three US backed Eurobonds in 2013 and 2014 and 2015 valued at US$ 1.25 billion,
US$ 1 billion and US$ 1.5 billion, respectively.

Jordan faces risks to public debt sustainability and the scope for further slippage is limited with the
                                                                                                    18

                                                                         19
scenarios: baseline, constant primary balance and historical. The results indicate that, according to the
baseline scenario, public debt is expected to reach a high of 90 percent of GDP in 2015 and then decline
steadily to a projected 77 percent of GDP by 2019 (Figure 4.6). The baseline scenario also projects that
gross financing needs will be sustainable, declining from 26.8 percent of GDP in 2014 to 15.3 percent in
2019 (Figure 4.7). However, debt dynamics and financing needs are sensitive to macro-economic shocks
- growth, primary balance, interest rate, exchange rate and contingent liability shocks.

  The baseline scenario assumes that real GDP growth is 3.3 and 4.0 percent in 2013 and 2014, respectively, increasing
to 4.5 percent thereafter. In addition, this case assumes that the primary balance will begin improving in 2015,
becoming positive from 2016 onward. The constant primary balance scenario assumes the primary balance at -5.3
percent. The historical scenario assumes growth rising rapidly from 3.3 percent in 2014 to 5.6 percent thereafter, and
the primary deficit falling from -5.3 percent in 2014 to -3.6 percent thereafter.

Debt projections for Jordan have been subject to extraordinary “base drift” i.e. upward shocks to the
baseline in any year appear to be permanent in subsequent baselines. For example, between 2009 and 2014,
the IMF Article IV baseline debt ratio for 2014 increased by 20 percentage points, and the future path for
debt in more recent projections is much higher than in older baselines. In addition, despite the persistent
nature of changes in debt (most clearly for the NEPCO shock), more recent baselines incorporate larger
declines in debt than older baselines (Figure 4.8). In older baselines (up to 2012), the medium term debt
ratio reduction was around 3-5 percentage points of GDP. In newer baselines, it is around 10 percentage
points of GDP. Vision 2025 assumes even sharper debt reduction than projected in baseline World Bank
and IMF forecasts.

Two successive external shocks—the global recession and the regional turmoil—have exacerbated
long-term structural vulnerabilities. Large fiscal and current account deficits have persistently been
financed, to a large extent, by external aid. As elsewhere, aid in Jordan has tended to be volatile, which
generated volatility in Jordan’s economy. Since 2008, as the global environment turned negative, growth
decelerated sharply in Jordan. The onset of the Arab uprisings throughout the region further undermined
sentiment, which led to (i) slower growth and lower fiscal revenues, (ii) and increased public spending to
partly accommodate social pressures (and sustain growth). The Arab turmoil also resulted in interruptions
to Egyptian gas supply, sharply pushing up public spending. As a result, both fiscal and current account
balances had deteriorated markedly by mid-2012, forming the basis for the current DPL and SBA.

Chapter 5 Poverty and Shared Prosperity Assessment

Poverty measurement and analysis in Jordan has become more systematic over time, improving the
scope for understanding the impact of shocks on household welfare. The first official measurement of
poverty was carried out in 1973 and a first full study on poverty was published in 1987. World Bank
assistance on poverty measurement became relevant starting from 1994 with work carried out on poverty
lines and a first World Bank poverty report was published only in 2004. This was followed by a poverty
update in 2009 and a poverty note in 2012. The Jordanian Department of Statistics (DoS) has published
information on household income and expenditure since 1992 but poverty analysis is only available in
specialized reports. Poverty measurement relies on the Household Expenditure and Income Survey (HEIS)
implemented by DoS in 1992, 1997, 2002, 2006, 2008, and 2010. The official poverty line in Jordan is
constructed based on a “cost of basic needs” approach and a national caloric level of 2,347 calories per
capita per day with a consumption mix adapted to the bottom 30 percent of the population (see World Bank
2012 for more details).

Absolute poverty has been on a long-term declining path since the 1990s, with a particularly sharp
decline during 2002-2010. According to official figures and World Bank studies, the poverty rate declined
significantly between 1997 and 2002. It continued to decline between 2002 and 2008 and more visibly
between 2008 and 2010 in spite of a deceleration of GDP growth. The outcome of these favorable trends is
that the headline poverty rate fell by 17 percentage points between 2002 and 2010 (Mansour, 2012). Official
figures are not entirely comparable over time as DoS changed the poverty line in 2008 and 2010 but the
World Bank re-estimated the poverty rate between 2006 and 2010 using a consistent poverty line, capturing
a steady decline (Figure 5.1). Therefore, the general finding of falling headcount poverty that is responsive
to growth seems robust to the choice of the poverty line, consistent across studies and across poverty
measures.

According to the most recent official estimates, 14.4 percent of the population in Jordan lived in
poverty in 2010. Recent estimates based on labor force surveys and cross-survey imputation methods
indicate that the poverty headcount has continued to decline modestly but consistently between 2010 and
          20
2013.

Poverty in 2010 – the year of the most recent analyzed household expenditure survey – was low by
regional and international standards. If one uses the international poverty lines of 1.25 and 2
US$/day/person at PPP values, Jordan shows a poverty rate below 1 percent comparable to that of the
Palestinian territories or Israel and much lower than Tunisia, Morocco or Iran. While the international
thresholds are important to track the global poverty objectives, national poverty lines should be
commensurate to the locally accepted standards of living and ensure that proper statistical monitoring of
poverty is possible. A poverty line which is too low makes the poverty rate low and the estimates and
tracking of poverty over time very difficult from a statistical perspective. This is part of the reason why in
2012 the World Bank advised Jordan to increase the poverty threshold and re-estimate poverty changes
since 2006, a recommendation that was endorsed by the government and that resulted in the new estimates
                                     21
shown in Figure 5.1.

Poverty in Jordan is significantly higher among larger households and those with less educated heads.
In 2010, a typical poor household was urban, had 8 members, half of them children, and a household head
with less than primary education. A quarter of the poor are in households with more than 9 members. A
typical non-poor household has 6 members with 3 dependents, and at least some level of secondary
education. The link between household size and poverty sharpened between 2006 and 2010 (comparable
surveys) and in all likelihood has been reinforced by direct and spillover effects of the Syrian influx.
Between 2006 and 2010, the share of the poor who belong to households whose heads have basic education
or less has increased; these households account for 80 percent of the poor and face poverty rates around 20
percent.

There is not a strong bivariate link between labor force status and poverty, but this is related to the
pervasiveness of female non-participation and the size of the public sector. Employment rates are
similar for poor and non-poor households, while poor households have an unemployed household head at
around twice the rate of non-poor households, noting however that unemployment accounts for a relatively
small share of the Jordanian labor force. Jobs in public administration and the social sectors span across a
wide range of households, so that at the surface, poverty is not related to lack of access to public sector
jobs. However, the sector of employment still matters; for example those employed in transport are more
likely to be poor, while those employed in finance, insurance and real estate are much less likely to be poor.

The financial crisis of 2008-09 appears to have weakened the link between employment status and
consumption, suggesting that adverse macroeconomic shocks were accompanied by a deterioration
in job quality. This is determined by World Bank analysis of the relationship between poverty and
employment status in the 2006 and 2010 household surveys. In 2006, employment in public administration
reduced the marginal probability of being poor by 3.4 percent, but this effect was insignificantly different
from zero in 2010. Similar effects are present for manufacturing and mining, commerce, and transport, and
for some sectors, the effect actually changed to the undesired direction between the two years (e.g.
employment in social sectors has a small but positive association on the likelihood of poverty in 2010). For
the probability of being in the bottom 40, employment in public administration reduced this by 4.5 percent

 The new poverty line was set at JD 813.7 per person at 2010 prices, which translated into US$3.42 per day in 2005
PPP terms, as measured by the World Bank.

in 2006, but insignificantly in 2010. This finding provides an important welfare dimension to the fiscal
strains discussed in section V.

The indicator of shared prosperity has showed positive trends between 2006 and 2010 in line with
regional and international indicators. Shared prosperity is measured as the consumption growth of the
bottom 40 percent (B40) of the population. Jordan has experienced positive developments between 2006
and 2008 and then again between 2008 and 2010 with an annual average B40 growth between 2006 and
2010 of 2.7 percent (Table 5.1). This average growth rate has been marginally higher than the growth rate
for the population as a whole indicating that the B40 performance has been positive in absolute and relative
terms. This performance has been better than West Bank and Gaza and Iraq but worse than Morocco or
Tunisia. When compared with the shared prosperity indicator now available for 72 countries worldwide,
Jordan appears to be around median values. Compared to upper middle income countries, Jordan’s
performance was rather modest.

The indicator of shared prosperity may hide more complex poverty dynamics, particularly between
2006 and 2008. World Bank estimates using an updated poverty line show a marginal decline of 0.8
percentage points between 2006 and 2008, which is consistent with the growth incidence curve (GIC)
showing positive growth rates for the poor. As we observe quintiles of households rather than the same
households over time, it is possible that some re-ranking across households occurred during the period. This
would change the profile of the GIC and is something that is not possible to capture with available data.
The absolute performance of the bottom 40 percent is much less complex to interpret for the period 2008-
2010. The GICs show positive growth rates for all quintiles and well above zero, averaging around 5
percent. But the growth rates of the poorer quintiles have been inferior to those of the richer quintiles. As
the concept of shared prosperity focuses on the absolute performance, this concept hides the more complex
relative picture for the period 2008-2010, which may be indicative of differential exposure to shocks, or
coping strategies, during the latter period.

Welfare inequality shows an erratic trend between 2006 and 2010 and this is explained by asymmetric
growth across quintiles. The Gini coefficient calculated with the expenditure aggregate shows a decline
between 2006 and 2008 (-1.5 percentage points) and an increase between 2008 and 2010 (+1.1 percentage
points). This is explained by asymmetric growth across quintiles as shown by the GICs (Figure 5.2). During
the first period, the very poor did better than any other quintile and this resulted in a reduction in overall
inequality. During the second period, the bottom quintiles did worse than upper quintiles and this resulted
in a marginal growth in inequality. However, this second period saw much larger growth on average for all

quintiles and a reduction in poverty as opposed to the first period. Therefore, poverty reduction came partly
at the expenses of inequality.

Household vulnerability is embodied in the risk of transient and seasonal poverty, to which the bulk
of the bottom 40 percent is exposed. Jordan’s official poverty statistics are updated annually based on
other surveys conducted since the 2010 household survey. However, a look at household consumption
trends on a quarterly basis from labor force surveys provides a unique perspective into the nature of the
poor and the vulnerable population in Jordan (Dang et al, 2015). For example, 18.6 percent of the population
in Jordan, although non-poor according to the official definition, experiences poverty in at least one quarter
during the year. These are the “transient poor” in the sense that they experienced poverty in at least one
quarter during the year, despite being officially considered as non-poor because their annual per capita
consumption exceeds the annual poverty line. Transient poverty is experienced across the income
distribution, including some lower-middle and a few middle income households. Overall, 33 percent of the
population in Jordan (18.6 percent transient poor and 14.4 percent official poor) experiences poverty during
at least one quarter of the year (Mistiaen and Serajuddin, 2013). This has implications for policy. For
example, based on annual poverty rates, the annual minimum cost of eliminating poverty is an estimated
JD 139 million, assuming resources could be perfectly targeted to the poor. If, however, the goal is to
prevent the population from falling into poverty during any quarter of the year, the cost would rise to about
JD 200 million (+44 percent).

Inequality in welfare may have more profound roots in inequality of opportunities. Work conducted
in Jordan on the Human Opportunity Index (HOI) shows that education achievements are strongly related
to family characteristics while access to services is highly related to regional location. These are
circumstances inherited by children that can have long-term consequences on the welfare of future adults
and provide a counter scenario to the one depicted for transient poverty. Combatting poverty and inequality
in the short (quarter), medium (year) and long-term (generation) period requires a combination of different
measures and one should be clear about whether the approach is addressing mutable characteristics over
some time period or the mechanism by which the characteristic is linked to outcomes.

Poverty reduction was driven by a favorable configuration of economic growth and fiscal space, but
these factors had run their course by 2010. Mansour (2012) uses a series of welfare decomposition
methods to assess the drivers of welfare change between 2002 and 2010. The paper finds that economic
growth has been the main driver with over 83 percent of the reduction in the poverty headcount attributable
to mean expenditure growth and about 12 percent attributable to redistribution, with the rest unaccounted
for. In turn, expenditure growth was attributable to job creation, especially in the public sector. The role of
income from rents has increased as compared to income from labor, pointing to the role of the real estate
market. Improved access to public utilities and services are also two notable factors that increased welfare,
enabled by higher public spending.

Employment also contributed positively to increases in welfare and reductions in regional welfare
disparities, reflecting the pattern of growth in Jordan. Big contributions to welfare came from
employment growth in selected sectors such as finance, real estate, mining and household services and these
sectors increased in importance between 2002 and 2010 with the exception of real estate. There was an
interaction between employment and location as northern governates and trade and tourism sectors fared
well during this period, reflecting both public expenditure which benefited these regions but also the
upsurge in trade with Syria. Both factors have been unable to play the same positive role since the fiscal
crisis and Syrian conflict.

The spatial distribution of poverty is very unequal but also very different depending on whether the
objective is to reduce the number of poor or the share of the poor. Poverty is higher in rural areas and
lower in urban areas but also diverse across regions. According to World Bank (2008), the poverty rate in
2006 varied from 9.4 percent in Amman to 23 percent in Mafraq. Poverty estimates at subnational level
need to be interpreted with caution due to the sampling structure and the lack of statistical representativeness
for some of the regions (World Bank 2012). However, differences between urban and rural areas are robust
while regional diversity is visible in most survey and non-survey indicators.

Regional diversity may have been accentuated by the influx of Syrian refugees starting from 2011.
Syrian refugees have mostly concentrated in the northern regions of Jordan, Mafraq in particular, which
was already the poorest region in Jordan. Naturally, the regional diversity related to the number of poor
may not correspond to the regional diversity shown by the share of poor in the regions. The majority of
poor people live in the highly populated areas. Amman, for example, which is the region with the lowest
poverty rate, has also the highest share of the poor in Jordan. Hence poverty reduction measures are most
effective and cost-efficient in urban areas even if these areas have lower poverty rates.

Poverty and Access to Infrastructure Services

Poverty scenarios in Jordan are closely linked to energy sector pricing as reforms to tackle
sustainability deepen. Tariffs for electricity in the household sector were far below recovery prices during
the era of elevated oil prices and the country accumulated a public debt of over JD 2bn generated by the
regulatory decision not to increase tariffs when oil prices were high. A combination of diversification of
power sources, the oil price decline, and tariff adjustments have greatly eased generation cost pressures,
but electricity tariffs remain well below cost recovery and subsidies to water production are substantial.
Depending on the type of tariffs’ structure reform one may want to simulate, the complete elimination of

                                                      31
electricity subsidies are estimated to reduce welfare of the poor by as much as 6 percent and increase the
poverty rate by as much as 2.4 percentage points. These are significant impacts considering that the share
of electricity spending in total household expenditure for the poorest quintile is 3.5 percent at the most.
Tariff adjustments so far have been successfully calibrated to have low impact on most households, not just
the bottom 40 percent. But sensitivities could increase as gradual price adjustments continue and unwinding
of cross-subsidies in the system brings more households above base usage thresholds.

The mobility of the poor is impeded by high cost of, and difficult access, to transport. Transport costs
in Jordan are higher than those in developed countries, in relative terms, but also in absolute terms, and are
a considerable share of households’ expenditures. The share of transport and communication expenditures
in total consumption is around 16.2 percent in Jordan based on 2010 household expenditure data. The share
increases with wellbeing from 11 percent among the poorest bottom quintile to 19 percent among the
wealthiest households. Since that survey, the removal of subsidies and the decline in oil prices will have
had somewhat offsetting effects. A recent study by USAID estimates that on average, about 23 percent of
employed youth salary is allocated to transportation costs. These percentages vary however between
different areas of the country and can reach a high of 46 percent of salary in Southern Shouneh area for
example. They pay an average of JD 1.9 for transportation to and from work each day, while the monthly
salary averages JD 202.

The National Employment Strategy (NES) recognizes several barriers to youth employment
including transportation. Inefficient and costly transport is creating increased disparities between Amman
and the regions. Economic activity is mainly concentrated in Amman, and poor transportation is
contributing to that as industries and services are promoted to reallocate to the capital to be closer to demand
and population centers. Any reform for economic and political decentralization, while very welcomed,
requires the improvement of the transportation connectivity as an essential prerequisite.

The lack of public transportation and the high transportation costs disadvantage the poor while
making it more difficult to address congestion and environmental externalities through pricing. The
rural poor can’t afford housing in the capital where employment opportunities are, and the commute to
Amman is both expensive and time consuming. There is no reliable public transport system which requires
the urban poor to use outdated, overcrowded, and unsafe buses and microvans to meet their transportation
needs. On the other hand, precisely because of its informality and lack of scale, the transport sector primarily
employs low skilled labor, mostly from poor households. Truck drivers, bus and microbus owners and
drivers, taxis, airline companies, ports all employ largely low skilled labor hailing from poor household.
The construction of transport infrastructure (roads, bridges) also employs poor and unskilled labor.

Jordan’s income and poverty data point to the existence of poverty pockets and of income inequalities
across regions, even though the number of poor is highest in the Greater Amman area. Regional disparities
are also reflected across a wide range of indicators including access to basic services - health, education,
water and sanitation, investments, employment opportunities and affordable housing, real estate and
transportation. This perceived marginalization of rural areas could explain why a lot of political dissent and
calls for political and economic reforms over the past few years have been led by East Bankers and amongst
the most critical voices are tribal leaders, military retirees and youth movements who were organizing
periodic demonstrations in rural and poorer governorates like Karak, Tafileh, Maan and Jarash. Lack of


                                                      32
opportunities outside the capital could also explain the evident radicalization amongst communities in those
areas, particularly amongst the poor.


Poverty in the Syrian influx

Recently published World Bank analysis has shed more light on the poverty profile of Syrian
refugees, but there is not as yet a harmonized assessment of poverty among refugees and residents
(Verme et al, 2015). The analysis shows that refugee poverty follows particular trajectories depending
where they flee from and where they settle in Jordan. For example, refugees coming from the Syrian
governorates of Aleppo and Damascus and going to the Jordan governorate of Tafilah are among the
poorest. Many among these refugees had been already displaced before the crisis due to the persistent
drought in the northeast of Syria and this affected poor agricultural workers who moved to the urban centers
such as Aleppo and Damascus in search of work during the years that preceded the revolution. Another
useful angle is to look at the time of entry into the country. The group that entered Jordan before the Syrian
crisis and the latest group of entrants have the lowest poverty rates while the peak of poverty is associated
with those who entered in 2012 and 2013 which coincides with the peak of the crisis. As one would expect,
refugees who entered Jordan illegally suffer from higher poverty irrespective of the point of entry.

There are very strong legacy effects in the poverty profile of Syrian refugees. For example, family
composition and previous occupation are also significant correlations of refugee poverty. Poverty is the
highest for the age group 35-49 presumably because this is the group with the largest number of children
in young age, and each additional child is strongly associated with increased poverty. For the same reason,
poverty is also higher for married and engaged people as opposed to other marital status group. Single
people have the lowest poverty rate and this seems to apply also to people age 50 and more. In general,
poverty increases as we pass from white collar types of occupations (pre-crisis) to blue collar types and the
highest poverty rate is found among skilled agricultural workers. Hence, agricultural workers who were
particularly affected by the drought in Syria before the crisis remain the poorest population group in the
post-crisis refugee status. But current returns to skills are very low for refugees. When refugees manage to
work, these occupations do not reflect their skills level. This is a non-negligible loss in human capital and
productivity.

Children are bearing severe costs of displacement. Refugee children face many challenges in enrolling
in educational institutions due to scarce supply, financial constraints, crowding, psychological distress and
other issues that would not normally be an issue for children in regular populations. Only about half of
Syrian refugee children in Jordan attend school despite the fact that Jordan provides free education to
refugees. Human capital investments take years between the initial investment and productivity returns.
Despite this “time to build,” the costs of losing entire cohorts of children’s education in recent years will
be enormous.

Many of the aspects of poverty in the Syrian influx coincide with pre-existing stresses among the
Jordanian poor. As noted earlier, the Jordanian poor tend to live in large households with low education
levels and more young (under age 15) dependents. These needs – housing, education, and support for
dependents – are also those of the refugees. The occupational profile of Syrian refugees also pushes them


                                                     33
into sectors where the Jordanian poor are disproportionately present, such as informal services, construction
and transport.


Poverty and Job Creation

Job creation tends to be oriented towards low-skilled males, resulting in a large wedge between
earnings sufficient to exceed the poverty line and reservation wage of more educated Jordanians.
Jordanian males tended to get around 72 percent of the net jobs created in the economy, 69 percent of which
were created for the less educated males (Figure 5.3). Females took up the remaining 28 percent of net
created jobs, more than half of which went to the highly educated (Figure 5.4). As such, out of the 48,500
jobs created in 2013, only 16,600 went to university graduates, 2,200 went to diploma holders, and the rest
28,700 jobs went to secondary degree holders or below. Given the high unemployment rates for Bachelor
degree holders and above (17.6 percent), job creation was not sufficient to absorb the unemployed.
Jordanian universities graduated around 45,500 students during the academic year 2012/2013, thus adding
around 29,000 people to an excess flow of graduates relative to current labor market requirements.

Even though 60 percent of jobs were taken by individuals without a university degree, these jobs
were not sufficient to absorb the low-skilled Jordanians who faced competition from the foreign
laborers. Around 21 percent of private sector jobs were held by non-nationals in 2013. These jobs were
mainly of low-skilled nature; a mere 5 percent went to non-Jordanians with a diploma or university degree
and above. Further, most of the foreigners working in Jordan had either an elementary occupation or were
service and sales workers (Figure 5.5). Figure 5.6 shows the share of non-Jordanian jobs created in 2013 in
each sector. Low productive sectors employed a higher proportion of foreign workers.22 Most of the jobs

sector shed jobs for Jordanians and created new ones for the non-Jordanians; however employment in that
sector is minimal. The wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles, and transportation and storage
sectors which employ 37 percent of Jordanians in the private sector had nearly 20 percent of jobs held by
non-Jordanians.

Half of all job creation took place in Jordan’s capital, Amman, which had the bulk of the unemployed
residing there but also exhibited the lowest unemployment rates. However, there still exists a mismatch
between where jobs are created and where people reside as job creation in certain governorates was not
sufficient to absorb the unemployed and lower unemployment rates (Figure 5.7). Amman, Irbid and Zarqa
had the highest concentration of unemployed due to their population size; however, they exhibited the
lowest unemployment rates compared to the other governorates where job creation was lower (Figure 5.8).
Moreover, it was the females who were disproportionally affected by geography; unemployment rates for
females in the north or south of Jordan are far higher than the rate in the capital (NES 2011-2020)1.

Chapter 6 Constraints

The SCD dual hypotheses of deficient risk management and distorted factor markets are both
aggregations of, and manifested in, sector level constraints. In other words, the SCD is arguing that
Jordan’s challenges in achievement of the twin goals – and unlocking of opportunities for doing so – need
an integrated analysis which sets out the constraints at two levels of aggregation. First, for each sector, how
individual constraints contribute to general problems with management of risk and functioning of markets.
And second, how these general problems are manifested at the sector level. While these interactions are
simultaneous, they have distinctive elements at the sector and aggregate level. These distinctive elements
in turn reflect the overarching components of the conceptual framework discussed earlier, namely Jordan’s
access to geopolitical rents and the sustainability of the domestic political bargain in the country.

The purpose of this section is to apply the two hypotheses to key sectors of the economy and distill
from the sector analysis a set of constraints which correspond to the hypotheses. The analysis will
proceed by initially setting out major shortcomings and challenges that have been identified in initial inputs
from the World Bank Group sector specialists. These will then be recast to show their relationship to the
SCD hypotheses. As will be seen, this will lead to the emergence of a common constraint across many
sectors – “implementation” – and a set of constraints within the sectors. Sector teams prioritized within and
across the constraint set, as explained further below.

Business Climate

The critical sign that Jordan’s business climate is not conducive to exploiting opportunity is the
inability to sustain high investment whether domestically or foreign sourced. While Jordan benefitted
from privatization-driven inflows in early 2000s, there has been a major drop in FDI since the spillover
from the global financial crisis of 2008. Gross capital formation had decreased to less than 10 percent of
GDP by 2011. The impact of the global financial crisis exposed the vulnerability of the Jordanian economy
to external shocks. The economy experienced a drop in FDI inflow of more than 30 percent during the
recent period of 2008 – 2011.

While part of the explanation for the post-2008 FDI decline is risk exposure, structural factors are
also at play. These are exemplified in a dire Doing Business (2016) ranking of 113, which in turn reflects
particularly poor showings on getting credit (185), protecting minority investors (163), and resolving
insolvency (146). These components of the rankings are intrinsic to the confidence of creditors or investors
to participate in the creation or expansion of businesses. Important strides are needed to streamline
regulations for business, and more importantly ensure effective implementation and equal enforcement to
all businesses.

Evidence of uneven implementation business administrative performance is revealed in the results of
the 2013-14 Enterprise Survey. As seen in the charts below, medium and large, and manufacturing firms
all experience greater delays in public service provision relative to smaller and service-oriented firms. This
probably reflects the lower burden of public service dependency of these smaller and service sector
businesses. The variability and uncertain quality of public service delivery (particularly for the key services
of water and electricity connections and award of construction permits) is further evidence for why

                                                      37
investment in manufacturing and more employment-intensive industries is constrained and reflects a
deepened risk-averse posture.

A number of non-traded sectors remain closed to foreign investors and suffer from lack of
competition and discretionary tax exemptions which sustain privileged firms and raises costs for
exporters. Compared to the 50 countries included, Jordan ranks relatively high in the OECD FDI
restrictiveness index, mainly due to the equity restrictions in a large number of sectors, in particular




                                                         38
                                                               24
transport, distribution and construction. This is despite the demonstrated success of FDI in sparking job
growth in domestic firms which supply foreign firms – gains which outweighed the job losses in direct
competitors to the foreign entrants (Jobs or Privileges report). The current review of Jordan’s investment
regulations offers an opportunity to address that, by lifting some restrictions on foreign investment in
sectors that are usually open in other countries, when alternative, non-discriminatory measures make it
possible to meet the legitimate public policy objectives for safety and quality.

Jordan has struggled in attracting the right scale of FDI in knowledge-intensive sectors. Despite a
strong ICT base (see Annex 1) the country missed out on later stage investments into ICT (outsourcing and
operational HQ components), medical services, tourism and other sectors that went to the other countries
in the MENA region. The investors moved to other locations that may not have been as well equipped,
partially due to inadequate investment policy framework in Jordan including flux in tax policy regarding
these investments. Entrepreneurs also report being deterred by laws regarding speech, which inhibit social
media innovations. A lack of skilled labor in some of those potentially strategic sectors was also quoted
among the reasons to not to invest.

More importantly, Jordan hasn’t graduated from its early FDI successes to punch above its weight
as a FDI destination, despite the advantage of stability. Most of the investments are market seeking into
non-productive sectors and with little value added (e.g. real estate), and Jordan’s non-mineral merchandise
export base remains remarkably small. FDI did not lead to significant technology transfers, adaptation of
the local market to improved production techniques/conditions or increases in productivity in multiple
sectors. Comparing investment decisions in Jordan to investments in the whole of MENA highlights the
potentially missed investment opportunities. At present, a much lower proportion of FDI originates from
emerging markets and European countries compared to the rest of MENA. Thus Jordan would benefit from
diversifying target markets for FDI, and targeting better quality FDI and strengthen the linkages between
FDI and domestic investment.

The earlier FDI surge did signal the potential of reforms to activate the capital market, but enabling
conditions were not in place for a sufficient time to be transformative. First, the reform momentum
which had been instrumental in improving the country’s investment climate and competitiveness, and was
reflected in its good standing in various global competitiveness indices, has fallen away in recent years.
Secondly, there were a number of incentives regimes which accounted for significant investment and trade
flows. For example, the Qualified Industrial Zones (QIZ) extended the benefits of the US Israel Free Trade
Implementation Act to exports from certain parts of Jordan through a new bilateral agreement with the
United States. This regime in particular, which provided tariff and quota-free entry into the United States
market and streamlined business processing within the zones, led to specialization primarily in textiles and
garments production. This attracted hundreds of millions in FDI in the late 1990s and early 2000s. To a
lesser extent, economic arrangements with the European Union establishing a free trade arrangement also
had a positive impact, but overall export performance to the EU remains extraordinarily weak.

The benefits accruing to investors into Jordan through the various special economic regimes allowed
for quick growth in investment activity that could not be sustained. While special incentives could

                                                                    39
attract some funds, these benefits were of finite duration and not built upon the export fundamentals of the
Jordanian economy which continued to remain broadly undiversified and dominated by extractives, notably
phosphates and potash exports. The current multiplicity of zone regimes further complicates investment
into productive sectors. The recent Investment Law (2014) offers an opportunity for coordination of
investment and economic policies and a welcome broadening of the investment promotion regime beyond
specific projects to the sector level.

Renewable energy presents an important exception to sluggish investment, and illustrates potentials
and pitfalls of the current approach. On the one hand, renewables represent a natural convergence of
needs and capability for Jordan, as the country has good prospects for wind and solar power, and strong
needs to diversify energy sources and reduce carbon intensity. Furthermore, scaling up renewables involves
substantial risk given the long-term nature of investments and dependence on regulatory arrangements (e.g.
for off-take/buy-back); in this regard, the role of a catalytic and signaling investor like IFC has emerged
strongly. As an example, the proposals for solar round 2 are drawing offers of capacity of 250MW at less
8 US cents per Kwh, among the most competitive in the world.

By the same token, prospective investors will benefit from government commitment to the emerging
clarity on the investment framework for renewables. The investment process around the first wind farm
at Tafilah, which is now operational, was done through direct negotiation with the sponsors (Masdar),
governed by a memorandum of understanding. This was seen as a pathfinder project which would establish
market interest. Once the Renewables Law was passed, the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources
(MENR) had the ability to begin a direct proposals process, which is has now done with subsequent solar
rounds. The process for these rounds was spelled out to investors and while there were a few hiccups in the
initial round of projects tendered under the Law, this was more related to timing and pricing as opposed to
lack of clarity on the tendering approach.

The government’s commitment to the PPP agenda has yielded some notable successes in mobilizing
domestic and foreign capital notably through PPPs in selected projects, such as Queen Alia International
Airport (QAIA). A significant component of the current policy agenda of the government relates to
operationalizing a PPP law through regulations, which would open up the potential for large-scale risk
sharing on transformative long-term infrastructure projects, where risk aversion is likely particularly high.
More generally, Jordan’s mix of risk exposures could likely be diversified regionally and internationally if
the right pricing and capacity frameworks were in place.

Despite efforts to liberalize its trade environment, Jordan did not fully reap the benefits of trade
integration, and export promotion programs show mixed performance to date. Regarding trade
agreements, while the Jordan-US FTA has generated a large trade creation effect without trade diversion,
the implementation of the regional agreements (GAFTA and AGADIR) has led to some level of trade
diversion without much trade creation. In other words, Jordan has hardly increased its export to these
partners as a result of these agreements. At the same time, the increase in duty-free imports from these
countries has “replaced” imports from non-preferential partners that normally pay customs duties at entry.
The net welfare impact is negative. Vis-à-vis the EU, Jordan has expanded its exports as the result of the
FTA (trade creation), but to a very small extent. In addition, export promotion and industrial upgrading
programs have helped firms increased their exports to overseas markets, but it has helped predominantly


                                                     40
established exporting firms for a short period and have a stronger impact at the “intensive margin” (export
of existing products to existing markets) rather than the “extensive margin” (export of new products to new
markets). The weak export-orientation of the Jordanian firm is further evidenced by fact that less than 20
percent of those firms reporting in the 2013-14 survey indicated that its primary market is international.
And only 40 percent sold nationwide. The preponderance of firms saw their market as strictly municipal.

Jordan’s business environment is not characterized by a push to develop new opportunities. Only 24
percent of Jordanian firms offer formal training programs for their employees to advance on the
organizational ladder. Only about 13 percent of service sector companies and 19 percent of manufacturing
companies use technology transfers from other firms or parent firms as a source of support for innovation
activities. Over 75 percent of firms surveyed indicated that during the previous 3 years they had introduced
neither a new product nor service or a new or significantly improved method of manufacturing products or
services.25 Only 16 percent of firms had made any innovations to logistics and distribution methods, barely
10 percent introduced new organizational structures or management practices. The government and private
sector agencies for innovation activities have underdeveloped capacities, monitoring mechanisms and
information for them to effective support and implement innovation activities. There is a need for a broader,
more private sector-focused product and process development strategy instead of the earlier near-exclusive
focalization on science and technology. Focus on innovation is key to improve productivity in both
knowledge-intensive and labor-intensive sectors.

Access to finance

Jordan ranks 185th out of 189 economies in the “Getting Credit” indicator of the World Bank’s 2016
Doing Business report, due to its poor credit information system and its inadequate collateral and
bankruptcy laws. This ranking caps off a downward trend that saw Jordan fall by an average of 18 spots a
year between 2011 and 2014. The Jordanian economy has a score of zero (weakest possible) on both the
depth of credit information index and the strength of legal rights index, far lower than those of the average
of Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) countries. This is attributed to, inter alia, the non-availability of credit information from retailers,
trade creditors, utility companies, or financial institutions; the inability of banks and financial institutions
to access borrowers’ credit information online; and the fact that borrowers cannot inspect their data in the
largest credit registry. Jordan also compares poorly against MENA and OECD countries on public registry
coverage and private credit bureau coverage.

For household access to finance, Jordan scores relatively well compared to MENA, but MENA
overall is weak in this regard compared to other upper middle income countries (UMICs). According
to World Bank Global Findex 2014, 25 percent of individuals aged over 15 years have a financial institution
account (UMIC average 71 percent), but just 4 percent have formal savings (UMIC average 32 percent)
while 14 percent have formal borrowing (UMIC average 11 percent).26 Just 16 percent of women have a
financial institution account. The figures for savings are particularly striking as they reveal how inadequate
access to finance and the socio-political bargain interact with each other. 29 percent of households report

                                                               41
saving any money compared to 63 percent for UMICs, while just 2 percent report saving for old age (UMIC
31 percent) and 6 percent report saving for education expenses (UMIC 25 percent). Many households lack
the institutions, the incentive, and of course the income to make provision for these lifecycle events.

Firms rank the issue of access to finance as the second largest obstacle to their operations after the
investment climate. Small firms were five times likelier than larger firms to record access to finance as their
largest obstacle. Similarly, more than twice as many firms in Aqaba, Zarqa, and Balqa saw access to finance
as their largest obstacle compared to firms in Amman. Only 11 percent of small firms in 2013 had a loan,
for example, compared to 24 percent of medium sized firms and 33 percent of large firms. The gap between
banks and SMEs remains large. Over the last couple of years, microfinance institutions (MFIs) started up
scaling to serve the sector after realizing its potential and its needs. MFIs started offering relatively larger
ticket loans for SMEs and hiring people with banking experience to handle this product. The up-scaling
that MFIs are going through is generally a welcomed step though it is obvious that MFIs cannot address the
needs of the SMEs given the funding constraints of MFIs being non deposit taking institutions and the
limited products they can offer.

While levels of access for SMEs are an issue in many middle income countries, Jordan is also
characterized by recent deterioration in critical access indicators. The worsening trend in access to
finance in Jordan cuts across all firm characteristics, from region and firm size to firm age and sector. In
nearly all instances, the basic indicators of access to finance such as ownership of a checking account,
access to a line of credit, and access to an overdraft facility have deteriorated for Jordanian firms across the
country. The percentage of firms without a checking account, for example, rose from 6.2 percent in 2006
to 16.6 percent in 2013, while the percentage of firms enjoying the benefits of an overdraft facility halved
from 40.4 percent to 20.1 percent over the same period.

Jordan’s financial depth is also impeded by the lack of non-bank financial intermediaries, notably
insurance companies and pension funds. For insurance, there is a regulatory challenge: The insurance
sector used to be regulated by the Insurance Commission (IC), however the power of the IC has been
weakened after it was dissolved and merged with the Ministry of Trade and Industry (about a year or so
ago). The market views this negatively as they have lost the independent regulator that weakens the overall
sector. There are about 25 insurance companies in this small and fragmented market where the large five
dominate leaving small players with losses. The small size of the insurance sector in Jordan, as well as the
low penetration results in low profitability (even for large players).

The market for private capital is dominated by the banking sector, which is less competitive and
plays a limited role in financial intermediation, compared to other regions. Enterprises often resort to
the informal sector, family and friends for access to finance. Private sector credit-to-GDP is relatively low
at 80 percent, which is largely allocated to the large corporates. Although banks are the principal source of
external finance for SMEs, only 11 percent of bank lending goes to SMEs, compared to 25-40 percent in
emerging markets. The 2012 Jordan Investment Climate Survey (ICS) shows the large disparities in terms
of access to credit by size of firms. Only 27 percent of the small firms have a loan versus 38 percent of 10
medium-sized firms and 53 percent of large corporates. Moreover, bank financing is mostly working
capital, rather than longer finance, though in overall terms, both remain a constraint.



                                                      42
Overall, the wave of shocks since 2008 compounded pre-existing weaknesses in market
infrastructure, explaining why trends have worsened. The need for approval of a secured lending law,
formation of a credit bureau (now expected to be operational in 2016), enhancing the role of NBFIs, and
modern insolvency and bankruptcy laws has been known for a long time. When shocks moderated during
2004-2008, these issues seemed less pressing but heightened uncertainty since then has highlighted their
importance. Macroeconomic factors such as crowding out from fiscal deficits also worsened during the
latter period; exposure to the sovereign accounts for 41 percent of bank assets.

Prevalence of informality

The weak business climate has very strong labor market impacts by acting as a driver of informality,
which in turn is an enabler of migration. There exists a duality in the labor market where job seekers
with similar profiles and skills get different benefits, and employers in similar businesses have different
labor cost structures due to informality. Informal employees are defined as those who do not have access
to social security coverage. In 2012, 26 percent27 of waged workers still had no access to social security
despite the fact that the number of establishments engaged in social security grew at an annual average rate
                        28
of 20 percent since 2009 due to a change in regulation29. This is because while a firm may be officially
registered, it could still hire some of its employees informally and avoid compliance with the new
regulations.

Age, education, firm size, and sector of work constitute important determinants of labor informality.
Informality rates are very high among youth between ages fifteen and twenty-four. After the age twenty-
four, informality decreases rapidly until individuals reach forty to forty-five years. Controlling for other
factors, more education is also associated with a lower probability of being employed in the informal sector.
Further, there is an important relationship between informality and firm size. Workers in medium size (large
size) firms are 19 (25) percent less likely to work in the informal sector compared to workers in small size
firms. Finally, workers in the low-value added personal services and wholesale/retail sector which employ
a significant proportion of Jordanians workers are associated with an 18 percent higher probability of
                                                                                      30
working informally compared to workers in other sector (World Bank 2013 ) (in 2013, 37 percent of
Jordanian workers in the private sector were employed in the wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor
vehicles, and transportation and storage sectors).

Overall, labor informality is not a “choice” but “exclusion” and is typically higher among the most
vulnerable and poor. Informal workers in Jordan earn on average lower wages than formal workers. The
average monthly wage for formal private sector workers was JD 388 per month in 2010 compared to an

     In 2009, the Social Security Corporation changed regulations and launched a governorate by governorate campaign
     to make coverage compulsory for establishments employing one or more workers, whereas prior to that year
     coverage was obligatory for firms with 5 or more workers.

average monthly income of JD 269 for informal workers. Further an analysis of wage disparities between
employment statuses shows that the self-employed who are mostly informal typically earn less than any
other status. Figure 6.3 demonstrates that the lowest wage category of JD 100 or less has the highest
proportion of self-employed. Controlling for personal characteristics such as age, education and gender,
self-employed are more likely to fall in the lowest wage quartiles than employees or employers.8 In addition
to the monetary benefits, informal workers typically receive less non-wage benefits. About (72 percent) of
wage earner workers in the private sector occupies formal permanent jobs and can get a paid leave against
                                                                                               31
(77 percent) of informal workers who haven't access to any kind of leave.

Governance

Public opinion about governance problems in Jordan coalesces around the view that the country
suffers from an implementation deficit, but there is no consensus on why these implementation
failures arise. For some cases, it is seen as the difficulty of achieving concurrence between the government
and the parliament, resulting in legislation that gets stalled or is diluted. In other cases, it may be the issuance
of regulations which is problematic, especially as this is a more technical process which is more difficult
for parliamentary or public scrutiny. Since regulations have to be within the scope of the law, poorly drafted
laws or laws written with the intention to enable loopholes at the regulatory phase exacerbate this problem.
Finally, problems may be downstream at the level of follow-up of new measures, due to weaknesses in
technical and managerial capacity in ministries, departments, and agencies.

     Informal workers include “informal labor in the private sector" and "workers in households without pay” which
     constituted 44 percent of total employment in 2010 (487,861 informal workers compared to 744,724 formal
     workers).

                                                                            44
There are also examples of where governance shortfalls are associated with a high degree of
discretion, with tax-related investment incentives being an important case. The Council of Ministers
is empowered by law to grant tax relief from sales tax and custom duty on a discretionary basis. There is
currently no clear framework in place nor are there clear policies and procedures to periodically evaluate
forgone revenue to the government from various tax expenditures. For customs administration, there are
reduced tariffs with eight different sectors benefiting from exemption of custom duties on imported fixed
capital for at least the first three years of doing business. The sector exemptions create clear scope for vested
interest lobbying and connections. Other sectors may be exempted based upon Council of Minister’s
recommendation. There are also special agreements including Council of Minister’s decision and
Investment Promotion Law with exemptions generally originating from export incentives. After the
issuance of the new investment law in 2014, and the executive regulations on investment incentives in 2015,
the scope of discretion should decrease significantly, as the regulations clearly stipulate in tables the
exemption rates / durations and the designated sectors. The results of such regulations are yet to be tested
on the ground. Also, the new investment incentives were decided without a study on the costs and benefits
of the prior incentives, and there is no framework in place to update them based on desired impact.

At the public sector managerial level, substantial effort on Public Financial Management (PFM)
reforms has not yet found a balance between streamlined controls and limits on arrears. Instead,
controls are often burdensome while arrears persist, especially in the health sector. The MoF’s PFM
Strategy 2014–2017 emphasizes the continuous improvement of PFM functions. In operationalizing its
PFM modernization efforts, the Government of Jordan could benefit from focusing first on consolidating
the effectiveness and enforcement of financial compliance systems. This includes the enforcement of
budget expenditure commitment controls, addressing tax administration weaknesses that allow significant
levels of tax evasion and arrears, and strengthening the skills of budget officers across the public sector.
Looking ahead, a focus of PFM reforms on downstream service delivery (as opposed to central systems)
seems necessary.

Given the decline in public investment, shortcomings in public investment management (PIM) are
especially costly. Inefficiencies in PIM include: i) Poor project selection that does not transform into
productive assets; ii) Unrealistic time schedules and consequent delays in completion; iii) Chronic under-
execution of capital projects; iv) Cost over-runs; and v) Neglect to operate and maintain created assets.
These weaknesses relate to a range of areas of concern in the existing PIM system including: i) Politically-
motivated decisions in PIM process; ii) Lack of objective criteria for project selection; iii) Unclear lines of
responsibility and accountability; iv) Shortages of project appraisal, procurement and management skills;
v) Perverse incentives for project managers to underestimate risk; and vi) Lack of coordination between
different levels of government.

Effective delivery of public capital is integral to achievement of Vision 2025 and the resilience
components of the Jordan Response Plan (JRP). From the perspective of Jordan 2025 (“A Blueprint for
Sustainable Growth and the Prosperity of all Jordanians”), improved PIM will be critical for Jordan’s ability
to convert its financial support from abroad and its own budgetary resources into productive capital.
Efficiency in capital expenditure has become increasingly important in the face of foreseeable public
funding constraints in Jordan. Many arguments for fiscal space are explicitly about the need to boost public



                                                       45
investment in physical assets such as public infrastructure and/or in social sector facilities (i.e. health,
education, etc.) that contribute to improvements in human capital.

The central theme of needed improvements is to increase integration of public investment with
broader policy objectives. Thus while the quantity of investment will continue to be limited by fiscal
space, the most significant challenge in Jordan’s current situation remains the achievement of a qualitative
improvement in its public investments. Those projects should be funded or leveraged equivalently whether
as traditional on-budget public procurement, or totally or partially by donors, or as public–private
partnerships (PPPs). In all cases, the government needs to ensure that its investments promote welfare
growth and reduce inequalities and unemployment, and that its fiscal risks are well managed. In this sense,
improvements should contribute to integrating all line ministries and other government agencies in sector
strategic planning of the system, as well as procurement processes, budget approvals and execution of
public investment projects/PPPs, establishing a solid foundation for inter-sector coordination and budget
integration, adjusted to Jordan’s priorities.

Transparency and Accountability

There have been numerous accountability initiatives in recent years, but there are also some critical
bottlenecks in the accountability chain. Jordan’s poor performance on freedom of press is reflected in its
score of 42.07 (rank 143) on the 2015 World Press Freedom Index. The Arab Spring and the Syrian conflict
seem to have led the authorities to tighten their grip on the media and, in particular, the Internet, despite an
outcry from civil society. Access to around 300 news websites was blocked within Jordan in June 2013
under a new media law that drastically restricts online freedom of information. Yet, understood as an
approach to governance by which citizens hold the state accountable for their performance, social
accountability has been enshrined in all reform efforts launched by the King since the early 2000s including
in Jordan First (2002-2003), the National Agenda (2005) and We are All Jordan (2006). Jordan is one of
the few countries in MENA to have joined the Open Government Partnership (OGP). In 2014, Jordan also
launched its National Integrity Charter and Executive Plan which seeks to serve the country’s citizens,
preserve their dignity and safeguard their assets through enforcing laws, regulations and instructions in
effect based on transparency, justice and equality. Also, Jordan is one of the few countries in the region
that has an Access to Information Law and a functioning Ombudsman through which citizens can provide
feedback on public services and predatory actions.

The tentative progress on access to public information is a case study on how dispersion of authority
and fragmentation can be used to weaken strong upstream initiatives. Jordan adopted the Law on
Securing Access to Information (LSAI) in 2007, the first ATI law in the MENA region, after other
legislation have been passed to promote greater openness and improve competition in specific sectors, such
communications and the media. Various aspects of the LSAI and its implementation are considered drivers
of failure. These include:

       The absence of a central independent agency to support implementation of the LSAI and monitor
        its enforcement by public agencies.




                                                      46
       The dependence of the Information Commissioner (ICO) on the Information Council (IC) and its
        Chair, the Ministry of Culture, makes this agency’s mandate very limited. It limits the capacity of
        the ICO to challenge the Executive and pressure public agencies to implement the LSAI.
       The ICO is the head of the National Library; he is responsible for the information kept in this
        department and not the information kept in other public agencies. His decisions are not binding for
        other public agencies.
       The process of classification and categorization of information at the agency level was launched
        only in 2012, after the majority of public agencies had ignored this LSAI requirement for more
        than five years.
       There is no use of new information and communication technologies in processing requests for
        information. A citizen wanting public information has to go to the specific agency and fill in a form
        (if it exists) to request it.
       The details and personal data required from individuals requesting information can dissuade them
        from presenting requests for information.
       The Law on the Protection of State Secrets and Documents (1979) covers the secrecy of public
        information, and this has constituted a serious obstacle to the implementation of the LSAI. Other
        existing legislation also hinders implementation of the LSAI, such as the “Law on Publications”
        and the press code.
       The absence of sanctions in the LSAI has contributed to what is currently low compliance, as there
        are no consequences for public officials and agencies that ignore the law’s requirements.
       The broad scope and use of exemptions and the limited success in processing appeals limit the use
        of the LSAI.
       The High Court of Justice is the last recourse for appeals against decisions pertaining to ATI, which
        imposes a considerable burden on the appellant.

Jordan constantly scores higher than the other MENA countries based on its performance in fighting
corruption. Despite this fact, considerable corruption challenges remain in Jordan. In Transparency
International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) 2014, Jordan is ranked 55 out of 175 (Jordan scores 49
in 2014, 45 in 2013, and 48 in 2012; MENA average score in 2014 = 38; global average score in 2014 =
43) and has fallen behind the Gulf states. Other findings on corruption in Jordan have indicated either no
improvement or a gradual decline in key governance indicators that would support a reduction of corruption
risks.

Requests for assistance with public services and benefits in Jordan are generally not channeled
through political blocs but through informal and personalized networks. Favoritism and the use of
influence or personal and business connections to gain favors, such as jobs or access to goods and services,
are covered by a particular phenomenon known as wasta, the middleman who is common throughout the
country and the region and can make transactions opaque and enforcement of existing laws difficult. A
business survey, the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2013–2014, reports that
corruption is considered by business executives to be one of the obstacles to doing business in Jordan.

Despite the recent improvements, the risk of arbitrary and discretionary administration persists,
with negative impacts on service delivery and the business climate. Included among the causes of this
un-level playing field are: i) Weak government accountability, which has reportedly contributed to the

                                                     47
abuse of office and to corruption; ii) No systematic punishment of public officials who take bribes, the
difficulty of achieving successful prosecution of corruption cases, and rare prosecution of high-ranking
civil servants; and iii) Hidden costs reported by companies operating in Jordan, stemming from
bureaucracy, red tape, vaguely formulated regulations, and conflicting jurisdictions. The Worldwide
Governance Indicators, produced by the World Bank, register no significant change in Jordan’s political
stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and rule of law from 2007 to 2012. The indicators
also show a lessening of control of corruption over this period, although this is not statistically significant.
According to a recent survey by the Centre for Strategic Studies at the University of Jordan, 81 percent of
Jordanians believe that the law is not applied equally to all citizens, while the widely cited Bertelsmann
Foundation gave Jordan a lower “rule of law” score. Jordan 2025 sets the target of having a small majority
of citizens (as measured by the University of Jordan survey) believe that the law is applied equally to all
citizens by 2025.

In the context of Jordan, poorly-designed accountability mechanisms can be a contributor to risk
aversion. The attractiveness and irreversibility of the public sector career path make the civil service
considerably cautious; civil servants generally do not make decisions unless they (multiply) confirm that
everyone above them in hierarchy is onboard. Promotion is sometimes based heavily on being around the
longest without making any big mistakes. By contrast, strategic plans usually involve change if
implemented properly, and change involves risk. Reinforcing this is that government officials pushing
strategy implementation may worry about becoming scapegoats for government failures. In the past, the
few officials who had mobility between the public and private sector were seen as especially vulnerable. A
number of cases at Greater Amman Municipality, which were eventually not prosecuted, contributed to this
perception.

The existing institutional setup for procurement in Jordan shows a proliferation of control
mechanisms but with fragmentation and no authoritative procurement policy. This fragmentation has
led to a situation where Jordan’s procurement is covered by 56 separate by-laws including the ones for the
three central procuring entities of the General Tender Directorate (GTD) of the Ministry of Works for
construction procurement, the General Supplies Department (GSD) of the Ministry of Finance for purchase
of goods and the Joint Procurement Directorate (JPD) for purchase of medicine. A comprehensive self-
assessment was carried out by the government in partnership with the World Bank in 2010 using the OECD
Assessment Tool. The self-assessment identified shortcomings in all areas, but the lowest scores (out of 3)
were awarded to the appeals mechanism (0.8), institutional capacity (1) and the regulatory/normative body
(1.3).

The absence of a lead entity on procurement coupled with weak accountability of fragmented
structures severely undermines confidence in the procurement system and makes it prone to insider
or collusive bidding. A political-economy study on enabling the implementation of public procurement
reform in Jordan (July 2014) identified specific issues hindering the prospects of reform, including those
of appeal mechanism, regulatory body and performance measurement among others. At present the appeals
function of the procurement system is very limited. Apart from the hierarchal administrative review of
complaints by the responsible procuring entity, bidders can only have recourse to the court system as there
is no independent form of appeal mechanism. As with the regulatory/normative body, there is currently no
central oversight unit and no entity in charge of the common regulatory framework. Each of the central


                                                      48
entities is tasked with discharging its functions in the procurement system, as well as with the maintenance
and updating of its relevant regulations. This has prevented the establishment of a central e-procurement
platform that could also be used for other processes besides tendering, such as complaints, dissemination
of regulations and so on towards an open government. In addition, the current absence of measurements of
procurement performance further hinders the prospects of reform, since the lack of information about how
the system is actually performing makes it difficult for stakeholders to know if and where improvements
are needed, and how those improvements might benefit them.

Environment and Natural Resources

The extent of challenges and costs arising from environmental and resource management issues can
be elaborated through increasingly sophisticated indices and methodologies. The Environmental
Performance Index (EPI) ranks how well countries perform on high-priority environmental issues in two
broad policy areas: protection of human health from environmental harm and protection of ecosystems.32
Within these two policy objectives the EPI scores country performance in nine issue areas comprised of 20
indicators. Indicators in the EPI measure how close countries are to meeting internationally established
targets or, in the absence of agreed targets, how they compare to the range of observed countries. One
weakness of EPI is that it gives equal weights to all its subcomponents, thus assuming a uniform distribution
of environmental pressure across countries. In reality, countries may be vulnerable to different pressures:
some are vulnerable to water scarcity, others to ecosystem losses.

By various measures, Jordan ranks fairly well in terms of resource management – but this is
insufficient given elevated risks. For example, on the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), Jordan
ranked 60th out of 178 countries in terms of EPI aggregate score. The overall EPI score is developed by
aggregating individual ESI factors (Jordan’s rank in parentheses) on health impacts (60th), air quality (74th),
water and sanitation (79th), water resources (45th), agriculture (55th), forestry (N/A), fisheries (N/A),
biodiversity and habitat (162nd) and climate and energy (20th). With regards to 10-year changes in these
factors, the agriculture rank has improved by 10 percent due to strengthening of pesticide regulations, and
the air quality ranking has decreased by 10 percent due to increases in average exposure to PM 2.5 as well
as PM 2.5 exceedance. When Jordan is compared to its GDP per capita cohort, it performs above the norm
with regards to two factors: (i) water resources (wastewater treatment) and (ii) climate and energy, more
specifically, positive changes in trends in carbon intensity as well as positive trends in CO2 emissions per
KwH. Jordan underperforms relative to its GDP per capita cohort in (i) air quality and (ii) biodiversity and
habitat, the latter of which is not indicative of Jordan’s performance relative to other arid-land countries.

Adjusted net savings (ANS) have deteriorated. ANS, also known as genuine savings, measures the rate
of savings in an economy after taking into account investments in human capital, depletion of natural
resources, and damage caused by the pollution. Jordan’s ANS, including particulate emission damage
(percent of GNI), has deteriorated in the recent past, from 12 percent (2010), to 9.5 percent (2012), to 5.4
percent (2012). This is due to (i) increases in consumption of fixed capital, e.g. the replacement value of
capital used up in the process of production; as well as slight increases in (ii) mineral depletion defined as
the ratio of the value of the stock of mineral resources to the remaining reserve lifetime (capped at 25 years).

Environmental degradation inflicts a cost to society, in terms of mortality and morbidity from air
and water pollution, foregone income of activities linked to natural resource use (such as agriculture
and tourism) and cost of “aversive behavior” (for example, water filtration, purchase of bottled water to
reduce exposure to water-borne diseases). The Cost of Environmental Degradation (COED) in Jordan is
evaluated taking into account both intermediate and long-lived impacts of degradation that occurred in a
reference year (2006). Using a range of well-established and internationally accepted methodologies, the
total COED in 2006 was estimated to be in the range of JD 143-332 million, with an average of JD 237
million, or 2.35 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). If the impact of emissions on global environment
is added, the total cost to Jordan and the global community as a whole would be JD 393 million.

The most important contributor to
Jordan’s cost of degradation is air
pollution, which is highly localized and
accounts for 1.15 percent of GDP. The
impact of inadequate water supply, sanitation
and hygiene is the second most significant,
representing about 0.81 percent of GDP. The
cost of improper disposal of solid waste
ranks third, followed by that of soil and
coastal zone degradation.

The relatively high cost of outdoor air
pollution should be interpreted as a signal
of degradation in selected road traffic and
industrial hot spots (such as downtown
Amman, Zarqa, Fuheis, and so on), and not
as a reflection of overall poor air quality at
the national level. In particular, air pollution
does not affect tourism poles, such as Petra, the Dead Sea, Jerash, and so on. Although Jordan’s aggregate
cost of environmental degradation as a percent of GDP equivalent is low compared to the mean, it also
starts with a much leaner basket of environmental assets.

The continuous influx of Syrian refugees to Jordan, specifically to the Northern governorates, is
having direct negative impacts on natural resource management, especially on groundwater aquifers.
A recent study by the Ministry of Water and Irrigation warned that it was only a matter of time before the
main aquifer lying beneath the Zaatari camp became polluted. Over-pumping to meet the demand of
hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees is not the only risk facing the aquifer, according to the study,
which noted that pollution due to wastewater leakage is already being documented. The influx of refugees
is placing pressure on the local sanitation network. This includes causing sewage to overflow frequently,
according to officials and residents of Mafraq. More than 34.164 million cubic meters of wastewater are
generated annually by Syrian refugees in Jordan. The second refugee camp setting is above Al Azraq
aquifer, one of the most important groundwater resources in Jordan. In addition to aquifer drawdown,
groundwater quality degradation, and a sharp increase in supply of wastewater, most of which is left


                                                   50
untreated, solid waste emanating from both the refugee camps and northern municipalities is straining
already stretched solid waste management infrastructure, including dumping bins, vehicles, landfill
equipment, as well as landfill volume.

Jordan’s National Agenda (2005-2015) adopted environmentally sustainable economic development
as a critical policy goal as reflected in a wide range of sectors, including transport, energy, and waste
management. These were translated into a National Executive Programme (2011-2013), highlighting
specific goals, policies, projects, programs, and indicators. Among the National Executive Program’s goals
were developing water resources and upgrading their management efficiency; achieving security in energy
supplies and diversifying energy sources. Reflecting the gravity of water scarcity in Jordan, the Programme
allocates the biggest proportion of funding – 16.5 percent of the total – to the water and wastewater sector.
In 2010, Jordan became the first country in the MENA region to conduct a national green economy scoping
study, called Green Economy Initiative. Through this Initiative, Jordan identified several opportunities to
kick off green clusters, including renewable energy and energy efficiency, water and wastewater
management, solid waste, green buildings, eco-tourism, transportation etc.

Other relevant strategies include the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources National Energy
Strategy (2007-2020), which outlines ways to develop conventional, renewable and alternative
resources such as wind, solar, oil shale and nuclear. Moreover, it sets a goal of increasing the
contribution of renewable energy to the overall national energy mix from 1 percent in 2007 to 7 percent by
2015, and 10 percent by 2020. In addition, the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Law Number 13
was a law implemented in 2010 to promote private sector investment in renewable energy projects through
the Renewable Energy Fund. This law paved the way for private sector investment in renewable energy
projects in order to enhance energy security and efficiency. Since the implementation of the Law, one wind
IPP of 117MW has been financed and is under construction, while another twelve solar IPPs of over
200MW have signed financing agreements and are nearing financial close. Power Purchase Agreements for
four additional wind and another four solar power projects were signed within 2015. The National Water
Strategy Plan (2008-2022) was also issued in 2009 to address Jordan’s water scarcity challenge. The Plan
aims to develop cost reflective tariffs by 2022 in order to reduce water leakages and promote efficient
distribution of water resources.

Efforts in renewable energy reform trace back to 2005 when the National Energy Efficiency Strategy
sought to introduce a number of incentives. For example, 100 percent exemption from income tax over
10 years was introduced to encourage independent power producers to generate electricity on a Build Own
Operate (BOO) and Build Own Transfer (BOT) basis. Additionally, other measures were highlighted
including the progressive removal of oil and electricity subsidies (to reflect their true costs), the
establishment of an energy data bank, the elimination or reduction of a sales tax and customs duties on
relevant materials, and the provision of renewable energy grants and loans.

As a result of the 2009 oil price shock, the government created additional fiscal incentives. For
example, all renewable energy and energy efficiency imports were exempted from customs and sales
taxes. Grants and tax exemptions were also utilized to promote energy efficient vehicles, and sales taxes
on solar water heaters were removed. There is considerable grant funding to subsidize both adaptation and
mitigation projects with high GHG reduction.

Water and Climate Change

Jordan is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world. Its per capita annual renewable
resources of 135 cubic meters in 2014 is far below the threshold of severe water scarcity set at an annual
500 cubic meters per capita. Rapid population growth, income growth and urbanization in combination
with a fixed supply of total renewable water resources will further accelerate the decline in available per
capita renewable water resources, and increase the gap between supply and demand, adding pressure to the
sustainable use of these scarce water resources. In addition, limited wastewater treatment capacity,
inadequate cost recovery, the high operation and maintenance costs (amongst others the results of the high
energy intensity of the water sector) and the dependency on trans-boundary waters further complicate water
sector management. As a result, groundwater levels have declined rapidly, while traditional surface and
groundwater water resources cannot meet water demand. The Government estimated the projected deficit
between supply and demand in 2013 at 312 MCM which is about 25-30 percent of available internal water
resources (Vision 2025).

Water’s role in the economy is a critical one, but difficult to value. Water is used as a key input in all
main sectors of the economy: agriculture, energy and mining, manufacturing and utilities. At the same
time, water is supporting transport, recreation and tourism. Negative impacts to the availability and quality
of water have effects on a country’s production potential and job creation. Hence, water resources are
essential assets that require effective management to ensure that water can be allocated between its
competing uses in such a way that it enhances prosperity. In a recent report the IMF noted that failure to
manage these water challenges can impede a country’s economic prospects as water shortages can result in
food insecurity, increasing production costs and impeding productivity growth.

Climate change impacts in Jordan will be severe. Total water availability for all uses, including Jordan
Valley agriculture, will likely diminish in the next twenty years. Results also show that climate change
could have significant impacts on rain-fed agriculture. The livestock sector and overall food production in
Jordan have been identified as most significantly impacted through climate change impacts on rain-fed
cultivation and on arid and semi-arid rangelands. An overview analysis of climate and disaster risks for
Jordan points to 3 major risks that would affect Jordan’s sustainability and should be incorporated not only
as risks but perhaps more importantly as opportunities for Jordan to move towards a sustainable economy.
First, changes in precipitation – sudden snow/rainfall and less runoff, which can cause flash floods,
landslides and location-specific flooding. But would also mean less water availability overall and loss of
infrastructure (e.g., rural roads). Second, increasing temperatures – rise on average, which can cause loss
of crops, increase in electricity demand, incl. peak load and some infrastructure disruptions. Third,
earthquake risk due to location in Rift zone. Each of the preceding risks presents opportunities for efficiency
and conservation measures for water and energy sectors; for diversification of rural employment; for better
urbanization and human settlement planning; clean energy/tech jobs, climate smart agriculture.

The Government is dealing with the extreme water scarcity, but recent external shocks have resulted
in rapidly increasing costs in the water sector. The large influx of Syrian refugees and the rapid increase
in electricity prices have further accelerated the cost of providing water and has increased the dependence
of the sector on the government’s budget. The influx of Syrian refugees forced the Ministry of Water and

                                                      52
Irrigation (MWI) to improve existing water supply systems to provide adequate water to refugees and
construct proper wastewater collection systems to avoid pollution of the aquifers. MWI prepared a report
on hosting Syrian refugees cost on the water sector that estimated the total direct annual cost at JD 128
million. At the same time, the dismantling of electricity subsidies and the increase in diesel prices has had
a major impact on the water sector. The sector has a very high energy intensity due to geographical and
hydrological conditions that result in high pumping costs. Between 2007 and 2013, the electricity costs in
the sector increased by 260 percent. In 2014, the IMF estimated the fiscal deficit in the sector at JD 313
million, constituting about 1.2 percent of GDP and 14.2 percent of the total deficit (including grants). As a
result of the persistent fiscal deficits, the debt of the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) had increased to JD
840 million by 2012.

Reducing the gap between demand and supply requires increasingly expensive and complex
investments, although there is still significant scope for managing demand more effectively. GOJ has taken
measures to reduce demand (through non-price and to a much lesser extent price based demand
management measures), but success in reducing demand has proved difficult as population growth,
urbanization and economic growth continue to increase the demand for water. Nevertheless, there is still
scope to manage demand more efficiently, especially in agriculture which is the largest water user in the
country (despite its relatively small contribution to GDP and employment). Directions could include on-
farm water use efficiency and integrated water resources management, improvement of livestock and
rangeland systems, and a comprehensive risk management system for agriculture incorporating risks of
pests and diseases, drought, and prices. Without more emphasis on demand management and the resulting
re-allocation of water amongst users, the country will have to rely on increasing water supplies, which
increasingly will include high-cost water sources such as desalination and wastewater reuse. The
Government has just completed the Disi Conveyor transfer and its future plans include large investments
in desalination to augment supplies.

Because of the low levels of cost recovery, the water sector is operating on an unsustainable financial
footing. Programs aimed to put the sector on a more sustainable footing have resulted in some successes.
The two largest utilities in Amman and Aqaba are currently able to cover their basic operation and
maintenance costs, and both utilities are even able to generate some cash to pay for some of their capital
costs. Yet, the recently established Yarmouk utility (covering the northern governorates) was in a weak
financial position when it was established, and the influx of Syrian refugees has strained its progress in
achieving financial sustainability. The Water Authority of Jordan as the country’s bulk water supplier
generates large deficits, as it increasingly finances projects to develop non-conventional (and more
expensive) sources of water to increase the availability of water in the Kingdom. The increasingly larger
distances over which water is transferred has resulted in the water sector becoming increasingly more
energy intensive – and as a result the sector is now the largest consumer of electricity in the country, which
increases the operation and maintenance costs in service delivery.

As a result, water in Jordan remains heavily subsidized. As in many other countries in the region, water
and electricity tariffs for agriculture and domestic use are heavily subsidized in Jordan. Subsidies in the
sector pose a large fiscal burden. Given the sensitive political economy issues associated with reducing
those subsidies, the Government of Jordan is adopting regulatory, institutional, and participatory
approaches to cost recovery that include measure to improve incentives for water conservation, and increase


                                                     53
efficiency in the provision of water services to coincide with tariff increases. In 2013, the Government of
Jordan was able to cover 86 percent of its current water expenditure but only 59 percent of its total (current
and capital) expenditure. The implementation of the IMF Structural Benchmarks for water shows that the
GoJ is committed to move the sector to higher levels of cost recovery with a targeted program of actions
that aim to increase revenues and improve efficiency in service delivery.

The efficiency improvements are mostly linked to the implementation of projects largely funded by
foreign aid because of the inability of the water sector to fund its own investment programs. The high
dependence on external funding (including donor funding) results in large fluctuations in the capital
budgets, and hence affects the ability of the country to deal effectively with its extreme water scarcity. The
capital budget tends to be highly fragmented because of the high number of projects being implemented at
any given time – often resulting in long implementation times and cost overruns. The absence of robust
investment project screening results in projects being financed and that often do not take into account the
life cycle costs of the project resulting in a crowding out of the capital budget to fund these additional
operation and maintenance costs.

The heavy reliance on a project based approach in dealing with extreme water scarcity has its limits.
As water is key input in most productive sectors, the project-based approach may result in partial solutions
to a constraint that cuts across sectors. The extreme water scarcity should be reflected not only in water
sector policies and projects, but also in the policies of sectors that are significant water users, especially
Jordan Valley agriculture and the industrial sectors.

Jobs

Vision 2025 identifies boosting labor market participation as the single biggest challenge facing
Jordan. At the macro level, the Jordanian economy is not generating enough jobs to absorb over 60,000
young citizens who enter the labor market every year. Major constraints arise from the structure of
economic activity, the large presence of the public sector with market-distorting effects on wages and youth
expectations, and the burden of inefficient employment-related social security contributions borne by small
and medium enterprises. At the same time that unemployment appears to be relatively constant over a long
time span, recent numbers indicate a decline while growth has been slow. Moreover, the high level of non-
participation makes the unemployment rate less useful as a barometer of the economy.

There is evidence of an education-labor market mismatch, with the education system failing to
generate readily employable graduates in sectors with strong growth potential. Several studies –
notably one conducted under the IFC E4E Initiative for Arab Youth initiative – have noted that Jordan’s
comparative advantage in sectors such as business process services and other high value services has failed
to generate clear market signals in the education system to direct more students into these sectors. Partly
this appears linked to shortcomings in general education career guidance, but it also relates to institutional
rigidities in education and a reluctance to embrace curriculum development innovations long seen as
standard in FDI success stories (e.g. the close consultation with global IT companies in third-level
curriculum development in Ireland).




                                                     54
The recent diagnostic analysis conducted by IFC illustrated that these growth sectors are constrained
because of the inability to find hires with the needed soft and hard skills, further exacerbating the
unemployment problem in Jordan, especially among youth. Higher education institutions are reacting
slowly to the needs of the job market contributing to this skills mismatch and the market failure. There is
evidence of coordination failures and incentives incompatibilities, contributing to the gap between the
educational and training outcomes (hard and soft skills) of college and university graduates and
industry/employers’ demands in key sectors such as ICT, tourism, health, construction, for example. In
terms of quality Jordan has 28 universities, and the world ranking as a quality indicator of the universities
is low, ranging from 1,787 to 9,719 (source: 2012 University Web Ranking).

Queuing for public sector jobs is significant. In 2010, about 218,000 applicants were queuing for
openings in the public sector according to the Civil Service Bureau. The queuing phenomenon reflects large
distortions between public and private sectors wages and compensation, especially at the semi and unskilled
levels. In 2010, the average monthly wage in the public sector was JD 412 compared to JD 338 in the
private sector; the public sector pays about 70 percent of private sector wages for managerial and technical
levels and about 150 percent of the private sector for unskilled and semi-skilled levels (Jordan National
Employment Strategy, 2012). This distribution of jobs between public and private sectors is inefficient: (i)
a large number of educated people are under-employed in the public sector and a large number of people
in the private sector are frustrated with few job opportunities or stagnant or declining real wages; (ii) the
public sector, including administration, defense and security already employs 38 percent of the labor force
and is bloated.

It is likely that subsidies reinforce the effect of remittances in raising reservation wages and so
depress labor force participation. Universal subsidies for LPG (used for cooking and space heating) and
bread and free health care to the poor and lower middle income groups are provided by the government.
Since these necessities can be met partially through subsidies, the incentive to work is weaker. As discussed
later, there are also substantial energy subsidies, which are now concentrated on electricity and water due
to the successful elimination of retail liquid fuel subsidies. The energy and water subsidies are embedded
in the operating model of the state-owned utilities companies. The subsidies program for bread and LPG
cylinders are simple in their design and translate into price controls at points of sale which enable all
households in Jordan to access basic necessities, as these are universal untargeted programs. For bread, the
government imports flour at a per ton cost of JD 350 and sells it to bakeries for JD 50. In 2015, the estimated
cost of subsidizing flour on the Treasury is around JD 180 million.

On the labor demand side, jobs in Jordan’s private non-agricultural sector are mainly found in old
large establishments and micro startups. However the country exhibits what can be described as a
missing middle with few young medium- and large-sized firms contributing to employment. Small scale
activities constitute the vast majority of firms and provide almost half the employment opportunities; half
of all establishments are sole proprietors. . This concentration of employment in one-person and micro (2-
9 employee) establishments, which are significantly more likely to be informal in the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA), is disconcerting (World Bank, 2011). In particular, evidence indicates that informality is
associated with lower levels of productivity in MENA as compared to other regions that are at a similar
level of development. The large share of employment in micro-firms is also a reflection of the economy’s
sectoral composition. The economy is dominated by the services sector which tends to have smaller


                                                      55
establishments. While Jordan has a reasonably high entry rate for new establishments, this is driven by the
entry of many small and often informal establishments.

Startups create the majority of jobs in the private non-agriculture economy, although these jobs are
mainly in informal and often low-productivity 1-person and micro establishments. Startup
establishments (aged 4 years or less in 2011) created 154,000 jobs constituting 193 percent of net job
creation over the 2006 to 2011 period. Around 83 percent of these startups employed only 1 or 2 workers
each and 80 percent of them were in the services industry with a large concentration in retail trade. These
types of informal firms that operate in low-productivity sectors often offer low quality jobs with limited
benefits and social protection.

The widespread creation of startups may reflect Jordanians’ attempts to secure a livelihood in an
environment where existing firms fail to generate sufficient jobs to absorb the growing labor force.
Establishments aged 5 to 19 years in 2011 destroyed 74,000 jobs between 2006 and 2011 and old
establishments (aged 20+ years in 2011) created a meager 10,500 jobs (constituting 13 percent of net job
creation in the private non-agriculture economy) over the same period. This lackluster performance is
attributable not only to job loss through the exit of firms from the market, but also to the slow employment
size growth of Jordanian establishments over their lifecycle. On average across the Jordanian economy in
2011, firms aged 35-39 years were only 3.5 times the employment size of young firms aged 0 to 4 years,
whereas those aged 40+ years were around 5.3 times the employment size of young firms. This finding,
however, belies the exceptional performance of Jordan’s manufacturing sector which actually outperforms
employment size growth over the establishment lifecycle in comparators such as Egypt, Turkey, and the
United States.

Among existing firms, and contingent on their survival, young establishments and large
establishments exhibit higher average employment growth rates than old and small establishments.
Young age (of 4 years or less) of existing establishments is associated with a higher average net job creation
rate (over the 2006-11 period), even after controlling for establishment employment size. Moreover it seems
that after controlling for age, the average net job creation rate consistently rises for increasingly larger
establishments, especially those with more than 50 employees.

A minority of fast-growing existing firms known as gazelles also contribute a significant share of new
jobs to the economy. Gazelles are defined as existing establishments with at least 10 employees at the
beginning of the period, and which at least double in employment size over a 4 year period. Only 1.4 percent
of all incumbent establishments in Jordan are gazelles. Despite their small number, these establishments
grow at lightning speed. More than half of gazelles grew at an average annual employment growth rate of
more than 40 percent, reaching in 2011 at least 6 times their size in 2006. Consequently these gazelles
contributed 64 percent of economy-wide net job creation among establishments with 10+ employees (and
40 percent of net job creation among establishments of all sizes). Manufacturing gazelles contributed 47
percent of manufacturing sector net job creation among establishments with 10+ employees (and 35 percent
of net job creation among manufacturing establishments of all sizes).

        Note: By definition, gazelles are establishments with at least 10 employees in 2006, and which more than
        double their employment over a 4 year period i.e. whose average annual employment growth rate is higher
        than 26 percent.

Jordanian gazelles are typically young and either small or medium-sized, and operate in various
economic sectors. 57 percent of gazelles are young startups or young firms (0-9 years old at the beginning
of the period) while 28 percent are older than 20 years. Almost 85 percent of Jordanian gazelles employ
less than 50 workers at the beginning of the period, whereas only 7 percent employ 200 or more. Gazelles
are prevalent across many sectors but seem to exhibit higher incidence in construction and manufacturing
sectors (at least 3.3 percent and up to 8.6 percent, respectively) and lower incidence in services sectors (at
most 2.9 percent).

In the services sector, Jordan’s ICT sector can be characterized as a conglomeration of gazelles as it
boasts over 600 technology companies and 300 startups. In fact, it is estimated that over 50 percent of
the country’s startups are in the ICT field, including telecom, IT, mobile online businesses, and game
development. Over the last decade, Jordan’s ICT sector has thrived due to (i) the concerted effort by the
government to advance the sector; (ii) the drive and innovation of its entrepreneurs; (iii) a competitive
deregulated market; and (iv) increased penetration of ICT infrastructure. These factors have helped Jordan
emerge as a technology hub in the region and attract investment and partnerships from leading tech firms
globally. Despite the sector’s growth and success, it currently only contributes to 1.25 percent of the total
workforce and 14 percent of the GDP. Weak macroeconomic conditions coupled with industry-specific
challenges and intense competition has increased pressure on the ICT sector. These issues are exacerbated
by poor infrastructure, namely reliability of power, secure internet servers and bandwidth availability as
well as uncertainty in the policy and regulatory environment (e.g. tax hikes, enforcement of contracts),
which have constrained the potential for both growth and job creation.

A significant proportion of jobs were created in the low productivity service sectors or in the public
administration sector. The low productivity private sector jobs are the counterpart of the microenterprises
discussed earlier. Figure 6.8 illustrates the distribution of net job creation by sector. In 2013, the main
contributors to net job creation were the public and defense administration (20 percent) and the wholesale
and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles, and transportation and storage sectors (25 percent). High
productivity services such as financial and real estate activities only created 4.7 percent of net jobs in 2013,
a decrease of 4.2 p.p. from 2007 (Figure 6.8). Almost all of the employed in high productive service sectors
are wage employees. Around a quarter of the employed engaged in low productive services are self-
employed indicating that these sectors creating 25 percent of the jobs are often an informal one or two
person firms. In fact, almost two thirds of all self-employed worked in the wholesale and retail trade, repair
                                                                                    35

The inactive population is overwhelming represented by women with low levels of education. When
in the labor force, women face very high unemployment levels, particularly for young and educated groups.
Less than 10 percent of women with low levels of education join the labor force against almost 70 percent
of young female graduates and 50 percent of young females with post-secondary education. A marginal
effect analysis demonstrates that women with post-secondary education and with university and post-
graduate education are respectively about 32 and 57 percent likelier to be in the labor force than their less
educated counterparts.

Married women also tend to remain outside of the labor force. The ‘marital-status gap’ in labor force
participation (the relative difference in labor force participation between married and never married women)
is about 24 percent. Among women aged 22-29, the marriage gap is even larger, suggesting that marriage
at a younger age causes an even earlier exit from the labor market. Despite low participation, women
experience very high unemployment rates - more than double than men- 20 percent versus 9.5 percent.
Unemployment levels are particularly high among the young (age 15-29) and highly educated women
(above 35 percent). Vulnerability to unemployment rises with the level of education for women, while men
with higher education are less likely to be unemployed. The probability of being unemployed decreases
with age, though it does not appear to be affected by the marital or parental status of the women, making
unemployment essentially a youth phenomenon. This masks the fact that women might simply leave the
labor market after failing to find a suitable job after a certain age. These factors point to a large, untapped
pool of resources that are not utilized in the economy.

To address the youth employment and enhance employability, the Government prepared a National
Employment Strategy (NES) for 2011-2020. The NES spelled out a comprehensive approach to

                                                      60
employment creation which tackles supply, demand and institutional issues. Thus the NES included: (1) an
overview and diagnosis of the labor market, (2) actions from the supply and demand side aiming to improve
the employability of Jordan’s labor and the creation of job opportunities and, (3) a sequencing of actions
over the short, medium, and long terms balancing both demand and supply of labor.

The NES has been characterized by a very large gap between the high quality of analysis and strategic
directions on the one hand, and implementation on the other. The NES, reaffirmed by Jordan 2025,
was intended as a national strategy which would set a cross-cutting human development agenda, but in
practice implementation has been split between the Ministry of Labor and the King Abdullah Fund for
Development (KAFD). Perhaps more debilitating to the strategy has been its conceptualization as a series
of projects (i.e. individual activities of training, skills development, and analysis) which in turn are financed
by a technical and vocational education fund which mobilizes revenue from a fee on expatriate employment;
in addition, project funding has come from donors. As a result, the ambitious policy agenda in the NES has
been relegated with government entities instead defining their NES role in terms of the ability to get a
project team funded in this fashion; if a project is not funded, then the respective entity simply drops that
component of the NES. Donors have enabled this modus operandi through their own preference for
appearing to support the NES by funding projects, but there is no sense in which the NES is a whole of
government endeavor.

Economic Growth and Labor Market Conditions

In Jordan, economic growth has not translated sufficiently into better labor market conditions; i.e.
lower unemployment and sufficient job creation. Even during the 2000-2008 period of high economic
growth, employment did not grow as much. Employment elasticity of growth averaged 0.42 during 2000
to 2008, which is still on the low side (NES 2011-2020).36 Employment to population ratios remained low
compared to international standards and did not grow much from 2000 to 2013 (Figure 6.9 and Figure 6.10).
Finally, despite positive economic growth, unemployment rates hardly changed over the last years
remaining in low double digits (12.6 percent in 2013).

Participation of Jordanians in the labor market

The labor force is increasing due to population growth, not higher participation. Overall labor force
participation rates fluctuated around 40 percent since 1993, meaning that less than half of the working age
was participating in the labor market. Male participation in the labor force decreased by 11 pp from 1993
to 2014 (Figure 6.12). As such, most of the growth in the Jordanian labor force has been due to
demographics and increases in the working age population rather than participation rates. Despite the slight
decrease in male participation rates, they are still highly comparable to the rest of the economies albeit on
                                                                                  37
the lower side compared to the MENA region (75 percent) (Figure 6.13) . On the other hand, female labor
participation is very low and not even in line with MENA averages. It also significantly lags behind non-
MENA countries (Figure 6.13). Indeed, Jordan has one of the lowest participation rates for women (13.2
percent according to DOS) in the MENA region compared to other countries such as Lebanon and Tunisia.

     Labor Force participation rates in the GCC are high because they include both nationals and migrant workers.

The inactive population is predominantly female but also young and of low education. A significant
proportion of the inactive females are women who stay at home (78 percent), while inactive males are
typically either students or with means to remain out of the labor force (Figure 6.14). The inactive females
are largely not well educated. Participation rates in 2014 were below 5 percent for females with a secondary
degree or below, but higher than 50 percent for those with a Bachelor’s degree or above (Figure 6.15).
Participation rates for males also increase with educational level to reach the highest rate of 82 percent in

2014 for Bachelor degree holders. Further, controlling for other factors such as age, the 2013 Employment
and Unemployment survey data (EUS) showed that the lower the education level of an individual, the less
likely he or she will participate in the labor force. Finally, around half of the inactive working age population
is below 30 years old many of whom can potentially enter the labor market. The inactive sub-populations
described here are out of the labor force by choice (data from the 2013 EUS showed that around 98 percent
of inactive are not prepared to start a new job if it was offered to them in the next 15 days).

Educational Attainment of the Jordanian Labor Force

Increasing access to tertiary education is reflected in labor force composition, but nearly two-thirds
of the labor force has no higher than a secondary degree as migration to the GCC reduces the
educated cohort. Thus the sharp relationship between education and participation seen in some countries
is muted in Jordan and the resident labor force continues to mainly consist of individuals with low
                  38
education. However, Jordanians holding high academic qualifications have been on the rise because of
the country’s focus on investment in human capital. Figure 6.16 shows the distribution of labor force
according to education. Around 61 percent of the labor force held a secondary degree or lower while 28
percent received a Bachelor’s degree or above. However, the share of university holders is steadily
increasing over time. The proportion of the labor force holding a university degree and above increased
from 6 percent in 1973 to the 28 percent in 2014 depicted in Figure 6.17.

  In addition to having a population with a relatively high share of individuals without a tertiary education, many
skilled and educated Jordanians migrate to the GCC and other countries in the world leaving mainly the unskilled

Despite the increase in university degree holders, specialization and skills supplied do not match those
demanded by the private sector. The problem begins with a tendency towards non-competitive
admissions in many tertiary institutions, weakening at the outset the link between outcomes and
performance. The number of graduates specializing in education, humanities, and non-technical and
professional fields continue to exceed demand, and employers complain through surveys that education is
not “applied” enough. Around 58 percent of graduates from Jordanian university majored in education,
                                                                                                                                                                            40
humanities, and non-technical and professional fields in the academic year 2012/2013. This translates into
a labor force dominated by the non-technical fields (70 percent) especially since professional and technical
fields have only slightly higher participation rates (74 percent for professional and technical fields vs. 67

provided with the expertise they would need in the workplace.

In addition, technical and vocational employment training (TVET) continues to be weak and
fragmented and offering academic and humanities specializations rather than a technically skilled
workforce demanded by the private sector. The challenge is not so much the diversity of the providers,
but rather the poor state of governance of the sector. In spite of a strategic focus by the National Agenda in

weak or nonexistent. In addition, there is a lack of private sector collaboration at all stages which widen the
gap between private sector needs and expectations and the skills taught to vocational trainees.

Non-Jordanian labor force

Besides out-migration to the GCC, the labor force also sees strong impacts of in-migration of Arab
and Asian workers. In 2012, foreign labor formed almost 16 percent of the labor force43. According to
the Ministry of Labor data, the total number of foreigners with work permits reached 286,000 in 2013. The
majority of male foreign labor is Arab; the highest number of non-Jordanian Arabs with documented
permits was Egyptian, followed by Syrians. On the hand, more than half of female foreign labor is Asian
working as domestic workers. The data from the Ministry of Labor is only indicative and does not reflect
the true numbers as undocumented workers are not included. It is believed that the amount is much higher
especially given the number of Syrian refugees entering the country.

Most of the foreign workers who enter the Jordanian labor market are either low-skilled or specialize
in non-technical and professional fields during their tertiary education, and as such, they occupy jobs
that Jordanians can take. More than half of the foreign workers in 2012 did not have a secondary degree.
Further, out of the foreign workers who held a university degree, 66 percent specialized in education,
humanities, and non-technical and professional fields, specializations which are also popular among
Jordanians.10 The supply of non-Jordanians can thus displace jobs from the unemployed Jordanians who
have similar qualifications, especially in occupations seen as undesirable or which have poor occupational
regulation. In addition, the low-skilled and often undocumented foreigners may depress wages at the low
end since employers have access to workers who have low bargaining power and can work at the minimum
wage.

The similarity in educational profile of inward migrants with that of resident Jordanians suggests
that structural features on the demand side of the labor market are playing an important role in
labor market outcomes. With a growing Jordanian labor force and a large supply of foreign labor, the
economy would need to create enough jobs to absorb the labor market entrants and combat unemployment.
Despite stagnant participation rates of Jordanians in the labor market, the total labor force has been growing
due to an increase in the Jordanian working age population and inflow of foreign labor into the market. The
foreign labor supply is relatively large and has increased due to the Syrian conflict and the influx of refugees
into the country. So how did job creation fare?

Public sector bias

The public sector continues to create the largest number of jobs. In 2013, 39 percent of all workers
were employed in the public sector. Despite perceptions of a hiring freeze, the government continues to
contribute to 24 percent of all net created jobs. Employment in the public sector is high relative to some

non-MENA developed countries but comparable to other MENA countries, albeit on the high side (Figure
6.18). Controlling for other factors, the better educated an individual is, the more probable that this person
is working in the public sector; however, given the number of high-skilled labor force participants and the
number of jobs created in the public sector, many stay unemployed, especially females. This is consistent
with the high unemployment rates among females with a Bachelor’s degree and above (26.6 percent).

The widespread preference towards public sector jobs is a rational decision on the part of the
Jordanian population; public sector jobs are stable, well compensated, and are associated with good
job quality and fringe benefits. Two key indicators of the rational public sector preference are that public
servants are paid better and work relatively less hours. The majority of employed public sector workers
earn above JD 300 per month (76 percent) while half of the private sector workers earn that much (47
percent). The average monthly wage in 2009 in the public sector was JD 412 compared to JD 338 in the
                 45
private sector (NES 2011-20201). Further, public sector employees work on average 40 hours per week
as opposed to the private sector where they work on average 44 hours per week. Finally, the public sector
tends to offer social security coverage, health insurance and maternity benefits to its employees, while
coverage of these benefits in the private sector varies by establishment. Given the better monetary and non-
monetary benefits, it is of no surprise that public sector employees do not wish to change jobs. Most of the
workers who wished to change jobs were working in the private sector; they mainly wanted to move jobs

  The differences in hourly earnings between the private and public sector should be more given that employees work
less hours in the public sector.

Mobility between the public and private employment sectors is limited, segmenting in effect the labor
market at the public – private divide and making the initial point of entry into the “right” and
“preferred” labor market crucial. Figure 6.19 shows that most of the mobility occurs within the private
sector and not across sectors. In 2013, around 73 percent of workers moved within the private sector, 7
percent within the public sector, and the rest between sectors. These rates did change throughout the last
few years. Further, most of the limited mobility which occurred across sectors tended to be from the private
to the public sector rather than the other way around (13 percent moved from private to public while 7
percent moved from public to private) reinforcing the public sector bias which exists in the labor market.
The low mobility between the two sectors does not allow in general the efficient labor allocation function
of the labor market to prevail which plays against developing a dynamic private sector that can lead to an
economic and employment expansion path.

Gender Differentials

A wage and occupational gap continues to exist between males and females. The average male wage is
1.24 times higher than the average female wage in the private sector. Taking educational attainment into
account, the wage gap is larger for university graduates than it is for graduates of community colleges, high
school, or below (NES 2011-20201). In addition, females remain underrepresented as business owners and
self-employed. Indeed, self-employed and employer women in micro, small, and medium enterprises
account for only 4 percent of female employment, far below the proportion of males as owners (17 percent

of employed males) (Figure 6.20). Expanding opportunities for females to start their own businesses has a
multiplier effect on employment of females; when females do start their own firms, they are more likely to
employ other females (NES 2011-20201).

Gender-related bias in the economic structure of employment and production tend to distort
women’s economic participation in the labor force. Women have not participated in the benefits of
higher growth in the past decades. Highly segmented labor markets have prevented them from working in
high growth and high productivity sectors. While only one woman over four participates to the labor force,
44 percent of working women are employees in the public sector. Education and health represent
respectively 38 and 12 percent of all female employment and are female employment intensive with female
employment being slightly over 50 percent in each (JLMPS 2010). However, the growth rate of job creation
in these sectors has not been high recently. What is striking about these numbers is how skewed the
distribution of female intensity is across sectors. Nearly half the sectors have minimal (less than 15 percent)
female presence. Very few sectors - activities such as education, health, ICT and other services - have
above-average female employment intensity. Aggregate trends also demonstrate that female workers are
not only locked into low growth sectors but also in sectors with low labor productivity, in particular
education, health and public administration.

Evidence seems to suggest that barriers to economic participation start with women’s educational
attainment, but are accentuated by the way economic incentives are designed or preferences and
social norms shaped. In Jordan there is a clear disconnect between the skills and education that women
acquired and the skills requested by employers, particularly in the private sector. Women are in fact much
more concentrated in studies related to humanities, with very little presence in scientific courses or in
technical fields in general. The labor market outcomes seem therefore to basically mirror the fields of study
in which women tend to specialize. This does not necessarily mirror the demand of skills that comes from
the private sectors, and the qualifications required to join the most dynamic and productive sectors in the
economy, as recent analysis conducted indicates, especially in sectors with high growth potential such as
ICT which has proven in other economies to be more “gender-blind.” Moreover, other sectors with high
growth potential, such as tourism and healthcare, seek more women yet cultural barriers tend to steer women
away from these growing employment opportunities, instead resulting in the need to hire from outside of

                                                      70
Jordan. Women are also perceived as less productive than men and face significant restrictions to become
entrepreneurs.

These norms strongly complement other preferences for public sector employment. Personal
preferences and social norms, particularly applicable to married women, lead to the perception of the public
sector as the only “socially acceptable” employment for a woman as well as constrain women mobility,
geographically and beyond (for instance reducing the ways women might look for a job). They are
accentuated by the way economic incentives are currently designed: generous compensation schemes in the
public sector for instance distort women’s choices in the labor market. All these factors are reinforced by
the lack of adequate institutions or legislation supporting the active insertion and participation of women
to the economic life of the country.

Participation challenges for women begin with the school-to-work transition and are then propagated
by the above factors. The Jordan New Work Opportunities for Women (NOW) pilot project provided
strong evidence on the nature and scope of the challenges. NOW was designed explicitly to support a
rigorous impact evaluation. The pilot randomly assigned 1,347 female community college graduates of the
2010 cohort to one of three labor market interventions: a 3-week soft-skills training course for 300 women,
a 6-month job voucher offer for 300 women, a dual training and job voucher offer for 300 women, and a
control group for 499 women. The job voucher offered a firm a 6-month wage subsidy conditional on hiring
a graduate. Early results from the midline survey indicated that employers responded to clear financial
incentives: the job vouchers induced a 39 percent rise in female employment. Moreover, 57 percent of
women expected to keep their jobs after their vouchers expired. In contrast, the training program received
extremely positive feedback from trainees, yet had no significant effects on employment. A detailed survey
was then undertaken to verify and understand the long-term impacts of the pilot. While the pilot succeeded
in its objective of increasing female labor force participation and helping young women accrue work
experience, the majority of the jobs did not translate into permanent employment. The pilot highlighted
critical constraints to young job seekers in Jordanian labor market regulations: the minimum wage and the
requirement to register workers in social security limited the willingness of many firms to retain these young
graduates after the wage subsidy expired.

Social Safety Nets

As is the case in most countries in the MENA region, the government helps households manage risk
through fragmented social safety net (SSN) measures, and universal subsidies dominate SSN
spending. Jordan has 18 different SSN programs which include non-targeted (universal) subsidies, housing
assistance, fee waivers in education and health services, in-kind and cash transfers, and training programs.
In 2012, non-subsidy SSN programs accounted for almost 1.6 percent of GDP on targeted social assistance
programs, and about 3.4 percent of GDP on food and fuel subsidies, making its targeted safety net
expenditure more balanced than the average MENA country. Moreover, Jordan’s overall subsidy bill is
lower than the MENA average, but it is well above the average of comparative sample of developing
countries. Excluding non-targeted subsidies on energy and food, the largest SSN program in terms of
coverage and cost are (i) the cash transfer program managed by the National Aid Fund (NAF) and (ii) the
fuel subsidy cash compensation scheme which is administered by the Ministry of Finance’s Income Sales
and Tax Department (ISTD).

                                                     71
Other universal subsidies are more effectively targeted at poor households through consumption
patterns. Bread and LPG are heavily consumed products by Jordanian households. Poorer households
spend a larger share of their total expenditure on these two products. They account for about 7 percent of
poor households’ total consumption but only 2 percent of the richest Jordanian households. More
specifically, Jordanians households in the bottom decile, spend 3.6 percent of their expenditures on
subsidized food items, whereas for the richest 3 deciles this share falls to below 1 percent. Similarly, the
poorest 20 percent Jordanian households spend 2.3 percent of their total spending on LPG compared to 1
percent for the richest 20 percent households.

Coverage of existing cash transfers is substantial but not all poor or vulnerable are benefiting from
the programs. Empirical evidence indicates that almost 80 percent of the beneficiaries of the targeted cash
transfers of the National Aid Fund (NAF), are poor, making this program one of the better-targeted SSN
programs in the region. Although the program covers about 100,000 households (500,000 people), the
coverage of the program is not sufficient for all poor (estimated about 1 million or 14.4 percent of the total
population in 2010). The fuel subsidy cash compensation program introduced in 2012, and run by the
Income and Sales Tax Department (ISTD), benefits over 60 percent of Jordanian households (over 3 million
people). Given the objective of this compensation scheme, the main target population is the middle income
households, vulnerable, and the poor who have applied to the program.

Existing cash transfers programs are using various targeting methods and overall targeting is
improving. Targeting methods range from categorical to universal including a mixture of categorical and
means-tested program (NAF) and a verified income and asset tests (ISTD’s cash compensation program).
More broadly, the nature of program targeting continues to evolve in Jordan as the country has engaged in
a series of fuel price reforms, including the price liberalization of gasoline by 2013 and the introduction of
the fuel compensation cash transfer scheme which was contingent on the oil price – and thus removed when
the oil price fell. Compared to similar programs in other countries, Jordan’s main non-contributory and
means-tested programs run by the National Aid Fund (NAF) are well targeted to the poor. Despite its small
coverage, with over 80 percent of NAF’s 80,000 beneficiary households in the bottom quintile, the
program’s targeting compares well even when measured against the performance of social assistance
programs in some countries in Eastern Europe (such as Poland or Hungary) or Latin America (such as Chile
or Mexico).

However, NAF has fairly limited coverage of the poor and vulnerable population with only 31 percent
of the bottom decile receiving this assistance in 2010. Overall, about 7.5 percent of the Jordanian
population received NAF assistance in 2010. Based on 2010 household survey data, out of those whose
consumption expenditure before NAF is less than the national poverty line (JD 813.7), and who find
themselves below the poverty line, only a quarter received assistance from the NAF. The coverage rates for
NAF drop sharply from 31 percent in the poorest decile to 10 percent in the second decile, and the remaining
coverage is for the richest 8 deciles.

The NAF faces a tradeoff between scaling up its current methodology and leakage of benefits to non-
poor households. About two-thirds of NAF’s resources go to those in the bottom 20 percent of the
population, with more than half going to the poorest decile. However, more than a third of NAF resources


                                                     72
go to the non-poor. This confirms that the current mixture of categorical and income-based targeting has
likely reached its limit, and if the coverage is expanded the leakages and inefficiencies are likely to grow.
This is because the poor currently excluded from the NAF are working poor (data shows that the majority
of the poor in Jordan are working poor) who do not necessarily belong to any particular category currently
targeted by NAF.

A proposed National Unified Registry (NUR) will provide a critical platform for the full range of
social safety net and service delivery objectives of the government. The NUR would constitute a single
data base with unique ID information for all Jordanian households. With the NUR, programs could fully
realize the targeting and scale potential of the ITSD cash transfer database, while building on the successes
of the NAF. If realized, the NUR would enable a major increase in government support to the risk
management ability of households.

Human Resources: Education

Public education expenditures – which exclude higher education – amounted to roughly 700 million
Jordanian dinars (JD) in 2011, which translates to 3.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and
10.3 percent of total public expenditures, which is slightly below the comparator country average (Figure
6.21). Based on available historical and projected data in Table 6.1, these shares are also relatively stable.
By way of comparison, the corresponding average for the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
                                                                                                         47

Teacher salaries constitute the majority of education expenditures; this proportion is relatively high
in Jordan as compared to its peers. The MOE employs 103670 people; 6239 of them are administrators
and managers in the Ministry and the regional and district offices, the rest are teachers. All in all, the MOE
is the largest employer in the country.

Jordan is well on its way to achieving the MDGs in terms of primary completion rates and the
elimination of gender disparities in education. In 2008, UNESCO reported that Jordan had achieved
gender parity in both primary and secondary education in 2005. At the beginning of this decade, it had
achieved 95 percent parity in literacy, full parity in primary and secondary enrollment, and increased school
life expectancy for both sexes. Jordan was then ranked 67th out of 128 countries in the “Education for All”
rating for gender and education, indicating that Jordan has made significant progress in providing equal
learning opportunities for males and females.

Efforts by the Jordanian government to improving education outcomes are slowly bearing fruit.
Jordan has an 8 percent illiteracy rate, the third lowest rate in the Arab world; its primary gross enrolment
ratio has increased from 71 percent in 1994 to 98.9 percent in 2010; and the transition rate to secondary
                                                                                                                                                48

background. In order to reduce the effects of this gap, it is important for governments to invest in early
childhood education and school readiness. Achieving universal KG access will take time; meanwhile it is
essential to reach these most disadvantage children with low-cost, effective learning readiness support. In
this regard, the MOE has had success with several alternative interventions which aim at engaging parents,
such as Parent-Child Packages (PCP). The PCP targets the mothers of children who were not enrolled in
KG to promote learning readiness at home.

After remarkable gains in education quality between 1999 and 2008, more recent assessments point
to a worrisome decline in student learning. Jordanian students’ outcomes in TIMSS 2003 and 2007
outperformed that of many of its peers in the region while showing a strong upward trend. However, the
                                                                                                 50
2011 TIMSS and NafKE (national assessment test) student learning outcomes plummeted. There are at
least three factors that may account for these results: (i) the massive expansion of enrolments in secondary
education between 2009 and 2011, (ii) the increase in the number of untrained teachers entering the
profession, and (iii) the negative data collection environment in many Jordanian schools in May 2011 when
both tests were conducted. The results of PISA 2012 confirm the deterioration of education quality in Jordan
although they also show that the dramatic downward trend has stopped.

In Jordan, student results confirm that female students have been outperforming males in TIMSS,
NAfKE and PISA in all subjects and grades for several assessment cycles. This clearly shows that a reverse
gender achievement gap exists in Jordan. While women´s high performance on standardized tests and at
universities are very positive attributes of educational development in Jordan, the low performance of males
and low participation of women in the economic and political arenas are both reasons for significant
concern. More specifically, the stagnation of male educational attainment might be a precursor to low
employment and weak earning opportunities in the future, particularly for those with low socioeconomic
                        51
backgrounds.

Disparities exist along rural and urban lines, causing students in rural areas to fall behind. This is
clearly seen in international assessments where Jordan’s students do well on international educational tests
compared to the region, but they fall near or below the international average and stark disparities exist
between urban and rural areas.

Sector-level constraints have been identified as follows:

       Limited capacity within the MOE to implement meaningful reforms and hold the education
        system accountable, plan and use data, and effectively put policies into practice. For instance,
        although Jordanians have the highest literacy rates in the region, a recent USAID-funded early
        grade reading assessment found that the majority of students are not reading with fluency and lack
        the foundational literacy skills normally taught in first grade.
       The education system suffers from low internal efficiency. Most recently, the pass rate for the
        2014 General Secondary Certificate Examination was 40 percent. Of the 57,141 students who sat
        for the exam, only 22,974 students passed.
       Teacher recruitment procedures and deployment practices are highly centralized and
        inflexible, ultimately impacting the quality of the teaching labor force. The increase in the
        number of not sufficiently trained novice teachers in Jordanian classrooms could perhaps be the
        greatest constraint for education quality in the country. The four-month induction course for newly
        appointed teachers (reaching only 16 percent of new teachers) can only be a temporary replacement
        of a modern pre-service training system in cooperation with tertiary institutions. Moreover, the role
        of MOE in the selection, recruitment and deployment of new teachers is still extremely limited and
        the issues of teacher shortages in certain curriculum areas, gender imbalance, and inefficient
        distribution of teachers are far from being addressed satisfactorily
       The influx of Syrian refugees is creating strain on the public education system and requires
        additional financial resources to maintain basic teaching and learning facilities and resources.
        While the main impact felt by the MOE relates more to its capacity in terms of providing additional
        classrooms or school buildings, including furniture and textbooks, the most concerning impact of
        crisis remains the protracted deterioration of the quality of education which could be further
        jeopardizing some of the key achievements of the past years. The introduction of double shifts in
        schools is clearly restraining instructional time available to all students in any of both shifts. In
        addition to having to manage larger size classes, freshly recruited teachers are insufficiently trained,
        making learning environment less conducive for any foreseeable good quality educational
        outcomes.

The most important risk affecting the sector currently is the long term effects of the Syrian refugees
in Jordan. The conflict in Syria is still ongoing and therefore the expectation is that they will be remaining
in Jordan for a significant amount of time. The MOE needs to strategically plan for the sustainable
integration of Syrians in the education system. This will require addressing the financial constraints on the
sector together with the problems of education quality and any potential social cohesion issues that may
arise with the presence of the refugees.

Health

Jordan has generally high attainment in health outcomes, but there are significant differences in
access and high fiscal costs in the current delivery model. There are three significant health service
delivery mechanisms: a basic national health service run by the Ministry of Health which provides a
backstop to universal access to free healthcare but is overstretched, a separate system of clinics and hospitals
for the military, and mixed public/private clinics and hospitals accessible to those with health insurance or
other financing, including financing from the government (e.g. cases taken on by the Royal Court).

                                                      76
Furthermore, the system in general bears extremely high costs for medications, due to rigidities in the
management of prescriptions which leads to an overreliance on brand name pharmaceuticals as opposed to
generic drugs.

The Jordanian health sector continues to be affected by several important challenges with respect to
its fragmentation, quality disparities, and funding. First, the relationship between the public and the
private sectors is not well regulated, which results in inefficiencies in the production of health services.
Second, even within the public health system, several large and smaller providers and fund holders compete
for resources with no or little overall coordination with respect to the allocation of resources, further
undermining the overall efficiency of the health system. And third, there are some inherent organizational
and governance limitations in the system, which generate serious inequalities with respect to paying for
services and accessing care. Importantly, the apparent challenges in the public health system – particularly
as it relates to quality of service delivery – and the perceived advantages of certain aspects of the private
sector generate a sense of mistrust in the health system on the part of the general public. A key challenge
for the GOJ is to restore the trust in the health system by introducing a well-articulated reform plan that
aims to provide all citizens with formal health coverage in an effective, efficient, and equitable manner,
while ensuring quality.

Organizational, regulatory, and economic issues are all compounded by, and partly, the result of the
overall political economy context of the country across a range of sector-specific issues and outside
of the health sector proper, such as the rule of law, PFM, and voice and participation in public
decision making. With respect to the health sector, an important overall challenge for the GOJ in its further
reform efforts will be to align the interests of the general public and the country with those of specific health
care providers, the largest of which are the MOH and the Royal Medical Services on the public side.
Furthermore, the performance of the health sector, including the health financing system, is undermined by
the ad-hoc nature of the generous ability of people to access subsidized health care at the expense of the
state through different channels. These venues, although understandable from a humanitarian perspective,
create serious inefficiencies in resource allocation and in the ability to develop a strong, reliable, and
sustainable health financing system based on the transparent application of rules and regulations.

While Jordan has made remarkable achievements in terms of health status attainment, significant
inequities exist. For example, child mortality differs considerably across regions and governorates, and
type of residence. In 2012, the highest infant and under-5 mortality rates were observed in the Southern
region (22 and 26 per 1,000 live births, respectively). The Central and Northern regions performed similarly
in terms of infant mortality rates. The IMR was 17 per 1,000 live births in these two regions. The lowest
rate of under-5 mortality was observed in the North (19 per 1,000 live births), while the South region
attained slightly higher U5MR (20 per 1,000 live births). In addition to these differences, there are
significant disparities in child mortality across governorates. The IMR and U5MR were the highest in the
Tefiela governorate (26 and 31 per 1,000 live births, respectively). The lowest IMR and U5MR were
observed in Ajloun (14 and 16 per 1,000 live births, respectively), where these rates are half that of the ones
in Tefiela. From another perspective, child mortality is higher in urban centers compared to rural areas.

Jordan is currently experiencing a demographic transition with a population composition
characterized by a youth bulge. The working age group (between 25 and 64) accounts for about 42 percent


                                                       77
and those under the age of 15 represent approximately 35 percent of the total population. Only 3 percent of
the Jordanian population is above the age of 65. This composition offers a unique opportunity for Jordan to
capitalize the potential benefits of the so-called demographic dividend. The window of opportunity to reap
the benefits of the demographic transition will depend on Jordan’s ability to engender a healthy and
educated workforce, and foster a labor market with the capacity to offer employment opportunities to those
entering the labor force. This being said, it should be noted that Jordan is also going through an
epidemiological transition characterized by a rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). If
NCDs remain unaddressed, the potential for a demographic dividend may be a remote possibility. These
category of diseases may result in premature disability, lower economic productivity, and lead to a large
turn-over in the labor force (if those in the working age group drop out of the labor force due to
complications associated with NCDs). At the national level, the competitiveness of the Jordanian economy
may be compromised due to losses in productivity and high turn-over in the labor force.

In 2011, Jordan’s public spending on health as percentage of GDP stood at 6 percent, almost double
that of the MENA average of 3 percent. This was also mirrored in the per capita health expenditures,
which in 2011 reached US$392 in Jordan in contrast to the MENA average of US$232. The majority of
public spending on health is allocated to curative care. In 2008, curative care accounted for almost 68
percent of Ministry of Health expenses. The situation was no different for the Royal Medical Services where
it spent 64.3 percent of its financial resources on curative care. These figures exclude any arrears that
hospitals may have been running. Out-of-pocket (OOP) spending on health, although low relative to the
MENA average, is inequitably distributed. OOP expenditure accounted for 24.7 percent of total health
expenditure, almost half of the MENA average of 46.6 percent. This said, OOP spending is inequitably
distributed across the population with poorer households spending more on healthcare relative to richer
households. For example, the poorest households spend 9 percent of their income on outpatient services,
while the richest spend 7 percent. Furthermore, OOP spending is mainly driven by spending on
pharmaceuticals (63 percent), followed by private hospitals (30 percent) and private practitioners (7
percent).

Total population coverage in Jordan is in the range of 70 to 93 percent. An issue of some importance
in the Jordanian context is the existence of duplicate health insurance coverage, which according to the
Jordanian High Health Council, is enjoyed by around eight percent of the total population. Therefore,
applying this duplication percentage would mean that population coverage lies somewhere between 62 and
85 percent. In the absence of an automated system that identifies those covered using unique identification
numbers it is extremely difficult to reach an exact figure for the level of coverage in Jordan. Importantly,
these data, while showing that a relatively large proportion of the Jordanian population is without formal
health insurance coverage, do not, however, imply that the formally uninsured are completely without
financial protection in case of illness. Most Jordanians without insurance coverage or other means can
receive medical assistance through the Royal Court and other agencies. While this system ensures effective
coverage to all Jordanians it also has its drawbacks as it undermines efforts to expand formal coverage by
means of other more structured and potentially more effective programs. It is also an inefficient way of
providing coverage due to its generosity and relative capriciousness.

                           Box 6.1: Jordan, MENA’s Top Health Tourism Destination

 Despite the host of challenges in the healthcare sector including significant variation in the quality and cost of
 delivery of service, organizational inefficiencies as well as misalignment of interests among the public, government
 and healthcare providers, the sector is an area of competitive advantage for Jordan. With thousands of highly
 qualified medical professionals, internationally accredited private hospitals, competitively priced treatments, and
 top-notch facilities, Jordan has positioned itself as one of the top destinations for medical tourism, both regionally
 and internationally. In 2014, more than 200,000 patients travelled to Jordan, which helped generate around US$1.4
 billion in revenue related to health procedures, accommodations, transportation and related expenses to the
 economy.

 While Jordan has already made significant progress in promoting and developing this niche sector, it has yet to
 fully realize the potential for job creation and private investment opportunities. The economic model needs to adapt
 to some key challenges including increasing operational costs (e.g. electricity, taxes) and brain drain as qualified
 physicians emigrate to the US, UK, and Gulf countries offering more attractive salary packages. Nevertheless,
 increasing demand for health services domestically and regionally coupled with greater investments by public and
 private players in healthcare facilities, research and development, and cutting edge technologies signifies the
 potential for Jordan’s continued growth in this space.


Energy

Energy is central to Jordan’s risk profile and investment prospects. Currently, most energy needs are
met by imported fuel, created risks that, when not managed properly, lead to crises such as with gas imports
during 2011-2014. Yet because of its potential, there is alignment of strong investor interest with a policy
priority on reducing the vulnerability to imported energy sources. Yet Jordan also exists in an energy-
abundant region, where low energy costs are seen as part of the competitive package in attracting investors.
How to strike the balance between management of energy supply and fiscal risks with the need to maintain
competiveness is a critical challenge for policymakers.

Electricity

Jordan’s successful record of electricity sector reforms could not withstand extreme external shocks
of fuel supply interruptions and price volatility. Since early 2000s Jordan has made significant progress
in reforming its electricity sector. The sector was unbundled into two generation, one transmission, and
three distribution companies, while an energy regulator was established in 2001. The largest generation
company and all three distribution companies were privatized. The Government has also successfully
developed its power generation needs by privately financed Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and twice
implemented major energy subsidy reform programs (2008 and 2012 ongoing). However, Jordan domestic
oil and natural gas resources are limited and as a result the country is heavily dependent (97 percent of its
needs) on imported fossil fuel and dominantly relied on Egyptian natural gas supply to fuel its power
generation. The electricity consumption has at the same time been steady growing at an average rate of 4.6
percent during 2009-2013 resulting in total energy imports of US$ 5.2 billion equivalent to 27 percent of
imports of goods in 2013, 15 percent of GDP, increasing therefore Jordan’s vulnerabilities to external fuel
supply shocks. Since 2011 the repeated and extensive interruptions of the Egypt gas supply, surging cost
of fuel substitutes and inability of the electricity pricing regime to carry through timely and effective


                                                          79
adjustments of electricity prices have hiked operational losses of NEPCO and putting increasing pressure
on Government’s budget and deteriorating the financial performance of NEPCO.

Yet even as the sector was being modernized, massive risks were embedded in the new electricity
generation and distribution arrangement. In fact, the NEPCO crisis was partly foreseeable. The NEPCO
structure as a sole buyer of fuel but with regulated charges to generators and users loaded the company with
severe financial risks i.e. that it would be squeezed between a mandate to maintain stable tariffs while
meeting open-ended fuel requirements for the generation sector. During 2007-08, the debate around
NEPCO focused on switching more generation capacity to Egyptian natural gas, because at the time the
contractual gas price was lower than the oil price. The logic of this decision had already been undermined
by contractual disagreements concerning the gas price prior to the 2011 disruption. Thus an opportunistic
decision to switch the fuel mix based on recent price trends led to power dependence on a single source,
which would eventually be interrupted, at great cost.

The Government is implementing a reform program addressing challenges and vulnerability risks of
energy sector sustainability. The Government recognizes that fundamental structural reforms will be
necessary to improve the financial and operation performance of the energy sector through addressing its
main challenges of mitigating the rising cost of energy supply and maintaining security of supply. Key
elements of the Government program in the electricity sector include:

       Electricity Tariff Adjustments and Management of NEPCO’s Debt: Under the IMF supported
        program the Government developed a five year (2013-2017) electricity tariff adjustment plan that
        aims to bring NEPCO’s wholesale electricity tariff to operational cost recovery in 2017. The
        Government implemented two planned annual tariff increases of 15 percent in 2013 and 2014 and
        a 7.5 percent tariff increase in January 2015. These electricity tariff adjustments have increased
        NEPCO’s revenues by 2 percent of the GDP. The Government continues to be committed to
        achieve full cost recovery in 2017 and is considering options to improve the electricity tariff
        structure and further measures to restore financial viability of NEPCO by addressing its JD 4.57
        billion (equivalent to US$ 6.44 billion) of accumulated debt since 2011.
       Diversification of Fuel Supply Resources: Jordan has initiated a program for the diversification of
        fuel supply resources to improve security of supply and mitigate impact of interruption of the
        Egyptian gas supply. The development of a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) at
        Aqaba for LNG import was initiated and the first LNG shipment was received in May 2015.
        Envisaged LNG import could allow GoJ to eliminate 50 percent diesel and 25 percent heavy fuel
        oil (HFO) imports and hence reduce the cost of fuel feedstock supply to power generation. The
        Government is also strengthening the country’s fuel storage capacity to mitigate the risk of fuel
        supply interruptions and has initiated the development of a Petroleum Strategic Reserves Terminal
        at Madona for petroleum products and LPG which is scheduled to be completed in 2018.
       Diversification of Power Generation Mix through Domestic Resources: Jordan is also taking steps
        to further improve the security of electricity supply by diversifying its power generation mix from
        domestic energy resources. The Government has made progress in developing new renewable
        energy projects in which the private sector will take the lead and could be able to reach its 10
        percent (and more) renewable target in the energy sector by 2020. As of February 2015, about 400
        MW of contracts for privately developed wind and solar power projects have been awarded and

                                                    80
        another 590MW is planned to be contacted by end-2015/2016. The Government is also considering
        to fund the required transmission investment to facilitate further scale up of renewable energy.

Although oil prices have fallen significantly in the last few months, scaling up development of
renewable resources remains a strategic approach to sustain security of energy supply in Jordan and
to strengthen its resilience to external shocks of imported fuel interruptions and price volatility. Under
various oil price scenarios, renewable power generation is expected to replace generation by the more
expensive imported diesel. Once in operation, the contracted 990 MW of renewable projects could reduce
the cost of generation by US$180 to US$230 million (under US$50 to US$60/barrel scenarios). In
November 2014 the Parliament amended the 2012 Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (REEE) Law
requiring improving the bylaws and regulations for development of renewable resources by direct
proposals. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources is preparing these bylaws and is developing a
public data room for renewable resources development to improve transparency. In addition to renewable
resources Jordan is keen to improve the balance of its power generation mix by utilizing its abandoned
domestic deposits of oil shale. The Government signed in 2014 a long term agreement for purchasing
electricity form a 500 MW privately developed shale oil power plant expected for operation in 2019.

Urban and Local Development

Jordan is a primarily urban country with an important concentration in Amman and the northern
part of the Kingdom. The country is divided in 12 governorates and 99 municipalities. While a number of
services are channeled directly through deconcentrated units at the governorate level (e.g. education and
health), the municipalities are responsible for a range of functions and services among which planning
activities, road construction and maintenance, solid waste management, street lighting and cleaning, and
the management of a number of public places and establishments. These activities are funded through their
own revenues, as well as limited central government transfers, loans and grants.

Despite their very limited resources, the municipalities have at the forefront of the response to the
Syrian refugees’ crisis. The sudden increased demand and utilization of services provided at the local level
has put the mayors and municipal councils under mounting pressure to reverse the visible decline in the
level and quality of these services. The municipalities have been addressing the daily problems of keeping
up with the provision of municipal services (e.g. solid waste generation has doubled in several areas with
high concentration of refugees, contributing to ground water contamination, pollution of water resources
and spread of water-borne disease), but has also been asked to find solutions to basic social demands such
as education and health, among many.

The traditional intergovernmental structure is best seen as limited deconcentration. Jordan established
a municipal system in 1955, assigning a number of authorities and functional areas to municipalities. In
spite of attempts to decentralize powers to the lower level however, the Kingdom has retained a centralized
structure where appointed governors function as antennas for the central administration and with only
limited prerogatives being handed over to municipalities. Recently, the Government has led a number of
efforts to increase participation in governate affairs and improve the financial situation of the municipalities.
This includes (i) a recently enacted decentralization law creating elected governate councils; (ii) an
expansion of the transfer pool in 2014; (iii) the application of more equitable municipal transfer formula,

                                                       81
also in 2014; and (iv) the preparation of a new Municipalities Law, under discussion by Parliament. The
need to fundamentally address the structural and systemic causes of performance weaknesses and gaps in
the municipal sector and strengthen its capacity in terms of level of autonomy, technical, and financial
resources is more pressing than ever due to the role of the municipalities and governates in responding to
the Syrian refugee influx.

While the Government has shown its willingness to approach decentralization within a longer term
strategic framework, there is still a need to rationalize and streamline the intergovernmental system
in terms of clarifying institutional arrangements relating to local development, realigning functional
assignments, and agreeing on a core set of policy objectives for the role of local actors in promoting growth
and development. As indicated in the poverty section, almost all municipalities in Jordan are characterized
by the weakness of their economic role and their dependency on the capital city. Despite the existing
potential for local development in areas outside Amman, the role of municipalities and governates in
achieving balanced socio-economic development still remains fairly limited.

Transport

Given its high urbanization, enabling major urban areas to thrive and to function effectively could
have a significant impact on a large portion of the Jordanian population. Approximately 91 percent
of the population of Jordan lives in densely populated territories within or close to major cities. The average
share in comparable territories in MENA countries is approximately 56 percent. Furthermore, connectivity
is high in Jordan across a range of modes relative to other countries in MENA. As such, spatially targeted
interventions to increase prosperity in lagging regions are less likely to be effective than in countries with
large population shares that are in lagging areas distant from major cities. Alternatively measures that
would enable equal access to services and opportunities, and that would enable factor market fluidity such
that dynamic urban cores, such as the Greater Amman Metropolitan Area, could better thrive, could offer
substantial spillover effects for populations across the country.

Jordan’s transport sector is considered the backbone of the economy and an important pillar of the
country’s economy. Jordan is a small open economy with close trade/financial linkages with the rest of
the world. Transport and communications-related services and industries make up an estimated 15 percent
of GDP, while employment in transport and storage-related areas absorbed 7.2 percent of all employed
                                                         52
persons in the country in 2012. Jordan also serves as an important regional transport hub between the
GCC, Turkey and Europe, and also between Iraq, the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. The volume of
transiting commodities passing through the country reached a peak of 83.6 million tons (JD 14615.5
                                                                                                        53
million) in 2011 and is expected to pick up again once the conflict in neighboring Syria abates. The
importance of the transport sector in Jordan thus goes beyond domestic needs.

For its relatively small size, the institutional setup of Jordan’s transport sector is heavily fragmented.
The sector is divided between two ministries, three main agencies, and two important local authorities: the

boundaries, and the Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZA) responsible for all transport in the Aqaba
region mainly the Aqaba ports, the King Hussain airport in Aqaba and public transport in Aqaba. There is
the proliferation of state-owned or affiliated companies and authorities operating in the sector: The
country’s three civil airports are operated by three distinct companies; two railway companies, while the
Port of Aqaba, the Kingdom’s only outlet to the sea, has four authorities. While the proliferation of agencies
and companies has contributed to a high degree of specialization, the current setup has also led to
duplication of responsibilities and poor coordination in the sector, particularly regarding the Port of Aqaba
and the increasingly important area of public transport.

The organization of public transport providers and trucking services is highly fragmented and would
benefit from consolidation among operators. The ownership of taxis, buses and trucks is overwhelmingly
in the hands of individuals. 65 percent of large trucks in Jordan are owned by individuals, which reduces
the competitiveness of the trucking sector both in terms of quality of service and pricing. Meanwhile, the
fragmentation of bus and taxi operators has resulted in low-quality public transportation services that have
not evolved to better serve demand.

The insufficient supply of public transport is compounded by its poor quality. Public transport services
are not reliable especially in term of schedules as buses wait to be full before departing, therefore
substantially delaying trips. The absence of decent and available transportation alternatives to back youth
trainings and employment opportunities is considered as major impediments that affected the decision of
many young people, notably the disadvantaged percentage of them, to reject job offers or decided to leave
work. Transportation was an even bigger obstacle to employment for females due to the sociocultural
limitations that they are subject to. The vehicles in use for public transportation in Jordan, including taxi
services, totaled 35,252 at the end of 2011. Of these 7,222 (or 20.49 percent) operate on urban routes. 7.46
percent (2,630) of vehicles run on main routes between the cities and 47 percent (16,068 vehicles) are taxis.
This large proportion of low capacity vehicles contributes to a high cost per trip and traffic congestion. By
comparison, only 2,382 high capacity vehicles (ex: buses) are part of the public transit system. Note that
bus transit is mostly concentrated in the capital Amman. The figure clearly indicates that the share of public
transport in Amman is well below most other cities, which see their share of public transport in the 20 to
60 percent range.

The government’s decision to stop subsidizing gasoline in November 2012 led to the increase in the
cost of daily transportation given the absence of alternatives. The price increases ranged from more
than 33 percent for diesel and kerosene for transport and heating and a 14 percent on lower grade petrol
which makes owning and operating a vehicle particularly expensive. With the absence of mass transit
systems, and despite the government’s plan to build a Bus Rapid Transit line (BRT), there are no
alternatives for the population.

Vehicular traffic on Jordan’s road network is subject to increasing congestion, with little apparent
impact from higher retail fuel prices. Besides that, and According to Greater Amman municipality, the
                                                                                                         54
cost of delay due to traffic congestion in Amman is estimated to be JD 567,000,000 (2006) which
                                                               55
constituted about 1.75 percent of total GDP. A recently completed World Bank study on traffic congestion
in Cairo puts the costs of congestion in Cairo at $8 billion US$ in 2010, about 4 percent of Egypt’s GDP.
While Cairo’s size and worst traffic implies higher costs in absolute value than in Amman, as the Jordanian
population continues to increase especially in the Greater Amman area (rapidly now with influx of Syrian
refugees), traffic congestion is becoming worse and the need to address this congestion is becoming more
urgent. Road traffic growth is estimated to continue growing through 2030 with an average annual increase
of five to six percent, outpacing projected GDP growth.

Jordan’s road infrastructure ranks 53 out of 128 countries, with recurrent cost funding being a major
                         56
shortcoming. Experts estimate that 60 percent of Jordan’s road network is in good condition, 28 percent
in fair condition and only 12 percent in poor condition. Comparing it to Lebanon (the other upper middle
income services-oriented economy in the region that most resembles Jordan’s), only 15 percent of
Lebanon’s main road network is in good condition, with 65 percent in fair condition and 20 percent in poor
condition. However, there is clear imbalance of expenditures in favor of costly reconstructions over regular
maintenance. Due to insufficient funds, and the existing large backlog of maintenance, Ministry of Public
Works and Housing (MOPH) is giving priority to repairing those roads that have largely deteriorated. Some

ongoing expansions in the new Aqaba port, and the upgrade of the road corridor to the Saudi borders.

Jordan’s losses due to road crashes (mostly due to fatalities and injuries) stand at 1.6 percent of GDP,
which is lower than most other countries in the region, but remains quite high when compared to developed
countries.

The Work Bank’s Logistics Performance Index , which benchmarks countries’ performance on trade
logistics, reveals that import and export costs in Jordan are relatively high but are following a
decreasing trend. In fact, Jordan ranked 102 out of 155 countries in 2012 but improved to 68 in 2014. The
table below shows that Jordan has acceptable costs of exports and imports is relatively cheap compared to
the region and similar income countries. Jordan also serves as an important regional transport hub between
the GCC and Turkey and Europe, and also between Iraq and the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. The
volume of transiting commodities passing through the country reached a peak of 83.6 million tons (14615.5
million Jordanian Dinars) in 2011 and is expected to pick up again once the conflict in neighboring Syria
            58
abates. The importance of the transport sector in Jordan thus goes beyond domestic needs. According the
LPI, the major impediments to logistics in Jordan is cumbersome procedures.

Transport costs due to internal distance have remained high even in the developed world; the total trade and
transport costs as a share of the value of goods can be split as follows:
    -     20 percent transport costs
    -    45 percent border-related trade costs
                                                                     59
       -         55 percent retail and wholesale distribution costs

The transport sector employs about 7 percent of Jordan’s working population (taxis, trucks, buses,
airlines). An additional 1 or 2 percent work on transport infrastructure. More importantly, investments in
the country’s transport infrastructure would have major effects on employment and growth. A recent study
by the World Bank on infrastructure and employment creation in the Middle East and North Africa
estimated that in the short run, every US$ one billion in infrastructure investment in the region would create
185,000 jobs. A US$ one billion investment in road construction alone would create 97,000 jobs, more than
twice as many jobs than if it were invested in any other infrastructure sector. In the long run, every one
percentage point in additional growth as a result of infrastructure investment in the Middle East region
                                                                               60
would create nine million additional jobs over 10 years for the region. Much needed investments in public
mass transit for the country or road rehabilitation and maintenance would thus confer significant
employment benefits for Jordan in addition to lowering economic costs and financial burdens for the poor
and the youth.

A trade and service oriented economy such as Jordan depends heavily on its transport system for the
moving of people (tourism/airline), and goods (trade and transit business). The civil aviation sector in
Jordan is an economically important sector that contributes significantly to Jordan’s development. Air
transport to, from and within Jordan creates three distinct types of economic benefit, i.e., contribution to
GDP, jobs and tax revenues generated by the sector and its supply chain. As per a study carried out by
Oxford Economics in 2011, the Jordan aviation sector contributes JOD 421 million (2.2 percent) to
Jordanian GDP. In addition, the connections created between cities and markets represent an important
infrastructure asset that generates benefits through enabling foreign direct investment, business clusters,
                                                                                         61
specialization and other spill-over impacts on an economy’s productive capacity. Jordan has relatively

good airline connectivity to the region, and the world. Its national airline has an established niche on short
and medium-range routes and good global connectivity through alliances. The airline operates over 500
flights per week, with at least 110 daily departures. It employs about 5,000 staff (4,507 staff in 2008).
When compared to other airports worldwide, Queen Alia International Airport performs very well,
especially in quality of service. This success of the QAIA could be attributed to a combination of both
substantial private sector investment and management expertise provided within a PPP framework.

Transport is a sector where the tradeoff between equity and efficiency is very strong. From an
efficiency perspective, the price of transport needs to rise: the fuel price will be cost reflective, and there
are significant congestion and environmental externalities which call for higher prices. But from an equity
and job market perspective this has adverse consequences, because it risks pricing out the poor who already
spend a lot on transport. Thus the solution is going to involve some sort of pricing mechanism to capture
the externalities (e.g. taxes on fuel over and above cost recovery and perhaps even tolls) but also investment
and other instruments which mitigate the effect on the poor, most notably through public transport which
is an obvious self-selection mechanism for poor households. There also has to be a regulatory component
as some issues at least in Amman clearly pertain to planning and enforcement issues.

Despite these glaring deficiencies, the government has not chosen to prioritize the transport sector in
the way that the above analysis would warrant. Partly it is an issue of accountability: the poor have had
insufficient weight in transport sector decisions. Partly it is that seems like transport got caught up in other
governance dynamics, most notably at Greater Amman Municipality (GAM). Transport projects, especially
those aimed at inter-modal coordination are complex, there is relatively little local expertise and unlike has
been the case for other initiatives such as privatization, a reluctance to bring in foreign expertise. As a result
decisions have languished. For example, the government has been studying a Light Rail between Amman-
Zarqa since 2007, and is now they are studying/implementing a BRT instead. The lack of fiscal space has
also been a deterrent to transport projects, given the upfront costs and diffuse benefits.

Chapter 7 Prioritization

The SCD analysis concurs with many other studies of Jordan on identified constraints, and it divides
them into two broad areas for the purposes of prioritization. One set of constraints pertains to policy
implementation, which in turn relates to the government’s ability to strengthen its capacity to cope with
risk, mobilizing resources for productive investment, and ensuring a more effect labor market. The second
set relates to constraints along specific dimensions which affect different sectors in different ways, but
nonetheless have scope to be addressed at the sector rather than systemic level.

At the sector level, the SCD follows a fairly standard methodology. Specifically; each constraint will
be assessed against a number of filters:

       Preconditions: This would critically assess the foundational constraints (risk and markets) that are
        pre-requisite for sustained high growth and shared prosperity
       Maximizing impact on the twin goals and sustainability: This will assess the potential impact
        on sustainable poverty reduction and improvement in the welfare of the bottom 40 percent.
        However, particular attention will be given to the channels of poverty reductions- with a greater
        role for labor market participation and targeted safety net programs and less reliance on public
        sector employment and untargeted subsidies
       Complementarities: This would assess the degree to which programs/policies could have positive
        impacts in other domains that are key to address constraints to growth, inclusion and sustainability
        (for example investment climate reform)
       Sequencing: This would assess the time frame of impacts and weigh quick wins against longer-
        term impacts. It will also support the process of carefully sequencing reforms.
       Citizen Participation: This filter will use the degree to which citizen involvement in the form of
        increased information, authority or participation is going to impact the pace and modality of
        progress towards the twin goals. It will also inform the extent to which actions support the building
        of ownership not just on the “what” but on the “how” of the reform agenda.

Regarding implementation, the SCD preparation mobilized input on a range of commonly-cited
causes of implementation difficulties. These are as follows:

       Excessive discretion: officials at various levels, especially lower administrative levels, have too
        much power to make arbitrary and unaccountable decisions
       Lack of authorizing environment: officials at various levels perceive that they can’t make any
        decisions without referring them up the hierarchy
       Silos and fragmentation: ministries, departments, and agencies are each responsible for a small
        segment of an issue but none of them takes the overall situation into account
       Dilution: policy effort is spread over too many areas and seemingly incidental issues consume too
        much time of public administration
       Absence of consensus: Apparent consensus in strategies and plans has not translated into a common
        understanding at ground level about what needs to be done, so it doesn’t get done



                                                     88
       Lack of level playing field: public administration may be personalized and not based on rule of
        law.
       Absence of transparency: key administrative information is not available within the government or
        to the general public
       Absence of accountability: officials are not seen as being held to satisfactory performance standards
        either internally or vis-à-vis the general public

Implementation challenges were the most frequently raised issue in the SCD consultations and the
varied explanation for these challenges revealed several common underlying elements. At a high level,
it is an interaction of the political structure with the SCD hypothesis regarding risk management. The
incentive system in the public sector makes officials more attuned to the downsides of action rather than
inaction. An issue that lingers for months or years without resolution is less costly than a clearly attributable
decision which has downside risk. The track record (e.g. on privatization or the energy crisis) shows that
this “decision aversion” is mitigated by the involvement of the King, either directly or through a clear
whole-of-government mandate to resolve an issue.

What can we learn from cases of slow implementation to replicate success stories such as privatization
and energy sector reform? An implementation deficit can result from weaknesses in one or more of the
following stages of the implementation process: The agenda creating stage: mechanisms to put findings and
recommendations on government’s agenda; The action plan endorsement stage: mechanisms which lead to
a concrete action plan; The core implementation stage: mechanisms to ensure that action plans are
implemented; The post-implementation stage: mechanism to ensure sustainability and learning from
experience. In Jordan, there are weaknesses in all four stages, but particularly so in the downstream stages
(core-implementation and post-implementation). This is indicated by a survey of a select group of WBG
TTLs on the quality of government processes in each of the above stages in Jordan. The TTLs surveyed are
either working on Jordan at present or have done so in the past. Thus the exercise captures the knowledge
of people who, between them, have several years of experience and familiarity with the workings of the
Jordanian government. The survey consisted of 22 statements related to different stages of implementation.
TTLs were asked to rate each statement on a four-point scale (i.e., whether the statements were mostly true,
sometimes true, rarely true or not true at all). The statements were worded such that a “mostly true” answer
is the most favorable from the implementation point of view and “not true at all” the most unfavorable. The
questionnaire was sent to 30 TTLs, of which 20 responded. The detailed results, with the complete list of
statements, are provided in Annex 3. The performance of the government is weak in all stages.

Weaknesses are more pronounced at the downstream stages, i.e., at the implementation and post-
implementation stages compared to the upstream stages of agenda creation, endorsement of the action
plan and the early stages of mobilizing for implementation. Thus, for example, the government appears to
be relatively better at defining mandates of various government agencies and identifying clear
responsibilities for implementation (with 85 percent and 70 percent respectively of survey participants
responding that the related statements are sometimes or mostly true). Next in rating comes the early-stage
processes of incorporating the results of diagnostics, analysis and stakeholder dialogues in development
plans and strategies, proceeding from development plans to action plans and building consensus in
government around the action plans (50 percent, 50 percent, 55 percent rated the related statements as
sometimes or mostly true). Nonetheless, there is much scope for improvement even with these processes.

                                                       89
Six out of the 10 dimensions of the “core implementation stage” covered by the survey have serious
weaknesses with less than 40 percent of the respondents reporting some incidence of good practices.

Three dimensions are particularly weak: adequate resourcing to implementation teams, feedback
processes, and knowledge sharing. The size and complexity of government makes it difficult to direct
resources required to implement actions to the responsible agencies. The results-orientation is weakest link
in the chain. There is little or no practice of seeking feedback from stakeholders on implementation quality
and, to the extent, any alerts on implementation quality are obtained, there aren’t any good procedures to
act on them. Attention to long-term sustainability of actions is poor and there is very little attempt to learn
from experience and disseminate that knowledge within government.

At this level, the binding constraint is that access to rents has detracted from the apparent urgency
of many envisaged reforms. In particular, the political system has yet to find a way for national priorities
to permeate through the functions of government. The creation of the authorizing environment has to find
a balance between the traditional role of the King, and the increasing executive and legislative powers of
the council of ministers and Parliament, respectively. Since the King cannot be involved in every area,
policy reforms must derive their legitimacy by being part of a national program, jointly owned by the
council of ministers and parliament. In the current political structure of Jordan, this implies that the
government must be effective in making the case to Parliament for its proposals on a case by case basis,
since the Parliament does not appoint the government. This makes it all the more important that national
strategies such as Vision 2025 make a credible transition to a policy platform.

Lack of progress on critical areas of social and political reforms is likely to continue to undermine
implementation momentum towards improved growth and prosperity. Reforming the country’s
political system (in particular the electoral law) and promoting its citizen’s voice and engagement in policy
making – as emphasized in Vision 2025 – will strengthen the legitimacy of reforms initiated by the
government. Delivering on its commitments for enhanced integrity, improved transparency and access to
information will also go a long way towards generating a sense of fairness and inclusiveness that is essential
for improved growth and promoting a sense of shared prosperity. Addressing constraints on service
delivery, including housing, at the local (municipal) level will also be critical for addressing community
tensions particularly those resulting from the influx of refugees.

But aside from the pace of political reform, implementation is a binding and cross-cutting operational
constraint that needs to be tackled in parallel with the remaining constraints identified below. As
experience shows, implementation constraints can be overcome. This is illustrated when there is a widely
understood mandate, originating from the King, and ministers who are empowered to staff reform teams
with high capacity and motivated members. By contrast, initiatives have languished when they are left to
inter-ministerial mechanisms without clear criteria for escalation and when reform teams have experienced
staffing constraints (usually rationalized on grounds of a hiring freeze).

These divergent implementation outcomes reflect also risk: in the latter case, policymakers see
adverse consequences to acting given unclear signals about the authorizing environment.
Furthermore, Jordan’s development partners unwittingly enable this stasis, because fragmented projects
offer the appearance of addressing important structural challenges (with associated “nameplate” benefit for


                                                      90
donors) while actually postponing action. There is also a risk that accountability initiatives have unwittingly
heightened the risk of attracting attention by pushing issues forward.

The implementation constraint also explains the absence of a strategic management approach in
government. At first sight it seems odd that a country with so many strategic documents should lack a
strategic orientation. But in fact, the operational implications of the findings of strategy exercises are often
not absorbed. Even where profound sustainability risks are identified, such as in water or climate change,
it has been difficult to get line of sight on how these priorities are being absorbed in the government
apparatus. Donors have made this problem worse by cherry-picking the most easily “projectized” elements
of strategy, so that the policy component is left as a shell.

The implementation deficit diagnosis implies that constraints need to be scrutinized as to how they
would be addressed, because past approaches have tended to reinforce reform-resistance. In general,
interventions which begin at the policy level but get progressively re-scoped as development projects have
been vulnerable to this problem. There is nothing wrong with beginning with a project-level approach to a
policy reform, especially when formally established as a pilot, but as noted above, the weakness has been
in generating and deploying knowledge gained from such interventions to inform the broader agenda which
they were meant to tackle. Examples of interventions which are prone to this pitfall include overly selective
product, skills, and activity promotion e.g. single-line export development, scattered SME support, and
vocational training. There is a growing body of evidence from global experience that vocational programs
in particular have extremely low impact.

Some constraints have more potential to generate genuine reform momentum and thus can be
classified as reform-oriented. Two examples warrant particular mention. First, investment climate issues
are critical to the sustaining of FDI and inducing more domestic capital and managerial skills into higher
productivity formal sector enterprises which could compete effectively with incumbents. Second, progress
in tackling gender disparities would get at fundamental elements of the socio-political bargain, which have
the effect of limiting the economic participation of women and enabling the status quo.

Sector/Thematic Priorities

In terms of the sector or thematic constraints, Table 7.1 presents a consolidation from the sector
analyses in which the identified constraints are mapped to the SCD dual hypotheses. This listing is
based on going through the identified sector-level issues with the filter of the dual hypotheses, and showing
how the key issues are manifestations of the hypotheses. For example, budget deficits contribute to risk
management problems by embedding a risk of forced fiscal adjustment (first hypothesis) while also
distorting the allocative role of the capital and labor markets through crowding out. The remainder of this
section shows how the SCD filters can be used to tailor an action framework for addressing this seemingly
formidable list.

The sector constraint prioritization exercise for Jordan requires considerable tailoring to the current
context: a substantial reform agenda is already unfolding, albeit at different pace across different
sectors. The key example is the energy sector. A SCD written in 2010 would most likely have identified
the energy sector as the top constraint in terms of risks, fiscal impact, threats to energy supply, and overall
urgency. In 2011, the risks that would have been embedded in such an assessment were realized, and a
long-discussed move to cost-reflective electricity tariffs is now under phased implementation, while liquid
transport fuel subsidies have already been eliminated. As this SCD has shown, water is now the “next
frontier” for such an adjustment, and depletion concerns heighten the importance far beyond fiscal costs.
An associated reform program is currently under discussion with the government within the framework of
a new programmatic DPL.

Despite the recent positive steps on subsidy reform, addressing Jordan’s fiscal and debt profile
represents a precondition for achievement of the twin goals and sustainability. When combined with
the undiversified export base, the fiscal situation embeds a “sudden stop” risk in terms of reliance on
external inflows to finance the structural savings-investment gap. On the expenditure side, achieving more
fiscal space is linked to the sector priorities discussed further below, notably on private sector job creation
and social safety net (SSN) reform, to reduce the reliance on the public budget for jobs and subsidies. On
the revenue side, there has been considerable analysis of the scope for revenue mobilization and several


                                                        93
efforts at streamlining tax exemptions and broadening the base of the income tax. Implementation
constitutes the major impediment to effectiveness of these measures, which in turn is linked to a lack of
consensus among stakeholders about the need for them. Of course, support from partners in meeting the
budgetary needs identified in the Jordan Response Plan (US$8 billion between 2016 and 2018) would
address some of the loss in fiscal space due to the Syrian influx.

Fiscal adjustment is also a precondition for a more effective allocative role for markets. Constraints
associated with the structural fiscal stance pertain to crowding out of bank finance, sparse domestic debt
markets due to overreliance on guaranteed external bond issuance, the lack of domestic fiscal space for
public investment or O&M expenditures, and the distortive role of the public sector job preference in the
labor market.

With responses to energy and water constraints already part of an emerging consensus in policy
discussion, the remaining constraints lie in the domain of implementation and citizen participation.
Energy and water pricing are at a stage where although there is a technical consensus around the need for
adjustment, there is much less agreement around the modalities, especially in water. Since any adjustment
will involve tariff increases, a lack of confidence of the public in the motivation for or impact of pricing
reforms could seriously undermine reform momentum. Popular discussion in Jordan already exhibits
skepticism about the finances of NEPCO and the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) and the associated
rationale for price adjustments, especially in terms of a perception of asymmetric price adjustment (i.e.
tariffs adjust upwards when energy costs increase but not downwards when energy costs decline). Plans to
boost water supply (through the Red-Dead link and ancillary projects) are very complex in terms of their
infrastructure and environmental implications. These implications could be challenging to explain to the
public, whose buy-in is needed for sustainability.

In other sectors, the reform agenda is at an earlier stage, and the prioritization filters are very useful
to determine sequencing.

Removing obstacles in the business climate, especially sector entry and level-playing field in currently
restricted sectors, is essential to energizing private investment. Without this, a focus on the labor market
alone will not be effective. The process of combining capital and knowledge to generate high quality jobs
is not working at sufficient scale to make a major dent in Jordan’s labor supply overhang. Special economic
zones and selective liberalization have created a “greenhouse” for some investors, but this mode of private
sector facilitation effectively puts the government in the position of picking winners as well as diluting the
impact of policy reforms. It also raises fundamental issues of access and level playing field regarding private
sector development policies. Realizing the potential of the 2014 Investment Law to shift the focus from
projects to policies is vital, but the law left some important issues (e.g. income tax) to the regulatory stage
which could continue the challenge of discretionary implementation of exemptions.

The top priority in sequencing therefore is providing investors, domestic and foreign, with confidence
that they will face a stable and effectively administered regulatory and legal environment throughout
the life cycle of their investments. For these investors, project delays and uncertainties fundamentally
undermine their willingness to invest. Other investment locations in Jordan’s region have and will continue



                                                      94
take corresponding advantage in attracting investment flows. Instruments which contribute to risk reduction
while Jordan reinforces its credibility in this domain will be particularly important in the near-term.

A related cluster of issues concerns the financing of investment. For this constraint area,
complementarity provides a strong filter, because there are multiple determinants of the total stock of
physical capital in Jordan and resulting need for multiple entry points depending on the nature of the capital.
For public capital, getting an effective public investment management (PIM) system operational will enable
a comprehensive perspective on existing assets, operations and maintenance thereof, and a vetted project
pipeline to which Jordan’s development partner funding inflows can be allocated. Technical work on the
PIM system is already underway. Given the political influence that comes with control of the capital
program, operation of a good practice PIM system will be especially prone to the implementation constraint.

If one particular area of PIM should be selected as a priority, it is integration of the capital program
into the multi-year budget strategy and annual budget preparation. This will bring the needed
coordination between the allocation of development partner financing, domestic revenue mobilization, and
comprehensive multi-year budgeting for all costs including recurrent costs of new capital projects. It would
also help with internalization of incentives which currently contribute to a proliferation of projects.

Infrastructure finance is another area where progress is already being made, due to the current
efforts to build on earlier privatization successes and operationalize the recent PPP law. Because of
Jordan’s risk exposure and complex project needs in certain sectors (e.g. renewable energy, water), having
an investment framework that attracts high capacity investors is important. These investors will be looking
to share risk with partners in the country (most likely the government) and with fellow investors. In this
setting, the role of a “first mover” investor in signaling prospects and resolving uncertainty is strongly
warranted. A solid PPP framework provides clear “rules of the game” for such coordination, but other
modes of investment (e.g. syndication) may be equally viable depending on the circumstances. Finally in
this respect, PIM provides the high level decision process to ensure that conventional public investment
and investments with private participation such as PPPs are each contributing cohesively to the national
capital stock.

Access to finance for smaller firms and households is not amenable to quick improvement; indeed to
push too far in this direction would lead to an overcrowded MSME sector and pose risks to financial
stability. The priority here is not a single initiative, but rather phasing of a set of reforms that will alleviate
different constraints over different horizons. The current banking sector structure with two large banks in
stable and conservative business lines and major gaps in credit market infrastructure will struggle to
promote access in the short-term. Over time, reduced fiscal deficits should reduce the appeal of financing
the government, and growing experience in the SME sector should increase banks’ capacity for this
segment.

But even with overdue improvement in credit market infrastructure centered on insolvency,
moveable collateral, and creditors’ rights, banks alone cannot respond with the scale, speed, or scope
needed to make the financial sector more dynamic. This will require better-functioning securities
markets, enabled through improved corporate governance and transparency and disclosure requirements on
the Amman Stock Exchange. Financial markets would be more diversified through the participation of


                                                        95
venture capital and private equity – but these players will want to see good prospects that promising projects
can actually move to implementation and profitability.

Another cluster of issues is around social safety nets, education, and health. In fact, these are all part
of helping households manage shocks at various horizons and in response to various random and life-cycle
events (income loss, unemployment, health, and livelihood opportunities).

The first key message here is that Jordan has already done a lot to put the technical prerequisites for
strong social sector performance in place, but these need to be completed urgently so that policy
design which relies on them can be activated. The fuel subsidy removal cash transfer compensation
scheme showed the ability to scale up a cash-based safety net when the right conditions are in place. The
ongoing construction of a National Unified Registry (NUR) will offer a comprehensive platform for SSNs
and social service delivery. The growing capability with cash transfer programs should also converge with
programs for refugees, where the information base is substantial.

In the long-term, universal health coverage will improve well-being, reduce inequitable health
outcomes, and complement labor market dynamism by weakening the distortion towards public
sector employment as a means of accessing healthcare. The NUR also provides a path to universal
coverage, and thus is a foundational initiative for implementation of the National Health Strategy.

The direction of cash benefit policy reform also needs to be maintained. The labor market diagnostic
indicates that the categorical basis and lack of activation measures in the current SSN creates disincentives
for labor market participation. While a realistic time horizon for responding to these shortcomings is long,
this policy area scores highly because of its complementarity with other reforms and, ultimately, its strong
link to the twin goals.

Constraints related to gender ultimately pertain to the ability of women for autonomous participation
in society. Obstacles to women exercising agency in Jordan are caused by a combination of the treatment
of women versus men under applicable legal frameworks, with gaps further widened by restrictive social
norms that can govern women’s behavior. In concrete terms, issues pertain to the imbalance in power and
legal rights between women and male relatives. Recent legislative and regulatory reforms, if implemented
effectively, have the potential to increase women's agency through expansion of rights and improvements
in service delivery including legal services.

The education sector illustrates the point that the issue is not whether the overall sector is a priority
– it is – but the sequencing of reforms within it. For example, although skills gaps will have to be
narrowed from both the supply and demand side, which will take time, several types of reform can be
frontloaded.

First, high quality general purpose skills will be needed even if some portion of near-term cohorts of
young Jordanians will be looking for jobs in the region rather than at home. Every day that these issues
are not addressed, the pool of difficult-to-employ youth is growing. Constraints begin with difficulties in
access to early childhood education, which in turn negatively impact the labor market participation of
women.


                                                     96
Second, the education sector needs more autonomy to be able to flexibly manage core operational
issues such as teacher assignments and implementation of a modern curriculum. At the tertiary level,
the public universities have a very constricted expenditure envelope, while private colleges have expanded
within a deficient regulatory framework which has adverse effects on quality. Clear signals about autonomy
and regulatory direction can be sent in the short-term to instill confidence in education quality and relevance
at all levels.

The transport sector is at the nexus of several reform areas. The necessary price adjustments in energy
have nonetheless exacerbated constraints to mobility, especially in urban areas. Relaxing constraints in
transport thus scores highly on improving functioning of the labor market. But it also goes directly to the
ability to meaningfully participate in the economy and society. Access and quality problems in modes of
transport used by lower income households and basic regulatory and planning shortcomings (e.g. pedestrian
facilitation) undermine the rhetoric of improvement and highlight the technocratic orientation of policy
reforms.

The refugee crisis provides further impetus to address these long-standing constraints in the
economy. Overlaps between a developmental approach to coping with the refugee influx and the
aforementioned constraints include the following: First, improving the business climate for tradable goods,
enabling investment to allow for higher productivity employment growth that will then absorb the refugees
as well as local workers without lowering wages; this will also help broaden the tax base. Second, strengthen
local service delivery so that additional students and patients do not break the systems. Third, as
accountability improves, shift funding down the chain (to municipalities and facilities) increasing flexibility
to respond to local demand. Fourth, the emerging experience with humanitarian cash transfers to refugees
can over time converge with SSN reforms for nationals to create a resilient social protection system which
will improve labor market functioning. And finally, strengthen financial markets which can more
effectively intermediate refugee assets along with local savings and enable investment, including in housing
supply.

Public sector reform is perhaps the single most challenging area to prioritize. Some simplification of
this large agenda is achieved by recognizing that certain constraints that normally fall within this
domain have been extracted as cross-cutting implementation constraints, already discussed above.
But even with this reduction in scope, the public sector remains a common element to numerous constraint
areas: fiscal (because of its size and rigid cost structure), labor market (distorted wage setting), and social
and administrative service delivery (performance management). However, the track record of public sector
reform efforts in Jordan is dismal. This most likely reflects that public sector employment is intrinsic to the
socio-political bargain, undercutting the feasibility of standard approaches to reform.

It may be that while a direct large-scale approach to public sector reform would fail, well-targeted
modifications within the current structure could have relatively large impacts. The recent ability of
the Ministry of Education to control recruitment of teachers, as opposed to being allocated candidates from
a central administrative pool, is a case in point. More generally, consultations in Jordan and experience in
other countries have consistently pointed to the need to work with the grain with the senior and middle
management layer in ministries, while helping them more effectively elaborate the constraints that they


                                                      97
face. This is a matter of sustained facilitation and dialogue within ministries, departments and agencies –
and not parachuted technical assistance. If done patiently and consistently, these critical personnel can be
more willing to acknowledge gaps in managerial skills, the absence of relevant strategies to guide policy,
and the degree to which inertia in operational frameworks continues to drive current decision making.

                              to be contextualized in terms of the labor market,
                              public sector performance, and household risk

The reform orientation and SCD filters jointly determine priorities not just for what should be done,
but how it should be done. Table 7.2 consolidates the major constraint areas from Table 7.1 and
characterizes them both in terms of their reform orientation and the particular SCD filters to which they are
most responsive. For example, fiscal stability addresses preconditions, business climate scores well as
complementing other reforms, while education and health interventions will address non-income inequality
arising from access and quality issues and thus improve the welfare of the bottom 40 percent. However,
each area also has a reform orientation: it can either reinforce reform momentum by shifting outcomes away
from the current inertia and stasis in many areas, or it can retard reform by absorbing and isolating the
positive impact of interventions. In the past, fiscal policy was used in this way, as it provided a buffer to
limit the scope of subsidy reforms. Certain interventions such as product-based development and
promotion, vocational training programs, and stand-alone SME finance are particularly prone to this
challenge, because on their own they are “pushing on a string” and not addressing the underlying distortions
which give rise to the associated outcomes.



Knowledge Gaps

Significant information will become available over the next 12 months which will shed further light
on demographic and poverty dynamics. Analysis of the 2014 household income and expenditure survey
is about to begin, while a census will be undertaken towards the end of 2015. The census will be the first
opportunity to rigorously and comprehensively measure the total resident population and understand its
characteristics. The 2014 survey will be informative about the impacts of the major shocks experienced by
Jordan in recent years, several of which have unfolded since the 2010 survey. It will be particularly useful
to link household welfare to labor market characteristics and income sources, as many puzzles about the
labor market relate to these linkages. Housing is also a critical component of welfare and comparatively
little is known about its impact on the welfare of the bottom 40 despite the clear correlation of poverty with
household size and the housing supply strains in many areas.

Ongoing work regarding refugee impacts on host communities will fill a major knowledge gap, but
will not be available within the SCD timeframe. It will however be available for the CPF. The objective
of the Syria refugee crisis impact project (P153563), being undertaken by the Poverty GP, is to assess the
socio-economic impacts of the Syrian refugee crisis on Syrian refugees and hosting communities. This
project will implement newly designed household surveys in Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraqi Kurdistan using a
unified survey instrument to be administered on both Syrian refugees and hosting countries’ communities.
It will compare a range of outcomes across the groups in each of the three countries, as well as camp and
non-camp refugee populations. The analysis can provide insights into the efficacy and lacunae in
humanitarian response, the effect of the crisis on local economic conditions including prices, employment,
and service delivery; and identify development interventions for the immediate and medium term.

There are significant knowledge gaps in the education sector, and higher education in particular
presents pressing questions on which the Bank currently lacks the knowledge to respond. Tertiary
institutions are proliferating despite uncertain job prospects for their graduates and deficiencies in quality

                                                     99
control. It is likely that a mix of credentialing, cultural factors, and disguised unemployment are driving
some of these outcomes but no quantitative evidence is available. On education and B40 linkages, Jordan
would need to define a national standard for assessing social vulnerabilities. Education data should be
systematically disaggregated by the nationally defined categories of vulnerabilities (gender, poor, ethnicity,
disability, cultural and social class system etc.). This would allow answering questions and issues such as:
i) to what degree boys and girls with economically under-privileged family background have equitable
opportunities to access and experience longer school-life expectancy?; ii) which are the social vulnerability
types that are best predictors of students’ poor performance in the schooling system? iii) to what extent is
transition from school to work constrained by socioeconomic background when graduates from vocational
and academic streams are compared? Overlaying these questions on the challenges faced by refugee
children is strongly warranted.

There is little information available on the precise contribution of water to the economy, and to
poverty reduction. This is a knowledge gap that extends far beyond Jordan. As for basic data on sector
performance, data are collected but are not always easy to access – both for government and public. The
Ministry of Water and Irrigation produces annual reports, but more information on water resources, their
allocation and management for both surface and groundwater are still required.

The most critical analytical constraint for social safety nets is the lack of a safety net module on the
national household survey that can assess the targeting performance of SSN programs. NAF is
currently the only program surveyed. Moreover there is need to better understand how other existing
targeted safety net programs are functioning and how efficient are they in terms of reaching the poor and
vulnerable. In addition, there is need for more robust performance indicators on the current fuel subsidy
cash compensation scheme to assess their targeting accuracy, coverage, leakage, as well as poverty impact
(in view of the associated subsidy reform program that has an impact on poverty in Jordan).

Despite evidence that land market dysfunctions are contributing to suboptimal spatial development,
limited analyses have been done on the land market in Jordan. An up-to-date analysis of local
governments and their service delivery and management performance would help in identifying constraints
to improving service delivery and housing, and to enabling cities to facilitate environments for inclusive
growth.

Annex 1                      ICT Sector in Jordan

Overview of sector

Jordan is at the forefront of the information communication technology (ICT) sector in the MENA
region, thanks to the drive and innovation of its entrepreneurs as well as continued concerted effort
by the government to advance the sector. It is estimated that over 50 percent of the country’s startups are
                                                                                                62
in the ICT field, including telecom, IT, mobile online businesses, and game development . Over the last
decade, the country’s ICT sector has thrived due to its strong human capital base, close regional and
international trade as well as a competitive deregulated market and increased penetration of ICT
infrastructure. Growth has been buttressed in particular by outsourcing and data processing and hosting
              63
markets . According in ICT Association of Jordan (INT@J) and the Ministry of ICT, IT exports grew 8
percent to record high of $324 million between 2012 and 2013, albeit telecom revenues fell by 6.4 percent
                                                               64
to $1.6 billion over the same period . While revenues are shrinking due to various factors including
government tax hikes and weak macroeconomic environment, the expansion of ICT exports (represents
only 2 percent of total exports of goods and services) offers significant opportunity, both for job creation
and growth.

The ICT sector is one of the key industries of Jordan, contributing to 14 percent of the country’s
                                                                    65
GDP and 1.25 percent of the total workforce . In the Global Information and Technology Report 2015,
Jordan ranks number 52 out of 143 countries on ICT and Network Readiness Index, above most other
MENA countries such as Egypt (94), Lebanon (99), and Tunisia (81) as well as above some EU countries
                                                       66
like Italy (55) and Greece (66) . According to the report, Jordan positioning in the ICT sector is boosted
by its favorable ranking on business and innovation environment, affordability, and skills; however, it is
hampered by (i) poor infrastructure, namely reliability of power, secure internet servers and bandwidth
availability; and (ii) political and regulatory environment, specifically effectiveness of law making bodies
and enforcement of contracts.

Constraints/Challenges

Weak macroeconomic conditions coupled with industry-specific challenges and intense competition
has increased pressure on the ICT sector in Jordan. In the telecom sector, the GoJ doubled taxes on to
                                                                                        67
16 percent and 24 percent in 2014 on telecom operators and mobile subscriptions , respectively, which has
significantly impacted their revenues. Decline in profitability has also been fueled by rising electricity costs

which has significantly increased operators’ operational costs. Since telecom operators are one of the major
spenders, they are less likely to contract local companies down the value-chain that invest in new products,
                                                               68
solutions, and value propositions . Additionally, given the fiscal pressures facing the government,
reduction in taxes and reinstatement of subsidy is unlikely in the near future and thus will negatively impact
on related ICT industries. Limited fiscal space and absence of public-private partnerships has also hindered
maintenance and improvement of technological infrastructure, which is critical to the growth of many IT
businesses and technology firms. Specifically Government policy (e.g. tax, labor) coupled with strong non-
oil growth and more stable business environments in GCC economies in particular has also resulted in a
brain drain of Jordanian talent. In 2013, over 50 Jordanian tech companies moved their ventures to outside
                         69
of the country . Others argue, however, that the relative size of MENA regional markets, including that of
Jordan, drives many start-ups and entrepreneurs to go outside their host countries to achieve scale. Lastly,
as the ICT sector in Jordan has advanced rapidly, there has been a lag at the tertiary level to keep abreast
the latest needs and requirements for the sector. The issue of skills mismatch is a major impediment for the
private sector--75 percent of employers in the ICT sector in Jordan note of having difficulty finding well-
educated staff. Many ICT operators therefore send their staff to post-graduate external courses to reinforce
and upgrade their skills base.

Opportunities

In MENA, Jordan has emerged as a technology hub as around 600 tech companies and 300 startups
                                                                          70
have sprung up in the country over the last several years . This success has been underpinned by
Jordan’s focus on ICT education, conducive regulatory environment (deregulated market with no
restriction on non-Jordanian ownership) that has increased competition in the sector. Both public and
private stakeholders are focused on supporting a digital based economy. The Central Bank of Jordan has
                                                                                             71
introduced a strategy to develop the legal framework for all e-payments systems in Jordan , while financial
institutions and private companies are concentrating on strengthening e-commerce platforms. To further
entrepreneurship and give starts ups international exposure, initiatives such as Umniah’s Plug ‘N Play were
launched to allow local entrepreneurs to learn from Silicon Valley experts on how to grow their business
and build connections. In order further enhance the human capital base across the ICT sectors, and address
the skills mismatch issue, there is potential growth opportunities in the vocational education and training
(VET) institutes as well as room for greater collaboration between higher education and prospective
employers to help ensure Jordan maintain its edge in this sector.

Within the sub-sectors of ICT, a number of opportunities exist to support firm growth as well as create
employment opportunities.

             Mobile: The market for mobile value-added and data services is expected to see strong growth over
              the next few years, specifically through the expansion or enhancement of services to existing

              customers. With the introduction of 4G and fiber optic broadband services, mobile operators can
              also offer these services to increase customer base and loyalty through product-bundling schemes.
             Broadband: Given the low broadband penetration with only fixed broadband penetration at a mere
                                  72
              4.5 percent , the potential for growth is sizable especially by improving the capacity of broadband
              infrastructure to provide higher speeds and reliable and secure connections.
             Export-oriented growth: Jordan seeks to become both regionally and internationally recognized
              exporter of ICT products and services, for example business process outsourcing and call centers.
              At present, roughly 25 percent of Jordan’s ICT exports go to Saudi Arabia, a little over 20 percent
              go to the United States with significant potential for future growth.
             Venture Capital Funds: While access to finance for SMEs and entrepreneurs alike remains
              constrained, the recent emergence of VC and PE Funds such as Badia Impact Fund, Wamda, iMena
              and Oasis500 have helped fill the gap.
             E-commerce: With expected improvement in broadband services including through the
              introduction of 4G data services, the demand for e-commerce is likely to increase.

Annex 2                      Renewable Energy Sector in Jordan

Overview of sector

Diversifying its energy sources is a top priority for Jordan as at present the country imports approximately
97 percent of its total energy requirement (including electricity generation) at the expense of 25 percent of
                           73
its annual GDP . The issue of energy security has been a persistent challenge given Jordan’s heavy reliance
on imported fossil fuels and natural gas (primarily from Egypt) to meet its energy needs. This has proven
to be both costly and unreliable, especially due to the disruptions in Egyptian gas flows since 2011.
According to data from the Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources (MEMR), the cost of consumed energy
                                                                                                          74
in Jordan grew from $2.6bn in 2010 to $4.6bn in 2012, a hike of 43 percent . To reduce its vulnerability to
gas supplies, oil price volatility as well as ease the economic burden of rising energy demand and costs, the
Government of Jordan (GoJ) is pushing ahead with a number of renewable (wind, solar) schemes. Several
developers have reached financial close in for solar energy projects (worth up to $560 million) under the
first phase of the state's feed-in tariff (FIT) program, for which power-purchase agreements (PPA) were

compete with conventional power

Through these efforts, the GoJ aims to increase the contribution of renewables in the energy mix from 1.5
                                                                                                                                      78
percent in 2014 to 10 percent by 2020 (600-100 MW wind, 300-600 MW solar, and 30-50 MW biomass) .
Broadening its energy mix will help to stimulate local industry systems and clusters by driving down their
operational costs in the immediate term and ensures sustainable energy supply in the medium to long-term.

Progress to date in promoting RE and remaining constraints
Over the past decade, GoJ has made a concerted effort to realize the renewable energy potential of Jordan
by formulating a strategic vision for the energy sector, setting renewable energy targets, and introducing a
number of laws to help pave the way for large-scale investments. In 2005, the National Energy Efficiency
Strategy called for the promotion of energy efficiency measures in all sectors, development of local energy
resources including renewable energy and adopting a rational pricing policy for meeting high energy
demand79. In 2007, this strategy was updated and helped introduce a number of incentives including 100%
exemption from income tax over 10 years to encourage independent power producers (IPPs) to generate
electricity on a Build Own Operate (BOO) and Build Own Transfer (BOT) basis. Other measures that were

part of the strategic plan included a progressive removal of oil and electricity subsidies (to reflect their true
costs), the establishment of an energy data bank, the elimination or reduction of a sales tax and customs
duties on relevant materials, and the provision of renewable energy grants and loans, among others80.
Despite making energy security and sustainability an area of strategic importance, the GoJ was slow in
making meaningful progress on above measures and initiatives. However, in 2011 the economy was
confronted with growing fiscal and current pressures due to Jordan’s dependence on subsidized and low
cost natural gas imported from Egypt which was hampered due to the Arab Spring turmoil. As a result in
2012, Jordan announced it would phase out its fuel subsidies as well as passed the Renewable Energy and
Efficiency Law (REEL) in April 2012 (the first of its kind in the region) and subsequent by-laws81 to help
facilitate private sector investments in renewables. Today, Jordan has positioned itself as one of the front-
runners in the RE space in MENA as it has developed a legal and regulatory framework for renewables and
there is strong political will to push this agenda forward. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement
across several key areas.

             Network: Grid infrastructure, upgrades, and management necessary to support large scale power
              supply from renewable sources is an emerging challenge. It is expected that the grid will need to
              accommodate 1.8 GW of additional generation capacity from renewable energies in the next ten
                     82
              years . Additionally, significant infrastructure investments will be needed to transmit power from
              the south (where solar farms are concentrated) to Amman and the north (where the energy demand
                                83
              in most intense) . Similarly, integration of a smart grid, which remains at an infant stage in Jordan,
              is critical, as it allows for more efficiency and reliability of power and greater transparency in
              service, as well as the need to develop storage capacity. Some progress has been made on grid
              infrastructure including through the NEPCO Green Corridor project, a multi-component program
              to reinforce Jordan's high voltage electricity grid for integration of more renewable generation
                                                                                                            84
              capacity and to improve reliability of supply, funded by European Investment Bank (EIB) . Other
                                                                                                        85
              proposals put forth to expand RE network capacity include a grant of $310 million (part of a
              broader 1GWp solar IPP proposal) in June 2015 from Hanergy, a China-based renewable energy
              company, and similar proposal by Masdar in 2014. However, neither of these proposals have
              progressed forward to date.
             Financing: So far the financing of large-scale renewable energy projects has gone through a
              government solicited competitive tendering processes. Although, the success of Round I tendering
              has increased the appetite of commercial banks (both regional and global) to fund renewable IPPs
              in Jordan. The availability of financing schemes for smaller-scale investments in RE however is
              still limited as local banks lack experience in providing project finance in RE space as well as often
              do not have the appropriate risk appetite and/or special financing programs to support renewable
                                                        86

              financing options available to investors from international IFIs or DFIs. Some other alternative
              sources of funding include the Jordan Renewable Energy & Efficiency Fund (JREEEF), which is
              a branch of the MEMR. While JREEEF was established in 2012, it finally launched in June 2015
              and is set to disburse JD25 million to provide financial and technical assistance to sustainable

              energy projects including equipping homes with PV systems in rural areas .
             Implementation of RE legal framework: While there is a strong level of commitment by GoJ to
              implement its RE strategy through the developed legal framework, the lack of coordination among
              the host of governmental institutions concerned with RE approvals and licensing (MEMR, ERC,
                                                  88

              costs associated with delays . In addition, the GoJ needs to ensure that the remaining obstacles in
              the legal and regulatory frameworks are addressed to help attract private investors to invest in
              Jordan RE space. Some key areas include developing FIT for residential solar (currently only net-
              metering available) as well as addressing the distortions in the current model which rewards
              generation (i.e. kWh produced) rather than the investment (i.e. installed capacity).


Opportunities for scale up
                                                               Graph 1:     Conducive Environment
In Jordan, the demand for energy is
expected to continue to rise (5.5
percent per annum), especially as the
economy becomes more dependent on
services and manufacturing sectors as
well as shifts structurally towards
urban centers. While the GoJ has
already initiated the process to develop
RE projects (through direct proposals,
competitive bidding, or EPC Turn-
key) such as Tafila Wind and 7-Solar
PVs, there remains significant
investment opportunity for private investors to finance the pipeline of projects to help meet the growing
demand and Jordan’s RE target of 1000MW of wind and 600MW of solar generation by 2020. According
to a survey conducted by DNV GL, Jordan is seen as the market with the highest short and long-term
                                       90
potential in the region given the conducive regulatory environment for RE and solar growth prospects for
the country (see graphs). As the proportion of renewables increases in the energy mix, there is potential to
support the supply-chain of RE technologies by encouraging and promoting local industries to manufacture

renewable energy components for the domestic and regional
markets. However, this would require significant upgrade and
expansion of industrial capabilities and research and
development capacity as well as training of individuals (e.g.
engineers, other related professionals). In the long-run, there
is also potential to capitalize on Jordan’s interconnectedness
with its neighbors (esp. with respect to electricity) which can
help pave the way to one-day even export excess supply of
energy sourced from renewables.




Conclusion
In order to meet Jordan’s growing energy demand and recognizing its vulnerability to the vagaries in the
oil market and dependency on imported gas (especially since 2011), the government stepped up its efforts
to roll out an ambitious renewable energy agenda. Thanks to a strong regulatory and legal framework for
renewables, Jordan has been able to achieve significant progress in attracting private investors to develop
its renewable energy projects. The success of the Round I tenders, followed by record low FIT in Round II
bidding has had a strong demonstration effect on the overall sector. It has not only helped increase
commercial banks (global and regional) appetite to fund RE projects, but also served to highlight the
increased efficiencies, falling costs, and grid parity advances of the renewable industry, particularly solar
and wind. Despite the impressive growth, however, it is important to address the remaining challenges
facing the sector including network capacity, additional sources of funding, and streamlining of the
regulatory process, which would help ensure Jordan meets its target of 10 percent of renewable energy in
the overall energy mix by 2020.

Annex 3                      Survey on Quality of Implementation Processes
A survey was conducted of a select group of WBG TTLs on the quality of government processes in
Jordan. The TTLs surveyed are either working on Jordan at present or have done so in the past. Thus the
exercise captures the knowledge of people who, between them, have several years of experience and
familiarity with the workings of the Jordanian government.

The survey consisted of 22 statements related to different stages of implementation. TTLs were asked
to rate each statement on a four-point scale (i.e., whether the statements were mostly true, sometimes
true, rarely true or not true at all). The statements, examples of which are provided in the box below,
were worded such that a “mostly true” answer is the most favorable from the implementation point of view
and “not true at all” the most unfavorable. The questionnaire was sent to 30 TTLs, of which 20 responded.

  Examples of statements included in the survey

      1. Good mechanisms are in place to carry out public-private dialogues and are regularly used by
         government to engage the private sector.
      2. Once a subject has been put on the government’s agenda for action, there is an efficient process at work
         to move from there to a point where a detailed action plan has been prepared and endorsed.
      3. The action plans typically identify clear responsibilities for implementation.
      4. Mandates of various government agencies are well-defined.
      5. Good mechanisms are in place to ensure that the required resources (financial, technical, human) are
         available to implementing agencies.
      6. Good mechanisms are in place to gather just-in-time information on implementation progress and alert
         management/oversight authorities.
      7. There are stakeholder feedback loops on implementation progress.
      8. There are post-project implementation monitoring mechanisms in place.  



To facilitate analysis, summary scores were generated from the responses in the following manner.
                                                                                        91
First, a weighted average score was calculated for each of the 22 statements. The maximum score a
statement can have is 3 (i.e., if all respondents rated it as “mostly true”). The weighted average score for all
the statements related to each stage of implementation were then averaged to get an average score for each
of the four stages. These scores are presented in the chart below.




                                                            
91
   The weighted average scores were obtained using the following equation: S = (3.S1 + 2.S2 +1.S3 +0.S4), where
S=weighted average score for a statement; S1=proportion of respondents rating that statement as “mostly true”;
S2=proportion rating as “sometimes true” S3=proportion rating as “largely untrue” S4=proportion rating as “not true
at all”.

 The core implementation stage: mechanisms to ensure that action plans are implemented

1. Good mechanisms are in place to ensure that the required resources (financial,    0.94                                                  5.9
   technical, human) are available to implementing agencies.
2. Good mechanisms are in place to ensure coordination in government.                1.24                                                  35.8
3. Turf battle amongst government agencies is not a serious issue.                   1.00                                                  29.4
4. Good mechanisms are in place to hold the implementing agencies accountable.       1.18                                                  29.4
   There is a requirement for regular monitoring of implementation progress.
5. There are stakeholder feedback loops on implementation progress.                  1.07                                                  12.6
6. There are well laid out procedures to discuss and act on these monitoring reports 0.88                                                  5.9

The agenda creating phase: mechanisms to put findings/recommendations on government agenda

1. Good mechanisms are in place to carry out public-private dialogues and are             1.35             40
   regularly used by government to engage the private sector
2. The Government has good mechanisms/processes in place to deliberate internally         1.55             50
   on the findings of diagnostic and analytic reports, or recommendations coming out
   of stakeholder dialogues, prioritize them and put them on the government’s formal
   agenda (e.g., through development strategies, plans etc.).
3. Based on the historical record in Jordan, development strategies or statements of      1.53             47
   policy intent can be taken seriously.
The action plan endorsement stage: mechanisms which lead to a concrete action plan

4. Once a subject has been put on the government’s agenda for action, there is an         1.55             50
   efficient process at work to move from there to a point where a detailed action plan
   has been prepared and endorsed.
5. The action plans typically identify clear responsibilities for implementation.         1.80             70
6. The action plans typically contain clearly defined milestones and an M&E               1.50             50
   framework with specific outputs, intermediate outcomes and outcomes.
7. Resources to implement the action plans are clearly identified.                        1.45             45
8. Typically, consensus is built within government behind action plans.                   1.55             55
The core implementation stage: mechanisms to ensure that action plans are implemented

9. Good mechanisms are in place to ensure that the required resources (financial,         1.00             10
    technical, human) are available to implementing agencies.
10. Good mechanisms are in place to ensure coordination in government.                    1.25             45
11. Mandates of various government agencies are well-defined.                             2.00             85

13. There is good information flow within government.                                     1.30             40
14. Government leverages resources of other partners, such as knowledge possessed by      1.47             42
    the private sector, to support implementation.
15. Good mechanisms are in place to hold the implementing agencies accountable.           1.20             30
    There is a requirement for regular monitoring of implementation progress.
16. Good mechanisms are in place to gather just-in-time information on implementation     1.20             35
    progress and alert management/oversight authorities.
17. There are stakeholder feedback loops on implementation progress.                      1.11             16
18. There are well laid out procedures to discuss and act on these monitoring reports     0.90             5
    and just-in-time alerts.

The post-implementation stage: mechanism to ensure sustainability and learning from experience

19. Action plans pay attention to the sustainability of the actions/projects after project   1.30   40
    ends, with sustainability plans drawn up.
20. There are post-project implementation monitoring mechanisms in place.                    0.85   10
21. There are processes in place to learn from experience, and to disseminate that           0.75   10
    knowledge within and outside government.
22. Stakeholders are engaged to get feedback on long-term implementation.                    0.85   15
