              PACIFIC FUTURES AND PACIFIC POSSIBLE
              The World Bank’s Pacific Futures (2011) and Pacific Possible (2017) work recognizes the
              structural barriers to international competitiveness and economic growth in the Pacific Islands
              posed by small population size, remoteness from major markets, and internal dispersion and
              division. It also recognizes the constraints posed by their vulnerability to external shocks and
              environmental fragility. Since these structural barriers undermine global competitiveness in
              manufacturing and service industries, this work suggests that potential drivers of growth in
              the Pacific Islands will be limited to a few sectors where natural endowments enable these
              structural barriers to be overcome, because the rents that can be generated from these
              geographically specific natural endowments can potentially cover the higher production costs.
              This work focuses on fisheries, minerals, and tourism and also emphasizes the importance of
              international labor mobility and long-term, predictable, and significant levels of aid provided
              through country systems for improving the living standards of Pacific Islanders.

                This SCD draws heavily on World Bank staff analysis of unit-record data from the 2012/13 HIES. To analyze and disaggregate the data from a welfare
              perspective, the analysis focuses on the records for which complete consumption aggregates were available (re-weighted appropriately). As a result,
              some indicators might deviate slightly from equivalent statistics published elsewhere (such as SINSO’s comprehensive HIES report). The SCD primarily
              focuses on the national measure of basic needs poverty in examining the nature of deprivation within and across Solomon Islands. The global poverty
              rates referred to earlier (based on the 2011 purchasing power parity US$1.90 and US$3.10 lines) are used to provide an international perspective only.

                During the 2012/13 HIES, economic activity in parts of Makira was affected by flash floods, landslides and cyclone damage, so the reported high
              incidence of poverty might not be found in a different year.

                Preliminary formulations of poverty maps constructed using small area estimation techniques also show considerable spatial variation in poverty. Wards
              with relatively high rates of poverty are found in seven of the nine provinces, including constituting half of the wards of Honiara.

   The lower tier of government consists of nine provincial authorities (formerly colonial administrative units) and the Honiara City Council (HCC).
    Each has an elected assembly, but these authorities are established under legislation, and the central government has retained tight control over their
    executive and legislative functions.

    Except for the sphere of law and order, the colonial state had very limited reach—and even in this basic respect, it relied heavily on local governance
    systems to maintain public order. In the early independence period, the state expanded education provision through provincial government-run schools,
    but it retreated from the sphere of law and order, leaving little in the way of public authority in the lives of most Solomon Islanders.

   The original analysis of the 2005/06 HIES reports a Gini coefficient of 0.39, with the bottom two quintiles accounting for 19 percent of aggregate
consumption. At face value, this suggests a decline in inequality between 2005/06 and 2012/13, but as indicated the two consumption distributions
are not comparable.

   For similar reasons to the inequality statistics, it is not possible to make robust comparisons between the two HIES of the extent of interprovincial inequality.

   Note that questions and response options relating to access to water, sanitation, and electricity were significantly altered between the 2005/06 and
2012/13 surveys. The access rates presented represent best World Bank staff estimates, but they are not directly comparable, and small changes should be
interpreted with caution.

   The available baselines are 2005 for net primary enrolment (74 percent for girls and 77 percent for boys), and 2006 for net junior secondary

         CUSTOMARY LAND IN SOLOMON ISLANDS
         Some 87 percent of the land area of Solomon Islands is designated as customary land. This
         means that ownership of it and access to it are governed by customary systems, usually involving
         control by kinship groups (matrilineal in some areas, patrilineal in others). In rural areas, where
         most land is in customary hands, indigenous Solomon Islanders have access to land to live on
         and for subsistence purposes through kinship networks. Social identity is generally very closely
         tied to kinship and thus also to land. Customary land is not meant to be available for commercial
         use. Formally, that requires prior registration of the land, involving demarcation of boundaries
         and naming up to five people as ‘duly appointed representatives’ of the landowners on its title
         (a trusteeship system). Monson (2010) has found that in practice these representatives have
         nearly always been men—including in areas of matrilineal landholding.

         The rest of the land area of Solomon Islands is alienated land—including Honiara, within the
         city boundaries, the provincial capitals, and virtually all of the flat agricultural land in the
         country. Almost all alienated land is publicly owned, with the Commissioner of Lands holding
         the perpetual estate interest in public land on behalf of the government. With the passage of
         the Land and Titles Amendment Act (2014), the government established a Land Board, shifting
         decision making from the Commissioner of Lands to the Land Board. Most public land has
         been allocated on 75-year leases—called ‘fixed term estates’ (FTEs)—to firms and households.
         In contrast to rural areas, where land provides for housing, subsistence, and access to essential
         services like water, in informal settlements in and around Honiara residents typically lack
         security of tenure where they live, there is little space for subsistence production, and access
         to essential services can be denied because of lack of formal title.

CHILD UNDERNUTRITION IN SOLOMON ISLANDS
Solomon Islands faces the double burden of malnutrition-related diseases, reflected in a high
prevalence of child stunting and wasting while rates of overweight/obesity are rising. According
to the 2012/13 HIES, 38 percent of children five and under are stunted, a rate considered ‘high’
according to WHO thresholds. Furthermore, 16 percent of children under five are wasted, a level
considered ‘alarming’ according to WHO thresholds. Nutrition lays the biochemical foundation for
physical and cognitive development. Stunting is a well-established risk marker and proxy population
indicator for chronic malnutrition, which impairs child health, development, and well-being. Height
growth not accumulated before age two is largely irrecoverable and the cognitive impacts on
brain development are largely irreversible. Severe childhood wasting is associated with an 11-fold
increase in the risk of mortality. Early life undernutrition also increases later life propensity for the
development of NCDs.

HIES data indicates that rates of stunting are higher among poor people and for boys relative
to girls. The rate of stunting for children in the bottom 40 percent of households is 43 percent,
compared to 33 percent for the top quintile. Rates of stunted and wasted children are also generally
higher among boys than girls and are slightly higher in rural areas than urban areas. There are
considerable variations across provinces, with the rate of stunting highest in Makira (at 46 percent)
and lowest in Guadalcanal (at 33 percent).

Childhood undernutrition arises from immediate factors such as poor nutrient intake and diseases,
as well as underlying factors including food insecurity, poor access to sanitation and unhygienic
environments, and poor access to reproductive, maternal, and child health services. Low access
to improved water and sanitation and the poor quality of diets are thought to be contributing
factors to the high prevalence of stunting in Solomon Islands. Only 27 percent of households have
access to improved sanitation and 76 percent to an improved water source, factors reflected in high
rates of diarrhea. However, the extent of variations in access to improved sanitation between rural
and urban areas and within urban areas is far greater than the variation in stunting rates between
rural and urban areas and across quintiles, suggesting other factors are also important. The quality
of diet in is generally poor (mostly cereals and starchy root vegetables). In addition, complementary
feeding practices among children aged 6–23 months are poor, with inadequate frequency and
dietary diversity (indicative data shows that only 37 percent met recommended dietary practices).
There is a high anemia rate among women of reproductive age (40 percent), potentially resulting in
maternal mortality and poor delivery outcomes including intrauterine growth retardation. Low birth
weight, indicating the in utero origins of growth faltering, is high at 13 percent and is associated with
young maternal age, short birth intervals, and poor maternal nutrition. Teenage pregnancy rates are
relatively high, at 12.3 percent for 15–19 year olds, and there are low rates of met family planning
needs.

Evidence-based interventions to improve early childhood nutrition and development have much
higher rates of return than interventions aimed at addressing skills and capacities in later life. To
date, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) has not adopted or consistently implemented
interventions proven to prevent and treat undernutrition. There has also been little progress with
implementing donor-supported programs in the MHMS to increase access to improved water and
sanitation. However, these are only aspects of the problem: all factors that contribute to low levels
of empowerment for women (endowments in health and education, economic opportunities, and
voice and agency) contribute to high levels of undernutrition in children.

       THE SUCCESSFUL REFORM OF SIEA
       In the last decade, there has been a remarkable turnaround in the performance of SIEA. At the end of
       2007, SIEA’s performance was poor—on average, customers had their power interrupted at least twice
       a day and were without power for nearly 2.5 hours a day, largely due to lack of generation reserves and
       network outages. SIEA’s poor financial position was due to a low collection rate, significant customer
       arrears (including government ministries and other SOEs), high fuel costs, significant non-technical losses,
       poor billing and accounting systems, and weak internal controls. The frequent and lengthy power-outages
       reduced household and business productivity and raised costs through damage from power fluctuations and
       (for businesses and wealthy households) the need to maintain generator-based backup systems. By 2011,
       SIEA had reached a point of financial crisis. It was close to insolvency, with severe cash-flow problems, and
       faced the threat of curtailed fuel deliveries, risking power rationing across urban areas. Subsequently, SIEA
       has increased generator efficiency and improved maintenance arrangements, improved reserve margins
       by overhauling cooling systems and boosting available capacity, improved fuel supply competitiveness,
       addressed metering deficiencies and fraud at large commercial customers, shifted to pre-paid meters for
       the majority of customers, improved customer service, and reformed its financial management and internal
       audit systems. After two decades of underinvestment due to the previous poor financial position, SIEA
       has commenced a significant program of capital investment in generation, transmission, and distribution
       infrastructure—including to expand the reach of its services. The capacity and reliability of the power
       system has improved and the collection ratio is now high (Table 9), though significant work remains to
       further reduce system losses.

       A number of factors contributed to this turnaround. The government provided an opening for the
       World Bank to assist SIEA through the Solomon Islands Sustainable Energy Project (SISEP), approved
       in 2008. Initial progress was slow, however. A vital complement to SISEP was the 2007 SOE Act and
       2010 SOE Regulations (supported by the ADB), which provided a new framework for SOE governance,
       accountability, and performance, and also reestablished a mechanism for community service obligations.
       A new board was appointed in 2010 under the new regulations, with members selected on the basis of
       professional and technical expertise, in contrast to the previous practice of political appointments. The
       effective implementation of the act and regulations at SIEA resulted in improved corporate governance and
       closer oversight of management performance and guided the design and implementation of a restructuring
       plan. The near insolvency of SIEA in 2011 then catalyzed action by MoFT to broker a new deal to have
       SIWA’s debts to SIEA paid (SIWA being its largest customer, with debts accumulating from 2008), and to
       implement fundamental reforms at SIWA (including replacing its board, appointing new management, and
       allowing water tariffs to be indexed to allow for electricity price pass-through). The electricity bills of other
       government entities were also to be paid on time, with MoFT making them on behalf of the other ministries.
       After years of accepting a norm of constant problems with SIEA and poor quality electricity services at
       high prices, the near crisis at SIEA catalyzed sufficient government commitment—including the interest
       and involvement of the Minister of Finance—to enable the reforms to proceed. The influence of donors was
       also important, with expatriate advisers holding important roles in MoFT and the restructuring of SIWA’s
       debt to SIEA being included in the joint policy matrix for budget support. Donors supported reforms and
       investments at SIWA that were instrumental to improving the situation at SIEA. The remarkable turnaround
       of SIEA provides a powerful demonstration of how well SOEs can work—a demonstration of benefits that
       may strengthen the hand of those in government arguing for similar reforms in other SOEs.

            SOLOMON ISLANDS GROWTH PROSPECTS:
            CONSTRAINTS AND POLICY PRIORITIES
            The World Bank undertook this analysis in 2010 in response to a request from the government
            to investigate future growth prospects for Solomon Islands. At the time, post-conflict growth
            had been driven by the rapid expansion of logging (with commercially exploitable stocks then
            expected to be exhausted by 2014) and large increases in international aid flows (which, with
            the improving security situation, were then expected to flatten out). The World Bank analyzed
            the growth experiences of small states that had achieved high levels of growth since 1970 and
            showed that the bulk of these depended on natural resource-based industries and tourism,
            with remittances and economic reform in the wake of major economic shocks playing a role
            in a few growth experiences. Taking into account both the particular economic geography of
            Solomon Islands and its weak governance with limited capacity for regulatory and economic
            policy reform, the World Bank identified four key sources of economic growth: a vibrant
            smallholder agriculture sector, natural resource industries that benefit Solomon Islands, an
            internationally mobile workforce, and international partnerships that recognize the central,
            long-term role of aid in supporting public service delivery and providing an added stimulus to
            the local private sector. In recognition of the fact that growth from the identified sources would
            not be distributed equally across the country, the World Bank also identified two key enabling
            requirements: building efficient connections between centers of economic activity and to
            surrounding populations and facilitating the concentration of population and production in
            urban centers. These issues are taken up in this SCD under the third pillar on managing uneven
            development.

LAND AS A FACTOR OF PRODUCTION
Both land that is under customary ownership and land that has been alienated serve as factors
of production in Solomon Islands. The former is used mainly for subsistence and smallholder
agriculture and or is forested. The latter includes urban land, the land used for large-scale
agriculture and forest plantations, and the land for the fish cannery. Secure access to customary
land for commercial use—as well as for the development of infrastructure—is frequently cited
as a major constraint to private sector development in Solomon Islands.

The customary landholding system undoubtedly constrains commercial development, but
whether it is a binding constraint is less clear. It is evident that some investors are able to
negotiate benefit-sharing arrangements that secure the support of local landowning groups,
enabling their access to land for commercial purposes. The government has also been able to
do this with land for infrastructure (though at times senior male landowner representatives
succeed in demanding extraordinary payments for the use of their land or the water from it). It
is also evident that the existing system for registering customary land (rather than the fact that
land ownership is widely distributed among local landowning groups) poses a number of risks.
The trusteeship system risks unscrupulous ‘representatives’ effectively usurping the rights of
members of landowning groups, by negotiating the commercial use of land without necessarily
consulting or securing the consent of the whole landowning group or sharing the rents with
them. This disadvantages women and youth in landowning groups, whose interests are often
marginalized, and is risky for investors, whose lease may not be seen as legitimate. The large
backlog of land-related legal disputes also raises the risks to landowners and investors.

The government is currently investigating alternative models to the existing system, including
making landowning groups (rather than ‘representatives’) corporate actors. If this can be
done in such a way that it secures the rights of all members of landowning groups, it might
improve the equity of and reduce the reservations of landowners over the commercial use
of their land. The government is, for instance, interested in aspects of Vanuatu’s approach to
dealing with gender issues in title transactions. Just as there are risks with the present system,
so there will be with any reforms. Given the complex and contested nature of land ownership
and access and that customary landholdings are currently unmapped, systems that define
exclusive ownership once-and-for-all may provoke inter- as well as intra-group conflicts along
generational and gender lines, as commercialization processes have in the past (Allen 2017).

             AGRICULTURAL VALUE ADDING
             The virgin coconut oil (VCO) industry in Solomon Islands demonstrates a number of
             market-based solutions to the challenges of economic geography. Operating since 2004,
             Kokonut Pacific is a social enterprise creating sustainable livelihoods for rural communities.
             Typically, manual presses are operated by family units, producing organically certified VCO
             from dried coconut meat supplied from their own or surrounding small-scale coconut farms.
             Residual coconut meal supplements livestock feed, increasing protein supply, and coconut
             shells serve as fuel for the drier, mitigating the need to use forest resources. There are now
             about 60 active operators, each with the capacity to employ 6–8 workers. Unlike the male-
             dominated copra industry, women account for about half the employment in the VCO industry
             and are not confined to particular, gender-specific roles. Kokonut Pacific effectively provides
             agricultural extension services for the industry, with training in VCO production and business
             skills accompanying the setup of new presses. Through partnership arrangements, financial
             literacy training and mobile banking are also provided to operators. Differential pricing gives
             operators the incentive to produce high quality oil, with women-led operations typically more
             consistent with the quality of supply. The high-value, low-volume VCO minimizes freight costs
             for shipping to the warehouse in Honiara, and the company reimburses producers for these
             shipping costs up to a ceiling, to ensure all producers receive the same price for their VCO,
             facilitating a degree of geographic spread in supply. At present, Malaita and Guadalcanal
             account for over 80 percent of production, with Isabel dominating the remainder.

             Most of the VCO is exported to niche markets. While the VCO generates a net return for
             operators that is significantly higher than traditional copra production, during periods of
             peak copra prices it is hard for operators to obtain sufficient coconuts. The costs of acquiring
             and setting up a press are prohibitive for most Solomon Islanders—at around SI$ 150,000
             per unit—with access to finance a key constraint. Thus, only a few units have been purchased
             privately. Some have been established by development partners or provincial governments,
             but most have been funded by MPs through CDFs. As such, most of the capital equipment
             of smallholders in the industry was free to the smallholder. (A favorable relationship with the
             relevant MP or provincial authority would have been a prerequisite for its supply.)

The expanding palm oil industry demonstrates another set of market-based solutions to
economic geography and political economy challenges. Guadalcanal Palm Oil Plantation Ltd.
(GPPOL), part of the PNG-based New Britain Palm Oil Group owned by Malaysian conglomerate
Sime Darby, manages plantations on 6,700 hectares of alienated land and registered customary
land, with 233 out-growers on 700 hectares of adjacent non-registered customary land. It
purchased the plantations in 2005, redeveloped them after widespread destruction during
the tension, and secured Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification. Consistent
with RSPO certification, GPPOL and its associated out-growers cannot, since 2005, develop
land that is primary forest or where development affects one or more High Conservation
Values. GPPOL has a zero-deforestation policy. Mitigating the extent of soil erosion and land
degradation, most of the planted land is flat, not surpassing a 9-degree incline. GPPOL is
now the second largest private employer in the country, with about 1,500 workers in its core
operation, 40 percent of whom are women working in a variety of roles.

GPPOL operates in accordance with a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with an
association of the landowners who lease their land for its plantations. GPPOL gave this
Guadalcanal Plains Resource Development Association (GPRDA) a 20 percent stake in
GPPOL—with lease payments, royalties, and other benefits set out in the MOU. These benefits
are controlled by a small number of trustees, usually senior men, but the out-grower scheme
provides more opportunities for women and youth (Allen 2012). GPPOL appears to have
widespread community support, though there have been occasional grievances over its land
leases and employment conditions. Given the history of the plantation and the tension, GPPOL
agreed with GPRDA to prioritize employing people from the surrounding area, with 60 percent
of its workforce Guale and only 2–3 percent Malaitan (compared to over 90 percent before
the tension). GPPOL provides amenities and the equivalent of public services in the company
area: housing for workers, water and electricity supplies, sports facilities, school buses, market
venues and health centers (employing medical staff and procuring its own medical supplies).
Outside the company area, GPPOL supports surrounding schools with teaching materials,
regularly grades access roads, provides minor infrastructure projects, and allows free access to
its health facilities to all members of surrounding communities. Effectively, GPPOL substitutes
for the state in the area, as some large-scale mining operations do in other country contexts.

GPPOL plans to expand operations to cover a further 7,000 hectares of customary land.
This relies on donors financing the road and bridge infrastructure to reach the new production
areas. It also relies on GPPOL securing the registration and lease of enough customary land on
Guadalcanal Plains—the largest tract of arable land in the country—for the nucleus plantation.
Having a higher share of the new area under out-grower production might help to balance
the interests of senior men who typically benefit from lease and royalty arrangements with
women and youth who have more to gain from out-grower participation. With its out-grower
scheme, GPPOL can effectively secure the use of customary land without it being alienated or
registered (GPPOL advances credit to an out-grower on the basis of a company form signed
by a relevant chief indicating recognition of the out-grower’s tenure (Allen 2012). This process
is not seamless, with disputes occasionally arising over the use of customary land by out-
growers. In-grower models might also be worth considering, to make the registration and
lease of land more attractive to a wider set of members within landowning groups. To address
the constraint of access to finance for out-growers, GPPOL provides interest-free loans for
out-growers to purchase seedlings, tools, and fertilizers, with repayments deducted from
future harvest payments (typically three years from planting). GPPOL also provides extension
services to out-growers to maximize yields and ensure compliance with RSPO standards.

       SOLOMON ISLANDS’ ARCHIPELAGIC AND OCEANIC FISHERIES
       Solomon Islands has traded off access to its archipelagic tuna fishery for local jobs in on-
       shore processing. Licenses for archipelagic fishing are reserved for domestic vessels landing
       tuna for local processing. In effect, NFD has exclusive access to the archipelagic tuna fishery,
       with its domestically flagged fleet of five smaller purse seine vessels and two pole-and-line
       vessels holding virtually all the fishing days (NFD is minority owned by the government, with
       Tri Marine the majority owner). NFD can thus use less fuel and spend less time travelling to
       fishing grounds than other operators (including purse seine and pole-and-line vessels) who
       are restricted to the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) or high seas. NFD does not own any
       long-line vessels, but it holds 30 of the total 100 long-line licenses available, leasing them to
       other operators to diversify revenue and attract more raw material for its processing facility.
       This tuna loining and canning operation at Noro in Western Province (SolTuna) is supplied
       primarily by NFD’s purse seines (and to a lesser extent by the long-liners it leases licenses to,
       fishing in the EEZ). SolTuna provides about 1,800 jobs, two-thirds of which are held by women
       (though women are underrepresented in higher wage, supervisory, and senior jobs). The loss
       of European Union (EU) preferences with future least developed country-graduation is likely to
       be problematic for SolTuna, because its exports of cooked loins to the EU are barely profitable.
       The recent Marine Stewardship Council certification of Solomon Islands’ pole-and-line and
       purse seine fishery as well as the lifting of the ‘yellow card’ by the EU provide some incentives
       for sustainable management and may allow for product differentiation along with a modest
       price premium in that market.

       Solomon Islands manages access to its oceanic tuna fishery through a regional partnership
       aimed at maximizing the returns and safeguarding the sustainability of the resource. The
       Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) operate a Vessel Day Scheme (VDS) which establishes
       limits on fishing days for purse seine vessels in the EEZs of participating states, underpinning
       both the price they can get for selling access to their oceanic fisheries and the sustainability
       of those fisheries. Solomon Islands is also implementing the new longline VDS, primarily to
       improve the sustainability of the oceanic fishery through the control of fishing effort by long-
       liners (rather than for revenue purposes, since the price of longline vessel days is likely to
       remain low relative to purse seine days, largely because long-liners are much less dependent
       on access to EEZs to ensure their profitability). While the Solomon Islands is a relatively small
       player in the purse seine industry (targeting skipjack), it is the largest player in the region’s

       Solomon Islands is fairly successful at extracting benefits from its oceanic fishery. In 2016, the
       price it obtained for purse seine vessel days was the highest in the PNA. It could extract even
       more of the rents from the fishery, however, if it and the other participating states operated
       transparent, competitive tenders for allocating vessel days, rather than working through bilateral
       negotiations. The grant of exclusive access to NFD to operate within 30 miles of territorial
       waters of the Main Group Archipelago provides about 150 jobs for local men, including in
       senior roles. The attractiveness of Solomon Islands for additional fish processing operations is
       largely dependent on access to the fishery, with the government potentially able to trade off
       government revenue from the VDS for more local jobs in on-shore processing. Transparent,
       competitive processes will be critical if it is to achieve least cost concessions (like discounted
       vessel day prices) for these jobs. Solomon Islands’ adherence to fishing effort limits under the
       VDS is regarded as strong, though illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing could be further
       reduced if all participating states restricted vessel days to operators in good standing under
       the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency’s Vessel Monitoring Scheme. Notwithstanding these
       efforts, climate change is likely to reduce the tuna stocks in Solomon Islands’ waters over the
       coming decades, adversely affecting government revenue. The widening food fish gap will
       likely require redirection of part of the tuna catch from the oceanic fishery to domestic markets.

       EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND GENDER IN SOLOMON ISLANDS
       While Solomon Islands is frequently described as a patriarchal society, gender relations
       are subject to substantial regional variation and are continually being contested and
       renegotiated, as women seek new avenues for empowerment. Global and regional evidence
       shows that extractive industries (especially when led by foreign investors) can distort gendered
       power dynamics throughout communities, almost always at the expense of women and girls.

       To date in Solomon Islands, men have tended to monopolize the benefits of logging and
       mining development. Decisions about land are typically made by men and negotiations with
       logging and mining companies are led by men, even in areas where matrilineal systems of
       customary ownership prevail. As a consequence, rents and royalties are typically paid to men.
       Employment associated with logging and mining development is also male-dominated and
       heavily gendered, further skewing the distribution of benefits (internationally, women’s jobs
       in mining—when they exist—are typically in cleaning and cooking and are much lower paid).
       Power asymmetries between genders are also affected by access to equipment—and sometimes
       firearms—for men engaged in extractive industries and in ancillary services like security.

       Women—on the other hand—tend to bear a disproportionate share of the costs of logging
       and mining, with flow-on impacts to children and broader communities. Because women
       have limited input to negotiations over land access, outcomes seldom reflect the concerns
       and knowledge of women. Land deals rarely reflect women’s land use, including for livelihoods
       and for child nutrition—with logging and recent mining activities leading to the destruction of
       women’s food gardens and long-term soil damage. With rents and royalties paid to men, cash is
       often used to purchase alcohol—fueling domestic violence—rather than to invest in household
       and child welfare. Land disputes lead to increased conflict and violence within communities,
       with disproportionate costs borne by women. The influx of outside workers to logging and
       mining camps can fuel trade in sex with associated negative impacts, including the spread of
       sexually transmitted diseases and some forms of exploitation, including sex trafficking. There
       are reports of very young girls and boys trading sex for small amounts of money. In some cases,
       families see their daughter having a ‘mining baby’ as an economic asset, reflecting perceived
       obligations of a father to a mother and child, that are often left unmet.

       Protecting the interests of women during the potential expansion of Solomon Islands’ mining
       sector will be vital if negative gender outcomes and associated social costs observed in
       logging are to be mitigated. This may require (a) arrangements for negotiating access that
       allow women’s voices to be heard, including in the ‘Development Forum’ (see below) provided
       for in the new mining policy; (b) skills and livelihoods training to ensure women can access
       benefits from mining development, both within the mining sector and through backward
       linkages between the mining sector and sectors within which women are already active (see
       Eftimie, Heller, and Strongman 2009); and (c) attention to ensuring the equitable distribution of
       benefits within and across communities to reduce risks of contestation, conflict, and violence.

                MINING AND THE CHALLENGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
                The history of the Gold Ridge mine is replete with examples of just how challenging
                environmental protection is in relation to mining in Solomon Islands. To date, mining has
                polluted waterways, degraded food gardens (particularly disadvantaging women), and possibly
                also damaged inland river fisheries. The potential for these kind of impacts to increase in future
                is high, due to the rising risk of heavy rains and flooding with climate change. Foremost among
                the environmental risks attached to the Gold Ridge mine is the tailings dam, which has long
                been a subject of controversy with downstream users claiming it has adversely affected their
                health and the productivity of their land. During the heavy rains preceding the flash flooding in
                2014, the tailings dam flooded with a serious risk of it breaching the dyke and overflowing. In
                early 2015, the foreign company that owned the mine sold it—along with legal liability for the
                tailings dam—to a small set of local ‘landowners’, reportedly for SI$ 100. This occurred despite
                the fact that the buyer lacked the resources to either invest in the proper management of the
                tailings dam or compensate those who would be affected if the dyke broke. It also occurred
                despite opposition from two of the mine’s three landowner associations.

                These events have starkly illustrated that issuing mining licenses to reputable companies
                based in jurisdictions that have stringent environmental standards is no guarantee of the
                conduct of those companies in Solomon Islands. Their conduct is instead determined by the
                environmental regulatory authority of the state in Solomon Islands, and to date it has fallen
                short on its responsibility to protect people and the environment from the risk of environmental
                catastrophe. The government reportedly refused to purchase the Gold Ridge mine itself in
                2014 because of its concerns over the liability for the tailings dam, but lacked either the power
                or the will to take on both the foreign company and the handful of ‘landowners’ involved,
                to prevent the sale to them. The government has now approved the redevelopment of the
                mine by the ‘landowners’ (whose corporation holds 10 percent of the shares in Gold Ridge)
                in partnership with another foreign company (holding 90 percent of the shares). The key
                concerns to government appear to be jobs, tax revenue, growth, and perhaps also returns to
                the handful of ‘landowners’ holding an ownership stake. With the Ministry of Mines, Energy and
                Rural Electrification and Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, Disaster Management and
                Meteorology continuing to act in a disconnected and rival manner with respect to mining, a
                situation mining companies are ready to exploit, it does not seem likely that the environmental
                regulation of the operation will be any stronger in the future than it has been in the past. Given
                local state allowance of the kind of corporate conduct that has occurred at Gold Ridge, as well
                as that currently occurring with bauxite mining on Rennell—and indeed across the logging
                industry—it is important to consider whether foreign states or foreign corporate regulators
                should take more responsibility for holding these foreign corporations to account for their
                conduct abroad.

         While the royalty is fixed by legislation at 3 percent, the means for determining the gross value of bauxite is not stipulated, and the value
       proposed by the mining companies is disputed as unduly low by MoFT. Instead of resolving this problem, mining operators are proceeding
       with exports at the disputed low value.

          MINING AND THE ‘DEVELOPMENT FORUM’ MODEL
          Informed by the tensions that led to the civil war on Bougainville, PNG has established a
          ‘Development Forum’ for its mining and oil and gas sectors. This opens up the negotiation process
          over extractive industry developments to a wide range of stakeholders at different scales (local,
          provincial, national, and global), who have various levels of political and technical capability and
          draw upon different kinds of legitimacy. It provides a forum for bargaining over the distribution
          of the costs and benefits of extraction among the different stakeholders. It recognizes that the
          absence of negotiating rights for all stakeholders systematically excludes particular actors (for
          instance, landowners and local and provincial governments, from deals struck between national
          governments and global mining companies) and potentially contributes to grievances, disputes,
          and violence. The Development Forum provides for negotiations over Memoranda of Agreement
          that are to be reviewed every five years. To date in PNG, it has led to steadily increasing flows
          of resources to landowners and local and provincial governments, including secure (rather than
          discretionary) transfers from the national government.

          Solomon Islands’ NMP includes provision for a Development Forum, modelled on PNG. This is a
          promising development, to the extent that it signals a recognition of the risks that mining can pose
          if actors with a stake in mining development are excluded from decision making and a willingness
          to adopt new approaches in an attempt to address these risks. The proof, of course, will be in
          whether such an institution is actually established in Solomon Islands, how it is constituted, and
          how it and the relevant stakeholders access the resources they need to participate effectively
          in the Development Forum. As an institution with the potential to enhance contestability in the
          policy arena pertaining to mining, its success should be treated as an important concern by
          development partners. Historically, in Solomon Islands, there has been a high level of mining
          company subsidization of Mines Division-mandated activities, a pattern that would entail
          particular risks that would need to be managed if repeated here.

   Unlike forests, mineral resources are state-owned – but default royalty shares perhaps indicate the relatively weak power of the central state
(50 percent) vis-à-vis landowners (40 percent) – with the province at 10 percent.

       SOLOMON ISLANDS’ BUSINESS ENABLING ENVIRONMENT
       Changes to business regulations have delivered important gains. Solomon Islands’ ranking in the
       World Bank Group’s Doing Business indicators has risen over the last decade, to 104 of 190 countries.
       This places it higher than many other Pacific Islands and on par with the small states average (Figure
       36). Foreign direct investment processes, business licensing and tax administration have all improved.
       Solomon Islands now performs very well on paying taxes and dealing with construction permits
       and quite well on getting electricity and getting credit. The time taken to register a business has
       declined from 55 days in 2010 to 9 days in 2017. Commercialization of SOEs and telecommunications
       liberalization have improved infrastructure services vital to firms. Between 2010 and 2017 the time
       taken to get electricity declined from 160 days to 53 days, while between 2009 and 2015 mobile
       network coverage increased from 8 percent to 89 percent and mobile subscriptions increased from
       6 percent to 66 percent.

       However, broader constraints that are often more difficult to address appear binding. In the absence
       of an established strategy or dialogue mechanism, the government’s approach to private sector issues
       is perceived as ad hoc. Firms cite corruption as the main constraint to investment (Figure 37). More
       than 80 percent of firms report having to pay bribes to get things done, compared to 53 percent in
       the broader East Asia and Pacific region. Cultural networks of reciprocity can constrain the growth
       of firms, with Solomon Islanders sometimes finding it difficult to accumulate and reinvest capital in
       the context of strong social pressures to distribute resources. Weaknesses in law and order and the
       court system are also major problems. More than one-third of firms have experienced losses due to
       theft and vandalism, while more than 70 percent of firms pay for their own security (compared to
       less than half of firms in the East Asia and Pacific region). Enforcing contracts is difficult, and around
       17 percent of firms identify the court system as a major constraint. There are important mismatches
       between skills provided through the education system and those sought by firms, often forcing firms
       to rely on skilled migrant workers from overseas. Women are underrepresented in senior and middle
       management positions, and most large and medium businesses are owned by men. Businesses report
       the relatively high burden of taxation falling on compliant businesses, the scarcity of urban land for
       business expansion, and the high cost of providing housing to professional and technical staff as
       major constraints. These issues are not easily addressed through further changes to formal rules and
       systems and reflect underlying governance and political economy constraints.

ACCESS TO FINANCE IN SOLOMON ISLANDS
Access to finance has improved considerably in recent years, with the rapid spread of mobile
banking services and establishment of rural banking schemes providing micro-loans and
savings in some provinces. There are now 170,000 mobile banking customers, an expansion that
has been particularly important for women, who previously represented only about 40 percent
of the banked population (roughly in line with their representation in formal employment). But
with commercial bank loans focused on formal sector enterprises and formal sector workers, the
urban poor—and sometimes even middle-income earners—are generally precluded from access
to credit. Current reforms to the national payment system to increase its financial stability
are expected to facilitate access to finance for the bottom quintiles, and the planned shift to
positive reporting for the credit bureau should also help, including by bringing a greater range
of credit and payment data into the system. Access to financial literacy programs (like those
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) supported for workers at SolTuna) have shown
significant positive impacts on the ability of relatively poor people to arrange their finances
to cover regular expenditures. Financial literacy programs might have wider value too, with
informal moneylenders in many workplaces in Honiara—especially the public sector—lending
to colleagues at 20–30 percent payable next payday, keeping borrowers in a constant cycle of
debt. ‘Savings clubs’ backed by credit institutions are common among the poor, particularly
women, but are not always as benign as they seem—with members becoming de facto debt
collectors in the event of unpaid debts and debtors vulnerable to having their property raided
by the group to avoid penalties falling on the group (Evans 2017). This can result in community
division and disharmony.

A key issue in access to finance remains the ‘missing middle’—firms that are neither part
of the formal sector nor microenterprises for which mobile-banking services might be
sufficient. The commercial banks are effectively not interested in these firms, because of the
transaction costs of catering to them and the relatively high credit risk involved. So, even when
liquidity in the banking sector is extremely high, suitable access to credit is not available to
small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Partly as a result of this, commercial bank credit to the
private sector is low (at 21.6 percent of GDP in 2015) compared to the average for other Pacific
Islands (55.2 percent) and small states (67.2 percent). In addition, over a third of credits in 2015
were personal loans, with loans to the productive sectors (agriculture, fisheries, manufacturing,
mining, forestry, and tourism) together accounting for less than a fifth of loans. The credit
bureau reforms should support access to finance for SMEs, but financial risk mitigation tools
and techniques are also needed to enable banks and finance companies to lend to this sector
at a reasonable interest rate and repayment schedule. The IFC Tourism Impediments Diagnostic
found that although SMEs theoretically have access to loans from commercial banks, few in
the tourism sector can secure them, due to lack of equity or land security and lack of business
planning skills. The situation with agriculture seems similar. The World Bank’s Rural Development
Program provides a good example of the risk mitigation approach, with grants supplementing
SMEs’ equity so they can secure credit from banks (and technical assistance also provided).

Solomon Islands is also facing significant impacts from de-risking in the banking sector.
Solomon Islands has seen the largest decline in correspondent banking relationships in the
Pacific Islands and a resulting increase in concentration of correspondent relationships with
the exit of a major regional bank. Several small money-transfer operators have also ceased
operation. The loss of competition can lead to reduced banking services and increased
costs—with the cost of remittances now higher in Solomon Islands, affecting seasonal workers.

          TOURISM AND WOMEN’S ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT
          Globally and in many Pacific Islands tourism is a major employer, particularly of women.
          Globally, the tourism industry provides an estimated 1 of every 11 jobs worldwide. Data from the
          UN World Tourism Organization shows that women make up a majority of the global tourism
          workforce, while women-owned businesses are significantly more prevalent in the tourism
          industry than in the broader economy. In the Pacific Islands that have developed their tourism
          sectors, women are visible across the industry as both employees and entrepreneurs. Women
          comprise a significant share of staff in hotels and restaurants, for instance, providing the bulk of
          staff in areas such as housekeeping. Although women owners or general managers are seldom
          seen at larger tourism properties, women progressing from entry-level positions to middle
          management is a standard career trajectory in the Pacific Islands.

          Tourism development can be an important tool for enhancing the economic position of
          women, as it provides employment and earning opportunities directly in the communities
          where women live. In the relatively new but fast-growing cruise ship markets in PNG and
          Solomon Islands, several women-owned tour operators have already tapped into the emerging
          opportunities, providing tours and transport to cruise passengers in port. Smaller-scale women
          entrepreneurs are also participating in the cruise market by retailing local crafts, clothing, and
          food, as well as providing services such as spa services and hair braiding. To support further
          expansion of the roles of women entrepreneurs and employees in the tourism industry, a better
          understanding of gender-specific barriers to advancement is required, along with development
          of appropriate training and mentorship opportunities and promotion of women role models.

            THREATS TO TOURISM ASSETS
            Solomon Islands’ primary tourism asset is its natural environment—ocean, beaches, reefs and
            their marine life, dive sites, and lagoons—but this is under considerable threat. These assets
            are threatened by more intensive use of agricultural land (with potential fertilizer runoff),
            over-exploitation of the coastal fishery, logging-induced soil erosion causing sedimentation of
            coastal areas, pollution of waterways and coastal areas from mining operations, and the mining
            of coral for construction purposes. Tourism assets are also threatened by the contamination of
            waterways and the ocean caused by the absence of treatment for sewage or fecal sludge from
            improved sanitation facilities, open defecation, and solid waste that is pushed into waterways
            and the ocean or stored on land without proper containment. Climate change threatens tourism
            assets directly, through rising sea levels and temperatures, coral bleaching, and damage from
            more extreme weather events like cyclones and storm surges. Were the tourism sector to grow,
            the additional demands it places on drinking water together with the additional wastewater
            and solid waste that it would generate (including wastewater from cruise ships, which is
            difficult to monitor and control), and potentially also the increased overfishing, destruction
            of corals, destruction of mangrove systems, and extraction of aggregates from coastal areas,
            could threaten the assets that attract tourists to Solomon Islands, if not effectively regulated.

            These threats are currently increasing in intensity, due to the continued expansion of logging,
            relatively rapid population growth, and the effects of climate change. As well as the direct
            effects of climate change mentioned above, climate change is also threatening tourism assets
            indirectly, for instance by increasing the frequency of heavy rains that worsen soil erosion from
            logging and pollution from solid waste, wastewater, and mining sites. However, although the
            threats to tourism assets are intensifying, the prospects for their protection do not appear to
            be very strong. Particularly with economic growth rates that are only a little above population
            growth rates, the state seems unlikely to regulate logging, mining, or agricultural and fishing
            practices to protect the natural environment. For as long as the tourism industry remains
            small, it will have relatively little political weight. It might take a fairly extensive push in the
            development of the sector, to alter this political economy dynamic.

     INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING FOR LABOUR MOBILITY
     Lessons learned from the experiences of other Pacific Islands suggest the following priorities
     for improving institutional capabilities for labor-sending:

       •	   Revising the recruitment model—the current model in Solomon Islands, which
            relies on private recruitment agents, has had mixed results. By outsourcing worker
            selection and processing to the private sector, the success of this model rests on the
            effectiveness of the participating agents. While some agents have helped bolster
            Solomon Islands’ participation in the RSE, others have defrauded potential seasonal
            workers of earnings. With this model, there is limited quality assurance in place to ensure
            departing workers meet employer requirements or have been adequately prepared for
            their work. It has also resulted in minimal representation from disadvantaged groups
            in the labor market (including women and workers from remote areas). Shifting to a
            ‘work-ready pool’ model, whereby the Labor Mobility Unit manages the functions
            currently undertaken by agents, could help address these issues. However, this would
            require a significant increase in its staffing and capacity, which would take time.
            In the meantime, more robust agent licensing procedures need to be put in place.

       •	   Developing an effective marketing strategy—Solomon Islands has struggled to increase its
            participation in the SWP largely because of (a) the poor reputation imparted by the first
            group of participating workers; (b) the lack of an active diaspora to create linkages with
            employers; and (c) lack of competitiveness against the main Pacific Islands participating
            in the scheme. A marketing strategy targeted at segments of the agricultural industry
            could help address these constraints. This is a priority activity for the Labor Mobility
            Assistance Program that DFAT is supporting.

       •	   Establishing effective governance and coordination structures—ultimately, strategic
            and operational-level commitment and coordination across a number of government
            agencies will be required to underpin a significant expansion in Solomon Islands’ labor-
            sending capacity, including the delivery of a reliable program, maintaining recruitment
            and training standards, solving problems as they arise, and keeping the stakeholders—
            particularly employers—successfully engaged.

   REVENUE REFORMS
   Solomon Islands has been remarkably successful in raising domestic revenue in the years
   following the tension. Between 2003 and 2012, domestic revenue grew by an average annual
   rate of nearly 16 percent in real terms—increasing from 13.1 percent of GDP in 2003 to 33.6
   percent of GDP in 2012 (Figure 41). Since then, domestic revenue has grown more slowly in
   real terms, with the share of GDP levelling off at about 33 percent of GDP—which is relatively
   high given Solomon Islands’ GDP per capita (Edwards 2017). As Figure 42 shows, customs
   revenue, logging duties, and non-tax revenue (dominated by fishing license fees) have all
   grown significantly in real terms since the end of the tension, but it is inland revenue that has
   dominated the rising trajectory of domestic revenue until recently.

   The remarkable performance of inland revenue has been due to joint work by the Inland
   Revenue Department (IRD) and New Zealand, which has provided the IRD with key staff.
   Following the tension, New Zealand provided the Commissioner as well as a number of other
   senior staff in in-line roles, who led the development and reform of the IRD. Since the tension,
   the IRD has made substantial progress in improving the efficiency of tax administration,
   increasing filing rates, strengthening assessment capacity, and pursuing payments. Planned
   moves to share information with customs may enable the IRD to better assess the income tax
   declarations of logging companies, given information on their log exports. To date, less attention
   has been paid to debt collection, with New Zealand not having provided in-line staff in that
   area. The overall success of revenue reforms has likely been enabled by their general alignment
   with the interests of political elites (in public resources for distribution, particularly through
   CDFs), contrasting with reforms to control the use of these resources on the expenditure side
   (Hameiri 2015).

   Solomon Islands faces a number of major challenges on the domestic revenue front.
   The burden of taxation falls disproportionately on formal, reasonably large businesses (which
   pay relatively high rates of taxation) and formal sector wage earners. It is widely accepted
   that large segments of the urban business community (particularly retailers) avoid tax to a
   significant degree. However, far more importantly, Solomon Islands has effectively been
   experiencing a natural resources boom from logging for an extended period, and the state
   has secured an extremely small share of the rents from it. The steep decline in grants from
   development partners, which has been occurring since 2011, is putting increased pressure on
   domestic revenue raising. If the business community that is already tax compliant is targeted
   for additional revenue, that will significantly impede their operations, while non-compliance
   proceeds elsewhere. At the same time, New Zealand is winding down its support to the IRD.
   The Commissioner was localised in 2016, and the remaining in-line staff will complete their
   assignments in 2017, leaving only the kind of advisory positions provided in other Pacific
   Islands. This would appear to leave the IRD quite vulnerable, given the pressing fiscal challenges

       UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT, MIGRATION, CUSTOMARY LAND,
       AND THE TENSION
       Uneven development was a key underlying contributor to the tension and remains an important
       source of risk today. In the years preceding the tension, growth centered on Honiara, Gold Ridge, and
       the forerunner of GPPOL created a contrast with the lack of development elsewhere on Guadalcanal.
       The jobs of the primarily Malaitan workers who migrated to these growth centers also created a
       contrast with the lack of employment opportunities for Guale. The increasing settlement of migrants on
       customary land to the west of Honiara, around Gold Ridge, and around the forerunner of GPPOL, as well
       as on alienated land to the east of Honiara, added to the discord. The informal and formal sale of land
       by senior men, often without the knowledge or approval of their matrilineal landowning groups, was a
       significant source of intragroup and intergenerational conflict. The younger generation of landowners
       resented such sales, compounding the grievances that gave rise to the tension. The younger generation
       of men around Gold Ridge and the forerunner of GPPOL also felt that they and their female kin had been
       unfairly excluded from benefit-sharing arrangements previously negotiated by senior males. Ultimately
       these frustrations were visited upon Malaitan settlers on north Guadalcanal.

       Significantly, the Guale militants who mobilized at the outset of the tension were mainly from the
       remote and relatively impoverished southern Weather Coast. Around Honiara, evictions began to

       around the mine and palm oil plantation also a focus of evictions. The Malaitan militants who mobilized
       in response were predominantly from the more densely populated, poorer areas of Northern Malaita.
       After 2000, many of the Malaitans who took up arms were from Honiara, and the town boundaries
       became the frontline in the conflict.

                PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT AND PUBLIC HOUSING
                Constraints on the management of public land contribute to broader pressure on access to land
                for housing. Earlier work by the World Bank showed that private firms and individuals hold FTEs
                over most public land in Honiara. Lack of competitive bidding for the initial grants of these 75-year
                FTEs, statutory rent reviews that have been skipped, failure to maintain valuation rolls, failure to
                maintain proper records of current holdings, and weak revenue collection contribute to the poor
                returns the state receives on this land. The earlier work estimated the value of public land subject
                to FTEs in Honiara at US$2.1 billion in 2010, with the government collecting just US$2.8 million in
                rent from public land across the country in 2009.

                At the same time, the government requires significant land for its offices and facilities, as well
                as for housing for public servants. A legacy of the colonial era, when the government provided
                housing in Honiara for expatriate and local public servants recruited from across the country,
                public servants are entitled to housing (a government house or a rental subsidy/rebate for housing
                provided by private landlords). While the government collected US$2.8 million in rent in 2009, it
                was paying about US$100 million in rent to sublease back public land for its offices and facilities
                and about US$50 million in maintenance on government housing and rental rebates/subsidies to
                private landlords, who are tenants of public land held under FTEs.

                Weakly enforced development covenants on land held under FTEs and the absence of capital
                gains or effective property taxes create distortional incentives that prevent the market from
                reallocating FTEs to more efficient uses. The inefficient allocation of land in Honiara contributes to
                its scarcity. The system of public service housing—and its equivalent for professional and technical
                grades in the private sector—entrenches a significant gulf between those with jobs in the formal
                sector, whose remuneration includes housing, and those without formal sector jobs who have to
                secure and pay for housing themselves. Anecdotally, public servants routinely refuse job offers
                with higher salaries (more than offsetting the rent implicit in their existing remuneration) because
                of the difficulty of securing housing privately.

          At present, the process for accessing land titles is not widely known and incurs a fee (which, while relatively small, is prohibitive
       for many—especially when accessing multiple titles).

              INTERNATIONAL MARITIME CONNECTIVITY
              Honiara is Solomon Islands’ main seaport gateway, accounting for approximately 90 percent of all
              freight movements (excluding logging) and fish transshipment. Noro, the other international port,
              almost exclusively serves NFD’s fishing and processing operations. By regional standards, the port at
              Honiara is expensive and inefficient (see Table 10). Before 2015, container ship arrivals were steadily
              increasing as international shipping lines began to centralize transshipment for other Pacific ports in
              Honiara, perceiving it as inexpensive. This trend reversed from 2015, when there was a major revision
              to the structure of fees and charges in Honiara, including some significant increases. Low quayside
              efficiency and delays in vessel clearance were also cited as disincentives. The existence of only a
              single berth handling one vessel at a time, continued breakdowns of heavy freight handling stevedore
              equipment due to lack of preventive maintenance, lack of container terminal management systems,
              limited yard space for storage and handling, and industrial disputes all contributed to poor productivity.

              Though it did significantly increase port tariffs, Solomon Islands Ports Authority is implementing a
              series of reforms to improve the productivity of the port—with vessel turnaround times down from
              40 to 15 hours, reducing costs to users. These reforms include new equipment and operating systems
              to increase quayside efficiency and truck turnaround time for the delivery and receipt of containers and
              expanded hours of operation (with a planned extension to operating at night). A donor-financed second
              international berth has now been completed. For domestic services, the port road has been upgraded
              for safety and security and is to have 24-hour lighting. The second berth, perhaps in conjunction with
              land reclamation, should extend the life of the port in its present location by about 25 years—thereafter,
              it is expected to need relocation in whole or in part to service projected demand.

          INFRASTRUCTURE PPPs FOR INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT
          New economic opportunities in mining, tourism, agriculture, and fisheries are likely to be in areas
          of the country where basic infrastructure needs to be established or significantly upgraded to
          support industry needs. This applies to essential services like water, sanitation, waste, and energy and
          to connective infrastructure. Some form of public-private partnership (PPP) is likely to be required
          for these developments to occur. If the government leaves it to industries to develop utilities and
          infrastructure at their own cost, the chances of the industries developing will be much reduced, and
          where they are developed the broader economic benefits of the utilities and infrastructure are likely to
          be lower, because they may cater only to industry needs. Government and SOEs, however, are unlikely
          to have the resources needed themselves.

          PPP approaches have the potential to support the establishment and operation of utilities and
          infrastructure needed for specific industry and broader economic development, but they entail
          considerable risks. Done well, PPPs could support utilities and infrastructure that meet the specific
          requirements of the industries concerned as well as the broader needs of the surrounding region
          (for instance, a new power grid that uses a new fish processing plant as the baseload customer while
          it extends services to the surrounding population; road systems to link surrounding populations to
          mine and port developments, not just to link the mine to the port). Done well, PPPs also provide an
          appropriate distribution of costs and risks between the public and private partners. But PPP instruments
          are complex and the public and private partners negotiating them in this context are likely to have
          very uneven bargaining power and technical capabilities. Moreover, the underlying political economy
          context would suggest a significant risk of the public interest (including that of future tax payers) not
          being well represented by the state in negotiations. At present, there are no guiding policy principles,
          legislative or regulatory framework for the development and management of PPPs, and there is no
          unit in government tasked with developing and managing them. If the need to develop major PPPs is
          only occasional, it may not be cost-effective for the state to build and maintain the necessary capacity
          in-house.

          Development partners may be able to play an important role helping the state supplement its
          capacity to negotiate and manage PPPs in the public interest, particularly for large industry and
          infrastructure developments. The costs of getting PPPs wrong—especially of foregoing the broader
          growth and employment benefits that could be obtained from utility and infrastructure developments—
          are high. Good analytical work on core characteristics of good PPPs and common pitfalls of bad PPPs,
          particularly in contexts of thin public sector capacity and significant power asymmetries, would be a
          valuable basis for a dialogue with political elites on how much more they, the government, and the
          people could obtain from industry developments if PPPs are done well. This may also open avenues
          for development partners to supplement the capacity of the state on PPPs for large industry and
          infrastructure projects.

    ICT AND PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY
    Given the challenges of providing access to basic public services across Solomon Islands,
    ICT-enabled service delivery could potentially be very significant. While the coverage of the
    voice network now extends to most areas of Solomon Islands, access to data services is still very
    low—limitations most affecting rural areas. Affordable broadband Internet could provide a platform
    for the development and use of ICT applications in public service delivery. Apart from websites
    enabling government entities to convey policy information to citizens and for citizens to engage
    with government services and processes remotely, there is considerable potential for ICT-based
    applications to mitigate some of the particular challenges of state reach and service quality in
    Solomon Islands. For instance, applications providing curriculum content, teaching material, and even
    lesson plans might help support better quality basic education than would be possible by relying on
    progressive improvements in the qualification base of the teaching establishment alone. Applications
    guiding a standard package preventative health checks and referral processes might strengthen the
    quality of primary care in rural areas, where fully qualified nurses may not be available. ICT-based
    applications might also prove useful among measures to improve the accountability of CDFs, with
    some MPs already using social media to communicate with constituents about how they have spent
    CDFs, for instance.

       153.	 CDFs now represent a major means                                                          for each constituency, since the population varies so
       for the redistribution of public resources on a                                                 much across constituencies, there are large variations
       geographic basis. Following their establishment in                                              in CDFs per capita (as shown on a provincial basis in
       the early 1990s, there has been relentless growth                                               Figure 44). Though there is no systematic evidence
       in the public resources allocated to CDFs and in                                                of their use, CDFs fund anything from setting up
       their importance. That growth has only intensified                                              constituency businesses (for instance, in shipping),
       in recent years (Figure 51). By providing public                                                to providing households with solar panels or paying
       resources to national government MPs to spend                                                   their school fees, to distributing bags of rice at
       at their discretion, CDFs bypass the provincial                                                 election time. While they serve as a mechanism to
       government system. Their budget now exceeds that                                                redistribute public resources across the archipelago,
       for provincial grants by a factor of six. In 2016, CDFs                                         including directly providing some essential
       accounted for 8.8 percent of total expenditure (6.9                                             services to constituents (through water or energy
       percent from consolidated revenue and 1.9 percent                                               infrastructure), their operation is widely recognized
       financed by Taiwan, China). Though equal in value                                               as mainly patronage based (see Box 23).


         Beyond Honiara, provincial governments have few means to raise the direct revenues that provincial grants are meant to supplement (with
       102

       business license fees the main source, in some provinces chiefly from logging).

      THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF CDFs
      CDFs are a cornerstone of contemporary patronage politics in Solomon Islands. They are both a
      cause and a consequence of the weak functioning of broader state institutions. The way the political
      system operates encourages MPs to secure the maximum possible share of public resources for CDFs
      and to focus on how these resources are spent in their constituencies. This detracts from the share
      of public resources available for broader public institutions and from political efforts to ensure those
      institutions operate effectively. MPs then see CDFs as means to deliver immediate and tangible benefits
      to constituents, which broader public institutions are not regarded as doing effectively.

      Popular sentiment on CDFs is often contradictory, with the behavior of voters enabling and
      encouraging the very system they despise. There is an unremitting stream of complaints about CDFs
      in the media and civil society forums. A dominant theme in these is criticism over the use of CDFs for
      the exclusive benefit of supporters, rather than all constituents. The media reports cases of constituents
      being denied assistance after constituency officers have checked lists of supporters compiled during
      elections and found that the applicants are not on them. The media also reports complaints about
      businesses or construction equipment established through CDFs being treated as the private property
      of MPs after they have lost office.

      There is an increasing degree of institutionalization of CDFs and some moves to penalize their misuse.
      However superficial in their effect, MPs have to lodge a plan for the use of CDFs with the Ministry of
      Rural Development, which expenditures are supposed to accord with. Though these plans are said to
      be public documents, they do not appear to be publicly available. Each MP employs a Constituency
      Development Officer, Project Officer, and Accountant on the public payroll, to administer and account
      for their spending. There is active consideration within the state of how greater accountability could be
      brought to the use of CDFs, including how constituencies could retain ownership of assets funded by
      CDFs, separately from MPs. There are also instances of MPs who are alleged to have stolen from CDFs
      being prosecuted.

      CDFs are likely to continue to pose fundamental problems for equity and cohesion. Research by the
      World Bank shows that CDFs are among the major causes of disputes and grievances in communities.
      (The same research shows that donor projects can similarly fuel local disputes and grievances over
      resource allocation.) Thus, even though Solomon Islanders tend to judge their MPs on the delivery of
      private or localized public goods, the perceived injustices over the use of CDFs are driving people apart
      at the local level. They contribute to a pervasive sense of unfairness about the current practice of politics
      and intensify long-standing grievances over geographic inequities in public spending and the dividends
      of citizenship and nationhood. By connecting the local directly with the national, CDFs further entrench
      central government as the key locus of power and wealth, a trend sidelining provincial authorities and
      seemingly inconsistent with aspirations to decentralize service delivery to provinces. Contestation over
      the use of CDFs could, however, spur improved accountability—at the very least, it signals the extent
      of local engagement in discourse over the use of these resources. Commentators vary over whether
      CDFs could become effective systems that could eventually be folded into the mainstream state or are
      fundamentally inconsistent with strengthened state capacity.

VOLATILITY AND SHOCKS AT THE MICRO LEVEL
Solomon Islanders are highly vulnerable to volatility and shocks in their day-to-day lives, largely
as a result of geography and the structure of the economy, in combination with very limited means
to mitigate exposure. Rural households are vulnerable to commodity price volatility and shocks for
their cash crops and to oil price volatility and shocks (Table 11). Remoteness from Honiara magnifies
the impact of changes in oil prices, with the markup on fuel that feeds into the cost of transport
and all transported items up to 182 percent per liter in remote areas compared to Honiara. Rural
households are also vulnerable to climate variability, climate change, and natural disasters, through
their impact on subsistence and cash crop yields and the availability of agricultural land. The main way
in which rural households mitigate the impact of volatility and shocks on their livelihoods if through
ex post changes in their economic activities—for instance, changing the allocation of their effort
between copra, cocoa, food crops, and fisheries depending on relative prices, climatic conditions,
and pests that affect earnings. In this respect, expanding the set of options (such as through VCO as
an alternative to copra) adds to the ability of rural households to mitigate the effects of volatility
and shocks.

In urban areas, households are more vulnerable to food price volatility and shocks, while households
in natural resource enclaves are highly vulnerable to commodity prices. With less than half of
urban households having a vegetable garden, urban households are typically more dependent on
purchased food than rural households, with the price of imported rice particularly important. Like rural
households, they are vulnerable to oil price volatility and shocks, directly for fuel and indirectly through
international transport costs for all imported items. In areas dominated by natural resource extraction,
households are particularly vulnerable to commodity price shocks, primarily through employment.
This vulnerability was starkly illustrated in 2009, when demand for logs in China contracted sharply,
as well as in 2014, when the low gold price contributed to the corporate decision to close the Gold
Ridge mine. The flooding of the tailings dam after heavy rains was also a major factor contributing to
that closure and loss of mining jobs. While the addition of nickel mining to gold and bauxite mining
might yield a partial hedge effect at the macroeconomic level, the volatility of nickel prices will still
yield significantly volatility in livelihoods for those dependent on nickel mining.

In the absence of formal social protection systems, Solomon Islanders primarily turn to kinship
and other community groups, like churches, for assistance in the face of hardship. Aside from
reallocating effort between the few available economic opportunities, there are few options but
seeking assistance through these informal systems. Even without the development of formal social
protection systems, household and community resilience to volatility and shocks could be further
supported through many mechanisms, including more resilient agricultural varieties and practices
and more resilient community infrastructure.

Table 12: Key knowledge gaps

                  •	   While detailed poverty analysis is possible on the basis of the 2012/13 HIES, the significant
Poverty                changes in methodology from the 2005/6 HIES means that it is not possible to draw robust
Analytics              conclusions about poverty and inequality dynamics over time. This is a critically important
                       limitation to address.

                  •	   The SCD highlights the high prevalence of stunting in Solomon Islands, but the evidence base
                       on the extent to which access to improved water, access to improved sanitation, the quality
Health                 of diets, or other factors like low levels of empowerment for women contribute to stunting in
                       this country context needs to be built. This would then enable appropriate interventions to
                       tackle the key causes to be designed.

                  •	   While the World Bank’s READ-PNG project has yielded significant improvements in literacy
                       results from an array of coordinated interventions in the education sector, it is not yet clear
                       how sustainable these improvements will be over time. This is an important consideration in
                       how applicable a similar approach could be to Solomon Islands.
Education
                  •	   It may be important to gather evidence on whether the language of instruction is in fact a
                       binding constraint on educational attainment in Solomon Islands, as might be indicated by
                       the large difference between literacy and numeracy performance and the success of mother-
                       tongue teaching pilots. If so, the strategy to improve outcomes would need reformulating.

                  •	   The SCD highlights the high prevalence of stunting in Solomon Islands, but the evidence base

                       tackle the key causes to be designed.

                  •	   While coastal fisheries are broadly recognized as being fully exploited or overexploited, data
Fisheries
                       on fish stocks are scarce, a critical priority for supporting evidence-based CBRM.

                  •	   Despite a range of studies over previous decades, repeated projections of log exhaustion
                       have failed to materialize and log export volumes reached their highest level yet in 2016. An
                       updated assessment of remaining stocks and the likely trajectory of log volumes over the
                       medium term would facilitate a better understanding of the likely extent and timing of the
                       macro-fiscal adjustments facing the country.

Forestry
                  •	   Little is known about the commercial viability of plantation forestry in Solomon Islands. There
                       are two commercial plantations in operation, but both are on alienated land. It is important
                       to assess whether smaller-scale plantations on customary-held land could be economically
                       viable, not only in the context of providing future income-generating opportunities in rural
                       areas, but also in the context of mitigating the environmental impacts associated with current
                       logging practices.

                  •	   A prefeasibility study is needed for Western Province, to identify what investors regard as the
Tourism                key gaps to fill to make tourism an investible proposition there and what the market potential
                       could be.

                  •	   Aside from data on CDFs and some provincial grants (administration, health, and education
Fiscal Analysis        grants), public expenditure data disaggregated by geographical region are unavailable,
                       limiting the extent to which patterns of public resource distributions can be analyzed.

                  •	   The SCD highlights the high prevalence of stunting in Solomon Islands, but the evidence base
                       on the extent to which access to improved water, access to improved sanitation, the quality

                       tackle the key causes to be designed.


                  •	   The SCD highlights the scope for formal social protection systems as significant, given that
                       they are almost non-existent at present. However, little is known about the extent to which

Protection
                       evidence is needed to assess the importance of building formal social protection systems and
                       to inform the design of such systems.
