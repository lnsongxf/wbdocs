     FINALLY, STRONGER INSTITUTIONAL CAPABILITY OF THE PUBLIC
     SECTOR TO IMPLEMENT REFORMS WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO
     MAKING PROGRESS ON THE THREE PATHWAYS DESCRIBED
     Thailand will need to ensure that it has the institutions
     (and people) to help provide an environment in which
     more and better jobs are created. It will also need strong
     institutions that can deliver the new programs to improve
     Thailand’s infrastructure, provide more targeted support
     for the bottom 40 percent, and implement politics and
     programs for cleaner growth.



     THE THAI AUTHORITIES HAVE LAUNCHED SEVERAL PROMISING
     INITIATIVES TO REVIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE IMPACT OF THESE
     INITIATIVES WILL DEPEND ON SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION.
     Successful implementation, in turn, will not only take
     political will; it will also require improving the institutional
     capacity of the public sector to formulate and implement
     multiyear   infrastructure    programs.    A   few    examples
     include: the government may consider comprehensively
     revamping    and    modernizing     the   Public     Investment

supply of labor. The ASEAN Economic Community (starting on
Jan 1, 2016) is strengthening trade and other linkages. As the
second-largest economy in ASEAN (after Indonesia), Thailand
has a strong starting position in terms of an agile business
sector, a historically strong civil service, and a large cohort of
young people in their 20s and 30s with a tertiary education.
Importantly, analysis shows that Thailand has considerable
potential to increase productivity in the future: the differences
in labor productivity across sectors and subsectors in
manufacturing and services (see Klyuev, 2015 and Figure 2)
are higher than for many countries in the region, indicating
significant potential for increasing aggregate productivity.
Similarly, high differences in productivity levels across
manufacturing and across service subsectors (Klyuev, 2015;
Dheera-aumpon, 2014) indicate considerable scope for
increasing within-sector productivity through intra-sector
reallocation of capital and labor.



A NUMBER OF RECENT POLICY INITIATIVES GIVE RISE TO
SOME OPTIMISM.
These include a focus on 10 industries as “new engines of
growth” (so-called “S-curve industries”); the creation of an
Eastern Economic Corridor; and the launch of a major push for
the creation of an electronic payment system. Thailand also
introduced a child grant for poor families with newborns in
2015. There has also been a major push to bring more SMEs
into formal economy by providing them with incentives to move
towards a single financial account. Moreover, the Government
has transferred responsibility of supervision and regulation of
State Financial Institutions to Bank of Thailand. And, finally, a
number of large-scale infrastructure investments – many of
which have been on the drawing boards since the early 2000s
– have gotten underway.

CHILDREN’S DREAMS FOR THAILAND


As part of the government’s consultations for their 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan, it organized a drawing
competition for school children from across the country. The children were asked to draw under the title “Your Dream for Thailand”.
Some of the common themes in the drawings were the wish for Thailand to be united and peaceful though there are differences in
 nationality, culture and religion; to take better care of the environment; and for children to be educated for a brighter future. Below are
 two of the winning drawings and the comments from the artists who drew them.

                   BOX Benchmarking with Peer Countries
                    1:

                   This SCD benchmarks Thailand vis-à-vis countries in the same region (ASEAN countries), countries in the
                   same income classification (upper-middle-income), and a set of structurally similar countries (“structural
                   peers”).


                   Structural peers are countries anywhere in the world that meet three criteria that also define Thailand

                    •• Upper-middle-income countries.
                    •• Countries with a strong track record in macro-economic management (identified as scoring at or
                         above the 70th percentile during 2005-2015 in WEO’s Global Competitiveness Index third pillar
                         (macro environment)
                    •• Economies not driven by exports of natural resources (identified by excluding economies in the 20th
                         percentile of the indicator “natural resource as a share of GDP 2006-12”)


                   Using these criteria, the structural peers for Thailand are: Bulgaria (USD 4,319 per capita), China (USD
                   2,966 per capita), Colombia (USD 4,457 per capita), Malaysia (USD 6,499 per capita), and Mexico (USD
                   7,814 per capita).


                   In this SCD, references to “structural peers’ average” indicate the unweighted average for these countries
                   (excluding Thailand).




      THIS SCD IS ORGANIZED AS FOLLOWS.
      It begins with an overview of the country context, describing
      some distinctive country features that have affected
      Thailand’s development. It then takes a closer look at
      economic growth in Thailand, analyzing key trends and the
      likely prospects for future growth. Against this backdrop,
      recent progress in reducing poverty and promoting
      inclusion is examined, with a focus on understanding the
      factors that drive or constrain inclusive growth. The risks to
      Thailand’s growth and its inclusiveness and sustainability
      going forward are then discussed. Based on this analysis
      as well as inputs from extensive consultations with
      government and other stakeholders, some key priority
      areas for ensuring strong, inclusive, and sustainable
      growth in Thailand are proposed.

           BOX An example of migrants’ vulnerability: The fishery sector
            2:

           The fishery sector in the Greater Mekong sub-region has been identified as being particularly vulnerable
           to coercive and deceptive labor practices (Pearson et al., 2006). The industry, which makes Thailand
           the world's third-largest seafood exporter, has been found in need of further controls and restructuring
           to prevent illegal fishing, illegal migrant labor, and human trafficking. The shortage of Thai nationals
           willing to work on fishing vessels and the availability of labor from neighboring countries implies that the
           industry’s workforce is mostly composed by migrants (ILO, 2013a; ILO, 2013b).


           Why are seafarers so vulnerable? Fragmented recruitment and incorrect practices


           Recruitment of fishermen is handled by a variety of brokers (at origin or destination) who use different
           methods to attract potential workers. The process is often characterized by subcontracting, no written
           contracts, and lack of transparency in wages and conditions of work (Robertson, 2011). The payment
           system on boats makes fishers vulnerable to irregularity and ambiguity of pay (ILO, 2013a). Payments
           generally depend on profit sharing at the end of a fishing period (varying in length between short- and
           long-haul fishing), at times combined with a monthly basic wage (Chantavanich et al., 2016). The practice
           of wage withholding is done to prevent the workforce from reneging on the work agreement, but it could
           result in forced labor practices as it may keep the migrants on the vessel against their will (Chantavanich
           et al., 2016; Derks, 2010).

     THE COUNTRY’S ECONOMIC UPS AND DOWNS.
     With nearly 30 million visitors in 2015, Thailand is considered one of the world’s top tourist destinations and generates
     approximately 12 percent of GDP from tourist receipts (Figure 9). Thailand has an impressive ability to attract new groups of
     tourists (from Russia and now China) and different segments of the tourist market (from low-budget tourists to golfers to medical
     tourists). With tourist numbers doubling over the past decade, authorities are planning for even more rapid growth: the Electricity
     Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) presumes that by 2032, Thailand will receive more than 100 million tourists a year, 40
     percent of them visiting Phuket and neighboring areas such as Krabi.

Socioeconomic inequalities have exacerbated the situation, inspiring resentment and violent responses among some minority Malay Muslims living in the areas. Peace
dialogues have been initiated by successive governments since 2013 with leaders of insurgent groups, mainly the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN)—one of the rebel
groups active in the South—with facilitation support from the Government of Malaysia. Given the fractious nature of the insurgent leadership, high levels of distrust, and
persistent violence, it is too early to predict the outcome of these efforts. While the attempt at dialogue is encouraging, the insurgency remains active, levels of violence
are significant, and it is not clear how and when a definitive end to the conflict will be secured.

exceptional success in reducing poverty and sharing prosperity.
Since the mid-1990s, exports mainly of manufactures have
served as the leading drivers of Thailand’s economic growth.19
Exports grew at a blistering annual rate of 15 percent from
1986 to 1996, driving the demand for capital investments and
labor hours. The strong outward orientation influenced the
allocation of inputs and sustained unconstrained expansion
of outputs as long as they were competitive. The continued
growth of outputs and export of manufactures allowed the
gains of the more productive manufacturing sector to be
extended over a greater volume of factor inputs, including
labor from agriculture. Thanks to such growth, the poverty
rate fell from 67.7 percent (34 million people) in 1986 to 35
percent (20 million people) in 1996.20



DURING 1986-96, INVESTMENT INCREASED AT A RAPID CLIP OF
14.8 PERCENT PER YEAR ON AVERAGE.
Private investment averaged more than 30 percent of GDP,
reaching 32 percent in 1995. Rising foreign direct investment
(FDI) brought in foreign savings and, more importantly, the
technology and marketing skills necessary for maintaining
export competitiveness.

        The important role of capital accumulation in driving Thailand’s economic growth during the period before the Asian crisis is a well-established fact (see, for instance,
     Bosworth (2005) (Economic Growth in Thailand: the Macroeconomic Context; or Lathapipat and Chucherd 2013). However, researchers differ in their estimates of the
     role played by TFP before and after the crisis. To our knowledge, only one other paper on Thailand (Chuenchoksan and Nakornthab 2008) explicitly take improvements
     in the quality of labor into account, as is also done in the calculations in Table 2. When ignoring the improvements in labor quality, the contribution of TFP growth is
     overestimated.

            BOX How large are the productivity differences across
             3 : Thailand's sectors?

            Given the difficulties in estimating employment in agriculture as discussed earlier, it is equally difficult
            to calculate labor productivity: should value-added in agriculture be divided by the 11.5 million full-time
            equivalent workers or by a smaller number, assuming the 5.5 million unpaid family workers’ contribution
            to output to be very small? Depending on whether unpaid family workers are included in employment or
            not, labor productivity in industrial or service sector jobs has for decades been around 5-10 times larger
            than labor productivity in the agricultural sector (see figures below).

        The manufacturing sector accounted for around 30 percent of GDP from 2000 onward. It increased from 28 percent in 2001 to 31.1 percent in 2010, and then

     Among these top-10 fastest growth sectors, the largest industry was manufacturing of office, accounting and computing machinery (ISIC 3000) dominated by hard disk

     16.6 percent in 2011-13. The other major industries in these top-10 included machinery (ISIC 2921 and 2915), auto parts (bearing and gears, ISIC 2913), and testing
     equipment (ISIC 3312), with growth rates of 17, 15, and 14.5 percent, respectively.

STALLING OF STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION.
On the “push” side, booming agricultural prices—with real
 prices rising by nearly 70 percent between 2001 and 2011
(Figure 15—rapidly pushed up real wages for agricultural
 workers, despite little growth in agricultural productivity
(Lathapipat, 2015). Real agricultural wages rose by more
 than 70 percent between 2001 and 2013, which nearly
eliminated the hourly “wage premium” between agricultural
and off-farm jobs (Figure 16). With this wage premium

agriculture but rather to move within the sector, mainly from
crop production to production of fisheries, livestock, and

ANALYSIS UNDERTAKEN FOR THIS SCD SUGGESTS THAT THE
SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN IN THAILAND’S EXPORT GROWTH IN
RECENT YEARS IS DUE IN PART TO A LOSS OF MARKET SHARE IN
LABORINTENSIVE MANUFACTURING.
Many labor-intensive and resource-based manufactured
exports (20 percent of total exports) have become less
competitive, a trend that accelerated in 2010-14. In the
face of rising wage rates, export items like textiles, footwear,
leather products, and wood products have been losing export
markets. This is also reflected in manufacturing value added
where laborintensive and resource-based subsectors have
declined, contributing in part to stagnating manufacturing
employment in recent years.

   There is an ongoing debate over whether export competitiveness is best achieved through an evolutionary process of upgrading – selling lower quality goods to regional
markets and building capabilities before moving into more competitive, sophisticated global markets – or leapfrogging immediately to sophisticated goods and / or
rich country markets, and therefore benefitting from the prospect of greater spillovers of knowledge and technology (Hausmann et al., 2006). The concept of having a
“sophisticated product” refers normally to the technological content of the product (Lall, 2000). More recently, Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik (2006) developed a series
of tools premised on the argument that exporting more sophisticated products leads to faster growth.

MANY REASONS HAVE BEEN CITED FOR THE SLOW RECOVERY
OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THAILAND (JONGWANICH AND
KOHPAIBOON 2008; ZHOU 2013).
First, reflecting over-investment and overleveraged firms
during the boom years, it took nearly a decade after
the crisis simply to work off excess capacity: as Figure
18 shows, capacity utilization remained low for nearly a
decade following the crisis. Reflecting this, gross profits
took a long time to recover as well (as Figure 19 shows).
And, second, in more recent years, political turmoil and
social tensions created uncertainty and political paralysis.
The uncertainty put a damper on investors’ appetite; and
the paralysis kept public investments low and, more broadly,
prevented the public sector from helping to address the
bottlenecks – whether on the infrastructure side; in terms
of innovation; or in terms of worker skills – that would have
shored up investors’ confidence in Thailand’s economic

Major deficits in infrastructure were identified starting as far
 back as 2004, with a focus on reducing transport congestion
within greater Bangkok, connecting it to other parts of
Thailand, and expanding power supply. Two Government
efforts   to   launch   and    implement     mega-infrastructure
 investment programs were made in 2004 and in 2007, and
 both times, they were not implemented. The implementation
of the THB 3.38 trillion infrastructure development master
plan (2015-2022) (with 20 priority projects worth THB 1.796
trillion) approved in July 2014 is expected to be crucial for
“crowding in” private investments. However, of the 20 priority
projects, 10 projects have been in the pipeline since 2004
and have never been implemented, possibly due to a series

      environmental and social impact mitigation measures.
      Therefore, people do not accept proposed measures to
      mitigate impact.

  •	 Use of e-reverse auctions for all construction contracts
      in the procurement system, which is not appropriate.
      Agencies are not allowed to start procurement before
      budget has been secured, and by the time procurement
      is concluded, the fiscal year is closing. Now authorities
      have implemented integrity pacts for all projects, so
      complaints from bidders can result in long delays.



PART OF THE SLOWDOWN IN INFRASTRUCTURE IMPLEMENTATION
COULD ALSO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE
(SOE) SECTOR, WHICH HAS HAD LOW INVESTMENT AND INEFFICIENT                                   2016/17
PERFORMANCE.32
Investments by SOEs account for approximately 30-40
percent of total public investments (IMF, 2015), so the
slowdown in public investment is partly a problem of
SOEs no longer investing at the same rate they did in the
early 1990s. The underlying problem is that SOEs are not
performing as well as their domestic and/or international
peers—as Figure 23 shows, at least 10 SOEs (across
all sectors) are delivering poorer returns than domestic
or international peers. The performance problems are
also visible in the State Enterprise Policy Office (SEPO)
annual evaluation which shows that only 8 SOEs (out of
56) got SEPO’s top score in 2014, down from 14 in 2008.
Worryingly, a growing number of SOEs are no longer being
scored at all (11 in 2014 compared to 2 in 2008).

   As of today, Thailand has 56 commercial entities with majority government ownership that are categorized as SOEs. These include: (i) 46 non-financial SOEs concentrated
in key sectors of the economy such as electricity production and distribution, transportation, and water, some of which are among the largest listed companies in Thailand,
and (ii) 10 financial SOEs, including a state-owned bank, a government pawnshop, and eight specialized financial institutions (SFIs) that carry out high-profile policy functions,
with a growing share of the financial sector.

     AS MENTIONED EARLIER, GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE EROSION OF
     THAILAND’S COMPETITIVE EDGE.
     Looking at the different governance dimensions, Thailand has been able to maintain intermediate levels of effectiveness
     in executive and regulatory quality in spite of increasing political instability (Figure 25). At the same time, according to the
     perceptions of surveyed experts, Thailand has experienced a marked decline in voice and accountability, control of corruption,
     and rule of law relative to other countries.

Institutional quality influences the perceptions and behavior of economic agents in numerous ways. First, political instability is
likely to hinder the capacity to implement long-term investment projects as well as to sustain major reforms. Second, even if it is
not clear whether corruption hinders economic growth (Shleifer and Vishny, 1993; Khan, 1996), from the point of view of the firm,
it may affect the business environment and the ability to innovate in some cases (Sharma and Mitra, 2015; Paunov, 2016). Finally,
well-grounded empirical evidence shows that rule of law is among the main determinants of FDI (Cartensen and Taubal, 2004; Bevan
and Estrin, 2004).

     THE PAST THREE DECADES, BUT MAJOR
     CHALLENGES REMAIN IN REDUCING POVERTY
     AND INEQUALITY

     THAILAND HAS MADE IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS IN REDUCING
     POVERTY OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES.
     As will be discussed further below, growth remains the main
     driver for poverty reduction in Thailand, with GDP per capita
     increasing drastically from 1,084 in 1986 to 3,415 in 2013
     (constant 2005 US dollars). Extreme poverty as measured
     by the international extreme poverty line (USD 1.90 per day,
     2011 PPP) is no longer a concern for Thailand as a whole,
     falling from 14.3 percent in 1988 to 0.1 percent in 2012.
     Similarly, measured by the official food poverty lines from the
     NESDB, the poverty headcount dropped from 7.2 percent in
     1986 to 0.6 percent in 2013. Based on the national poverty
     line (in 2013, approximately USD 6.20 per day 2011 PPP),
     the poverty rate fell from 67 percent in 1986 to 10.5 percent
     in 2014, with 26.8 million Thai people moving out of poverty
     (Figure 27). Box 4 below provides an overview of how poverty
     is measured in Thailand.

POCKETS OF POVERTY REMAIN IN LAGGING REGIONS, SUCH AS
THE NORTHEAST, NORTH, AND DEEP SOUTH.
As of 2014, 4.7 million poor people (out of the total 7.1
million in Thailand) lived in the Northeast and North
regions, which have the highest share of poor relative to
the total population living in each region as well as the
highest number of poor. The share of Thailand’s poor living
in the Northeast and North increased from 61 percent
in 1986 to 71 percent in 2013, despite the fact that the
total population living in these two regions declined from
55 percent to 45 percent. Among the top 15 provinces
with the greatest number of poor, 9 of them have been on
the lists for both 1996 and 2013, of which 8 are in the
Northeast. For the three conflict-affected provinces in the
Deep South, poverty rates have remained stubbornly above
national averages (and remain at 33 percent in 2013).

                 BOX How is poverty measured for Thailand?
                  4:

                 The national poverty line in Thailand captures the expenditure needed to cover basic minimum
                 food and non-food needs. Poverty lines in Thailand are household-specific—they depend on the
                 demographic composition of households and the price vector that they face in local areas. National
                 poverty lines in Thailand have been revised every ten years to take into consideration improvements
                 in standards of living. The revisions capture updates in the concept of basic minimum needs—from
                 a heavily food- and carbohydrates-based poverty basket toward more non-food items and more
                 diversified foods. As a consequence of continuously raising the bar, the line and poverty rate have
                 almost doubled from THB 473 per capita and 32 percent to THB 881 per capita and 65 percent poor
                 in 1988, respectively, using the earliest and most recent lines. The current poverty line is based on
                 2011 consumption patterns and is estimated using the 2011 Socio-Economic Survey.


                 The national poverty line is the sum of the household-level food and non-food lines:

                  •• The food poverty line captures the amount of money needed to cover basic calorie and protein needs for
                       a household with a given age and gender composition. It is calculated by applying the cost of a calorie
                       and gram of protein in a given area to the household’s calorie and protein needs. The cost of a calorie
                       and a gram of protein is calculated from the Socio-Economic Survey using the expenditure patterns of
                       households in the bottom decile. The cost of a calorie is allowed to vary across 9 geographic areas:
                       Bangkok, and rural and urban areas in the Central, Northern, North-eastern, and Southern regions.
                       Minimum calorie and protein intakes for households are estimated using 2003 nutritional norms from
                       the Bureau of Nutrition at the Ministry of Health. These nutritional norms vary by age and sex. The cost
                       of meeting these nutritional needs is adjusted using an economy of scale coefficient—this assumes
                       that the cost of a calorie and gram of protein is lower in households with more members.

                  •• The non-food poverty line includes nine broad categories of non-food goods and services: housing,
                       including maintenance; housing expenditures including fuel, lighting, water, purchase of furniture and
                       appliances; domestic workers; clothing, laundry and dry cleaning; footwear; personal care and personal
                       services; health care; transportation and communication; education expenditure. Expenditures on
                       non-food items are examined for those households whose food expenditures fall within 10 percent of
                       the food poverty lines and whose total expenditures lie under median expenditure. Average non-food
                       expenditure per capita is calculated in each of the nine geographic areas for each of the non-food
                       categories. Economies of scale parameters are applied to each non-food category separately. There are
                       no economies of scale for private goods such as personal care and medical care, and economies of
                       scale are higher for goods that can be shared such as housing and domestic workers.

Pockets of poverty are concentrated in the lagging North, Northeast, and Deep South, as well as among the ethnic minorities (Figure
30). For instance, households headed by an elderly (above 65 years old) have a higher poverty rate (14 percent) compared to the
national average, and for these elderly-headed households, poverty rates are higher in the North/Northeast (20 percent) and Deep
South (30 percent). Among ethnic minorities (i.e. identified as those speaking a language other than Thai at home), the poverty rate
spikes to 31 percent for the entire country and is even higher in the North/Northeast (40 percent) and Deep South (33 percent).

the bottom 40 percent are most likely to be enrolled in
schools in which nearly half are functionally illiterate after 7
or 8 years of schooling. If a student is functionally illiterate
at age 15 (i.e. the end of lower secondary education), they
will never finish a secondary education or proceed to a
tertiary education. As World Bank (2015b) points out, there
are no easy fixes for these problems; broad and sustained
reforms on several fronts will be needed to raise learning

   PISA results are reported both as an overall score (a number between 0 and 700) but also as the percentage of students performing at different six “proficiency
levels”. For instance, the description of proficiency level 2 (which we refer to as the functionally literate level) is: “Some tasks at this level require the reader to locate one
or more pieces of information, which may need to be inferred and may need to meet several conditions. Others require recognizing the main idea in a text, understanding
relationships, or construing meaning within a limited part of the text when the information is not prominent and the reader must make low level inferences. Tasks at this
level may involve comparisons or contrasts based on a single feature in the text. Typical reflective tasks at this level require readers to make a comparison or several
connections between the text and outside knowledge, by drawing on personal experience and attitudes” (OECD, 2014).

THE POOR AND THE BOTTOM 40 PERCENT ARE MORE LIKELY TO
WORK IN AGRICULTURE.
In line with the overall declining trend in agricultural
sector employment, the ratio of the labor force (15-65
years of age) in the agricultural sector has declined
steadily from 70 percent in 1986 to 40 percent in 2013.
However, some 12-15 million workers still worked in
agriculture in 2013, of which approximately 8.8 million
were from the bottom 40 percent (or 2.8 million poor).41
It is worth noting that after a steadily declining trend, the
number of workers in agriculture increased during the
recent years in 2011-2013, particularly for the poor and
bottom 40 in urban areas. 42

   As discussed earlier, establishing an accurate count of employment in agriculture is difficult for a range of reasons
42
   As discussed earlier, the increase in employment in agriculture in the recent years might show that agriculture provided some sort of safety-net nature for the poor
and bottom 40; it might also indicate the latent underemployment problems.

Inclusive growth can be seen for most time periods since 1986, with the exception of the 1996-2000 crisis period (when incomes
fell for most income groups) and the 2000-2006 period when growth for the bottom 40 percent lagged that of the rest of the

     AS THE ECONOMY BECAME MORE SOPHISTICATED, CONSISTENT WITH THE IMPROVEMENT IN EDUCATION LEVEL OF THE GENERAL LABOR
     FORCE, THE NEW JOBS CREATED FOR WORKERS WITH HIGHER EDUCATION INCREASED.
     As mentioned above, initially a large share of the new jobs required little education. This meant that the poor and the bottom
     40 percent could apply. Starting from the 1996- 2000 period, however, the net number of jobs requiring primary education that
     were created actually declined. Instead, more and more of the jobs being created required either a secondary or postsecondary
     education. In 2000-2013, the trends of increasing demand for workers with secondary education or tertiary education continued.

     ALONGSIDE THE RAPID GROWTH IN JOBS AND THEIR

     The increase in the number of employed workers in
     Thailand was accompanied by significant improvements
     in the educational attainment of the labor force. As

THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF FARM INCOME IN THE CONTEXT OF LIMITED IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCTIVITY RAISES CONCERNS
ABOUT THE LACK OF STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION AS WELL AS SUSTAINABILITY.
In part, the rising importance of farm income reflects the structural problems facing the economy: a slowdown in non-agriculture
employment growth (Table 10) and the stalling of structural transformation (discussed in Section 3), combined with the struggle
within agriculture to move labor from low- to higher-productivity jobs. It is worrisome because it likely reflects the 70 percent real
increase in agricultural prices (Figure 15) and not productivity increases in agriculture. When agricultural prices fall back to more
normal levels—a process that has already started—the inclusiveness of growth will no longer look good.

     THE INCREASED ROLE OF PRIVATE TRANSFERS IN POVERTY REDUCTION

     IN THAILAND, PRIVATE TRANSFERS ARE COMPRISED MAINLY OF REMITTANCES FROM MIGRATION, WHICH CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT
     SOURCE OF INCOME.
     Over one-fifth of Thai households have migrants, with the highest proportions being from poor households and disadvantaged regions
     (Figure 45). Looking across income groups, a higher share of poor households and the bottom 40 percent have migrants (over 25 percent)
     compared to the top 60 percent (around 18 percent). In terms of geographic location, 26 percent of households in the Northeast and 15
     percent in the North have migrants, shares that are significantly higher than those for other regions. Notably, while migration flows have
     generally declined over time, the share of households in the bottom 40 percent with migrant workers has stayed constant—for example, in
     the Northeast, it has remained at 80 percent for households in the bottom decile and around 70 percent for the remaining three deciles.

        The acronym LGBTI refers to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex. Exclusion based on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) exists in
     different forms across cultures, countries and regions. Homosexuality is punishable by death and illegal in some countries, and although homosexuality is not illegal in
     many others, lesbian, gay, or bisexual people commonly face social exclusion. Transgender or intersex people may not be homosexual at all but are frequently classified
     as “gay” regardless. Social stigma driven by homophobia, transphobia and discriminatory laws fuels the exclusion of LGBTI people and creates barriers to accessing
     markets, essential services, and spaces. Such social stigma also often precludes participation by LGBTI persons in social institutions and decisionmaking, and exposes
     them to violence. Sources: World Bank. 2013. Inclusion Matters: The Foundation for Shared Prosperity (Advance Edition). Washington, DC: World Bank. License: Creative

           BOX The evolution of minimum wage policies
            5 : in Thailand

           The minimum wage policy in Thailand started in Bangkok and vicinities in 1973 followed by the entire
           kingdom in 1974, with minimum wage bands set by geographic region to take into account differences in
           the cost of living and other socioeconomic conditions (e.g., inflation reflected by the CPI, and since 1990,
           economic growth) (Del Carpio et al., 2014). In 1998, the Labor Protection Act (No. 2) further modified
           the wage adjustments criteria into a two-tiered system intended to differentiate minimum wage levels by
           province and industry. The province-specific minima were implemented since the early 2000s and the
           wage adjustment criteria was readjusted in 2008.


           Most recently in 2011, the government announced a change in the minimum wage regulations
           aimed at harmonizing wages into one national minimum wage rate in two major steps:

           (i) The daily minimum wage was set at THB 300 in seven core industrial provinces (Bangkok and vicinities
           plus Phuket province), while the wage in other provinces was raised by 40 percent. The policy started in the
           second quarter of 2012 and lasted for nine months.

           (ii) Starting in January 2013, the entire kingdom was subject to the THB 300 minimum wage rate.




THE EMPLOYMENT COMPOSITION IS SHIFTING TOWARD MORE EDUCATED WORKERS, WHICH POSES FURTHER CHALLENGES
TO YOUNG WORKERS.
Statistics for the bottom 40 percent suggest that total employment for young females and males decreased by 6.8
and 2.5 percent, respectively, in 2012- 2013. While some moved into education, others moved out of employment or
out of the labor force. For example, almost one in four females aged 15-25 were neither working nor studying in 2013.

While UHC reduces the direct costs associated with
seeking care, having a household member fall ill can still
be a major shock. The opportunity costs of caring for sick
family members can be high, and oftentimes it is women
who bear more of the burden. Similarly, the death of a family
member and the high funeral expenses can also be a major
shock for a household. Given the limited development of the
insurance system, millions of farmers are impoverished by
droughts every year, particularly those in the Northeast who

                 BOX Inclusion of LGBTI people in Thailand’s development: progress, challenges, and
                  6 : steps ahead

                 In recent years, Thailand has been advancing toward inclusion of LGBTI people. Legal and institutional
                 progress started with the decriminalization of homosexuality in 1956. The 2007 Constitution prohibits
                 discrimination based on sexual orientation, in addition to labour standards which specifically prohibit
                 discrimination based on sexual orientation. Sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) are specifically
                 protected statuses in the Gender Equality Act of 2015. Some legal protections also exist for transgender
                 individuals, like the ability to change their sex assigned at birth on official documents and the legality of
                 gender-confirming surgeries.


                 However, significant challenges remain to achieve full inclusion of LGBTI groups in practice. During
                 consultations with LGBTI civil society organizations for a World Bank research project, participants
                 mentioned that there is still significant stigma and exclusion of LGBTI people in society, school, and
                 in the family. In the 2010-2014 World Values Survey, only 2.4 percent of Thai respondents believed
                 homosexuality was “always justifiable,” only slightly above the average for the sample of countries
                 surveyed. This stigma has implications on an LGBTI person’s ability to access markets, services, and
                 spaces.


                 In the labor market, employment discrimination and workplace exclusion affect the type of employment
                 LGBTI people obtain as well as the compensation they receive—thus limiting overall labor productivity. The
                 ILO finds that jobs in the public sector are the least tolerant to LGBTI people, and as a result of repeated
                 rejections and a hostile work environment they often opt out of formal jobs in large organizations and
                 seek employment in non-government organizations or the informal sector—notably sex work. Participants
                 during World Bank consultations mentioned that their current job in civil society organizations is one
                 of the few professional opportunities that had been afforded to them throughout their adult life. Maya
                 mentioned that as a transgender woman it has been very hard for her to find jobs within her field of
                 expertise.


                 Stigma also limits their access to education and healthcare. In a study of 2,070 students, as high as 56
                 percent of LGBTI respondents reported being bullied within the past month due to their SOGI (UNESCO,
                 2014). This violence hampers the development of their human capital, and thus limits their future
                 employment prospects and even perpetrates a cycle of poverty. Finally, LGBTI people experience many
                 obstacles when accessing appropriate healthcare coverage as well as services. In fact, some insurance
                 companies refuse to sell insurance to LGBTI people or require them to pay higher premiums—under the
                 guise that their lifestyle is considered “high-risk” (Suriyasarn, 2014). For transgender individuals, the
                 services needed for gender-confirming surgeries are inadequate and often lead some of them to self-
                 medicate in harmful ways.

               Stigma also fuels the rampant violence committed against LGBTI people. In a survey of 868 LGBT Thai
               respondents, 27 percent experienced violence in their families due to their SOGI. Other research shows
               that, in Pattaya, as high as 89 percent of transgender women reported an experience of violence due
               to their gender identity and expression (Policy Research and Development Institute Foundation 2008).


              The ILO, UNDP, UNESCO, bilateral aid agencies, and recently the World Bank are pursuing data collection
               efforts on LGBTI people in an attempt to fill significant knowledge gaps which limit progress on the policy
               level. In fact, the bulk of data on LGBTI issues in Thailand is qualitative in nature and based on interviews
               and consultation with the communities, and biased toward those living in cities. The true extent of
               economic development outcomes—from housing to education to health care—are largely unknown,
               and the impact of discrimination and violence on socioeconomic status and essential assets is largely
               unexamined.


               In Thailand, the ILO “PRIDE” campaign is addressing this knowledge gap by measuring SOGI-based
               discrimination in the workplace. SIDA, USAID and UNDP launched “Being LGBTI in Asia”, a regional
               campaign to undertake numerous consultations and literature reviews (Phase 1) in support of the
               rights of LGBTI people. Currently, Phase 2 is working with community-based organizations and national
               human rights institutions to increase their capacity, as well as support sensitization of lawmakers and
               governments. UNESCO and UNDP committed to combat homophobic/transphobic bullying in schools—
               with a focus on teacher sensitivity, awareness-raising, peer support and counselling—to support the
             “Education and Respect for All: Preventing and Addressing Homophobic and Transphobic Bullying in
               Educational Institutions” program. Finally, USAID supports LGBTI organizations by funding programs to
               increase their visibility and empowerment.

   Gender refers to the social attributes and opportunities associated with being male and female. It encompasses the relationships between women and men and girls
and boys, as well as the relations between women and those between men (UNDP 2008). Ideals about the appropriate attitudes and behaviors for men and women are
learned, socially constructed norms that vary across local contexts and interact with socio-cultural factors, including class, race, poverty level, ethnic group, and age
(Connell 2008). At a local level, and a broad societal level, the situations in which men’s and women’s roles are formed vary and change over time (Kimmel, Connell
2000). Sources: UNDP    . 2008. Gender Equality Strategy 2008-2011. New York: United Nations Development Programme; Connell, R. 2000. Men and the Boys. Berkeley:

HOW SUSTAINABLE IS THAILAND’S “ECONOMIC MODEL”
AND WHAT ARE THE RISKS ON THE HORIZON?


BASED ON THE ANALYSIS PRESENTED ABOVE, A NUMBER OF
RISKS TO THAILAND’S ABILITY TO GENERATE INCLUSIVE,
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH FOR THE FUTURE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.
In par ticular, this section highlights four such risks:
(i) failure to restar t the “structural transformation”
engine    to   drive   productivity      grow th   and   fur ther
pover ty reduction, (ii) a rapid decline in the working-
age population, (iii) continued social and political
instability stemming from widening regional gaps and
the lack of a modern social safety net system, and (iv)
a worsening environmental situation.




RESTARTING THE “STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION”
ENGINE WILL BE KEY FOR PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH

LOOKING AHEAD, WITH AGRICULTURAL PRICES SET TO REMAIN
LOW, THEY WILL NOT BE THE MAIN ENGINE OF POVERTY
REDUCTION IN THAILAND.
As discussed earlier, the 70 percent real increase in
agricultural prices was the locomotive behind Thailand’s
rapid poverty reduction since 2002. Rising agricultural
income in recent years mainly reflected a real increase
in agricultural prices and not productivity increases in
agriculture. However, since 2011, prices have fallen by 22
percent. Moreover, most forecasters expect agricultural
prices to remain broadly flat between now and 2021 (Figure
49). As agricultural prices fall back to lower levels, growth
could become less inclusive, with negative impacts on the
rural poor.

     Areas more exposed to variability in cash-crop prices such
     as the Deep South have seen their poverty rates fall while
     agricultural commodity prices were booming (as shown
     in Figure 50 plotting the growth in rubber export prices
     and the poverty rate in the area). Analysis conducted
     for this report suggests that between 2011 and 2014,
     reduced prices increased the likelihood of being poor
     for households involved in agriculture. As prices are
     forecasted to remain at low levels in the near future, new
     incentives are needed to raise farm incomes and keep
     lifting individuals engaged in agriculture out of poverty.

     The tensions in Thai society - that culminated with the

     society. These divisions, in part, reflect growing regional
     disparities. The lagging regions are falling further behind.
     Empowered by more education, by broader horizons gained
     from labor migration, and supported by a strong and vocal
     network of civil society organizations, people from these
     lagging regions have become a far more potent force in
     Thailand than in the past. They can point to their regions

INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT SUCH UNMET

Strong evidence indicates that political instability generally
stems from perceived and actual inequalities. Using one of
the six dimensions in the Worldwide Governance Indicators
(WGI) project (Kaufmann et al., 2010), Ortiz and Cummins
(2011) find that unequal societies are much more prone
to being destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or
forceful means. Such conflict can in turn affect economic
performance in numerous ways. For example, increasing
political instability and unrest can have a negative impact on
investment levels,66 or it can hamper the ability of political
systems to respond to external shocks effectively.67 percent

help heal the political divisions that have undermined the
ability of the political system to address Thailand’s loss of

     HOWEVER, GROWTH HAS BEEN DEPLETING NATURAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.
     As Figure 53 indicates, fueled by more rapid exploitation of available energy resources, the rate of natural resource
     depletion started to rise rapidly since 2002 and now stands at 4.4 percent of GNI. While this is around the average for
     EAP and upper-middle-income countries, it is almost double Thailand’s natural resource depletion rate in 2002 and three
     times the rate in the 1980s. Four targets were set for the MDG goal of ensuring environmental sustainability. Thailand has
     achieved the goal of halving the proportion of people who lack access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation and is
     likely to achieve the goal of significantly improving the lives of slum dwellers. However, the chance of achieving the other
     two targets—of reducing biodiversity loss and integrating sustainable development into national policies—is rated only
     “potentially” (UNDP, 2014b).

     The air pollution problem is largely due to energy
     combustion from vehicles and factories. Despite a steady
     decline over the last decade, small particle and ground-
     level ozone concentrations in large cities remain the key
     concern. Particulate matter 10 and 2.5 per m3 levels in
     Bangkok still exceeded WHO air quality guidelines and
     national standards. In addition, volatile organic compounds
     continue to exceed the national standard around the Map
     Ta Put industrial estate. The smog problem in northern
     Thailand, due to burning of crop residues after harvest
     season, is another key cause of air pollution. Water quality
     in the national internal water bodies is improving and
     close to reaching the national target of 80 percent at or
     better than acceptable standards, but it is worse in central
     Thailand and around Bangkok due to discharges from
     households, contamination from agricultural production
     and livestock, commercial and industrial activities near the
     water resources, and direct discharges of wastewater into
     the rivers. Solid and hazardous waste generation may be

           BOX An Example of Thailand’s Vulnerability to Climate Risks: the 2011 Flood
            7:

            In 2011, the Chao Phraya river, fed in wide, low-lying plains and discharging into the former floodplains
            in Bangkok, experienced the most severe flooding ever recorded due to intense and particularly long
            rains (Komori, et al., 2012). The floods affected more than 13 million people, resulted in more than
           680 deaths, and brought estimated damage and losses worth THB 1.43 trillion (USD 46.5 billion) to the
            economy (World Bank, 2012b). About 19,000 homes were destroyed (World Bank, 2011) and 2.5 million
            people displaced (Haraguchi & Lall, 2015).


           Although Thailand’s agricultural GDP rose by 0.7 percent in 2011, production decreased by 10.1 percent
            in the non-agricultural sector, and manufacturing decreased by 21.8 percent (Okazumi & Nakasu, 2015).
           The 2011 floods hit supply chains in electronics and car manufacturing not only in Thailand but also in
           Japan and other countries that depend on Thai suppliers for parts. Before the floods, Thailand had a 43
            percent share in global hard disk drive production before the floods; in late 2011, its production dropped
            by more than 80 percent due to facility and supply chain disruptions, leading to a 30-percent global
            production decrease in the six months after the floods and causing a price spike between 50 percent
            and 100 percent (Haraguchi & Lall, 2015; Japanese Ministry of Economy, 2011). This experience led
            some Japanese companies to reconsider Thailand for investments or as a source for procuring parts
           (Haraguchi & Lall, 2015).

                   The flood exposed the vulnerability of the population and limitations in the government’s ability to help
                   affected people. Analysis of household survey data by Noy and Platel (2014) found that households
                   who reported being affected by the flood saw a negative impact on their income. The estimated average
                   decrease in income was about THB 7,600 per person for directly impacted households. Households
                   that were not directly impacted (but lived in affected districts) suffered an almost equivalent decrease
                   in income of about THB 6,700 per person. These impacts translate into changes in consumption, with
                   more expenditure in housing (to rebuild) and less in luxury goods. The poorest quartile of the population
                   sustained an average income loss of about THB 13,000 per person, of which about 70 percent was loss
                   in agricultural income. Data also suggest that Government post-disaster assistance, which averaged
                   THB 100 per person, was not only inadequate but also skewed toward the rich, with the richest quartile
                   receiving on average about THB 500 per person.

      WORLD BANK ASSESSMENTS AND AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE
      REVIEW WERE USED TO HELP PINPOINT A FEW CRITICAL AREAS
      TO BE ADDRESSED TO ENSURE STRONG, INCLUSIVE, AND
      SUSTAINABLE GROWTH IN THAILAND.
      While arguments can be made for a wide range of interventions
      across various sectors, not all measures will have an equal
      impact in helping Thailand generate economic growth and
      ensure the inclusivity of that growth. Looking across the
      numerous expert assessments of challenges and key areas
      for intervention, World Bank experts focused on identifying
      priorities which would, in their judgement would likely have a
      high impact on the poor and bottom 40 percent.



      AN EQUALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PRIORITIZATION
      PROCESS WAS THE EXTENSIVE CONSULTATIONS THAT WERE
      HELD WITH GOVERNMENT, LOCAL EXPERTS, AND A BROAD
      RANGE OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS.
      The prioritization was heavily informed by these consultations,
      which gave key stakeholders opportunities to influence the

The government’s 12th Plan (see below) lays out a broad
development     agenda,    with    seven     “targets”   covering
macroeconomics       through      “spatial   development     and
connectivity.” A total of ten plans will guide the country
toward achieving those seven targets, again covering a very
large and ambitious policy agenda. Rather than covering all
of these areas, the pathways proposed here focus on the key
areas where more attention is needed to address the most
critical challenges to poverty reduction and shared growth as
described above.

            Industry to promote ten industries as the new engine of growth for Thailand. The ten industries which
            will be promoted are five existing industries which will be encouraged to move up the value-added ladder
            (an initiative called “Extending the S-Curve”): (i) “Next – Generation Automotive”; (ii) “Smart Electronics”;
            (iii) “Affluent, Medical and Wellness Tourism”; (iv) “Agriculture and Biotechnology”; and (v) “Food for the

            was launched back in 1982). The Eastern Seaboard project boosted the GDP of the Eastern region from
            3.6 percent of national GDP in 1982 to 17.7 percent in 2014. However, the Eastern region is facing new
            challenges as many of its manufacturers have relocated to neighboring countries where costs are lower.

                  Hence, the government is focusing on boosting the region’s attractiveness through a number of mega
                  investments, including:


                   •• Laemchabang Seaport Project Phase 3 with an investment value of USD 1 billion.
                   •• U-Tapao International Airport Expansion Project to receive more than 10 million passengers per year
                        and become the most important aviation HR development center and aircraft maintenance hub in
                        ASEAN
                   •• Chuk Samet Seaport development project in Sattahip to become ferry terminal to Bangkok and Hua Hin
                   •• Dual track and High speed rail which will connect Rayong and Leamchabang with Bangkok with an
                        investment value of USD 6,500 million
                   •• Connect the highway network


                  The government also has plans to develop a future industrial estate around U-Tapao Airport and Chuck
                  Samet Seaport which will incentivize investors to invest in the new S-Curve industries. The project
                  expected to attract FDI of around USD 50 billion and generate more and better jobs in the coming two
                  decades.


                  National e-Payment. With the rapid growth in internet and mobile usage, the government is making a big
                  push to launch an electronic payment system to propel e-commerce industry and transform Thailand into
                  a cashless society. There are about 11 million online consumers in Thailand with an estimated of USD
                  58.4 billion in Thai e-commerce market value in 2015 but the market is rapidly growing.


                  The Cabinet approved a strategic plan for national e-payment infrastructure development on December
                  22nd, 2015, laying out a 2 phase plan for the next 3-5 years: First, launching an electronic money
                  transfer service at all major Thai banks called “PromptPay” for peer-to-peer transfers. PromptPay is
                  expected to be ready for service in the last quarter of 2016. The second phase will allow electronic
                  payments for goods and services, personal income tax returns, and subsidiaries and welfare services by
                  2017. With the national e-payment system in place, the number of online consumer is expect to double
                  in the next 3-5 years.

         There are three reasons for this. First, Japanese firms played a key role in making Thailand a manufacturing hub and has a dominant presence. Second, Japanese firms’
      overseas investment grew at 12% a year before the global financial crisis and this trend has accelerated recently due to yen appreciation & energy supply uncertainty after
      2011 earthquake Kang & Piao 2015). Third, their continued FDI expansion will be a good signal to other potential foreign investors that Thailand is a favorable place for
      FDI to export.

BEHIND, POSING A CONSTRAINT TO INCLUSION.
While functional illiteracy can be seen across the various
types of schools in Thailand, the greatest concentration of
functionally illiterate students is found in villages, where
47 percent of their 15-year-old students are functionally
illiterate. In 2003, these 15-year-old students were, on
average, 125 “points” behind their peers in large city
schools on the PISA assessment, corresponding to more
than three academic years of schooling. That gap widened
to 139 points by 2012 (see Figure 68). Village schools
face unique challenges in being “remote” and small—
despite lower student numbers resulting from falling birth
rates, the number of small schools rose from 10,899 (33
percent of OBEC schools) in 2003 to 14,669 (47 percent)

needed. The Agricultural Land Tenancy Act B.E. 2524, which
aims to protect tenant farmers’ rights and their investment
security, stipulates that the tenancy contract must be at
least six years. If a landowner wants to sell the land, he/
she must give his/her tenant the first chance to buy the
land. Another obstacle is that the legal process to evict a
tenant from land is very lengthy and costly, usually taking
a few years of court proceedings. Even if the owner wins
the case, the eviction process itself is also difficult and

for Climate Change for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions as well as its undertakings for adaptation planning. As part of its INDC declaration in October 2015,
Thailand made the commitment to reduce green house gas emissions by 20 percent from the projected business-as-usual level by 2030 sessions around key issues, like

      SEVERAL CONCRETE EFFORTS COULD ACCELERATE THE SHIFT
      TOWARD MORE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLEANER ENERGY.
      First, targeted efforts in the major energy-consuming
      sectors, i.e. manufacturing and transport, could contribute
      significantly to the government’s goal. In the transport sector,
      key measures will involve improving vehicle fuel efficiency
      and expanding infrastructure investment to promote greater
      use of rail transport. Other efforts will include more stringent
      regulations of large factories and buildings, strengthening
      the capacity of the industry to adopt low global warming
      and   energy      efficient      technologies,           improving   energy
      efficiency standards for buildings and appliances and their
      enforcement, and greater use of demand side management
      measures. Moreover, adopting new and innovative measures
      – such as energy efficiency resource standards among power
      producers, performance-based EE incentives – will also
      help induce new investment and adoption of new and more
      efficient technology. Second, avoiding energy price and
      demand distortion by maintaining the current pricing/

            The SCD has applied this framework by focusing on:


              •• Specific functions rather than forms, that fiscal institutions could undertake to implement the 8 year
                  infrastructure plan.
              •• Reflecting current realities in terms of power asymmetries, the SCD recommends deregulation for
                  improving competitiveness and promoting private enterprise to improve the role of law.
              •• Making suggestions on implementing ASEAN Economic Community agreements on skilled labor


            This approach means that governance reforms proposed by the SCD are calibrated to solve problems
            identified by stakeholders during countrywide consultations and promotes economic development for all
            by strengthening functions, reducing power asymmetries and enhancing the role of law.

In this regard some considerations for improving institutional
capability include:


 •• Defragmenting the institutional arrangements for water
    management. Currently there is no single agency that
    has the responsibility and accountability for managing
    water resources in a manner that prevents floods and
    droughts. Currently there are more than 10 agencies
    that are working on narrow water management issues
    without having an overall agency that can effectively
    manage water resources nationwide. This institutional
    fragmentation was a key reason why the Government’s

ANOTHER GAP IS THE LACK OF TIME SERIES OF

TIME SERIES ON PUBLIC EXPENDITURE BY FUNCTIONAL
USE ONLY STARTS IN 2005. 89
The former means that there is no research on the impact
of public spending on provincial-level outcomes (e.g., poverty,
job creation). The latter means that it is difficult to decipher
how government priorities have shifted over time (e.g., from
defense to social sectors).                                               89

      was added during the 1984-1997 period, while a fourth
      round was included in 1998. This has allowed researchers
      to measure the performance of the Thai economy at a
      quarterly frequency ever since. In addition to enabling
      investigation of short-run fluctuations, the comparability
      and long time series of the survey data mean that statistics
      on long-run labor market trends can also be analyzed.
      These characteristics render the LFS extremely valuable for
      researchers and policymakers alike. However, beginning in
      2014 there was a major update in the sampling frame based
      on the new series of Population Projection for Thailand,
      2010-2040. Unfortunately, no attempt has been made by
      the NSO to retrospectively revise the sampling weights
      for the survey data collected prior to 2014 to correspond
      with the new sampling frame. This effectively means that
      the long-run effects on the labor market of, say, the new
      minimum wage policy implemented during 2011-2012 or
      the recent fall in the global agricultural prices cannot be
      evaluated.90



      ANOTHER KNOWLEDGE GAP RELATES TO DETAILED RISK
      VULNERABILITY INFORMATION WHICH IS ARE NEEDED TO
      INTEGRATED CLIMATE RESILIENCE ACROSS SECTORS AND
      SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INDC AND THE NATIONAL
      ADAPTATION PLAN.
      Although the data and information needed for the climate
      risk assessment are mostly available through international
      and national sources, they are currently not systematically
      evaluated, nor forwarded/translated to the stakeholders
      and considered actionable to guide the prioritization of
      resilience measures across key sectors. Development of
      national and subnational climate services that include
      effective early warning system and long term monitoring
      of multi-hazard risks are needed to enhance the adaptive
      planning capacity of national agencies and local decision
      makers.

         The seriousness of the problem can be gauged by considering the number of employed workers in the third quarter in 2013 and 2014. Over this one year period,
      if one is to believe the currently available numbers, the total number of employed persons declined from 39.1 million to 38.4 million. The number of agricultural and
      fishery workers fell from 16.4 million (42 percent) to 13.5 million (35 percent) while the number of manufacturing workers increased from 5.4 million (14 percent) to
      6.3 million (16 percent).

      Based on Moore and Donaldson (2016) this box reports
      the experience of the Northeastern provinces of Surin and
      Si-Saket in their pathways out of poverty. Despite similar
      geographic, demographic and production traits as well as GPP
      growth rates, they experienced marked differences in poverty
      reduction over the first decade of the 2000s (see figure to the

      The authors find that the formation of a strong and active
      civil society has harmonized small-scale, low tech industries
      to multi-actors’ initiatives, thus generating shared prosperity
      within multiple channels. Three proximate factors are                            Note: Figure:“Growth and poverty reduction in Surin and Si-Saket”,
