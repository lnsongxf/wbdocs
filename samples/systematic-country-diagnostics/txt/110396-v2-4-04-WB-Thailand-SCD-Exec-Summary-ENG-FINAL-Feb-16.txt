supply of labor. The ASEAN Economic Community (starting on
Jan 1, 2016) is strengthening trade and other linkages. As the
second-largest economy in ASEAN (after Indonesia), Thailand
has a strong starting position in terms of an agile business
sector, a historically strong civil service, and a large cohort of
young people in their 20s and 30s with a tertiary education.
Importantly, analysis shows that Thailand has considerable
potential to increase productivity in the future: the differences
in labor productivity across sectors and subsectors in
manufacturing and services (see Klyuev, 2015 and Figure 2)
are higher than for many countries in the region, indicating
significant potential for increasing aggregate productivity.
Similarly, high differences in productivity levels across
manufacturing and across service subsectors (Klyuev, 2015;
Dheera-aumpon, 2014) indicate considerable scope for
increasing within-sector productivity through intra-sector
reallocation of capital and labor.



A NUMBER OF RECENT POLICY INITIATIVES GIVE RISE TO
SOME OPTIMISM.
These include a focus on 10 industries as “new engines of
growth” (so-called “S-curve industries”); the creation of an
Eastern Economic Corridor; and the launch of a major push for
the creation of an electronic payment system. Thailand also
introduced a child grant for poor families with newborns in
2015. There has also been a major push to bring more SMEs
into formal economy by providing them with incentives to move
towards a single financial account. Moreover, the Government
has transferred responsibility of supervision and regulation of
State Financial Institutions to Bank of Thailand. And, finally, a
number of large-scale infrastructure investments – many of
which have been on the drawing boards since the early 2000s
– have gotten underway.

CHILDREN’S DREAMS FOR THAILAND


As part of the government’s consultations for their 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan, it organized a drawing
competition for school children from across the country. The children were asked to draw under the title “Your Dream for Thailand”.
Some of the common themes in the drawings were the wish for Thailand to be united and peaceful though there are differences in
 nationality, culture and religion; to take better care of the environment; and for children to be educated for a brighter future. Below are
 two of the winning drawings and the comments from the artists who drew them.
