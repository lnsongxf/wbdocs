OVERVIEW

i. Madagascar is an island nation with unparalleled biodiversity and many natural assets, a
vast majority of whose 22 million people are poor. It is a country with a great potential, but is
prone to weather-related disasters and recurrent political crises. It is one of eight countries in the
world, for which data are available, which have lower per capita income in 2010 than in 1960. Its
economy is dualistic with large subsistence agriculture and informal sectors, where a vast majority
of the population work, and a small but relatively diversified formal sector. The end of the most
recent political crisis and drafting of the National Development Strategy by the new, duly-elected
government mark an opportunity for the country to turn the corner and embark on a path of
inclusive, sustainable and accelerated growth.

ii. The poor are disconnected from developments in the urban, formal economy and political
tensions – minimizing the benefits from growth but also somewhat sheltering them from
frequent turbulences. This document seeks to identify the most critical constraints and
opportunities facing Madagascar in accelerating progress toward the goal of ending extreme
poverty in a sustainable manner. The focus is primarily on poverty reduction as opposed to the
theme of “shared prosperity” of the bottom forty percent of the population, as the share of the
population who are extremely poor vastly exceeds 40 percent. The context of examining poverty
is that of general stagnation of the rural economy, substantial disconnectedness of the rural
economy from that of urban areas, and political instability that causes severe cyclicality in urban
and formal sector development. The welfare of the rural population is held back by the lack of
articulation with the urban sector, but this disarticulation also buffers the rural sector from
downturns in the formal and urban sectors.

iii. Increasing labor productivity in agriculture and informal sectors would contribute the
most to more inclusive growth through in situ welfare improvements as well as triggering a
structural transformation observed in other countries. Currently, Madagascar’s labor productivity
in the agriculture and informal sectors is low compared to other countries. Moreover, the rural
population is increasing, partly due to rapid population growth, compounded by migration from
urban areas due to formal/manufacturing sector job losses that resulted from the most recent
political crises. Higher labor productivity in the sectors where the poor work will not only
contribute to faster growth, but also attenuate the divide between the richest 10 percent of the
population and the rest, who are either poor or vulnerable to becoming poor.

iv. Political stability and improved management of the country’s natural capital would
contribute the most to more sustainable growth. Sustainability of development in Madagascar
is a challenge in two dimensions. First, its economy has never experienced stable and continued
growth, as all past growth spurts have been punctured by recurrent political crises. Subsequent
recoveries have not been sufficient to regain the lost ground. Second, Madagascar has been
depleting its natural resources to achieve economic growth. Depletion happens through formal


                                                                                                    1
                                                   


extractive industries, illegal trafficking of natural resources, excessive access to common resources
(e.g., forests and fisheries) as well as through the coping mechanisms of the poor (e.g., slash and
burn farming, cutting down timber for fuel, etc.). Over the long run, development will be
sustainable only if the drawing down of exhaustible natural capital is accompanied by accelerated
accumulation of physical and human capital and if renewable natural resources are sustainably
managed.

v. Higher investment will be necessary to accelerate growth, which will need higher
government revenues to finance public investment and an improved business environment
to attract private investment. Madagascar’s government has too few own resources to increase
investments substantially, and external aid, on which it has relied traditionally, fluctuates with
external events and political crises. Increasing the government’s revenues as well as enhancing
the government’s capacity to manage investments will be key for accelerating growth. The private
sector has made the bulk of investments in the past, and they too are affected negatively by political
instability through general uncertainties as well as its impacts on the economy. Madagascar’s
business environment also acts as a drag on investments.

vi. The challenges to inclusiveness, sustainability and accelerated growth are inter-related to
an unusual extent in Madagascar. This document is hence organized not around the three types
of challenges, but around five themes of governance, public finance issues, private sector-led
economy, poverty and environment, and human capital – all crucial to achieving faster, more
inclusive and sustainable growth (see Figure A for the organizing framework). Chapter 1 provides
the country context. Chapter 2 discusses the quality of governance, an overarching issue in
Madagascar. It has a direct bearing on the pace, the inclusiveness and sustainability of growth.
While acknowledging the importance of improving governance for Madagascar, which is a
difficult, medium term undertaking, this Systematic Country Diagnostic argues that progress is
also possible. Chapter 3 discusses how amelioration in managing public finances, and increasing
revenue in particular, could be used as a lens for improved governance. Chapter 4 discusses the
role and challenges of the private sector, the main driver of growth. Chapter 5 discusses the
challenges for achieving higher human capital in a country with a very young population and some
of the highest infant stunting and malnourishment rates in the world. Chapter 6 discusses the faces
of poverty, which are predominantly rural, agricultural and informal. A structural transformation
has not started in Madagascar and poverty and environment are closely intertwined. The chapter
also discusses the challenges to enhancing the management of natural resources and protecting the
poor from natural disasters and impacts of climate change. Chapter 7 summarizes the challenges
and prioritizes the reforms.

A NATION OF MANY OPPORTUNITIES

1.   Madagascar is an island nation with unparalleled biodiversity1 and much natural
wealth, which are its greatest assets for development. Between 1995 and 2011, Madagascar’s
natural capital accounted for about one quarter to one third of its total wealth2 (see Figure 1). This
share is similar to that of Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, where natural capital represented about
30 percent of total wealth. Human and social (referred in the figure as ‘intangible’) capital is also
important (48 percent), but below the average for Sub-Saharan African countries (56 percent)
because the majority of the workforce is not qualified. Meanwhile, physical assets (i.e.
infrastructure, etc.) are sparse and poorly maintained (e.g., the country has one of the lowest
densities of roads per capita in the world).

2.   Agricultural land (cropland) accounts for 40 percent of natural capital, followed by
forest products (timber and non-timber), protected areas (32 percent), and pasture land (26
percent). Energy and minerals, still in exploration phase, account for 2 percent of total wealth.
The number is bound to increase as new reserves are discovered and data availability improves.
These figures do not take into account the values of the country’s biodiversity in its contribution
in advancing scientific research.

3.  Macroeconomic stability in recent years despite political turbulence has also been an
asset to the country. Inflation hovered around 6-7 percent, the fiscal deficit has been less than 2
percent of GDP and the current account deficit declined during the crisis, reaching -0.3 percent of

GDP in 2014. Credit, particularly to the micro and small and medium enterprise (SME) sector, is
scarce and expensive, standing only at 12 percent of GDP at end-2014, well below the Sub-Saharan
Africa average. Madagascar has a relatively low public debt to GDP ratio (37.3 percent in 2014),
with external debt representing two thirds of the total. There are two main risks to macroeconomic
stability. First is the low tax revenue, representing only 9.7 percent of GDP in 2014, and well
below the low income countries average of 15.6 percent of GDP (2005-2012 average). This level
of revenue does not support public investments necessary for development nor adequate provision
of public services. The second is low international reserves, stemming from the dwindling external
aid inflows due to the political crisis, and the government’s policy of subsidizing imported fuel,
which was instituted during the crisis. The Ariary, the local currency, has been depreciating.

4.    During periods of political stability, Madagascar has experienced stronger growth. In
addition to its abundant natural resources, its work force is inexpensive and relatively literate, and
its formal private sector is small but diversified. Madagascar has taken advantage of these assets
during periods of political stability. Average growth between 2003 and 2008 reached 7.4 percent,
led by large mining investments and the vibrant export processing zone. This period also coincided
with introduction of important reforms in a number of areas including investment climate. The
country’s track record during political stability suggests that Madagascar is capable of growth
when its assets are deployed effectively.

5.    Madagascar’s comparative advantage lies in sectors which use its unique biodiversity,
rich natural resources and abundant (unskilled) labor intensively. A non-exhaustive list of
promising sectors include tourism, agribusiness, industrial fisheries, extractive industries and
garments (see Chapter 4 for detailed discussions). The tourism sector is sensitive to political
instability, but tends to bounce back quickly. It recorded close to 200,000 visitors in 2013, who
are attracted to the country’s unique fauna and flora. Both the average length of stay and return
rates among leisure tourists are exceptional, at 21 days and 40 percent according to the latest
statistics available.3 The fisheries sector, if the challenges of managing common resources can be
overcome, is promising as the industrial branch offers significant growth prospects and the
artisanal branch provides livelihoods for some of the country’s poor. The extractive industries, be
it industrial mining, artisanal mining or timber, require adequate oversight and rule-based
operations to ensure that rents are shared equitably. Industrial mining is nascent and offers
significant growth prospects, but also presents risks of unequitable sharing of dividends,
environmental concerns, and possibly Dutch disease, if not managed properly. The country’s
recent reinstitution of membership to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative is a good
start. The country’s export processing zone hosts successful entrepreneurs, particularly in the
garment business. The garment sector took a hit when the US market became unavailable due to
the suspension of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) benefits in 2009, but proved
fairly resilient by finding alternative markets. It is poised for a rebound with the reinstitution of
the AGOA benefits.

6.   There is also a large potential to be exploited in the country’s large informal sector, such
as agriculture, artisanal fisheries and artisanal mining. These subsectors are far from marginal,
and provide livelihoods to a large share of the population. Reorienting these subsectors on a
sustainable path, and developing value-chains is a promising avenue for improved income
generation.

MADAGASCAR HAS MADE LITTLE HEADWAY IN REDUCING POVERTY

7.   Despite Madagascar’s promising potential, a vast majority of the Malagasy are poor,
and most of them extremely so. Extreme poverty (per capita consumption under $1.25 2005
purchasing power parity – PPP – per day) has hovered around four fifths of the population between
2001 and 2012. Over the same timeframe, absolute poverty ($2 PPP per capital per day) rose from
an estimated 88.9 in 2001 to 92.7 percent of the population in 2005, then declined slightly, but
stayed above 90 percent until 2012 (See Table 1). Strong overall growth between 2003 and 2008
coincides with strong consumption growth, particularly for the poorer segments of the population
(Figure 2), although it does not seem to have affected poverty head count rates much, possibly
because of the depth of poverty of the poorer segments of the population.

8.  Madagascar is not expected to meet any of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Progress had been made in the 2000s towards meeting a few of the MDGs, but the sharp economic
contraction in 2009 and the subsequent sluggishness of the recovery have reversed this trend.
Deteriorating health and education outcomes since 2009 have dropped Madagascar’s rank on the
2014 UN’s Human Development Index to 155th in the world.

9.   Yet, the poor have experienced consumption growth over the past decade and a half,
with most benefits accruing in the first half of the past decade. Based on an analysis of the
incidence of growth, inequality has declined from 2001 to 2012, primarily because it declined
dramatically in the first half of 2000s when consumption growth accrued disproportionately to the

poor (Figure 2). This trend reversed in the second half of the decade.4 Between 2010 and 2012, as
with 2005-2010, growth was primarily regressive, although consumption among the richer
segments of the population also fell after the crisis as firms in the formal sector closed, employment
in manufacturing fell and entrepreneurs felt the effect of the crisis. Nonetheless, over the period
2001-2012 taken as a whole, consumption gains have been progressive, as the large consumption
growth among the poorest between 2001 and 2005 is dominant.

10. Changes in producer and consumer prices favoring farmers explain much of the pro-
poor nature of growth until 2005. The progressive pattern of consumption growth between 2001
and 2005 is explained by a variety of factors, including the loss of employment in urban areas due
to changes in the international trading environment (discussed in detail below), and the effect of
increased consumer prices (induced by a spike in the international price of fuel) in 2005. A general

  The growth in consumption of the poor was nonetheless low and insufficient to move them out of poverty, thus the
stable or rising poverty headcount ratios. On average, the net change in consumption was negative, even though
there was a period of rebound beginning in 2002. It was not until 2006 that per capita income caught up with 2001
(pre-crisis) levels.




                                                                                                                                                                                       7
                                                                             


rise in consumer prices was reported as a shock by 36 percent of households, and the fall in real
consumption in 2005 affected disproportionately those in urban areas working outside of
agriculture. At the same time, as agricultural prices for the products that are produced by the poor
increased, so did their income.5

11. Inequality in Madagascar is similar to that of other low-income countries. The Gini
coefficient was 0.41 in 2012, similar to the low income average at 0.40 (Source: World
Development Indicators WDI). The poverty gap, hovering around 40-45 range, is also similar to
the low income average, and its evolution mirrors the consumption growth pattern per period.
Madagascar’s inequality, however, is not due to a steep welfare increase at the top: as shown in
Figure 3, the average consumption ratio for the top decile to the bottom decile in Madagascar is
consistently lower than the low income country average over 2007-2011 of 13.4 (Source: WDI).
This suggests relatively higher inequality among the bottom 90 percent than in other poor countries
– that is, different levels of deprivation.

12. Poverty is significantly higher in rural areas and in the southeast of Madagascar. Close
to 80 percent of Madagascar’s population lives in rural areas, and rural poverty rates are nearly
twice as high as in urban areas. Extreme poverty is more pronounced in the southeast of the
country, whereas the capital region had a notably lower incidence of extreme poverty (Figure 4,
right map, darker indicates higher incidence of poverty, using the national threshold). Moreover,
on the whole, regions have tended to retain their poverty incidence rankings over time.6

  The mean annual producer price of rice paddy, the country’s main crop, declined (in nominal terms) from 788
Ariary per kilogram in 2005 to 723 Ariary in 2010.
6
  Poverty rates tend to show mean reversion: There is no intra-regional correlation between headcount poverty rates
and subsequent changes in this rate, whether between 2005 and 2010 or between 2010 and 2012. Moreover,
changes in poverty rates are negatively and statistically significantly correlated. It is therefore suggested that further
detailed measures of short term changes within and across regions is unlikely to be useful for diagnosing the
primarily impediments to accelerating broad based increases in income.


                                                                                                                         8
                                                                


Improvements may be short-lived, and with a high level of random weather-related shocks one
would not expect short run movements in consumption to necessarily indicate long term trends.

13. Inequality is higher in regions with lower poverty rates. This higher inequality is not due
to higher inequality within cities in these regions, but rather due to the higher percentage of people
who have escaped poverty in these regions (Figure 4, left map, darker indicates higher inequality).
Whereas inter-regional inequality has increased from 2005 to 2010 and 2012, it accounts for only
about 13-21 percent of total inequality, depending on the inequality measure used (See Table 2).
Similarly, only a small proportion of inequality can be explained by differences across rural and
urban areas – only 13-19 percent in 2012, depending upon the inequality measure used. Moreover,
inequality within rural zones of the country is greater than inequality within urban areas. Spatial
factors are undoubtedly very important as constraints to reducing poverty in the country; however,
the relative degrees of deprivation that the population faces – in particular, lack of access to
infrastructure, markets, and social services – need to be analyzed at a more disaggregated level
primarily with the aim of assessing their impacts on incomes and poverty.7

 Inequality per se in Madagascar is mainly an issue insofar as it reflects extreme forms of poverty, and reducing
poverty may at least initially lead to increased inequality of outcomes.

14. A large majority of households in the poorer segments of the population are employed
in the agricultural sector. As shown in Figure 5, agriculture is the main sector of employment
of the household head for the bottom 80 percent of the country, with only the fourth and fifth
consumption quintiles engaged in large numbers in services, manufacturing, and public
administration. A similar pattern can be observed when analyzing employment of spouses.
Secondary sectors of employment are important additional sources of income, particularly in
services, which employ significant shares of the top quintile.

15. Cropping patterns are very similar across the income distribution with the exception of
paddy – primarily grown by the richer quintiles and cassava – primarily grown by poorer
quintiles. Cropping patterns in Madagascar are somewhat similar across the distribution. As
shown in Table 3, the richer quintiles are more concentrated in the production of rice paddy and
less concentrated in cassava and other crops in both 2005 and 2010, but production patterns do not
shift dramatically across quintiles. In 2010, the proportion of rice in total production fell across
quintiles relative to 2005, with an increase in fruits, and for upper quintiles in vegetables, cash
crops, and industrial cultures.

16. Most farmers across the income distribution consume the majority of their production
with a relatively small share of production being marketed. The level of engagement in crop
marketing changes continuously over the income distribution, with no abrupt distinction in this
regard between the bottom 40th and the 40-80th consumption percentile (Table 4). With the
exception of cash crops, vegetables and fruits, on average, households in all quintiles consume a
majority of their production themselves. They are responding to what appear to be high
transactions costs of buying and selling food in Madagascar, as well as relative price changes in
deciding which crops to consume themselves and which to sell.

employment, low education levels and less access to productive assets. The circumstances and
characteristics that are associated with more severe poverty are similar to those in other Sub-
Saharan African countries: a greater concentration of household income and employment in

agriculture, possession of less land, lower educational attainment (see Figure 6), and lesser access
to markets and public services. While the bottom 40 percent tend to have less of these productive
assets and opportunities, the main story is one of continuity of deprivation. Recent analysis by
Stifel et al. (2010) argues that persistently poor households have less land, live in more remote
areas, and are headed by uneducated individuals. Moreover, apparent disparities associated with
ethnicity were largely due to intergroup differences in asset holdings. About a third of the
population in Madagascar is deprived on multiple dimensions, including consumption, access to
education, usage of electricity, and possession of basic household assets (World Bank, 2014). As
has been seen in other countries, these population groups can also suffer from depleted cognitive
functioning, some symptoms of which are limited decision making capability and a reduced
capacity to focus on future prospects in the face of overwhelming present need. When individuals
suffer from such cognitive constraints, this compounds the challenge that they face in trying to
better their own circumstances and those of their families, thus perpetuating the cycle of extreme
poverty8. Although more extreme poverty is a more serious welfare issue, the qualitative
conditions, and possibly the primary causes, of poverty are similar across the consumption
distribution, but are present to different degrees within the population.

18. Female-headed households and families with more children are associated with higher
poverty levels. In addition, the marital status of female household heads is associated with
differences in consumption.9 The incidence of extreme poverty is higher among female-headed
households, which make up a fifth of all households. These households are particularly vulnerable
as they tend to own less productive assets: on average, they have one year less schooling, they
cultivate just over half the acres of land that male heads cultivate, and have 3 to 4 times fewer large
livestock and almost 2 times fewer small livestock. Moreover, whereas men who separate from

their spouses tend to remarry (whether customarily or legally), a much higher share of females
remains separated or widowed. Female headed households with all types of marital status except
“married” (but including customarily married, in a free union, separated, or divorced) tend to have
lower consumption per capita even when controlling for education, land, and other assets (World
Bank 2014 Face of poverty). Households with more children show up as disproportionately poor
with young children coming out as the poorest segment of Madagascar’s population (see Figure
7).10

19. Households in Madagascar are subject to an unusual degree of weather-related and
other risks which can push households deeper into poverty in any given year (Table 5). When
assets are lost, households may have difficulty recovering economically, and may be forced to
sacrifice long run investments in education and health. Effective social protection of the most
vulnerable and poor population in Madagascar is largely absent: social protection expenditures as
a share of GDP declined from 1.9 percent in 2008 to 1.1 percent in 2010, and this largely excludes
the poor as it funds primarily expenses for public sector pensions. It is unclear to what extent
informal risk mitigation instruments are used in Madagascar, but even if present, these are unlikely
to adequately address spatially correlated risks such as cyclones or drought.

  This result is based on per capita consumption and so tends to be true by construction. Adult equivalency scales
should be applied to assess how robust this is to household economies of scale.

EXCEPTIONAL NATURAL CAPITAL NOT TRANSFORMED INTO OTHER FORMS
OF CAPITAL FOR PRODUCTIVE USE

20. The balance between natural resources and livelihoods is extremely fragile. Local, often
isolated, rural populations depend upon the country’s natural resources to ensure basic livelihood.
Generally, the further away from urban centers, the more precarious living conditions are.
Livelihoods heavily depend on subsistence agriculture, fragile pasture lands, timber and fuel wood,
small scale fisheries, each rarely in connection to markets and often in direct or indirect
relationship with forests and other natural resources. Population growth has increased demand for
agricultural land both for subsistence production and for cash crops and has consequently increased
the pressure on forests. Poor soil management in areas outside of forests reinforces expansive land
clearing and incursions into forest areas where the soil is more fertile.

21. Madagascar’s total wealth has been declining over time, and natural capital more
sharply. Madagascar had US$7,955 in per capita wealth in 1995, but by 2011 the value had
dropped to US$7,176 (a 10 percent decline in real terms) (Figure 1). The drop in the real value of
natural capital has been even more important: 26 percent, from US$2,796 per capita in 1995 to
US$2,078 in 2011 (see Figure 8). This drop has been associated by and large with a drop in
cropland (minus 33 percent), pasture land (minus 31 percent) and non-timber forest value (minus
42 percent). While the drop in natural capital values has been halted and reversed during the period
2003-2010, the trend reversed again more recently.

22. Madagascar is not using rents from its natural resources to invest in accumulating other
productive assets. Recent research argues that successful natural resource rich countries (both
developed and developing) have invested the rents from their natural capital into other forms of
capital, human, physical and institutional. Transforming nonrenewable natural capital into
productive assets contributes to the sustainability of growth, along with using renewable assets
sustainably. Madagascar has not been on the sustainable path, judged from the negative adjusted
net savings11 since the 1980s: the country is depleting its natural capital at a faster pace than it is
investing in other forms of capital, as discussed in chapters 3 (with respect to public investment)
and 6 (with respect to human capital). Mineral depletion is likely to accelerate in the future with
large mining operations.

23. The country’s fame for its biodiversity, a renewable asset, is under threat, which is
putting at risk the industries that are potential drivers of growth. For example, tourism, which
relies heavily on the country’s biodiversity, is estimated to have brought some US$0.6 billion of
revenue and employed 230,000 people12 (2 percent of the total job market) in 2013. The viability
of the tourism industry, however, is being threatened by the high rate of degradation, including
high rates of deforestation,13 poaching of precious timbers and other endemic species, and the

degradation of coastal environments. The cost of environmental degradation is estimated14 to
amount to US$450 - 500 million per year (approximately 4.7 percent of the GDP in 2013).

24. The pillage of precious woods is symbolic of how poor governance can erode the
country’s asset base with virtually no development return to the country as a whole and to
the local communities in affected areas. Over the last 20 years, illegal logging of precious wood,
which includes rosewood and ebony species, has emerged as a recurrent issue in Madagascar,
severely threatening Madagascar’s ecosystems and unique biodiversity- an irreplaceable public
good. Though not as immediately devastating as large-scale clear-cutting, the selective logging
linked to precious woods, now taking place mostly in Madagascar's protected areas, creates
secondary effects that can be just as harmful, if not more so, to both the local environment (e.g.
introduction of invasive species, increased susceptibility to fire, impaired habitat), global
biodiversity (through species and possibly ecosystem loss), and local communities (cheap and
dangerous labor exploitation, violation of traditional codes and local taboos, increase of
prostitution and drug trafficking). In addition to destroying a world heritage site and plundering
natural resources, in particular endemic rare species, illegal logging is consolidating a trafficking
culture that spans from the local administrations, law enforcement agencies, and to the judicial,
parliamentary and political systems. It also deprives the government of millions of dollars of tax
revenues a sustainable timber industry could generate, and robs Malagasy people of development
opportunities. Finally, by destroying an important component of wealth, the country is destroying
an important poverty reduction lever, and banking on the livelihoods of future generations. Of the
estimated US$220 million of sale revenues in 2009, the largest portion was captured by a handful
of exporters. Local communities benefited only marginally through remuneration for logging
(US$5/log) and transport.

THE MALAGASY ECONOMY HAS STRUGGLED TO ACHIEVE ITS POTENTIAL

25. Insufficient investments in productive assets partly explain the underperformance of
Madagascar’s economy, which failed to keep pace with population growth. Per capita GDP
in 2014 was only US$271 (in constant 2005 dollars), approximately half of what it was in 1971
when it reached the post-independence peak of US$501. As a consequence, Madagascar has one
of the lowest GDPs per capita in the world. Madagascar’s growth averaged only 1 percent per year
between 2009 and 2014 (including the contraction in 2009), inferior to both the Sub-Saharan
region’s average of 4.7 percent in 2013, as well as to its high population growth (estimated to be
around 2.8 percent). The population doubled15 between 1990 and 2013, with half of this increase
taking place since 2003. Between now and 2030, the latest United Nations population projection16

suggests that the population of Madagascar will increase by around 50 percent to 36 million people,
while the population aged 15-24 will increase by approximately 2 million.

26. Recurrent political crises are also an impediment for Madagascar to achieve sustained
growth. Political crises have disrupted all multi-year growth spurts since independence17 (see
Figure 9). Some research has found that the crises are manifestations of conflicts among the ruling
elites jockeying to gain control of the country’s resources,18 and that they occur precisely because
the multi-year growth renders the economic prize irresistible. The last crisis between 2009 and
2014 was exceptionally long, and had devastating economic and social impacts, and were
intensified by the global financial crisis that halted growth across the world. The suspension of
many donor activities due to the crisis also led to significant cuts in investments and a sharp decline
in the delivery of services; international aid represented 40 percent of the pre-crisis government
budget.

27. In non-crisis years, real GDP growth has generally been positive and led by
consumption, except for 2003-08 when two large mining investments led (see the blue line in
Figure 9). To investigate the drivers of growth in “normal times,” the last two decades can be
divided into three periods, prior to the 2002 crisis (1994-2001), between the two crises (2003-
2008), and after the last crisis (2010-2013). The average real growth rate was 3.8 percent, 7.4

   The growth spurt in 1979 was artificially driven by massive public investments and lasted only one year unlike the
other four spurt episodes. Investment rate went from 9.2% in 1978 to 15.3% in 1979 (Razafindrakoto et al. 2013),
mostly invested in new state-owned enterprises and financed through external debt.

percent and 1.8 percent, respectively in the three periods (Figure 10). Growth accelerated in the
period 2003-08, primarily as a result of two large mining investments (US$8.3 billion or averaging
10.6 percent of GDP between 2005 and 2013). Investments fell sharply and the contribution from
consumption to growth was also significantly lower during the last period. It is also notable that
the government consumption contracted sharply during the third period.

28. The tertiary sector led growth between 1994 and 2008, and the mining sector took over
since 2010. On the production side, the tertiary sector drove growth during the first two periods:
transport, public works (mainly financed by development partners), information and
communications technology and banking sectors contributed the most. The contribution of the
secondary sector to growth increased in 2003-2008 compared to the previous period, reflecting
efforts to liberalize markets and the introduction of export processing zones towards the end of the
period. The primary sector grew at 6.1 and 5.3 percent respectively in the first two periods, but
contracted sharply in the third, as 2010 and 2013 were particularly bad years for agriculture
(locusts, cyclones and droughts). The third period was also lackluster for the tertiary sector, and
its contribution to growth fell below that of the secondary sector. The performance of the
secondary sector was helped greatly by the explosive growth of the extractive industry, which
contributed to 42 percent of growth from 2009 to 2014.

29. Growth was lower in the third period than the previous two because many companies
reduced investments and adopted a defensive strategy since the onset of the 2009 crisis.
Because the last crisis was much longer than the previous episodes, many firms postponed
investments, reduced the level of operations or stopped operating altogether whilst others opted to
increase the level of informal activities, resulting in a decrease in formal employment.19 Even
after the return to constitutional order in early 2014, an economic rebound has not happened, as

   According to a national survey conducted by ILO/PNUD, an estimated 335,636 jobs were lost in 2009-11, with
“industry” (126,211), “services” (111,234), “infrastructure” (46,688), “tourism” (16,739), “mining” (12,945), “crafts”
(11,587) and “fisheries” (10,232) the most affected.

local and foreign private investors appear to be waiting for the prevailing economic and political
uncertainty to clear up. Most productive sectors were adversely affected, but some sectors such as
the extractive industry, agribusiness and the banking sector have shown resilience. An analysis of
the top 100 enterprises in Madagascar reveals that the largest formal enterprises are found in the
mining and energy sectors followed by retail, the construction and fisheries sectors and then agro-
industry and textile (see Box 1 for details). Agriculture, tourism, and construction are the main
employment-generating sectors.

         (2) Regional transnational companies (Shoprite, Harel Mallac, Vitol, Galana. etc)
         (3) Local large companies (Groupe Fraises, Sipromad, Groupe Basan, Groupe Ramanandraibe, Groupe
             SILAC, Filatex, SMTP Group, Groupe Rajabally, etc)
         (4) Micro and small and medium enterprises (industry and services)

         (6) State-owned enterprises, which should operate like private companies according to the Law 2014-014 on
             companies with State participation (Air Madagascar, JIRAMA, and Aro are the best known).


30. Shoring up an environment conducive to private investments is critical in achieving the
country’s growth potential. Half of the enterprises surveyed by the 2014 Enterprise Survey
identified political instability as the main obstacle to business. Energy availability is a serious
bottleneck for the manufacturing sector, particularly those outside the capital, and is lowering
investments in other productive sectors such as fisheries, tourism and agro-processing. In addition,
the private sector suffers from a noncompetitive behavior of well-connected incumbents, with
corporate governance problems exacerbated by a defective judicial system. For example, Air
Madagascar and JIRAMA, state-owned airline and public utility enterprises, are loss-making, have
opaque corporate governance structures, and do not publish audited financial statements stipulated
by the law. Some large private firms also do not make standard disclosures stipulated by the law.
For example, only about half of the companies enjoying the benefits of the EPZ regime had filed
the activity report for 2014 by the legal deadline.

A NATION HELD BACK BY CYCLES OF POLITICAL INSTABILITY

31. Madagascar is the only country in the world20 whose real per capita income declined
vastly between 1960 and 2010 without experiencing civil wars or violent conflicts. The
average Malagasy is 42 percent poorer in 2010 than she was in 1960 (Figure 12). Among the other
countries whose real per capita income also declined, all but one experienced violent conflicts or
even wars at least at one point during this fifty-year period. In Madagascar, the reason for the poor
performance lies elsewhere. In the 50 years of its post-independence history, Madagascar has
suffered from frequent political crises; all former heads of state have either gained or lost power
as the result of unconstitutional events. The most recent episode ended with the presidential and
parliamentary elections of December 2013, which were recognized as fair by the international

community. A first government was appointed in April 2014 and was re-shuffled in January 2015.
A process of national reconciliation was initiated under the leadership of President Hery
Rajaonarimampianina with the support of the Council of Christian Churches (FFKM). A
conference organized by the FFKM developed a set of recommendations, including a call for the
dissolution of some of the state institutions. These proposals fueled further tensions between the
executive and legislative branches, leading the National Assembly to call for the impeachment of
the President and the dismissal of the Government. Both motions failed but tensions remain.
Municipal elections took place on July 31, 2015.

declined after the onset of the last crisis, falling below the threshold to be classified as a
fragile country21 since 2012. After peaking in 2007-08, Madagascar’s CPIA scores have declined
across all dimensions, but particularly in public sector management. The evolution of
Madagascar’s scores contrasts with average scores of comparator countries where scores have

34. Madagascar’s governance ratings are low because of the discrepancies between the
formal rules and implementation in practice. The country’s legal and regulatory framework,
for example, public financial management apparatus and tax laws (discussed in chapter 3), and the
competition law (discussed in chapter 4), is deemed broadly adequate. Despite this adequacy, the
country receives low and declining ratings for governance, for example, in the World Governance
Indicators (WGI) indicators (see Figure 13) and the Transparency International Corruption
Perception Index,22 because implementation is lacking.

  In the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index, Madagascar’s ranking has declined progressively,
from a ranking of 84 (2006) to 133 (2014) out of 176 countries.


                                                                                                                          22
                                                                


35. Governance emerges as a key constraint for the country’s sustained, inclusive and high
economic growth. Madagascar’s fragility stems from the fact that the rule of law is not respected
systematically and that the justice system is unable to enforce the laws effectively. There are
several structural and historical elements driving this fragility according to a recent analysis.23
They include i) the State and a political system that serves the elites; ii) the persistent role of the
army in political dynamics; iii) a fragmented society (geographically and socially); iv) an
unrealized decentralization process; and v) tensions to capture the rents from the country’s natural
resources (land and extractives). Moreover, the report highlights that the country’s fragility
increased in recent years due to: 1) growing criminality and insecurity, 2) the rapid growth of a
trafficking economy, 3) the criminalization of a significant part of the country’s security forces,
and 4) a weak justice system that is absent from large areas of the territory pushing people to take
justice into their own hands. The governance challenges are discussed in detail in the next chapter.

Chapter 2. Governance challenges
 

Summary:

   State institutions in Madagascar often serve the interests of the elites instead of those of the
    broader population. Partly as a result, the State is not providing appropriate public goods
    and services.
   Madagascar has one of the lowest revenue-to-GDP ratios in the world and spends the bulk of
    its revenue on public sector wages and recurrent spending, including regressive fuel subsidies,
    with very little left for social services or investment.
   Malagasy citizens are dissatisfied with government and have come to expect very little of it.
    Capacity of stakeholders that could demand government accountability (civil society
    organizations, the press) is weak.
   Investment (both public and private) is much lower in Madagascar than most of its peers –
    constraining growth. The private sector has identified political instability as the main
    constraint for their activity. Other constraints include inadequate infrastructure, especially
    electricity, and governance problems.
   Weak governance also affects the government’s ability to manage the country’s vast natural
    resources. Weak governance and natural resources wealth can lead to a degradation of law
    and order as has been seen in Madagascar over the past 5 years.
   Recommendations to strengthen governance include investments on demand-side
    accountability, strengthening of the anti-corruption agency and continuing with the
    decentralization process.
   As governance issues are key in a number of specific sectors, they are covered in some cases
    in subsequent chapters.

2.1 Diagnosis

36. The government has identified improving governance as the first priority in its National
Development Plan for 2015-2019, diagnosing poor governance as a major constraint to
achieving the country’s development objectives. Based on the available evidence, this chapter
discusses governance constraints to inclusiveness, sustainability and accelerated growth. These
constraints are not unique to Madagascar, but their magnitudes are more acute than in other
countries and their combined effects have resulted in one of the lowest per capita incomes in the
world and a long-lasting decline in welfare levels.

THE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES ON INCLUSIVENESS

37. State institutions in Madagascar often serve the interests of the elites instead of those of
the broader population. The Malagasy State can be characterized as neo-patrimonial,24 to
distinguish from other forms of clientelistic rule. Madagascar has not suffered from kleptocracy
or shadow states where leaders exist in lieu of state institutions, and it does not have a history of
“big men.” Rather, in neo-patrimonial Madagascar, there are formal institutional structures, but
they are captured by personalized networks of powerful leaders. Decisions concerning property
rights, law enforcement and access to resources are governed by an unwritten common
understanding among elites called the ‘elite bargain’ which is distinct from and weakens the formal
institutions and mechanisms described in laws. The boundary between political and economic
powers is blurred under neo-patrimonial rule, and the resources are tied up by the individual leader
to maintain his/her office. Parties are controlled by patronage, and do not serve as a conduit for
political participation, nor as a mechanism for providing public goods.

38. The central government is not providing adequate public goods and services to serve the
needs of the population due to an acute lack of resources. Madagascar has one of the lowest
revenue-to-GDP ratios in the world (see chapter 3), and spends the bulk of it on civil service wages
and functioning of the central administration, with little left for social services and public
investment. The isolation of the poor from the central government is true both physically and
figuratively. In 2012, 71 percent of the national roads were in poor condition (Figure 14), and the
time it takes to reach an urban center increased between 2007 and 2010 for everyone, and
particularly for the poor (Figure 15). Access to electricity in Madagascar at 14 percent of the
population in 2010 is among the lowest in the world. Moreover, the country expanded the coverage
by only 3 percentage points between 2000 and 2010, one of the slowest levels of progress among
the comparator countries (Figure 16). There was a progress in virtual connection, as measured by
teledensity,25 between 2007 and 2013, but only 6 million of the country’s 22 million population
(or 27 percent) had access to a telephone.

    Following Erdman and Engel (2007), neo-patrimonialism is a hybrid political regime between authoritarianism and
democracy. It is understood as a mix of patrimonial and legal-rational bureaucratic domination in Max Weber’s
classical sense (Weber, 1978). “The distinction between private and public interests is purposely blurred.” (Bratton
and Van de Walle 1994).

   It is important, however, to take into account that the accurate count of the number of subscribers is complicated by
the different methods of counting used by the various operators (for the active prepaid subscribers), which have been
moreover modified in certain cases during these last few years. The figures provided in this chart come from the
estimates of TeleGeography. The reduction observed in the last couple of years can be explained partly by the changes
in the counting of the subscribers, and by the retail tariff increase implemented in 2013.

39. Malagasy citizens and the private sector are dissatisfied with the government according
to surveys. For example, Afrobarometer Origines et sortie de crise à Madagascar: que dissent
les citoyens ordinaires? 2013, reports that 47 percent of respondents said the mismanagement of
the public sector by successive governments is the main factor of Madagascar’s failure in reaching
its development objectives. A survey of the informal sector found that operators do not see any
benefit in formalizing, an indication that the public sector is failing to offer useful services
responding to their needs. Enterprise surveys report the formal sector’s dissatisfaction with the
business environment provided by the government (see more discussion below and in Chapter 4).
This sentiment has not (yet) become a driver for change, as there are few channels available for
the ordinary Malagasy to influence public policies.

40. Civil society organizations do not yet fully play the role for voice and accountability.
Civil society organizations (CSOs) are nascent in Madagascar, and they have limited presence
beyond the capital. They have struggled to play the role of an arbiter between the state and the
society, and a watchdog of public policies. The main barrier for the active participation of CSOs
to public decision making is the lack of capacity and stable source of financing.26 Legislation
defining the roles of CSOs, associations and unions are unclear and outdated, although freedom of
association and information is upheld by the law. The 2013 Civicus Enabling Environment Index27
ranked Madagascar 97 out of 109 (19th among 26 African countries) with a score of 0.39.

41. Access to information is a challenge, and the ability of the press to report freely is limited
due to inadequate protection by the law. In particular, the absence of a communications code
protecting the freedom of the press allows authorities to prosecute journalists under the libel law
and the criminal code whenever the content of their reporting in not in line with their political
agenda. Journalists tend to practice self-censorship. Access to information more generally is also
a challenge. The Freedom House Index for press freedom rated Madagascar 63 in 2014 (0 = best,
100 = worst) compared to 66 in 2013. Madagascar is one of the few countries in Africa without
legislation ensuring the citizens’ rights to access to information. However, a recent initiative from
civil society led to the development of an Access to Information Charter signed by a broad range
of stakeholders.

THE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES ON ACCELERATING GROWTH

42.  Madagascar has relatively low investment levels when compared to most of its peers in
Africa. Investment represents only around 17.6 percent of GDP (2010-13 average) in Madagascar,
lower than many other low-income countries (see Figure 18). Even this low ratio has been
temporarily boosted by two large mining investments of around US$8.3 billion over the 2005-
2013 period (averaging 10.6 percent of GDP). Non-mining private investments averaged 5.3
percent of GDP between 2010 and 2013. Domestically-financed public investments averaged only
0.6 percent of GDP (2010-2013 average). They are augmented by external aid, which averaged

  The indicator evaluates the ability of the government to create an environment that allows citizen to mobilize and
participate in civil society.

2.1 percent of GDP over the same period but fluctuated between 1.8 percent and 8.1 percent of
GDP and fell sharply during the crisis due to the suspension of most external aid (Figure 19).

43. Low investment levels are partly the result of weak governance. Political instability is
reported as the top impediment to doing business by firms (48 percent of the respondents)
according to the Enterprise Survey (2013-2014). Manufacturing firms reported corruption as a
major constraint less frequently in 2013 than in 2009, and also less than the average of other
countries sampled in the Enterprise Surveys (2013-2014), but reported sharply higher incidence of
bribery and gifts in 2013 than 2009, and higher than the comparators (Table 7). Access to
electricity is the second most cited impediment in the same survey (16 percent of the respondents).
Inadequate infrastructure, including electricity, roads, ports, railroads and reliable air service, is
often the result of poor performance of partially or wholly state-owned companies, such as
JIRAMA, Air Madagascar and Madarail. Very low government revenues, mainly caused by poor
tax administration, prevent the government from increasing public investment – which also affects
growth.

THE IMPACT OF GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES ON SUSTAINED GROWTH

44.  Frequent political crises disrupt growth and discourage longer term investments. The
recurrent political crises are detrimental to sustained growth, as business activities are interrupted
while the economic landscape is reconfigured to be aligned with the new political power structure



                                                                                                                       28
                                                                


because the boundaries between political and economic powers is blurred. This process adds to
the effects of the disruption to economic activities in general, and the sanctions and other adverse
reactions from trading and diplomatic partners which the political crises often trigger.
Razafindrakoto et al. (2013) argues that when the benefits of growth are concentrated in a small
group of people, a skillful politician is able to take advantage of mounting discontent to trigger a
political crisis. Limited information and general disenfranchisement mean that a large share of the
population feels it has nothing to lose from reversing the constitutional order. Frequent crises also
create disincentives for longer term investments and increases incentives for behavior that favors
the extraction of short term rents (e.g. from natural resources).

45.   Weak governance can also affect the government’s ability for improved natural
resources management. Governance problems are also a constraint to inclusive and sustainable
growth, as they heighten the risk that the rents derived from concentrated natural resources be
captured by a few individuals. For example, the rents from precious woods are captured entirely
by a network of illegal operators and their political allies owing to a prohibition on exploitation
and quasi-absence of law enforcement. Equitable sharing of the rents among all current and future
Malagasy requires that the State captures an adequate share of the economic rents through an
appropriate fiscal regime and the judicious use of these rents in providing improved public goods
and services (the so called extractive industries value chain)28. Governance problems can prevent
this value chain from working properly.

46. The nexus between weak governance and natural resources can also lead to a
degradation of law and order. A salient illustration is a vicious circle between precious woods
traffic and corruption. Traffickers’ networks have expanded exponentially under the combined
effects of the suspension of international aid and erosion of public institutions. The networks
promote corruption in the political and security forces, while depleting the country’s natural
resources and depriving the State of public revenues. Pellerin (2014) estimates the value of the
illegal logging of rosewood from protected forests (North-East) since 2009 to be US$1 billion, and
the trafficking of gold since 2009, estimated at 400 kg/month, to reach a similar magnitude,
although less than 200 kg is reported annually to the Ministry of Mining.29 The involvement of
security forces, including senior officials, in the trafficking is often reported in the media, but no
prominent actor has been apprehended to date. The judiciary system is incapable of upholding
justice because the law enforcement side lacks financial and human resources while the traffickers
enjoy significant protection thanks to their financial prowess. This situation also makes collusion
with the traffickers more attractive to various actors, including public officials at all levels and the
poor people who live near the places where natural resources are located. The partiality of justice
and security forces undermines the confidence of the population, which explains episodes of mob
justice with reported casualties such as the cattle rustling phenomenon in the South.

2.2 Opportunities and recommendations

47. Political tensions over the years contrast with relative peace among the population, and
natural insulation from international conflicts. Despite its fragility, Madagascar also has many
strengths: it does not have a history of mass violence or civil war. Even though the society is
fragmented geographically and socially, there are few conspicuous grievances held by
disenfranchised groups that have led to violent conflicts. It is also naturally insulated from regional
conflicts that could result in flow of refugees or massive inflow of arms. These strengths should
be exploited as a stepping stone to a better equilibrium.

48. Investments in human capital can lead to stronger demand for accountability. According
to the literature (for example, Glaeser et al 2004), the demand for better governance increases with
the level of human capital in the society. This element is another consideration for prioritizing
investments in human capital among the competing needs. The private sector, in particular, the
financial services sector, may also be a promising ground for searching for demand for good
governance, as is discussed in the fourth chapter.

49. Ongoing efforts to strengthen the anti-corruption agency are promising. Steps that are
already taken to enhance the independence and capacity of the anti-corruption agency (BIANCO)
are an encouraging start, and should be pursued vigorously. For example, the compliance in 2014
by all cabinet ministers with the Constitutional requirement for filing asset declaration is a useful
start, and the compliance should be expanded to cover all those who are required to file. More
active use should also be made of the filed declarations, through random checking and disclosure
of information while protecting privacy adequately.

50. Decisive measures to tackle the trafficking of precious woods would send a strong signal
that Madagascar intends to put an end to impunity that prevailed during the years of
transition.     A legal study conducted by Ministry of Environment and Forests (No.
07/13/IDA/PE3/FinAdd/UCP/C 2014) with the support from the World Bank recommends, among
other things, setting up a special jurisdiction, as provided by ordinance 2011-001 to deal with this
issue decisively. As the issue is quite specialized with international ramifications, making use of
magistrates and lawyers with the relevant expertise and independent credentials is recommended.

51. Madagascar should renew efforts to improve governance in all its dimensions, including
decentralization and local governance processes, reestablish law and order and fight the
sense of impunity, strengthen civil society and other stakeholders that can hold the
government accountable, forge a better business environment and improve performance of
state-owned enterprises tasked with providing essential public services (the last two are
discussed in Chapter 4). Policies should aim at addressing the main binding constraints.
Improving governance should be at the center of Madagascar’s development strategy and inform
other interventions. By and large, sound policies are in place, capacity is not low and institutions
are in place (but not functioning). The following recommendations should be part of Madagascar’s
strategy to improve governance:
   Improve the center-periphery relations through decentralization (e.g., implementation of the
    existing law on decentralization), and engage directly communities in local economic,
    environmental and social development processes (as discussed in chapters 3 and 5)


                                                                                                    30
                                                


   Understand the dynamic of degradation of law and order, and seek to reverse the trend by
    strengthening the relevant entities (such as anti-corruption bureau, organs tasked to fight
    traffickers, police and security force) by providing adequate resources and enhancing their
    professionalism.
   Weaken the “elite bargain” by cultivating counter-powers, such as civil society, press and
    national assembly, by empowering them with access to information and protecting the freedom
    of press. For example, the Ministry of Finance and Budget and the National Assembly could
    have more sustained exchanges on budget preparation and execution. See discussion in the
    next chapter on those dealing with public finance.

Chapter 3. Public finance issues
Summary:

     The main priority in public finance for Madagascar is to increase government revenue,
      which is a precondition for improved public service delivery. Per capita Official
      Development Assistance (ODA) that Madagascar receives is also lower than comparators
      based on the quality of policies and institutions or on development outcomes.
     Weak tax administration – related to capacity constraints and governance issues - seems to
      be behind the relatively poor revenue performance, while tax policy seems generally sound.
      Tax expenditures are relatively high at 3 percent.
     On the expenditure side, a large share of the government’s budget is allocated to public
      sector wages and regressive subsidies on fuel and electricity, leaving little to allocate to
      social services or public investment.
     The wage bill is relatively low as a share of GDP when compared with peer countries. The
      capacity of the civil service has been weakened through patronage-based appointments and
      limited capacity building. A more competent civil service will be required for improved
      services delivery.
     There has been progress in the regulatory framework for budgeting, transparency and
      accountability, but implementation remains weak, as illustrated by worsening Public
      Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) scores from 2008 to 2014. Reinstituting
      oversight mechanisms that were weakened during the crisis is a priority.
     Decentralization has been discussed for a long time without being implemented. Financing
      and decision-making are still concentrated in the central government.
     Public private partnerships (PPPs) are an opportunity for Madagascar to increase
      infrastructure investments in a resource-constrained environment, but it will be important to
      manage risks. The country is currently revising the regulatory framework for PPPs.
     Natural resources offer an opportunity for Madagascar to increase government revenue and
      derive a number of benefits. But it will be necessary to improve transparency in regulating
      the sector. An open discussion involving all stakeholders on how to share the dividends from
      the natural resources among the citizens will be important.
 

3.1 Diagnosis

52.   The main priority in public finance for Madagascar is to increase tax revenue, which is
among the lowest in the world as a share of GDP. Madagascar’s revenues are not adequate for
supporting the ambitious strategy outlined in the National Development Plan (PND) 2015-2019.
There is scope for improving the efficiency of expenditure as well, but the bulk of the challenges
and constraints lies with the revenue side. On the plus side, the authorities have a track record of
maintaining macroeconomic stability and conducting prudent debt management. One of the
potential sources of future revenue is the mining sector, which is not yet a large contributor to the
Treasury. Managing the potential exponential growth of the extractive sector is a challenge for
the country, and also an immense opportunity. Another potential area of opportunity for increasing
investments in the near future is public-private partnerships (PPPs).

GOVERNMENT COLLECTS VERY LITTLE REVENUE

53. Madagascar has one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios in the world. Tax revenue in
Madagascar has been chronically low, and has been less than 10 percent of GDP since 2009. Its
2005-2012 average at 10.6 percent of GDP is well below the Sub Saharan Africa average of 16.8
percent of GDP. The average collection rate between 2010 and 2012 is among the lowest in the
region (see Figure 20). According to literature, tax performance is associated positively with
higher income per capita, trade openness, financial sector depth and better institutions. By
contrast, larger shares of agriculture in total value-added and higher inflation are associated
negatively with tax revenues (IMF 2011).

54. Madagascar’s tax potential based on its characteristics is estimated to be 15-17 percent
of GDP (IMF 2015). The tangible progress that was being made before 2009 indicates that it is
possible for the authorities to collect more taxes: in the five years leading up to the crisis, tax
revenues had increased by almost 3 percentage points from 10.1 percent in 2005 to 13.0 percent
in 2008 (see Figure 21).

55. Weak tax administration seems to be behind the relatively poor revenue performance.
Tax policies are generally sound, with the simplifications and modernization introduced in 2008
(see Box 2), though mining and petroleum taxation could possibly be enhanced. Administration
(i.e., human resources, financial and technical means, and procedures), on the other hand, is where
the challenge lies. Madagascar has a low and flat personal and corporate income tax rate of 20
percent, which is at the lower end of SSA economies. The tax base is narrow due to the small size
of the formal sector, and compliance appears to be an issue: in 2013, less than half of all enterprises
filing returns declared a taxable profit. The value-added tax (VAT) is the main tax earner,
accounting for about half of all taxes during 2004-2013. Madagascar’s VAT rate is among the
highest in SSA (see Table 8), but its productivity, defined as the ratio of revenue collected to the
standard rate, is very low. Thus, VAT underperformance appears to be linked to implementation
issues, such as those related to the handling of VAT refunds, and to compliance gaps. Available
data suggests that about a fifth of enterprises with turnover of between Ariary 50 and 200 million
are not complying with their obligations to file VAT returns. Moreover, the share of these non-
compliant enterprises has been increasing since 2010. Another indicator of weakness is the high
share of enterprises submitting nil VAT obligations or requesting VAT credits. This share was 65
percent for large enterprises in 2013 (Source: IMF 2015).
                                             Box 2: Madagascar’s 2008 Tax Reform

 In 2008, Madagascar implemented a wide-ranging domestic tax reform. The reform’s objectives were to increase the tax yield
 and improve the business environment. It included the following elements:
       Reduction in the number of taxes from 28 to 14;
       Harmonization of taxes on income and consolidation into a single tax rate of 25 percent;
       Elimination of excise duties on several items;
       Increase of the VAT rate from 18 to 20 percent and of the VAT threshold;
       Announcement of the elimination of the Export Processing Zone regime for new firms, with ‘grand-fathering’ of existing
            firms. No firm date had however been announced for this measure and it was never applied.

 In parallel, tax administration procedures were overhauled, resulting in the revitalization of the directorate for large enterprises,
 the restructuring of several regional service centers, and the modernization of procedures for tax filing and payment.

56. Capacity constraints and governance are affecting the collection of taxes on
internationally traded goods. Customs administration also has issues of exemptions, evasion
and challenges. Current procedures do not allow for adequate tracking of the activities of importers
despite the fact that a few large importers account for the bulk of all imports. Many of these
importers benefit from accelerated customs procedures, but are not followed by ex-post
verification. There are concerns regarding false declarations regarding the content of imported
containers, to benefit from lower duties and tariffs and exemptions, and the declared values of
imports which appear too low: about 70 percent of all imported containers have a declared value
of less than US$20,000, which is abnormally low, as it translates into less than US$1/kg. Special
procedures for customs clearance also give rise to opportunities for fraud. Derogations introduced
during the transition years have weakened the purview of the customs administration. Export
processing zones (EPZ) companies, for example, are no longer required to declare to customs the
value of their sales in local market. Consequently, the risk of unauthorized duty free sales on the
domestic market has increased. A relatively high share of imports (16 percent) is granted
temporary admission. Temporary admission is often granted on an ad hoc basis, and for relatively
long periods of time. Last, but not least, there is anecdotal evidence of governance issues at
customs30.

57. There is no effective mechanism to sanction tax and customs agents who engage in
corruption. There is no effective mechanism to sanction tax and customs agents for bribe-taking
or harassing tax-payers. This administrative weakness became more pronounced during the crisis,
because formal institutions are not operational (e.g., Conseil de discipline budgétaire et financière)

                                                            
 
30An example of governance issues at customs is reflected in the fact that some 20 individuals with connection to international

markets through illegal activities made gains of US$220 million from precious wood trafficking while the government gained
US$21.7 million (through the temporary export permits and the auction of confiscated logs) and the communities US$9.6 million
through logging and transporting the logs out of the forest in 2009 (Ballet et al)




                                                                                                                            35
                                                                         


or lacked resources (e.g., BIANCO). Even when enough evidence of wrongdoing exists, culprits
are not prosecuted because the judiciary system is hampered with graft.

58. Madagascar’s royalty rates for nickel and other base metals are relatively low, which
may be needed to compensate the private sector for the relatively weak infrastructure and
business environment. Madagascar, at 2 percent, has relatively low royalty rates according to a
recent study on mining tax regimes among African countries (World Bank 2014) (Table 9).
Indeed, revenue from the existing three industrial mining operations, two of which are considered
world-class,31 is forecast to provide the central government with an annual revenue of less than 1
percent of GDP (Table 10). Taxes and royalties that operators are able to pay are determined by
the profitability of the investments, which in turn is a function of the quality of the mineral deposit
and the ease with which it can be extracted and exported. The latter depends on both physical and
business environments, including the location of the deposit and access infrastructure,
predictability of obtaining operating permits, timeliness of VAT refunds, stability of political

retain higher share of the proceeds if the second factor can be made less constraining.

59. Tax expenditures are estimated to be large at 3 percent of GDP. Tax expenditures
proliferated during the crisis. The EPZ is legal, but since the application decree to implement the
Law establishing the zone (adopted in 2007) has not yet been issued, its implementation in practice
has been haphazard. For example, the list of EPZ firms are kept by several entities for different
purposes, such as the Customs Administration and Large Enterprise Department of Ministry of
Finance, Economic Development Board of Madagascar (EDBM), and Ministry of Commerce, and
the lists do not match. More than 50 firms operating under the EPZ regime in 2013 according to
the EDBM list, did not have a tax identification number, even though EPZ firms do have tax
obligations, such as corporate income tax after the initial tax haven period is over, social security
tax and VAT on the portion of their merchandize sold domestically. Other types of exonerations
were also granted on a case by case basis, rather than based on a systematic application of a set of
well-defined and transparent criteria. This practice can be open to abuse, and be used as a
mechanism to grant favorable status to those who are well-connected. The magnitude of tax
expenditures is not assessed systematically by the authorities, but they have been estimated at 3
percent of GDP in 2014.

60. Madagascar also receives relatively little financing from development partners, much
lower than its Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) and development level
would suggest. At US$21.8 per capita, Madagascar receives much less Official Development
Assistance (ODA) per capita than other countries with similar CPIA ratings (see Figure 22). There
are 10 countries with CPIA ratings similar to Madagascar’s, but only one country (Pakistan) has
lower ODA per capita, possibly a result of very large population. In fact, there is a large number
of countries that have lower CPIA ratings but have higher ODA per capita. This cannot be
explained by better development outcomes, as can be seen in Figure 23, which shows that
Madagascar has some of the lowest development outcomes among countries with similar CPIA
scores, but also lower ODA per capita.

UNDER-PROVISIONS OF SERVICES BY THE PUBLIC SECTOR

61. During the crisis Madagascar cut spending on social services and investment to maintain
macroeconomic stability. Maintenance of macroeconomic stability throughout the last crisis has
been a remarkable achievement. The fiscal authorities maintained it by drastically cutting social
spending and capital investments to cope with low tax revenue: expenditure declined from the
peak of 23.5 percent of GDP in 2004 to the trough of 12 percent in 2012. The country has
traditionally relied on aid inflows, but this source fluctuates with political stability as well as
external factors: externally-financed public investments accounted for the bulk of the decline in
expenditure (Figure 24).

62. A large share of the government’s budget is allocated to public sector wages, and a
substantial part of discretionary spending is allocated to highly regressive subsidies on fuel
and electricity. Over 40 percent of public resources are allocated to the civil service wage bill,
including pensions. Yet, the wage bill as a share of GDP is relatively low, and Madagascar has
fewer public employees per 1,000 population compared to the SSA average (Table 11). In 2012
and 2013, about a third of current discretionary spending (total expenditure excluding wages, debt
service and investments) was allocated to subsidies on fuel and electricity. This share is estimated
to have increased to almost a half in 2014. These subsidies are regressive, as 97 percent of the
direct fuel subsidies accrue to the richest 10 percent of the population, and only 14 percent of the
population has access to electricity.32

63. The capacity of central government administration is not low, although it has been
weakened through a combination of patronage-based appointments and limited capacity
building. During the crisis, retirees were not replaced systemically, appointments were made
through patronage and training to maintain capacity was not provided. Establishing a clear
strategic orientation for managing public administration would help restore its performance. In an
indication of poor management, the exact number of civil servants remains unknown; there is a
significant discrepancy between the number reported by the Ministry of Finance and Budget
(MFB) and that by the Ministry of Public Administration.33 Its civil service is over-concentrated
(nearly 29 percent of total) in the Analamanga region where the capital city is located, where 15
percent of the population lives.

64. The Government has managed public debt well, although little is known about
contingent liabilities that could be accumulating. The government also has a track record of
managing its debt prudently, partly as a result of scarce concessional financing and lack of access
to international markets and partly because it has cut expenditures instead of resorting to deficit
financing when faced with a decline in resources. It should be noted, however, that there is no
systematic data on contingent liabilities and informal debt, stemming from out-of-circuit
expenditure, public pension obligations34 and liabilities of state-owned enterprises, and extra-
budgetary expenditures whose legality is questionable.

65. The Central Bank has maintained price stability, but its independence has been eroded
during the crisis. The Central Bank has maintained price stability and reduced inflation during
the last crisis. Its independence was eroded over the same period, however, as it was forced to
give preferential exchange rates to petroleum companies to support the government’s fuel subsidy
program, and to grant increasing statutory advances to the government (although still within the
legal limit).

66. Madagascar has made progress in public financial management reforms with a number
of initiatives to improve transparency and accountability. Public financial management has
been improving as a result of a series of reforms in budgeting, procurement, treasury and cash
management over the last decade. The 2014 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) self-assessment showed that the country has improved budget credibility regarding
revenue forecasting. Efforts have also been made to improve budget transparency with the regular
publication of quarterly budget execution reports on the Minister of Finance and Budget (MFB)
website within a month of the end of the period, although annual execution reports are not made
public (see below). The completion of the first Open Budget self-assessment in July 2014 is an
additional step in the right direction. Government has also joined the Global Partnership for Social
Accountability (GPSA) in October 2014.

67. While the regulatory framework and technical solutions for public finance management
have improved, implementation of reforms has been weaker. The reforms have not delivered

the results expected because the rules are often circumvented to cope with the shortage and
unpredictability of cash flow by resorting to extra-budgetary spending, or to accommodate the
well-connected. An evaluation of expenditures shows mismatches between budget previsions and
execution, both on the amounts and composition; the first has been poor historically (the score of
D in both years) but the second saw a significant deterioration during the crisis (from A in 2008 to
C+ in 2014). Budget information available is not exhaustive (no change in scores between 2008
and 2014), and budget preparation lacks credibility due to inadequate participation by sectoral
ministries (deterioration). Extra-budgetary expenditures are common (deterioration), creating
windows for abuses. The procurement processes remain opaque (deterioration), allowing
domination of the market for state contracts by a limited number of firms. There are major delays
in preparing the annual consolidated accounts and their audits by the Accounting Agency (Cour
des Comptes): the last audited consolidated public accounts (Loi de Règlement) brought to the
Parliament for approval were those for 2008 (no change in scores).

68.   Participatory budgeting at the local level has been a success with avid participation by
citizens. Participatory budgeting is one way for citizens to influence public policy decisions. It
has been implemented successfully in some communes (the lowest level of government) starting
with pilot programs introduced in 2004 and progressive scaling-up to include a total of 122
communes by 2014. Malagasy citizens mobilize when given a chance35: 36.6 percent of citizens
attended the initial fora where budget priorities were discussed in each commune. This result
contrasts with other countries, for example, in Porto Alegre in Brazil, where participatory
budgeting has been implemented for about 20 years, average attendance rate is only 3.3 percent.
A subsequent survey in 2014 noted an attendance rate of 26 percent, which is one of the highest in

the world. Analysis suggests that the rate of citizens feeling that their opinions are taken into
account by local leaders is significantly higher in communes where participatory budgeting was
implemented than in those where it was not.

69. Decentralization could be a programmatic option for a country as vast as Madagascar,
and it has been on the political radar screen for a long time, but most public finances and
decision-making remain highly centralized. The success of participatory budgeting at commune
level and other countries’ experience seem to indicate that moving public decision making closer
to the people by decentralizing may be useful in making policies more responsive to ordinary
citizens’ needs. Successive governments in Madagascar have discussed and promised
decentralization since at least the 1990s, yet most public finances and decision-making remain
centralized. The constitutions of 1992 and its amendments, a 2006 policy paper, legislations
adopted in 1994 (Law 94-01 and 94-007), the creation of the Local Development Fund (Fond de
développement local - FDL) in 2007, the latest Constitution and the recently adopted
decentralization Code 2014-01836 outlined ambitious steps for decentralization, but few of them
have been implemented so far.

70. Disarticulation has opened the door for experimentation and service delivery at the
local level during the crisis. Citizens and officials at the commune level reacted with creativity
and resilience to the shortage of fiscal resources from the center during the crisis years 2009-13.
It led to some ad hoc decentralization, though not on the path spelled out in the Constitutions and
the laws. Local governments have sometimes taken matters in their own hands in the areas of
education, land management and taxes. They also negotiated some mining royalties, despite the
stipulations of the Mining Code. A few places have made impressive progress on the strength of
their economic situation and the personality of their leaders, but most have too few resources to
do much, or have used their resources less well and done very little for development.

3.2 Opportunities and recommendations

71.   The main priority for strengthening public finances and the delivery of public services
would be to increase government revenues. Increasing revenue is a prerequisite for improving
public service substantially. The underlying causes of low revenue reflect most elements of
governance challenges facing the country, be it special treatments of well-connected individuals,
insufficient enforcement of law and order, or a marked lack of citizens’ confidence in the public
sector. Hence, efforts to increase tax revenue could serve as a lens through which to assess
progress in forging a more sustainable and inclusive future with higher economic growth.
Regaining the lost ground during the crisis will be an uphill battle, as bad habits are difficult to
remove once they become entrenched; it is always easier not to give special treatments in the first
place than to try to take them away from those who are enjoying them already. What is needed
are behavioral changes and a willingness to demand even well-connected businesses to contribute

  The new legislation on decentralization adopted in October 2014 excludes the specific legislation on municipalities
with “special status,” including the nation’s capital, Antananarivo. The proposed legislation for municipalities with
“special status” currently debated in Parliament proposes a partition of Antananarivo, which is controversial and is
perceived as a political move in anticipation of the next communal elections not yet scheduled, but anticipated to take
place in 2015.


                                                                                                                    43
                                                                


their fair share to the public treasury. Professionalizing the revenue-collecting administrations,
and creating an incentive structure compatible with upholding the laws are also indispensable.
Technical upgrades would only be productive if there is a political will to implement these reforms
and agents are incentivized to follow them through.

72. Establishing or reinstituting budget oversight mechanisms that were weakened during
the crisis is a priority for the expenditure side. This would include, among others,
operationalizing the system to investigate, prosecute and sanction wrong doing by civil servants;
auditing and publishing of the financial accounts of the government; enforcing rules for
procurement to assure value for money; and cleaning up the extra-budgetary procedures tolerated
during the crisis.

73. Improved service delivery will also require a better incentivized civil service – efforts
should therefore focus on strengthening the civil service. Madagascar needs to develop a
strategy to manage its civil service, which is aging and gradually losing technical expertise.
Developing a human resource management strategy is a priority, starting with the establishment
of a single roster of civil servants, which will also help plan for future pension liabilities. The
strategy should also re-examine the location of civil servants, who have traditionally been highly
concentrated in the capital.

74. To increase public investment even at a time of limited fiscal resources, Madagascar
could consider expanding PPPs. Madagascar has gained experience in the past few years with
the implementation of a number of PPPs, focused on the telecommunications, energy and transport
sectors. Private sector participation in infrastructure through PPPs amounted to US$853 million
in the last 23 years (1990-2013)37. Private participation was largest in the telecom sector, with
US$757 million, followed by transport with US$79 million (3 projects including airport, railroad
and seaport) and energy with US$18 million. Experience from other countries shows that
managing PPPs can be complex and involves important risks: it requires a strong capacity to
negotiate balanced contracts, and to monitor and enforce them. Still, PPPs can be particularly
attractive for Madagascar, as the country has few other options at its disposal for increasing
investments.

75. The government has identified setting up a PPPs framework as a priority to develop
infrastructure services and boost economic growth. The regulatory framework is being revised
and consultations on a draft law are ongoing. In 2008, a national strategy, a global PPPs law and
a bill on “contrat de partenariat” (a form of PPPs inspired from French PPPs legislation) were
drafted by legal consultants and a PPPs ad hoc committee was tasked with elaborating the
associated decrees. The draft PPPs law clarifies roles between the different ministries, providing
the Ministry of Finance with approval rights at different stages of project preparation to ensure
affordability and management of fiscal exposure. The PPPs Unit to be created within the State
Minister for Infrastructure (MOI) will assist contracting agencies with the selection of projects,
preparation and procurement of PPPs projects, particularly where capacity is weak (e.g. at the
subnational level), supervision of project implementation as well as capacity building. Contracting

agencies will be responsible for the identification, appraisal, development, and monitoring of
project implementation.

76. Decentralization also provides opportunities for improved revenue collection and
services delivery. One avenue for potentially attaining higher tax revenues and improving service
delivery is fiscal decentralization. The principle of subsidiarity states that public service should
be provided by the lowest logical level of the government. The entity providing the service may
have a better chance of convincing taxpayers to contribute, provided that there is sufficient
potential for revenues (in the medium term) and capacities are improved. Many areas of the
country are predominantly agricultural, and are likely to have a limited potential for tax collection.
An accompanying system of transfer and equalization fund will need to be operational for
economically disfavored regions/communes for a decentralized system to function properly.
Elected local governments with more autonomous sources of revenue and empowered to make
policy decisions would be more resilient, and could continue to function, even when the central
government experiences political crises. Local Development Fund (Fonds de Développement
Local) offers an opportunity for encouraging a performance-based culture in which municipalities
receive transfers from the central government based on their performance against verifiable
criteria, such as schooling outcomes, forest conservation, health outcomes and so forth.

77. Natural resources offer a significant opportunity to increase government revenues but
there is a need to improve transparency in regulating the sector. Madagascar’s rich natural
endowments represent an opportunity for the country, and a potential source for government
revenue, but they also pose a governance challenge as the experience of other resource-rich
countries shows. Madagascar should strengthen transparency in regulating the natural resource
sector. There is also a need to strengthen the capacity to enforce existing laws, urgently for
renewable natural resources sectors such as forestry. Enhancements are needed in multiple facets
to improve law enforcement, such as technical capacity of the front line officers to understand the
law and pedagogical expertise to enforce them, financial resources to carry out the necessary
surveillance and investigations, and a functioning penal chain to prosecute wrongdoers and to
discourage potential ones.

78. As the government prepares to amend the petroleum and mining codes, there will be
trade-offs in the country’s efforts to benefit from its natural resources. For example, the Law
on Large Mining Enterprises stipulates lower royalties if the enterprise is engaged in
transformation activities in Madagascar instead of exporting raw materials. The lower rates were
designed to promote local employment and diversification of activities. Besides the question of
whether these intended outcomes are likely to materialize, there is also a case to be made for a
careful weighing of the trade-offs between employment and activities in specific areas around the
mines on the one hand, and higher tax revenue which might be used for the benefit of a larger
segment of the population on the other. The choice is subject to preferences and judgment call,
and should be debated widely and transparently among stakeholders. That the government is
pondering the future role of the extractive sector now represents an opportunity, as it is still early




                                                                                                   45
                                                                


days for the sector’s development: despite the abundance of endowments and a large potential, the
extractive sector currently represents only a few percent of GDP.38

79.  Stability of rules, especially those related to taxes, is very important to investors, and the
Malagasy authorities did well to resist reneging on the Law on Large Mining Enterprises (although
the mining company did encounter numerous difficulties during the Transition period). A
reasonable assurance that professional administrations can continue to function even during crises
allowing investors to pursue their business activities would go a long way in convincing potential
investors to invest. It would also help preserve gains in the form of employment and
accompanying income generating activities.




                                                            
 
38
   The estimated contribution of the extractive sector to GDP is too low, as GDP is still calculated with 1984 as the
base year. Rebasing to a more recent year would increase the contribution, possibly 2-3 fold, but the sector would
still not be the predominant one in the country.

Chapter 4. Private sector
Summary:

     The main constraints for private sector development include weak governance and the frequent
      political crises, a poor business environment as well as poor access to social, financial and
      physical infrastructure. A partial justice system and uncompetitive market structures in many
      sectors adversely affect the private sector.
     Access to electricity is among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Delays and costs of obtaining
      an electricity connection are onerous, affecting competitiveness. Weak government capacity
      to supervise the sector, poor governance of the sector, and underperformance of the electricity
      company are obstacles to improving access to electricity.
     The financial sector has shown remarkable resilience during the crisis, but its level of financial
      intermediation is limited. Long term financing is largely unavailable and costs remain high.
      Access to finance remains a major constraint, particularly for small and medium enterprises
      (SMEs). Insurance and capital markets remain small.
     Increasing financial intermediation will require interventions to improve the supply of finance
      – promoting competition and product innovation; the demand of finance – improving firms’
      business plans; as well as financial system improvements, such as the creation of a credit
      bureau and collateral registries. Increasing access to finance for SMEs will require innovative
      products, such as increased use of mobile money, and improving financial literacy.
     Transportation services represent a major constraint for the country’s competitiveness. To
      improve the sector’s performance, the government will need to prioritize between
      maintenance, rehabilitation and investment in transport infrastructure in the short term. In
      the medium term, the government should prepare a medium term investment plan that helps
      the country invest scarce resources in the most productive infrastructure.
     Despite these challenges, Madagascar’s private sector harbors significant opportunities,
      particularly in sectors that can leverage its potential for labor, natural resources, international
      and regional trade treaties.

4.1      Diagnosis

80. Growth is constrained by weak governance and a poor business environment, recurrent
political crises as well as poor access to social, financial and physical infrastructure. The
private sector is and will be the engine of growth in Madagascar. The country has diverse
endowments, and the private sector (outside of agriculture) is small but diversified, which is an
asset for stability. But the business environment is constrained by strong administrative red-tape
favoring back channel relationships, back-hand rewards and unfair practices. Disruptions caused
by the recurrent political crises make long term planning difficult and investments riskier,
especially for those without connections. The private sector is also constrained by poor access to
social, financial and physical infrastructure.

A RESILIENT PRIVATE SECTOR OPERATES IN A DIFFICULT BUSINESS
ENVIRONMENT

81. Investment climate reforms prior to the 2009 crisis had started to create a vibrant
private sector. Madagascar’s private sector is small, fragmented and suffers from a highly
restrictive and uncertain policy and regulatory environment. Earlier waves of investment climate
reform before 2009 had begun to create a vibrant private sector, assisted by the liberalization of
the telecoms, rail and petroleum distribution and logistics in the early 2000s. A new Investment
Law and Export Processing Zone Law were adopted in 2007 and 2008 respectively. These
measures catalyzed the emergence of tourism, garment, construction, fisheries and Information
and Communication Technology (ICT) sectors.

82. The crisis had a devastating effect on the private sector with a large number of investors
and professionals moving abroad. The policy gains described above were not sustained, and
have given way to an unpredictable environment in the wake of the 2009 political crisis. The
economy suffered a sharp decline in 2009 followed by economic stagnation in 2010-14. During
the crisis, many firms exited the market or introduced some form of parallel trading with cash
transactions (i.e. no VAT invoices), and others opted to join the informal sector, resulting in a
decrease in formal employment. One of the direct casualties of the crisis was the loss of AGOA
privileges, which affected the viability of the textile and garment export oriented sector. Many
investors and professionals shifted their activities opportunities elsewhere.

83. The return to the constitutional order has not resulted in a revival of investments due to
the prevailing poor business environment and degrading infrastructure. Though business
opportunities have been identified in several sectors such as agro-industry, infrastructure, services
(e.g. tourism), and mining, the investments by the private sector remain limited. The lack of
appetite appears in part due to the sluggish improvements in the business environment and unstable
political situation, and also in part due to lack of complementary infrastructure.

84. Madagascar is one of the most difficult countries in the world in which to do business,
according to surveys such as the Doing Business and Enterprise Survey. The 2013 Enterprise
Survey noted that nearly half the firms cited political uncertainty as the most severe constraint
(Figure 27). The grant index, a measure of corruption, at around 25 percent is well above the Sub-
Saharan African (SSA) average of around 20 percent. Doing Business 2015 ranked Madagascar
163rd out of 189 countries assessed, down from 157th the previous year. Madagascar has made
very little progress over the last five years on improving its performance. The most critical
constraints identified by Doing Business 2015 were “getting electricity (189th, i.e., the lowest
among all the countries assessed)” and “getting credit (180th).” In addition, Madagascar fared
poorly in “dealing with construction permits (177th),” “registering property (153rd)” and “enforcing
contracts (146th).”

85. A partial justice system and uncompetitive market structures in many sectors affect the
private sector and the country’s competitiveness. Investors have also expressed little trust in
the justice system, citing quasi-impossibility of winning even obvious cases in the courts of justice
without paying bribes to judges as one of the factors increasing costs of doing business in
Madagascar. As a result, few people take a case to the court.39 There is a strong perception that
the laws are not enforced equally. Business groups with close historic ties to politicians have a
strong presence in most sectors. These groups operate in multiple sectors and maintain de jure or
de facto monopoly or oligopoly power in some, such as the railway and air transport. The
government is not setting the right regulatory and administrative framework, creating instead high
barriers to entry. While this situation is not unique to Madagascar, it is clear that such a market
structure reduces business opportunities, investments and therefore growth.

86. More generally, the statutory rules, as codified by laws and regulations, and practices
often diverge in Madagascar. For example, the Competition Law (No 2005-020) was adopted
in 2005, but its implementation decree (No 2008-771) was not issued until 2008. The statutes of
the Competition Council, the main enacting body of the Competition Law, were only adopted in
2014, and the Council has not adopted any decision to date. Moreover, the implementing decrees
referenced in the Law have not been approved yet (e.g., the ex-ante merger control regime is still
not in place). The delay in implementing the enforcement body and instruments is in part due to
the political crisis (2009-2014), but also seems to have been associated with lobbying from the
industry groups, fearing that the Competition Law could threaten their economic positions in
Madagascar.40

87. The formal small and medium enterprise (SME) sector in Madagascar remains small.
The country has among the lowest rates of new firm entry, as measured by the Global
Entrepreneurship Database, ranking just above Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with 0.05
firms per 1,000 people, and well below a number of other conflict-affected states (Figure 28).
Smaller firms have developed sources of resilience to the risky environment, including resorting
to informality and informal payments to circumvent regulatory barriers.

88. Informal firms do not formalize over time. There is a very large share of small informal
firms and this share of 1-person firms is constant at around 72 percent for firms with under 3 years
and over 20 years of activity, as well as everything in between. There is no marked drop off in
informality with the length of the firm’s life: about a fifth of the informal firms surveyed had been
in business for over 20 years.

89.   A large share of informal firms do not think there are any benefits from formalization
– complexity and costs of procedures seem to be important constraints to formalization.
When asked to report their needs for various business support services such as technical training,
support to access credit, assistance to have better access to market, a majority of the firms did not
express a desire for support services to help them solve their challenges underscoring their
isolation and unwillingness to interact with formal institutions. Forty percent of firms responded
they would be willing to formalize their businesses, but the stated willingness to formalize may
not be an accurate reflection of reality as only 6 percent of firms have actually tried to formalize
in the past. Twenty nine percent of informal firms think there is no benefit to formalization. Most
common perceived benefits of formalization are the ability to have “better location in the market”
(25 percent of firms) and thus afford and enjoy the advantages of being more visible, followed by
“better access to credit” (17 percent) and “being able to sell to large firms” (10 percent). The
complexity and cost of procedures are important impediments to firm formalization.

90. Informality does not shelter business from taxation, as many informal businesses do pay
“taxes” to local governments. Interviews with informal businesses showed that small fruit
merchants along the RN7 pay 1,000 Ariary per week to the municipality, a retailer of artisanal
goods pays 40,000 Ariary to the regional government, while a small bicycle repair shop owner
pays 100 Ariary per day to the commune. These payment schemes are adapted to the income
streams of informal businesses, but are often a significant share of their sales and net income.
Moreover the lack of clear local tax laws undermines the transparency of tax obligations local
institutions put on informal businesses.

91. Availability of electricity is a major impediment for investors and has a significant
impact on competitiveness. Only 14 percent of the population had access to electricity in
Madagascar in 2010, lower than many comparator countries. Firms in Madagascar have to wait
24 days to obtain an electricity connection upon submission of their application, compared to 16
days in South Africa and 19 days in Zambia (Figure 30). Corruption to get electricity connection
is also apparent with 13 percent of firms saying that gifts are expected to complete the process.
Once connected, firms receive poor service relative to regional comparators. They experience
over 6.7 power outages per month of an average duration of 1.5 hours which is about 2.5 hours per
week. The impact on businesses is large; the average firm loses the equivalent of 7 percent of its
sales because of power outages compared to 6 percent in Zambia and 1 percent in South Africa.41

92. Difficult access to electricity is a consequence of three factors: weak government
capacity to supervise the sector, poor governance in the sector as well as the poor
performance of the state-owned enterprise in charge of urban electricity. First, the
supervising ministry lacks the capacity to carry out sector planning and implementation in all
segments, in particular in energy generation, which result in suboptimal choices and high costs for
the country. Second is poor governance and unclear allocation of responsibilities to sector players.
Third, but not least, the poor performance by JIRAMA, the state-owned electricity and water
company. The company’s financial position deteriorated significantly between 2010 and 2013 due

  These calculations do not incorporate the incidence and impact of variations in electricity voltage which are
significant for firms according to interviews with entrepreneurs and managers of textile plants.

to declining operational efficiency, poor management of its assets and theft of fuel, and high non-
technical losses (unbilled electricity consumption) and rising price of inputs, primarily imported
fuel (prior to the recent bout of lower fuel prices). JIRAMA has increased the use of expensive
oil-based thermal generation, mainly running on diesel, to reduce the supply gap in the short term,
even though the use of diesel for electricity generation is incompatible with sustainable
development of the power sector. As a result of its dire financial situation, the company has
underinvested in network maintenance and rehabilitation/upgrade, which in turn results in high
technical losses and exacerbates its financial difficulties. The government has provided large
transfers to fill the increasing financing gap of the company at a high opportunity cost of foregoing
more productive investments.

93. The financial sector has shown remarkable resilience during the crisis but its level of
financial intermediation is limited. The sector can be considered to have a low level of
capitalization, high sector and client risk concentration, and has a narrow product offering,
resulting in low levels of financial intermediation: the depth of the Malagasy’s financial sector is
lower than the Sub-Saharan African average despite high levels of bank liquidity. Yet the total
number of financial institutions has continuously increased over the past five years now reaching
11 banks, 6 Non-Banking financial institutions (NBFI) and 30 microfinance institutions. However,
the high asset concentration index for the three largest banks (at 93 percent at end-2013) signals
potential systemic risks and general lack of competition. Total assets of the financial sector
represented 23 percent of GDP at end 2013.

94. The financial system continues to be broadly stable but its supervision needs to be
reinforced. The majority of banks adhere to the Basel core principles as of end June 2014. The
average risk weighted capital adequacy ratio was 16.1 percent at the end of 2013 and declined to
14.8 percent at end June 2014 but it is still well above the minimum requirement of 8 percent. The
liquidity levels in the system, despite a decrease in the ratio of liquid assets/deposits and short term
funding from 54.3 percent at end 2012 to 45.2 percent at end 2013, remain above the SSA average



                                                                                                                                            52
                                                                


of 33.8 percent. The banking system remains very profitable, with a Return on Equity at 24.8
percent in 2013 (from 19.8 percent in 2012) against a regional average of 17.1 percent.

95. Long term financing is largely unavailable and financing costs remain high. The banking
sector has been very risk averse and relied mainly on collateral based lending. A slight increase
was registered in the ratio of private sector credit to GDP (from 11 percent at the end of 2012 to
11.9 percent of GDP in 2013), but this ratio is still significantly lower than the regional average of
23.6 percent. Non-performing loans as measured by Banking and Financial Supervision
Commission (CSBF) prudential rules reached 14 percent in June 2014, a relatively high level. This
figure could be higher if measured under the International Financial Reporting Standards. The
tertiary sector (mainly trade) and construction are the most exposed in terms of non-performing
loans. Long-term funding is largely unavailable and banks have mostly a short-term funding
structure. The high cost of lending further inhibits access to finance which has been specifically
detrimental for the micro, small and medium enterprises as well as for households and consumers,
all of them remaining strongly underserved by traditional banks.

96. Access to finance is a major constraint in Madagascar with access levels much lower
than in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa. Only 8.6 percent of adults aged 15 and older have an
account (with a financial institution or mobile money service) compared to a SSA average of 34.2
percent42. Of these, only 5.7 percent have an account at a financial institution in 2014, showing
very little progress from the 5.5 percent level of 2011 (versus SSA averages of 29 percent and 24
percent respectively). In 2014 only 3.3 percent of adults saved at a financial institution, and only
2 percent have borrowed from a formal financial institution despite 40 percent of adults declared
to have saved money in 2014 and 57 percent of adults declared to have borrowed money in 2014
(of which almost 50 percent from family and friends). Access to formal financial services remains
therefore a major challenge. Lack of risk mitigation tools, weak legal frameworks, poor
infrastructure and a lack of efficient low-cost delivery mechanisms, among others, hinder banks
and Microfinance institutions (MFIs) from expanding their services to the unserved population.
Mobile accounts remain on the low side too, compared to SSA levels (4.4 percent of adults in
Madagascar versus 11.5 percent in SSA).

97. The Malagasy microfinance sector has been growing rapidly in recent years, but some
are facing difficulties. The number of MFIs has reached 30 (up from 25 in 2009) and the total
number of clients has grown by 16 percent annually to reach a million in 2013. Clients are reached
through a growing number of service points; 803 in 2013, up from 652 in 2009. Despite this
growth and relative outreach, the microfinance sector is increasingly fragile. One deposit-taking
MFI, TIAVO, is insolvent because of mismanagement and fraud. This has had a negative impact
on several other MFIs that have deposits at TIAVO or have contributed to its financing. Another
deposit-taking MFI, Boeny, is also facing serious difficulties because of a shortfall of funds as it
did not receive expected government subsidies. There are strong indications that the difficulties
extend beyond these two institutions.

98. The Malagasy insurance market is small and does not cater for the local private sector.
Insurance penetration remains low, mainly because the non-life products are geared for large
corporations and not adapted to suit local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) business
requirements and business constraints. On the microfinance front, the offer of micro-insurance
products, especially for the rural population, is still limited. The regulatory framework for
insurance is outdated and it does not cover micro-insurance activities.

99. Capital markets are also very limited. There is no corporate or municipal debt market in
Madagascar and the fixed income market is limited to short term government securities. As of
today, Madagascar lacks a sovereign rating by any of the three major credit rating agencies. There
are no primary dealers in Madagascar and all investors (excluding foreigners) with a local currency
account can access the primary and secondary government bond market. Secondary market
activity has decreased considerably in recent years and liquidity is limited. Madagascar has no
stock exchange and no derivatives market.

100. Madagascar’s transport sector represents a major constraint for the private sector. The
transport sector has a key role in connecting the domestic markets and to integrate with the rest of
the world. In the early 2000s the government decided to focus its role in policy design and strategy
development and signed a number of concessions for transport services delivery. Regulation and
supervision of the sector was to be delegated to independent agencies. This shift was endorsed by
development partners, who helped the government initiate in-depth institutional reforms and carry
out investments, partly using PPPs. However, the 2009 crisis and the suspension of traditional
donor support that ensued, led to slowing or suspension of the reforms initiated and investments
planned or made. During the crisis period, even minimum repair and maintenance work fell short
due to lack of resources. As a result, half of the secondary roads and two thirds of tertiary roads
are classified to be in “bad condition,” although 88 percent the primary roads were in “good” to
“moderate” condition in 2012 (see Figure 14). The performance of the troubled Air Madagascar,
a de facto monopoly, is also a constraint for business people that need to traverse the large country,
as well as for industries that depend on it, such as tourism.

101. Investments in telecommunications offer opportunities to mitigate the deficiencies of
physical connectivity. Madagascar has improved access to international connectivity with the
arrival of several submarine cables since 2009, and considerable investments have been made in
access infrastructure to increase network coverage.43 Madagascar’s mobile broadband penetration
of 0.4 per 100 inhabitants at end 2013, however, is among the lowest in the world (ITU, 2014).
Basic services like telephony44 are not as widely available in Madagascar as in other countries with
more accessible and affordable voice services.

PROMISING SECTORS FOR GROWTH

that some of the constraints can be relaxed. The following section presents a non-exhaustive list

103. Textile and garment industries are poised for a rebound, with the reinstitution of the AGOA
benefits in 2014 (and if the extension of the Act is approved by the US Congress). Informal
surveys indicate that it takes 1-2 years to start up an operation in these industries. Madagascar’s
abundant and relatively literate workforce is well-suited for these industries. The attractiveness
will be enhanced further with improved productivity of the labor force, better infrastructure such
as roads and electricity, competitive freight costs and streamlined customs clearance. Streamlined
customs processes are particularly important to the textile industry, which is more intensive in
capital than the garments industry. A revival of the textile industry would open scope for vertical
integration between the two industries and higher addition of value in Madagascar, and an avenue
for shared prosperity. It should be noted, however, that an earlier study of these industries (Nicita
2006) found that the benefits from export-led growth had only a small impact on overall poverty
reduction, as they accrued disproportionately to urban and semi-urban residents concentrated
around Antananarivo, who have at least 8 years of education. Many of those who worked in this
sector lost their jobs during the crisis as the firms closed, and quite possibly fell below the poverty

line.45 Nevertheless, the recovery of the sector bodes well for those living in this area with the
right qualifications.

104. Agribusiness, which is distinct from the subsistence farming in which the majority of the
population is engaged, is another area of high potential for Madagascar,46 provided that the
incentive structure can be improved. Agricultural policies in Madagascar often do not serve the
interests of the larger public but rather accommodate the needs of economically powerful and
politically connected businesses. Examples include past efforts to impose minimum export prices
for lychees and vanilla, as well as use of government-supported crop production campaigns to
promote particular types of locally produced fertilizer. Farms are also subjected to extortionary
practices by rent-seeking public officials. Such unfavorable business climate discourages private
investment and starves smaller (and less connected) players of the financing needed to grow and
diversify. In addition, faced with steep entry barriers erected at the urging of economically and
politically powerful entrenched interests, private entrepreneurs have tended to shy away from
agricultural markets in favor of more attractive opportunities elsewhere. Years of underinvestment
have left agricultural markets underdeveloped, non-competitive, and all too often subject to
manipulation by a small number of economically-dominant and politically-connected players.
Other bottlenecks for expansion of the sector and increased productivity include a lack of skills
and knowledge among producers, outdated production technology, inadequate aggregation
capacity, specific rural infrastructure deficiencies, processing technology limitations, ill-equipped
sanitary, agricultural, veterinary and other government services.

105. Policy inconsistencies in the agriculture sector provide disincentives for large scale
private sector investment. Even the well-intentioned policies in agriculture sector tended to
change frequently with changes in political leadership, but with a common feature of reliance on
special initiatives, programs, and projects to provide immediate solutions to pressing crises. Many
special initiatives and programs have been financially unsustainable (the most recent example
being the crop intensification program launched during the 2008 contre saison). Market
participants all along the supply chain frequently express frustration that government policies are
inconsistent and counter-productive. The criticism is heard especially often in the rice sub-sector,
where farmers, processors, and traders say they are discouraged by the unclear and conflicting
messages being transmitted by the government through its statements and through its actions with
regard to the production, importation, and trading of this strategic commodity.

106. Rice policy implementation seems to favor a few large importers at the expense of
smaller traders. The rice market is essentially divided into two, imports and local (domestic)
trade. As in many other African countries, the import sector is dominated by a few politically-
connected companies, but there are also smaller traders that import container loads of rice. The
few large companies dominate the market for imported rice (importing up to 300,000 tons, or 10
percent of total consumption), almost exclusively for urban centers. Some of this trade supplies
government subsidized distribution programs where suppliers are paid full price. Other potential
                                                            
 
45
   Significant shares of the workforce (50, 39 and 42 percent in 1997, 1999 and 2001, respectively) were already
classified to be below the poverty line (Nicita 2006).
46
   Opportunities and constraints for agribusiness are being examined by the analytical work under preparation,
which will be completed during the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) period.


                                                                                                                   56
                                                   


suppliers are excluded from these programs. At the importation level, the formalities appear to
serve only to escalate illegal practices and reduce competition. At the urban rice distribution level,
the government rice subsidy program creates unpredictability and reduces transparency,
discouraging potential importers of rice and diminishing contestability of the market.

107. The resilience of a number of export-oriented agribusinesses and rice markets suggests
that, despite the discussed constraints, agribusiness continues to present opportunities for
Madagascar. First, a substantial number of export-oriented agribusiness value chains have
survived, and/or have developed, during recent years. Madagascar continues to be a major supplier
of vanilla, vanilla extract, cloves, clove oil, lychee, and pepper in world markets, including Fair
Trade and organic niche markets, confirming competitiveness of its agribusiness sector, and
attractiveness for private investment. Second, while the production of rice has suffered from locust
and drought events in recent year, resulting in localized food insecurity, rice markets have
continued to function. Where supplies from rural areas were inadequate, urban demand was met
through private sector imports, including small scale imports, despite policy signals that suggested
government interventions and distortions in the rice market. Therefore, the dynamism in the rice
market could be harnessed and support could be directed to making rice production more profitable
and the rice market more efficient and more accessible by local producers.

108. An increasing number of agricultural value chains are being organized around contract
farming schemes in Madagascar. A growing body of evidence – global and from Madagascar –
points to the effectiveness of contractual relationships in spurring better linkages of small farmers
to agricultural markets. Contract farming spans a wide array of value chains, although it still
concerns only 10 percent of the roughly 2.5 million farms operating in Madagascar. One of the
most studied contract farming schemes in Madagascar is the centralized model developed by the
firm Lecofruit. Today, more than 14,000 farmers from the Central Highlands are involved in the
production of green beans and a number of other vegetables for the export market. The additional
income generated by this off-season production amounts to more than Ariary 400,000 per
contracting household. As with a number of other value chains, more farmers could be included in
this contract farming scheme if two key constraints are addressed, namely: improved road access
to rural communities, and increased capacity to train farmers in specific production techniques (in
the case of Lecofruit, farmers require training on production and quality control, and the use of the
drip irrigation equipment that is supplied by the company).

109. Other agribusiness value chains offer significant potential for the development of
contract farming schemes, both for domestic and export markets. Cotton production in
Antsimo Andrefana has been rebounding since 2013 – following the collapse of the privatized
state enterprise Hasyma in 2009 – with six new private firms collecting and processing the cotton
seeds produced on more than 35,000 ha. The region’s favorable agro-ecological potential for
cotton production, coupled with farmers’ good knowledge of the related agricultural practices
could contribute to the development of a competitive, diversified, and sustainable cotton industry.
Cocoa is another value chain that could offer sizeable growth potential and income generation
possibilities for farmers. But as it stands now, production remains limited – less than 6,500 tons
exported – and lingering issues related to aging cocoa trees, low productivity, decreasing quality,
and illegal exports will have to be tackled for the value chain to reach its full potential. In the
highlands, Artemisia is produced by smallholder farmers, contracted by a company that produces
Artemisinin, used to treat malaria and exported mainly to China. (The company started out with a


                                                                                                   57
                                                                


large production unit but found that it was more efficient to contract out the production to
smallholders.)

110. Agro-food value chains – milk, wheat, barley, various pulses, sesame, garlic, onions,
herbs and potatoes – produced in the central highlands with Antsirabe and Antananarivo as
the main hubs – have potential for growth if the main constraints related to feeder road
maintenance, seed quality and training/human capacity are addressed. The further
development of export value chains on the east coast, with Toamasina as the main hub, will require
addressing constraints related to rural roads, productivity, and aggregation and quality issues.
Addressing key infrastructure bottlenecks could unlock areas with substantial production potential.
Strengthening producer organizations would enhance the quality and volumes of lychees and other
fruits supplied to exporters. For lychee, clove, and vanilla, their medium to long term development
potential and sustainability will be determined by the ability to replace old tree stock with new
plantings. In addition, quality requirements and volume restrictions imposed by regulations and by
industry players require improved value chain coordination, ensuring transparency in building
competitive and inclusive industries.

111. Tourism is one of the promising drivers of growth, supported by Madagascar’s unparalleled
biodiversity. The sector is highly sensitive to political instability, but it has also tended to bounce
back quickly from shocks. The country recorded 196,000 tourist arrivals in 2013, which has not
quite attained the peak of 255,000 reached in 2008, and there is still a large growth potential:
neighboring Mauritius, located only 900 km away and whose surface area is less than 1 percent of
Madagascar, recorded almost a million tourist arrivals in 2013. Tourism offers high direct and
indirect employment opportunities, even in remote areas. Travel and tourism’s total contribution
to GDP is estimated at 15.9 percent in 2013, which is higher than the world (9.5 percent) and
Africa (8.5 percent) averages.47 Direct job creation increased from 18,600 in 2003 to 35,400 in
2013.48 The study on tourism sector (World Bank 2013) identified air transportation, infrastructure
and land allocation as the main constraints for the sector’s development. Growing insecurity and
lack of adequate health and sanitary services in tourist areas are also cited as constraints. Traffic
in rare and precious timber species, which is taking place increasingly in protected areas, will also
act as a deterrent to nature-based tourism.

112. The industrial fisheries sector offers significant growth prospects.       With an exclusive
economic zone covering over 1 million square kilometers, Madagascar is endowed with substantial
marine and coastal resources: hundreds of thousands of hectares of mangroves, coral reefs, inshore
coastal areas and offshore waters. Tuna and billfish fishing licenses sold to foreign vessels yield
an average of US$3.2 million per year. Since 2009, the country developed its own tuna fleet of
currently three long-liners targeting tuna and tuna-like species. Madagascar hosts the third largest
fish processing hub in the Indian Ocean. The industrial fisheries sector suffered from the political
crisis and external shocks, and is adapting to diminishing resources and an increasingly
competitive regional and global environment. Industrial aquaculture is relatively advanced in
Madagascar compared to other countries in the region, and significant room for development

remains. To counter the negative price effects from international competition, the industrial
shrimp aquaculture focuses increasingly on quality. New species such as sea-cucumbers and eels
are candidates for an expanded aquaculture production. Higher levels of regional cooperation will
be necessary to boost Madagascar’s integration in the region’s ocean economy while limiting the
economic and environmental negative effects of intra-regional competition.

113. Extractive industries are very likely to contribute to higher growth in the future. Industrial
mining investments had almost singlehandedly maintained economic growth during the last few
years, and could remain one of the main engines of growth going forward and dominate
Madagascar’s exports by 202549. Mining employs 12,500 people directly, which represents 0.1
percent of national employment. The production at the two world-class industrial projects,
Ambatovy and QMM, has started, and will continue for the next 20 years, and the output will
depend essentially on the international prices of the product, barring serious economic setbacks.
Once the mining companies become profitable (projected around 2021), they will become reliable
sources of corporate income tax revenues for the central government. Mining royalties, estimated
to reach around US$10 million annually from Ambatovy alone, start accruing immediately with
exports, and are distributed to affected local governments (provinces, regions and communes: 70
percent), mining cadaster (21 percent) and the central government (9 percent). The royalties will
make a relatively minor contribution to the central government treasury in the next few years, but
will have a large impact on the affected communities. There are several development challenges
associated with the allocation and spending of these royalties, including how to define the “affected
local governments,” how the funds should be used, and how to ensure transparency and fairness
among local entities. Industrial mining currently has limited linkages with the rest of the economy,
but under a number of scenarios, local procurement could increase from US$200 million today to
US$1 billion and employ, directly and indirectly, up to 65,000 people50. Optimizing these linkages
will require close engagement of both the government and the private sector.

4.2           Opportunities and recommendations

114. Private sector could play a larger role in prioritizing policy reforms and improving
investment climate through an effective platform for dialogue with the government. A
credible public-private dialogue platform could help identify comprehensively the challenges and
prioritize actions and reduce a mismatch between private sector needs and what the government
identifies as the priorities. The government has recently taken two actions to address this issue.
First, it adopted a decree that sets forth a Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) platform51 with the
mandate to facilitate a constructive dialogue between the government and the business community.
Second, a Doing Business reform memorandum that traces a set of short, medium and long term
action plan of reform agenda has been drawn. Examples of possible initiatives include: (i)
enhancing transparency for prioritizing implementation of economy-wide quick wins reforms and
addressing anti-competitive behaviors in some industries, coupled with targeted policies to
promote FDI inflows, (ii) strengthening the PPD platform by defining a transparent process of

validating and selecting priorities, improving the analysis and implementation of the identified
issues (i.e. Doing Business issues, tourism, investment regulation, etc.), setting up an impact
evaluation and communication campaign for the PPD, and (iii) streamlining commercial justice
procedures, process mapping and administrative efficiency analysis to improve efficiency, fairness
and transparency of the legal, regulatory and judiciary environment for business.

115. Improving corporate governance is also indispensable in nurturing a dynamic private
sector in Madagascar. Enterprises, both state-owned and private, should be run efficiently to
maximize the value for shareholders, and for this purpose, their managers must be held
accountable. The performance of enterprises should be judged periodically using an agreed set of
metrics, and to this end, audited financial accounts should be published annually and discussed by
the board of directors, who should be selected according to their qualifications. These accounts
would also be used for verifying compliance with tax and other legal obligations of the companies.
The exercise carried out in South Africa52 to improve corporate governance may serve as a model.
In Madagascar, the banking sector may be a good candidate for an entry point to infuse ‘best
practice’ in private sector enterprises, as it has already an established supervisor, the Commission
Supervision Bancaire et Financière, and also has a reputation for being a well-run sector.

116. Addressing      constraints to accessing electricity, finance and transportation
infrastructure will be key for private sector development. The constraints identified by the
private sector, such as those reported by the Enterprise Surveys, should be addressed as a priority.
The 2012 survey reported the main constraints as political instability, access to electricity, crime,
theft and disorder, tax rates and administration, access to finance and corruption. Transportation
comes in slightly behind them. This section concentrates on access to electricity, finance and
transportation, as the other issues are discussed in detail in the previous chapter.

Electricity

117. Addressing performance issues at JIRAMA should be the most immediate concern to
improve access to electricity. There are immediate actions which could start alleviating the worst
of the bottlenecks in accessing electricity while other challenges can only be addressed over a
medium term. The most immediate action is to start running JIRAMA more professionally, by
stopping the theft of subsidized fuel, reviewing policies for providing preferential electricity rates
to employees and selected customers and publishing the audited financial statements of the
company as required by the law. Bringing in private sector expertise could help in this regard.
Necessary work to elaborate a medium term business plan for the company as well as a cost-
effective electricity sector development plan should also start right away. The business plan should
include a socially and politically acceptable tariff adjustment mechanism, an incentive structure
for the employees to provide best service to fee-paying customers, as well as technical plans to
widen access to electricity sustainably.

Access to Finance

118. Increasing financial intermediation will need a combination of supply side measures –
promoting competition and product innovation; demand side measures – improving firms’
business plans; as well as financial system improvements – credit bureau, collateral
registries. Barriers to access credit could be lowered by promoting competition and product
innovation on the supply side, and by supporting micro and SMEs’ preparation of financially
viable business plans on the demand side. Product development and training at local institutions
to create awareness and competition are crucial. The absence of a functioning credit bureau
inhibits access to finance by preventing SMEs and individuals from creating a credit history.
Similarly, the absence of a collateral registry further inhibits access to credit. Institutional
strengthening and a fair/transparent judicial system will be needed. Similarly, legal, administration
and taxation amendments to allow companies to regroup under holding company structures with
the inherent fiscal advantages would be critical to creating corporate value for long term equity
and debt financing.

119. Increasing access to finance, primarily for SMEs and individuals, will require enhancing
the use of alternative payment services and improving financial literacy. Wider access to
financial services can contribute to inclusive growth. Enhancing the use of alternative payment
services such as mobile phones can improve access to finance and facilitate the implementation of
social protection programs and possibly automatization of government’s transfers. Creditor and
debtor rights should be adequately protected through a consumer protection framework. Financial
education and literacy also remain a challenge, with a large part of the population lacking the
knowledge and skills to safely use financial services for saving, borrowing, making payments, and
managing risk.

120. The regulatory framework for the stability of the financial sector may have been
adequate so far, but would require a major upgrading if it were to play a critical role in
supporting economic growth. Although the existing legal and regulatory framework is
considered acceptable, implementation, supervision and enforcement of prudential standards are
weak, as demonstrated by the recent episodes in the microfinance sector. Prudential rules
governing the banking sector are outdated and in their current form will act as a major constraint
on banking sector growth. There is scope and rationale for strengthening the supervising entity,
Commission de Supervision Bancaire et Financière (CSBF). The banking sector association
(Association Professionelle des Banques) and local independent non-executive directors on the
boards of banks have also a role to play in ensuring sustainability and adequate skills of local
middle management. The regulatory framework governing insurance needs updating; micro
insurance practices are not regulated and supervised; the overall supervisory capacity of the
insurance sector at the Ministry of Finance and Budget (MFB) remains limited.

Transportation

121. Improvements in the transportation sector should include clear and transparent
management of the sector, adhering to commitments made and the establishment of an
effective monitoring system. There are three important components for improving the country’s
transportation service. First is a clear and transparent management of the sector, which should be



                                                                                                  61
                                                   


accomplished by clarifying the roles of all stakeholders including ministries, regulatory agencies,
implementing agencies, concessionaires and licensing authorities, private sector and the users.
Second is for all stakeholders to respect the financial and operational commitments made. Third
is the establishment of an effective monitoring system, in which the administration is no longer an
all-powerful authority wielding arbitrary decisions, but one that clarifies and respects the rules of
the game, accounting for its management to citizens. In parallel, the public and users must have a
say in the management of the assets and public funds through existing channels.

122. In the short term, the government will face tradeoffs between maintenance,
rehabilitation and investment of transport infrastructure. Short term recommendations
include preparing a costed plan to reduce the large deficit in the maintenance of all transportation
infrastructures and launching an inventory exercise of the current state of the assets of the
transportation infrastructure with an estimated value. These actions are prerequisites for
prioritizing among the competing needs for maintenance, rehabilitation and investment in
transportation infrastructure.

123. In the medium term, the government should update the National Transportation Policy
and prepare a medium term investment plan that informs the Priority Investments Plan and
helps the country allocate scarce resources to prioritized projects. In the medium term, the
National Transportation Policy (NTP) should be updated based on developments in the industry
over the last decade and on the basis of the visions for the future of the sector, essentially based
on the projected increase in traffic due to the expected increase in trade between Madagascar and
the rest of the world, leading to more substantial carrying capacity and/or major renovations in all
the transportation sub-sectors and the investments to support this extension. The government's
vision for each sub-sector of transportation should be more specific to address their different
challenges. Based on the updated National Transportation policy (NTP), a medium term
investment program (5 years) should be prepared. It is crucial for the government to clarify how
it intends to allocate scarce resources, so that they are actually allocated to priority needs. For
each large scale project estimates for the costs of initial investments as well as the future
maintenance needs, and the benefits to be derived from realizing the project should be provided
for prioritization purposes. This cost benefit analysis role is one of the areas where capacity
reinforcement is needed. The transport sector’s medium term investment program would be a
critical component in the country’s rolling multiannual Priority Investments Plan (PIP), which in
turn would determine the allocation for public investments in the annual government budget, and
potential opportunities for public-private partnerships.

124. Beyond the above three priority areas, complementary public investments will be
required to act as a catalyst for new private investment in agribusiness value chains, air
transportation and biodiversity-based tourism. For example, public investments in value
chains are needed to unlock the agribusiness potential. Tourism sector is particularly dependent
on reliable airline service, for both international and domestic travel. Regional and strategic
partnerships are promising avenues for overcoming some of the constraints facing the air transport
subsector. The air transport subsector itself has potential for new private investments if some of
the constraints are relaxed. Harnessing the value of biodiversity through tourism can be enhanced
through unlocking carbon finance, particularly when linked to sustainable forest management.
Poverty driven deforestation means that actions to reduce emissions through avoided deforestation
are extremely cheap compared to other emission reduction options available globally. Madagascar

has developed a series of important pilots throughout the country and has already concluded a
number of carbon credit transactions with foreign governments and private firms. This is the tip
of the carbon revenue potential.

Chapter 5. Aiming for higher human capital 	
Summary:

   Labor productivity in manufacturing is lower in Madagascar than in many comparator
    countries. The low productivity decreases the country’s cost advantage arising from low
    wages.
   The low productivity is partly due to low and stagnant educational attainment of the labor
    force and poor health development outcomes.
   Public spending on education has declined as government resources dwindled and out-of-
    pocket expenditures have increased as a share of household expenditures. Madagascar’s
    education system is not yet able to provide education for all children, and does not seem to
    prepare those in school for the labor market. Financing challenges must be overcome to
    improve access to and the quality of the education system.
   Nutrition and health are key drivers of educational attainment and productivity and
    Madagascar is doing poorly on both. Government allocations to health and nutrition seem
    inadequate and have declined since the crisis. The Malagasy health system is failing most of
    the population, especially the poor.
   To improve development outcomes in health and education, the government will need to
    improve the efficiency of public spending given the limited fiscal space going forward as well
    as strengthen human resources management. Renewed focus on nutrition is essential because
    of the multiple impacts on health, education and productivity

125. Low productivity undermines the country’s cost advantage arising from low wages.
Labor productivity in manufacturing is lower in Madagascar than in many comparator countries.
Systematic data on labor productivity are not available, but according to the Enterprise Surveys,
the labor productivity in the manufacturing sector is lower in Madagascar than in comparator
countries (see Figure 31).

126. Low labor productivity decreases the country’s cost advantage arising from low wages.
Competitiveness of wage levels can be assessed by comparing wage levels with value added per
worker. The indicator of real wage cost to the firm is a measure of unit labor cost which measures
labor compensation as a ratio of labor productivity. The lower this ratio is, the lower the real cost
of labor to the firm. The ratio of the minimum wage of the typical worker to the value added per
worker (average value added per worker in the retail sector) is 0.74 in Madagascar, 0.51 in South
Africa and 1.21 in Zambia.

127. The low productivity is partly due to low and stagnant educational attainment53 of the
labor force in Madagascar, which has been losing ground compared with the rest of the world (see
Figure 33). Further, the last 10-15 years have witnessed a rapid drop on education outcomes,
which means that those leaving school may not be equipped with basic and other level skills
required by the economy. Analysis of PASEC54 results indicates that between 1998 and 2012, the
national average in French scores (grade 5) has dropped 16 percentage points and the math score
(grade 5) by 19 percentage points, with Madagascar being the worst performer in French language
among all participating countries in PASEC 2012.

128. Madagascar’s education system is not yet capable of providing education for all
children. Before the onset of the crisis in 2009, Madagascar was making good progress in
expanding school enrolment (see Figure 35) and enrollment in primary education was relatively
high. However, the financial impact of the crisis along with the pace of population growth made
it impossible for the system to keep the pace of expansion. The gross enrollment rate for primary
dropped from 157 percent in 2008/09 to 144 percent in 2013/14, equivalent to a 13 percentage
point drop. The attendance rate of children aged 6 to 14 years has also receded strongly over the
2005-12 period, from 77 percent to 74 percent in 2010 and 69 percent in 2012. Between 2005 and
2010, the drop was most apparent for primary school-aged children (aged 6 to 10 years), for whom
the rate was reduced by 4.6 percentage points, against 1.2 percentage points for children aged 11
to 14 years. The drop in attendance rates has been unequal, especially affecting rural zones and
the southern regions, and, with the greatest reductions and levels of exclusion being observed in

129. The education system in Madagascar seems to be failing to prepare students for both
the formal and informal sectors of the economy. A large number of children are out-school,
and thus have no access to formal skills development. Quality of learning outcomes has
deteriorated and thus even those who complete basic education may enter the labor market with
lack of functional skills to allow them to either be self-employed or improve their livelihoods in
the informal sector. For those moving up in the education ladder, i.e. the less poor, education may
not be providing them with appropriate skills for the labor market, as there is limited technical and
vocational training on offer, and higher education is mostly focused on the social sciences, for
example, in 2011, 43 percent of students were enrolled in departments of law, management or
social science, preparing them for work in the tertiary sector, whereas subjects where shortages of
skills are observed, such as agriculture, teaching, engineering, health and science, attract small
shares of enrollment.

130. Public spending on education has declined as government resources dwindled and out-
of-pocket expenditures have increased as a share of household expenditures. The crisis
caused a decline in education spending, both from the government side as its revenues dwindled
and aid was suspended, and from the household side. In terms of public spending, primary
education receives more than half of the overall education budget including salaries but excluding
investment. Between 2011 and 2013, the share of primary education in terms of current
expenditure was nearly 55 percent on average and the shares for lower and upper secondary
education was 7.2 percent and 18.2 percent respectively. Out of pocket expenditures of the
households have increased substantially from 2.1 percent of the household’s budget in 2005 to 3.5
percent in 2012. Moreover, households finance 19 percent and 30 percent of total expenditure for
primary and junior secondary schools respectively. Most of these funds are used to finance
community hired teachers which constitute around 80 percent of the teaching force.

131. Education opportunities are unequal and poor children have little to no access to higher
education. Spending in primary education is still pro-poor. Spending on lower secondary
education is reasonably equal and spending on higher education benefits primarily the richer
segments of the population. Higher education is not accessible for anybody under the fourth
quintile, and—recalling that the poverty threshold is into the fourth quintile in Madagascar—this
means that almost none of the poor can access universities (only 1.3 percent of students are from
the poorest quintile in 2012). As Figure 37 indicates, a visual comparison of the 2005 and 2010
data shows increasing inequalities at the secondary level, and this inequality is most apparent in
2012, suggesting that the number of school dropouts in teenage years has increased among the
poor.55

132. Improving access to and the quality of the education system will pose financing
challenges. Improving access, quality and equity requires an allocation of resources that considers
the specific geographical and population characteristics of the various regions and the need to
improve education inputs such as the quality of teachers and the learning environment. Currently,
a large share of the budget is allocated to salaries and does not include the salaries of the
community teachers, which account for 80 percent of the teaching force (see Figure 38). A
dominant factor for this decline is the massive increase in the number of community teachers, who
tend to be poorly qualified. In 2011-12, it is estimated that over 90 percent of community teachers
had no teaching certificate. Transforming these teachers into civil servants will decrease
household’s out-of-pocket expenditures but will challenge the financial sustainability of a system
which is already financially constraint.




                                                                                                     69
                                                                     


             Box 3. The Impact of the Regularization of Community Teachers as Civil Servants

    Recent political decisions in the sector include the gradual integration of community teachers in the civil service. Projections
    for 2020 show that the number of teachers would reach 96,100 for an expected 5.2 million children in primary school. It
    translates into the recruitment of an additional 68,000 civil servants compared with 2014. An analysis of the potential impact
    of this decision on public spending on education is presented below. The evolution of the macroeconomic context was
    simulated using two different scenarios, in line with the recent scenarios elaborated by the IMF. In addition, the analysis
    examined two different hypotheses for integrating community teachers in the civil service.
       Hypothesis 1: all community teachers are integrated in the civil service as early as 2016, and new teachers are hired as civil
        servants.
       Hypothesis 2: community teachers are gradually integrated in the civil service to ensure that all teachers are civil servants
        by 2020. More specifically, this hypothesis assumes the integration of 10,000   community teachers in 2016, 15,000 in
        2017, 15,000 in 2018, 16,000 in 2019 and 16,960 in 2020.

    The results of projections show that Hypothesis 1 is unsustainable even in the most favorable macroeconomic scenario.
    Indeed, from 2016 onwards, the salary needs for primary schools would amount to 550 billion MGA, or 16 percent of total
    government revenue projection for 2016, and 10 times larger than the current amount allocated to community teachers’
    subsidies.
    In the case of Hypothesis 2, the results of projections show that the    Simulating the impact of the integration of community
    integration of 10,000 community teachers in 2016 and as many in                                 teachers
    2017 would result in salary costs equivalent to about 300 billion
    Ar in 2016 and as much as 350 billion Ar in 2017. This compares
    with 286 billion Ar and 318 billion Ar projected for salary costs in
    2016 and 2017, respectively. Neither hypothesis seems
    sustainable even in the favorable economic growth scenario, and
    completely unrealistic in case of a slower economic growth.

    The results of these simulations show that the integration of
    community teachers as planned will have large and unsustainable
    consequences for the State budget. To improve its feasibility, it
    would seem essential to envisage the following options: (i)
    dramatically slow down the process of integration; and/or (ii)
    allocate more resources to salary for primary education. The
    second option should be assessed in the current context that
    already allocates a high weight to salaries and to primary
    education in the education sector spending.

    The implication is that interventions aiming at improving the quality of education, such as the improvement of infrastructure,
    teacher training and the improvement of the availability of learning material would need to be cut back as a consequence.
 

133. Health outcomes remain poor and in many areas progress has stalled over the past ten
years. The health and nutrition sectors suffered from lack of financing, inequitable service
delivery and poor quality of service. In addition to the overall health financing budget being low,
current health expenditure is highly inequitable. While there have been some gains in the reduction
of overall child mortality prior to 2009, the infant mortality rate stagnated at the national level
since 2007 (62 per 1,000 live births in 2012). Prevalence of long term (chronic) malnutrition
among children under five is one of the highest in the world: 53 percent are stunted (short for their
age) and 5.8 percent are wasted (too thin for their height). Over the past few years the rates of
acute malnutrition have risen by over 50 percent in some of the most food insecure regions in the
southeast, southwest, and central parts of the country. Maternal mortality ratios have also
remained relatively high and stagnant over the last ten years: from 469 per 100,000 live births in
2003 to 500 per 100,000 live births in 2013 (Figure 39). Looking at specific outcomes such as
child mortality, the bottom 40% of the population, bears most of the burden. Similarly, key service

delivery indicators such as skilled birth attendance are 40% lower among the poorest two quintiles
as compared to the richest quintile further highlighting the equity issues in accessing and utilizing
care. HIV/AIDS and STDs are high among at-risk populations and vulnerable populations.

134. Nutrition and health are key drivers of productivity and poor development outcomes
affect the work force’s productivity. One of the most worrying statistics in Madagascar is the
prevalence of stunting among young children due to chronic malnutrition, which is the sixth
highest in the world: 53 percent of all children 0-5 are stunted and 22 percent are severely stunted.
Growth retardation, which starts earlier in Madagascar compared to other countries, is largely
irreversible after the age of two and has long term costs in terms of educational attainment and
productivity as an adult because of poor cognitive development, delayed psychomotor
development, poor fine motor skills, and altered behavior. Children who do not reach their full
development potential at an early age are more likely to do poorly in school: for every 10 percent
increase in stunting, the proportion of children reaching the final grade of primary school drops by
7.9 percent.

135. In addition, Madagascar’s school children and communities in the poorest regions carry
the highest burden of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in the country. NTDs are responsible
for absenteeism from school, and as many poor households are malnourished, NTDs and other
illnesses further impact the child’s ability to concentrate and learn. With regards to the adult
population, workers in Madagascar suffer from a number of illnesses that lower their overall
productivity. While Madagascar does not currently have a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, trends
among high-risk groups are concerning and would be detrimental to the country’s overall
productivity should there be a more generalized epidemic (as experienced by other Southern
African countries).

136. Government allocations to health and nutrition seem inadequate and have declined since
the crisis. Despite the inextricable links of health and nutrition to education and longer term
productivity, both the nutrition and health sectors are not prioritized in Government spending.
Madagascar spends less on health than most other low income countries in Sub Saharan Africa
(SSA). Since 1995, the percentage of total Health Expenditure in GDP has remained around 4-5


                                                                                                  71
                                                                                   


      percent with a slight downward trend in recent years. In real terms, per capita expenditure has not
      changed since 1995. Between 1995 and 1999, total health expenditure per capita was US$21 in
      the period between 2010 and 2014 it was US$20. This is far below the regional average of
      US$8456. Unlike the education sector, the health sector is only 20 percent financed by domestic
      Government resources, far lower than other sectors in the country. Such a high amount of external
      funding poses serious challenges to the sector in terms of financing predictability, efficiency and
      sustainability. Recent severe cuts to the National Nutrition Office’s (ONN) budget with most of
      the resource envelope going to central salaries is posing real challenges to realizing the multi-
      sector coordination mandate of the National Nutrition Office’s (ONN) and to the implementation
      of the country’s National Community Nutrition Program which has been built over a 25 years
      period and is considered a global good practice in delivering crucial nutrition services to
      pregnant/lactating women and children under five across all quintiles.

      137. The Malagasy health system is failing most of the population, especially the poor.
      Madagascar’s epidemiological profile remains comparable to many low-income countries with a
      high communicable disease burden. Almost 30 percent of all deaths in Madagascar are still
      attributable to preventable and infectious and parasitic diseases, with the burden of disease falling
      disproportionately on the poor. Over the past decade, non-communicable diseases are increasing
      in the population, resulting in a dual burden of disease which will tax an already fragile health
      system. Overall, utilization of services is unevenly distributed across locations and is marked by
      substantial income/wealth inequality (Figure 40). Coverage of essential health services is low and
      immunization coverage has also decreased in recent years. Immunization is a proxy indicator of
      the availability of primary health care in a country, and this has declined from 62 percent in 2008
      to 33 percent in 2012 in some of the poorest regions (Figure 41). The country is also seeing a rise
      in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in recent years which will put an additional strain on the
      health system.

                            138. Health expenditure is highly inequitable in Madagascar. Over eighty percent of health
                            financing comes from external aid both channeled through the sector and by vertical funds.
                            Overall, health expenditures are negatively correlated to poverty rates and positively correlated
                            with per capita consumption – even when restricting expenditures to primary health care, regional
                            distribution is regressive. The Benefit Incidence Analysis for MOH non-wage expenditures
                            reveals that benefits are found to be regressive with the average benefits going to individuals in
                            the richest quintile two to four times higher than those going to individuals in the poorest two
                            quintiles. Distribution of benefits from all MOH expenditures directed to primary health and
                            hospital care is pro-rich with the richest quintile benefiting from 40 percent of total expenditures.
                            Similarly, analysis of expenditure shares by type of residence show that less than five percent goes
                            to rural communes. Considering that approximately two-thirds of the population lives in rural
                            areas, this represents a highly unequal distribution of expenditure shares.

                            139. Health care in Madagascar is both expensive and non-accessible to the poor. Household
                            out–of-pocket health expenditures are high and increasing in Madagascar with the cost of most
                            medical consumables borne by the patient through cost recovery. Yet, percentages of catastrophic
                            expenditures in the poorest quintiles are very low (Figure 42). In the context of Madagascar, which
                            has also has low total health expenditure per capita this is indicative of the low health seeking
                            behavior among the poor. Indeed, the latest household survey (2012) indicates that close to 70
                            percent of the population does not seek care when ill. Catastrophic expenditures may cause 4.5
                            percent of people in the richest quintile to fall below the poverty line (and keeps those already in
                            poverty poor).

                            140. Geographic access to health service is also a challenge, as numerous communities are
                            seasonally isolated for months at a time. Even those communities with a health center suffer
                            during the rainy season, since referrals to hospitals are impossible, replenishment of drugs is
                            slower, and supervisory visits are virtually non-existent. Geographic access is of particular
                            importance to maternal mortality and morbidity outcomes, where Madagascar fares poorly. Prior
                            to the crisis, the World Health Organization reported that only 60 percent of the Malagasy


                                                                                                                                                                        73
                                                      


population had access to health facilities. By 2013, approximately 856 primary health care
facilities had closed down due to the impacts of the crisis, which has led to an increased workload
in the health facilities that continue to function. The number of people served by a health facility
has gone down by nearly 47 percent in rural areas. In addition, nearly 78 percent do not have the
ability to transport patients to hospitals for further treatment.

141. The persistently high total fertility rate and population growth rates (4.6 births per
woman and 2.8 percent growth respectively) indicate that further action is needed in this
area. Significant variations by location and income quintiles exist. For example, the total fertility
rate for rural areas is almost double that of the capital - 5.2 versus 2.7 while that for the poorest
quintile is 2.5 times that of the richest. The percentage of adolescents having given birth is almost
4 times higher for the poorest quintile than for the richest. Not surprisingly, the contraceptive
prevalence rate (modern methods) for the richest quintile is double that of the poorest and the
unmet need for contraception is 41 percent higher for the poorest quintile than the richest. While
there has been a significant increase in the utilization of family planning (from 18 percent in
2003/04 to 29 percent in 2008/09), the significant unmet need and the inequitable availability of
family planning services – as well as the non-health related implications of continued high
population growth highlighted above – suggest that this issue deserves increased attention.

142.  Lack of access to potable water is a determinant in the health status of the Malagasy.
Madagascar ranks among the countries with the lowest access rate to drinking water and sanitation,
well below Sub-Saharan Africa average despite recent progress in improving access to potable
water, which increased from 29 percent to 46 percent between 2000 and 2012 (see Figure 44),
although the progress falls short of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) target of 68
percent by 2015. Disparities exist between regions. In rural areas, access to potable water
increased by 20 percent between 2000 and 2012, as a result of support from development partners
who mainly focused their interventions in rural areas. On the other hand, access in urban areas
has progressively declined since 2005 due mainly to lack of rehabilitation/extension works and
proper maintenance of existing infrastructure. Regarding sanitation, the access rate was 46 percent
in 2012, also far from the MDG target of 54 percent by 2015. There are disparities between
highland and coastal regions.

143. Poor access to drinking water and sanitation facilities has a negative impact on public
health, education, poverty as well as the environment. In Madagascar, diarrheal diseases are
the second leading cause of death after malaria and affect 51 percent of children under 5 years.
Practice of hand washing with soap will result in reducing risks to contract diarrheal diseases by
44 percent and access to sanitation facilities will also diminish these risks by 32 percent. The
number of school days lost per year due to these diseases is estimated at 3.5 million, and the
number of work days lost by population per year due to the lack of access to water and sanitation-
related diseases is estimated at 5 million (Source: UNICEF). On the environmental side, open
defecation and proximity between unimproved latrines and wells increase the risk of
contamination of water sources (groundwater, rivers, lakes, etc.).

144. Indoor air pollution caused predominantly by solid fuel use has the potential for
substantial effects on human health and economic development. Burning solid fuels (i.e.
charcoal and fuelwood) for cooking produces extremely high levels of household air pollution.
Average concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM10) in homes using biomass fuels typically
range from 300 to 3,000 g/m3, with peaks during cooking as high as 10,000 g/m3. By
comparison the European Union standard for average annual PM10 levels is 40g/m3. Elevated
levels of indoor air pollution have been proven to increase the risk of several life threatening
illnesses including pneumonia and other acute lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease; these diseases are particularly prevalent in children and women over 30
respectively, two vulnerable groups from a public health point of view. There is also evidence of
associations between indoor air pollution and lung cancer, asthma, cataracts, tuberculosis and
adverse pregnancy outcomes. Madagascar’s burden of death and sickness due to indoor air
pollution is comparable to the one for diarrheal disease and tuberculosis; an estimated 5.3 percent
of the burden of disease is attributable to solid fuel use. With more than 90 percent of the
population in Madagascar using solid fuel, the burden of ill health stands at nearly 12,000 deaths
per year, of which 10,000 per year are children under the age of five, and 40 percent of respiratory
infections are thought to be linked to indoor air pollution.

145. There is no social safety net system to support basic consumption and human needs as
well as productive development of the poorest of the poor. Development Partners and CSOs
support a variety of programs, ranging from food assistance and training to cash-for-work
programs, often responding to disasters. While these more emergency related interventions are
important given the country’s high level of extreme poverty, they have failed to develop a systemic
approach to address the short and longer term causes of extreme poverty. In moving toward a more
development focused safety net approach, a collaborative effort by government and development
partners is needed to identify the poorest according to a set of objective criteria, and combine
income support with livelihood and human capital development, thus establishing a basic safety
net to enable the poorest of the poor to access basic services and participate in opportunities for
enhanced livelihood. The new Ministry of Population, Social Protection, and Promotion of
Women has started to fill this gap by leading a participatory process to develop the country’s first
Social Protection Strategy. This process is inspired and informed by successful experiences of
other poor countries, such as Ethiopia and Rwanda (for the design of Productive Safety Nets) and
Senegal, Niger, Brazil and others (for the design of Human Capital Safety Nets), in establishing
country wide, targeted programs for the extreme poor (see box 4).

                                    Box 4: A path to a first system of social protection

 Several countries in the Africa region are establishing safety net programs that provide cash transfers for the poorest of
 the poor while also improving the beneficiaries’ access to human development basic services such as education, health,
 nutrition and early childhood development. Others are also exploring how to engage the poorest in community works
 that can not only provide them with a minimum income but also improve the land productivity and climate change
 resilience in their area. An example of such program is Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) which has
 made a significant contribution to increasing food security in Ethiopia over the past ten years. The PSNP provides food
 and/or cash to chronically vulnerable households during the predictable annual lean season in exchange for their labor on
 communal projects that address the underlying causes of vulnerability and food insecurity. As a consequence, the food
 security of PSNP beneficiaries has increased from 8.4 months per year in 2006 to 10.1 months per year in 2012 on
 average.

 For the past year, Madagascar has piloted a cash transfer program that is conditional on children’s attendance to primary
 school and that encourages mothers’ participation in local educational programs on nutrition. Initial results of the pilot
 covering 5000 families indicate that school attendance is at 98%, with cash transfers enabling families to cover a share
 of the out-of-pocket costs associated with sending their children to school regularly. On the basis of these positive results,
 the pilot will be expanded to cover 32,000 families within a year and will be subject to a rigorous impact evaluation that
 will include an assessment of the families’ nutritional improvements as well as behavioral changes of parents and
 children.

 Madagascar is also attempting to support the poorest in rural areas that do not have access to land and thus hardly benefit
 from the Government’s programs aiming at improving agricultural productivity (e.g. irrigation for rice production).
 Through a multi-year cash-for-work program – following the Ethiopian and Rwandan models –, the poorest would
 undertake small work activities identified through a micro-regional landscape development plan designed jointly by the
 authorities and the communities that would aim to improve land productivity and limit land degradation (e.g.,
 reforestation of watershed areas, terracing, building and maintenance of small dams and canals). This “productive” safety
 net program would provide a minimum cash income for almost 30,000 poorest households, with the landscape
 enhancements of micro-regions benefiting their entire communities.

 The sustainability of such programs will depend not only on its proven positive results but on increased tax revenues and
 additional donor support. 


5.2. Opportunities and recommendations

146. Improving access, quality, and equity in education and health in Madagascar is essential
for increased labor productivity. This will entail improving the efficiency of the systems along
with the implementation of short to medium term pro-poor policies and interventions within a
context of limited fiscal envelopes and financial sustainability.

147. Improving access to education involves pro-poor measures to reduce the number of out-
of-school children and to allow the poor to move up in the education ladder. International
experience has shown that education conditional cash transfers have an impact on school
attendance while improving local economies. If targeted to the poorest communities, such as those
in the southern areas of the country, such a program could reduce the number of out-of-school
children while allowing a transfer of resources to the poorest local economies of the country.
Conditional cash transfers linked to secondary education, aligned with a pro-poor secondary school
grant system, could also offer an opportunity for poor children to move in the education system,
and thus have greater access to wage employment. For those children who are out-of-school and



                                                                                                                       76
                                                     


lost from the system, second chance education programs would be an option. If well aligned with
the skills needs of micro and small enterprises, and if supported by micro-credit programs and
internships, second chance education programs could have a strong impact on labor productivity
and improvement of livelihoods of the poor.

148. Improving learning outcomes will require better equipped teachers. Investment on pre-
and in-service teacher training will be required to improve learning outcomes in Madagascar.
Assessment exercises clearly indicate that students perform the worst in schools where teachers
have very few if any qualifications. Teacher training programs need to be customized to the
characteristics of the Malagasy teaching force and need to take into account the limited teaching
inputs of the system. Further, given the fact that 80 percent of Malagasy teachers are community
teachers, training programs need to target this group, and can be used as a mechanism to support
the integration of these teachers in the system.

149. Improving distribution of qualified teachers in a financially sustainable manner would
have an impact on equity and quality of education. Evidence indicates that poor communities
are those with less qualified teachers; further, poor communities out-of-pocket expenditure in
education is very much linked to payment of community teachers. An improved distribution of
qualified teachers in the country would have an impact on learning outcomes, especially, if
accompanied by a progressive program of integration of trained community teachers in the system.
This would also free resources from poor families and potentially have an impact on access to
education, as well. However, the integration of community teachers in the wage bill threatens the
financial sustainability of the system. Thus, an integration program will need to focus on the
medium term, include an appropriate teacher career path, linking qualifications and training with
integration in civil service, and target initially the most deprived and poor areas of the country.

150. Policies and interventions to reduce out-of-pocket expenditure on health can have a
strong impact on health outcomes in Madagascar. Such policies and interventions would
involve prioritizing and investing in functionality of first level rural health facilities, removing out-
of-pocket costs for services at the facility level, especially for the poorest communities, and at the
lowest facility level, and financing outreach activities and approaches in rural areas. Conditional
cash transfers could also be considered – conditionality could be linked to education and health.

151. Better qualified and distributed health personnel is essential for improved health
outcomes. This entails a review of existing policies and training of health personnel.
Strengthening primary and community mechanisms and deploying community health workers, can
promote resilience in service delivery. Training programs for health workers and better supported
health workers networks would allow for improved performance of these health actors.

152. The use of results-based financing in the health sector in Madagascar would have an
impact on the availability of resources at the facility level. International experience has shown
that such type of financing improves the system efficiency and quality of outcomes. This is so as
it improves the distribution chain, allowing health inputs to reach the local level, while stimulating
health practices of high impact such as immunization.

153. A renewed focus on nutrition is essential because of the multiple impacts on health,
education and productivity. A way forward would be to scale up a package of interventions that


                                                                                                      77
                                                                


tackle stunting. Estimates of the impact of these programs indicate that they have a benefit to cost
ratio of about 10, which compares favorably to other interventions.

154. Policies to improve water and sanitation will be required if health outcomes are to
improve. Access to water and latrines in schools, along with the development of behaviors around
washing hands are interventions to be considered. Urban development interventions need to
include sanitation related ones.

155. The promotion of cleaner cooking solutions, particularly in urban areas, is key to reduce
the burden of disease from indoor air pollution. Recent research points to the comparative
advantage of ethanol when compared to improved charcoal cookstoves from a household air
pollution point of view. Building on an initiative to monitor household air pollution in two towns
in Madagascar, with a stratified sample of 154 and 184 households, Dasgupta et al. (2013)57
investigated the effects of various factors, including fuel (charcoal, wood, and ethanol), stove type
(traditional and improved ethanol), kitchen size, ventilation, building materials, and ambient
environment. Judging by its comparatively lower production of fine particulate matter and carbon
monoxide, ethanol is significantly cleaner than biomass fuels. Compared with traditional charcoal
stoves, improved charcoal stoves were found to yield no significant improvements in air quality,
although the improved wood stove with a chimney was effective in reducing concentrations of
carbon monoxide in the kitchen, as was ventilation.

Chapter 6. Tackling poverty – improving the lives of the rural poor
Summary:

     The lack of progress in reducing extreme poverty in Madagascar is to a large extent due to the
      failure to improve the lives of the rural poor, a vast majority of whom work in agriculture or
      the informal sector. Eighty percent of people engaged in agriculture are poor compared to
      about 25 percent and 38 percent in the public and textiles sectors. Unemployment is low, since
      the poor cannot afford to be unemployed, but around 80 percent of the workforce is
      underemployed.
     Agricultural productivity is low in Madagascar and has been falling in the past 50 years. Low
      agricultural productivity can be attributed to limited use of improved technologies and weak
      extension services, limited availability and high costs of improved inputs, limited access to
      credit, deficient infrastructure, lack of land tenure security, soil degradation as well as a weak
      human capital base. High transport costs hinder access to markets and provide disincentives
      for investments.
     To improve agricultural productivity, efforts will be needed to improve rural infrastructure,
      enhance land tenure security, increase human capital of the poor, strengthen provision of
      extension services and increase access to improved inputs (fertilizer, seeds) and credit.
     Madagascar is one of the most climate vulnerable in the world and risks are likely to increase
      in the future. The poor are often the worst impacted by natural hazards because they have less
      ability to cope efficiently with the negative social and economic impacts on their lives.
     Poverty in Madagascar is closely linked to environmental degradation. The regions with
      highest poverty incidence and low productivity are also those with most acute environmental
      and land degradation. Degrading lands are often a consequence of poverty-driven short-
      sighted land management decisions, including deforestation and over-tilling of soils.
      Community-based natural resources management can be a pathway out of poverty, although
      the evidence so far is mixed, particularly in terms of reducing deforestation. Going forward,
      it will be important to revise the legal and regulatory framework for community based natural
      resources management.
     A better definition of the roles and mandates of disaster risk management institutions as well
      as stronger capacity of staff responsible for environmental and climate change risks
      management will be necessary to improve disaster risk management and to protect the poor
      from the negative impact of climate change.

6.1      Diagnosis

156. The lack of progress in reducing extreme poverty in Madagascar is to a large extent
due to the failure to improve the lives of the rural poor, a vast majority of whom work in
agriculture or the informal sector (usually both). “Structural transformation” is not happening
in Madagascar: more people are engaged in agriculture and productivity per worker in agriculture
is falling. Constraints for structural transformation and poverty reduction include limited
migration to urban areas, few job opportunities in urban areas, declining agricultural productivity,
the vulnerability of poor households to a variety of risks and poor delivery of public goods and



                                                                                                     79
                                                                


services. Natural resources are being depleted, partly through overuse by the poor, which will
affect the sustainability of growth and rural livelihoods.

MISSING STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION: MORE PEOPLE WORK IN
AGRICULTURE AND THE INFORMAL SECTOR

157. Agricultural sector growth causes the largest decline in poverty, but growth in
agriculture in the last decade has been very low – around half the average in Sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA). Studies have shown that growth in agriculture and services has the largest impact
on poverty reduction in SSA, while in other developing countries, it is growth in industry and
services that reduces poverty the most. In SSA, a 10 percent increase in agricultural growth
(respectively services growth) reduces the headcount by 6.7 percent and the poverty gap by 10.2
percent (respectively 9.4 percent and 12.3 percent).58 In Madagascar, a 10 percent increase in
agricultural growth reduces poverty by 14 percent compared to 4 percent for growth in mining and
utilities. Agriculture in Madagascar grew by only 1.4 percent in 2000-2013 compared to about 7.6
percent on average in SSA.

158. International experience suggests that improvements in agricultural productivity leads
to structural transformation. According to a recent study (Herrendorf et al, 2013),59 a structural
transformation away from agriculture, triggered by a faster productivity gain in the sector, leads
to higher income growth. The study finds that faster agricultural productivity growth raises the
competitiveness of non-agricultural activities and fosters overall economic growth. This in turn
raises income levels and the demand for non-agricultural goods. This process leads to a
reallocation of resources from agriculture to non-agricultural sectors such as manufacturing and
services as countries develop.

159. Labor productivity in the agriculture sector has been declining and there is no evidence
of structural transformation in Madagascar. The share of the labor force working in agriculture
has been increasing, and the average acreage cultivated per household decreased between 2001
and 2010 for the poorest 80 percent of the households before regaining ground in 2012; the per
capita labor productivity in the sector has been falling (Figure 46).

160. A large majority of the country’s labor force continues to be employed in agriculture,
more than predicted by its income level (Figure 47). Agriculture (and fisheries) is the main
source of employment followed by manufacturing and commerce. A vast majority (80 percent) of
people engaged in agriculture are poor compared to about 25 percent and 38 percent of the workers
respectively in the public sector and textile sectors.

161. High participation rates and limited job opportunities outside agriculture explain the
high share of the labor force in the agricultural sector. While unemployment is very low,
underemployment is rife at 80 percent of workers. One of the reasons to find a higher than
predicted share of the labor force working in agriculture is that the demand for labor is weak, but
the labor force participation rate is high (Figure 48, left panel). The official unemployment rate is
low (3.4 percent in urban areas and nil in rural areas), essentially because the poor cannot afford
not to work. The unemployment rate of the youth aged 20 to 29 is 3 percent compared to a national
average of 0.6 percent (Figure 48, right panel). The majority of these youth are new entrants in
the labor market but about 40 percent were unemployed following the loss of their previous job.
According to the 2012 labor force survey (LFS), 8 out of 10 working individuals are
underemployed60 and most of them work in the informal sector. Among those who work outside
the agriculture sector, the rate of underemployment in 2012 is 1 in 4. The rate of underemployment
varies somewhat by regions: it is relatively lower in the capital region (Analamanga) and in the
north (Diana) registering between 67-76 percent, whereas it reaches around 90 percent in some
regions.

162. Malagasy women have a high participation in the labor force, but they still receive
significantly lower wages than their male peers. Women’s participation in the labor force is
higher than many comparator countries, with close to gender parity (see Figure 49), yet women
earn less than men. The gender pay gap has been dropping in recent years – from over 40 percent
in 2005 to 34 percent in 2010, but figures from the World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Gender
Gap report suggest that wage inequality in Madagascar is still higher than in comparator countries
(see Figure 50). In addition, the rate of underemployment is higher in women (87 percent) than in
men (75.8 percent), and a substantially higher proportion of women than men working in

163. The country’s non-agricultural private sector is dominated by self-employment and
family workers. About 42 percent of the employed work in their own business and 18 percent
help in their family’s businesses. Large firms of over 100 workers only account for 4.5 percent of
total employment. Most micro and small firms are not registered with statistical and tax authorities
or with the social security agency. The registration process is different depending on the legal
status of the firms. The sociétés (SA, SARL etc.) can register at the one stop shop but the
entreprises (mostly owned by one person) must go through various steps involving various
institutions. These include obtaining an authorization at the municipal level, a statistics number
with the National Statistics Office and a tax identification number with the Tax Office.

164. Educated workers are less likely to be employed in the agriculture or informal sector.
The workforce is highly segregated by levels of education. The less educated are mostly employed
in agriculture, while the more educated are mostly employed in services and are more likely to
work in manufacturing. The more educated are less likely to work in the informal sector (although
the likelihood is still high at about 50 percent) and more likely to have a contract and social security
coverage. Given the correlation between poverty and educational attainment, these findings again
indicate that the composition of growth will benefit people with different levels of education to a
varying degree and will impact the profile of poverty reduction. The findings also indicate that
the contraction of employment in manufacturing that resulted from the crisis may have impacted
the more educated workers more severely.

165. Sectors with a high share of employment have low levels of operating profits, but there
are niche sectors with high levels of operating profit. For instance the average net monthly
operating profit of informal enterprises in the manufacturing sector is about 100,000 Ariary, where
operating profit is defined as profits minus costs including intermediate inputs, wages, rental of
business location, cost utilities such as water and electricity etc. Certain niche informal activities,

profits above 300,000 Ariary per month.

166. The artisanal mining sector is the third largest non-agricultural employer of the
informal sector after commerce and manufacturing. It is almost entirely informal but far from
being marginal for the economy.61 The country is well-known worldwide for its precious and semi-
precious stones such as sapphire, ruby, aquamarine, tourmaline, topaz, amethyst and emerald.
Their exploitation provides full-time or seasonal livelihood to up to 500,000 artisanal miners
spread across the country. The sector also includes small-scale gold mining, artisanal extraction
of alluvial gold, which is a secular livelihood activity in many regions of Madagascar. These
activities sometimes bring significant impacts on health, safety, social and environment in rural
areas or parks. In addition to coloured gemstones and gold, artisanal miners exploit decorative
stones, industrial minerals (quartz, mica, feldspar) and building materials (cement, marble, kaolin,
gypsum).

167. Artisanal fisheries are an important source of income for the poor, and are in urgent
need of reorientation towards a sustainable path. The artisanal branch represents the vast
majority of the fisheries sector, with an estimated 102,000 fishermen catching 135,000 tons on
average annually, and relying heavily on marine resources for subsistence and income.62 The catch
is sold almost exclusively to local markets as their products have difficulty getting certified for
export. While no stock assessments have been conducted, the limited amount of data available
indicates that most fisheries are in decline due to overfishing, habitat destruction, pollution and

   According to Bureau du Cadastre minier de Madagascar, 70% of mining permits are artisanal.
62
   The numbers are probably largely underestimated: there has been no recent census and many households practice
fishing as part-time occupation or as means of supplementing their subsistence needs. Active population in

climate change. There is a need to deepen fisheries value-chains and reorient the sector towards
higher value-added and sustainable activities:

             Developing artisanal fisheries value-chains, which have promising income generation
              potential for the poor in the current context of difficult access to markets and low value-
              addition. Several constraints currently hamper this development, including systemic lack
              of access to finance and market barriers linked to certification requirements.
             Engaging in sustainable co-management of fisheries. Despite some successful but
              scattered initiatives, the overall sustainability of the resource is jeopardized by a lack of
              attention to fisheries management, and greater effort is required at the local, national and
              regional level.63
             Increasing aquaculture fish production for internal consumption, exports, job creation and
              reduction of the pressure on the marine ecosystems. Several promising models are being
              developed in Madagascar and in the region, and greater attention to the facilitating
              environment is required to significantly scale up the approaches. Out-grower schemes in
              sea-cucumber aquaculture are tested to address rarefaction of the resource while supporting
              poverty reduction, and are progressively industrialized.
A CLOSER LOOK AT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY IN MADAGASCAR

168. Agricultural productivity in Madagascar is low and has been falling since the 1960s.
Agriculture value added per worker was merely US$250 per worker (in constant 2005 dollars) in
1980, did not grow significantly in the 1980s, and contracted on average 1 percent per year in the
1990s and 2000s. Moreover, production of rice, Madagascar’s main staple food crop, representing
nearly 70 percent of agricultural production and accounting for 48 percent of total calorie
consumption, has not kept pace with the increasing needs of the population. Over the past 30 years,
rice production grew by 2.6 percent per year on average, mostly through area expansion rather
than yield increase, while total calorie consumption expanded at around 3 percent per year.
Madagascar’s performance in agricultural productivity compares poorly to most other countries
(Figure 52, left panel). Productivity growth is slow, while it has more than doubled in Indonesia,
a country with similar agro-climatic potential, from a similar starting point in 1960 (Figure 52,
right panel). Today, the yield gap in rice (defined as the difference between average yields
achieved by farmers and maximum yields attainable under experimental conditions) is much larger
in Madagascar (75 percent) than in Indonesia (20 percent). Other staple food crops are also
characterized by average yields that are well below their potential: corn (0.9 t/ha actual vs a
potential of 4 t/ha), beans (0.8 vs 2), cassava (7 vs 30), and potatoes (6 vs 20). The bulk of staple
food is produced for self-consumption, with less than 25 percent of the production sold on markets.
This limited market participation limits farmers’ capacity to boosting productivity, which requires
improved inputs that are acquired from cash flow generated by market sales.

169. Low agricultural productivity in Madagascar can be attributed to multiple underlying
causes, of which the following stand out:
    Use of outdated farming practices caused by producers’ inadequate knowledge of
       improved technologies and compounded by a weak and ineffective extension service.
       Experience from many countries suggests that the most effective way to deliver extension
       advisory services is through pluralistic systems that bring together public institutions,
       private firms, and civil society organizations. Such a pluralistic system does not exist in
       Madagascar. In the absence of a functional public extension service, donor-supported
       development projects have attempted to enlist the support of Non-governmental
       organizations (NGOs) and private firms in providing agricultural advisory services. This
       approach has not worked. The services available today are limited in terms of geographical
       coverage and highly uneven in terms of quality. More than 50 percent of rural households
       currently have no access to an extension agent of any kind (SSA 2009).
    Limited availability and high cost of improved inputs, (especially seed and fertilizer)
       resulting from poorly developed input distribution systems, high transportation costs, and
       a weak private sector. Returning to the comparison with Indonesia, only about 20 percent
       of the area planted to rice in Madagascar is planted with modern varieties, compared to 95
       percent in Indonesia. Fertilizer use in Madagascar (5 kg/ha) similarly has lagged far behind
       fertilizer use in Indonesia (290 kg/ha) and has actually declined during more recent years
       (FAOSTAT 2009).
    Low use of production credit, stemming from a lack of effective demand for bank
       financing on the one hand and a lack of supply of appropriate financial services on the
       other. Many agricultural producers lack the knowledge and skills needed to access
       financing through the formal credit system, and those who do have the knowledge and
       skills are considered by banks to be unattractive clients because they can offer little in the
       way of collateral and plan to invest in risky activities. In the absence of effective demand,
       financial institutions in Madagascar make little effort to lend into the agricultural sector.
       Market penetration by financial institutions extends to only 20 percent of all communes,
       and only around 10 percent of rural households access credit to finance agricultural
       production activities (AGEPMF).

      Deficient infrastructure for production, especially irrigation infrastructure and grain
       drying and storage facilities. One of the major reasons for low productivity in rice, by
       far the most important crop, is the lack of effective water control. The proportion of total
       cultivated land classified as irrigated is relatively high by global standards—around 31
       percent in 2005—but nearly three-quarters of the irrigated land is irrigated using micro-
       perimeters, many of which allow only poor water control (INSTAT 2008). Lack of
       irrigation infrastructure therefore continues to pose a major constraint.
      Weak human capital base, resulting from poor nutrition, inadequate rural health services,
       and prevalence of debilitating diseases, lack of skills (attributable to the lack of education
       opportunities for the rural population, particularly opportunities for vocational training),
       and poor organization (reflecting the absence of a tradition of formal and informal
       collaboration). According to the most recent census, 23 percent of the agricultural work
       force had not attended school at all, and an additional 63 percent had not progressed beyond
       primary school (INSTAT 2008). Poor health and nutrition status have a significant impact
       on the level of productivity. For example, according to the 2009 Demographic and Health
       Survey, 9.3 percent of adults had a fever or malaria in the 2 weeks prior to the survey, while
       35 percent of women and 33 percent of men suffered from anemia. Anemia has been
       shown to result in 17 percent lower productivity in heavy manual labor and 5 percent in
       other manual labor. A bout of non-fatal malaria will typically last for 10–14 days,
       including 4–6 days of total incapacitation during which no farm work is possible.
      Lack of land tenure security: due to continuing reliance on traditional systems of land
       allocation and administration, which discourage investment in productivity-enhancing
       improvements, especially irrigation and terracing. Although 86 percent of the land used
       for agriculture is classified as privately owned, only 8 percent of household heads hold
       formal title to their land (INSTAT 2008).
      Soil degradation closely linked to the high rates of deforestation which are in turn an
       effect of poverty driven agricultural extension practices (known as ‘tavy’). These practices
       are also re-enforced by the widespread application of customary law in forest management,
       which allows for slash and burn as a mean to sustain livelihoods as population grows and
       agricultural land remains at low levels of productivity. Soil degradation makes the farmers
       more vulnerable to weather shocks and natural disasters.

170. High transport costs and poor physical and informational connectivity reduce
incentives for productivity-enhancing investments. The considerable variation in prices across
regions of the country indicate high domestic transport costs and poorly functioning information
exchange. Many rural communities lack reliable access to the outside world. Where roads do
exist, they are often in poor condition and impassible during the rainy season. The poor have to
contend with great distances to reach food markets, urban centers and schools, although the
distances covered are generally very high for even the richest segment of the population, and have
increased between 2005 and 2010. For example, it takes over 90 minutes for the richest quintile
to reach food markets, and over 144 minutes for the poorest quintile (Figure 53). The Rural Access
Index for Madagascar, defined as the percentage of rural people who live within 2 km of an all-
weather road, is 22.4 percent, extremely low even by developing country standards (World Bank
2009). Road maintenance is expensive, because the country is large and sparsely populated, and
also because of the damage caused by frequent tropical storms and cyclones. Coverage of the rail
network is limited to the more densely populated areas in the central plateau. Port facilities are for


                                                                                                   87
                                                                              


the most part in poor condition. Consequently, only around 40 percent of agricultural production
is sold, according to the estimates by Randrianarison et al (2009). In addition, the strong seasonal
variability of prices of many leading commodities suggests a lack of reliable storage capacity.

171. Output is also lost due to adverse shocks, many of them weather-related as discussed in
the first chapter. Although the nominal value of loss incurred is highest among the richest quintile
of the population, the losses in income and assets combined resulting from all negative shocks as
a share of household consumption is much higher for the bottom two quintiles of the population
(figure 54). Such huge intermittent losses combined with the absence of mechanisms to address
this risk is considered to be among the key constraints for the poor.64

  See, e.g., Christiansen and Dercon (2011), Osborne (2006), and Zimmerman and Carter (2003), which underscore
the importance of risk in farmers’ decisions to utilize lower-effort lower-return technologies.

WEATHER RELATED SHOCKS EXACERBATE POVERTY

172. Madagascar is one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world with a poor and
predominantly rural population, a high geographical exposure to climate events, and a lack
of readily available resources to respond to and recover from natural disasters. From 1980
to 2010, 53 natural hazards - including, droughts, earthquakes, epidemics, floods, cyclones, and
extreme temperatures - affected Madagascar and caused economic damages of over US$1 billion
(Figure 55). These risks are projected to become more acute in the future, due to rising sea levels
and increasingly severe and frequent droughts. In addition to human exposure, the country’s
infrastructure and urban zones, particularly in coastal areas, have not been developed to cope with
the effects of existing and future climate events. Historically, the disaster risk management in
Madagascar had focused on ex post response and recovery efforts, but there had been a growing
recognition that it is important to give equal attention to pre-disaster planning and preparedness,
by taking a resilience-building approach. The political crisis and the resulting withdrawal of many
development partners halted efforts in this direction.

173. The poor are the most impacted by natural hazards because they tend to choose lower
priced lands located in disaster-prone areas and have less ability to efficiently cope with the
negative social and economic impacts on their lives. Over 4 million people currently live in
zones at high risk of cyclones or floods. While Madagascar remains a predominately rural country,




                                                                                                                89
                                                                


potential urbanization in the future would increase vulnerability to disasters.65 The recent storms
and flooding that hit the country have revealed the fragility.

174. Madagascar has one of the highest cyclone risks among African countries, with an
average of three to four cyclones affecting the country every year. Cyclone season begins in
November and ends in March and can cause significant damage, including crop loss, increased
incidence of disease outbreaks, degradation of coastal and marine ecosystems, disruption of critical
urban services such as water and electricity, severe flooding, damages to infrastructure, and
sometimes human casualties. In the last decades, several damaging cyclones have hit the country.
In 2008, a more detailed economic analysis of the impacts of natural disasters was carried out
following the arrival of three consecutive, severe cyclones.66 These cyclones affected 84 percent
of the territory, causing an economic loss equivalent to 4 percent of GDP and a decline of 0.3
percent in real GDP growth in 2008. Damage and losses of US$103 million were experienced in
the agricultural sector, US$127 million in the housing and public administration sector, and US$46
million in the transport sector. Rebuilding cost estimates were in the order of $155 million.67

Southern Indian Ocean, their intensity is projected to increase, and could severely impact the
country’s GDP (leading to a 38% decline in the balance of payments.68

175. Driven by large-scale disruptions in atmospheric circulation and exacerbated by poor
land use practices, droughts are a common occurrence in the south of Madagascar, with
some areas receiving less than 400 mm of rainfall each year. Droughts pose a severe strain on
subsistence livelihoods, leading to water shortages and crop loss. Between 1980 and 2009, five
major droughts occurred with large impacts on agriculture and food security. According to the
World Food Program in Madagascar, over the past years droughts have caused widespread failure
of maize crops in the southern regions affecting more than 230,000 children under five years of
age. Recent evidence of the prolonged nature of dry periods suggests the need to place increasing
emphasis on livelihood diversification that can temper the impacts of future droughts for
vulnerable populations.

176. Intense rainfall events caused by strong storms and tropical cyclones, coupled with poor
land use practices and increasing deforestation, can lead to significant and damaging floods
across the country. Floods cause damage to roads, bridges, houses, and crops, while also
threatening the lives of hundreds of people that live in the affected areas. Over 30 floods or heavy
rainfall events affected Madagascar in the past 30 years, killing hundreds of people and affecting
thousands. The most damaging floods were those caused by hurricane Gloria, which killed 20
people, and tropical cyclone Elita, which killed 363 people and affected one million, causing
economic damages of over US$250 million.69

177. Shoreline erosion caused by sea level rise is already a significant problem to the coastal
ports and beaches of Madagascar. Coastal erosion as measured in 1997 was between 5.71 and
6.54 meters, and this is projected to increases exponentially by 2100. Critical infrastructure such
as ports and roads are at risk from rising sea levels, as are unique biodiversity hotspots with coastal
ecosystems such as the littoral forests on the sandy coastal plains of eastern Madagascar, which
are already threatened by development and increased fragmentation.70

178. In addition to the economic damage inflicted by a disaster, the preparation for future
natural disasters will have an economic impact. The future costs of climate change adaptation
(CCA) in sub-Saharan Africa are estimated to be in the order of 0.6 percent of GDP. The costs of
adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa are expected to be highest in the areas of water supply/flood
protection and agriculture – a trend that is likely to be reflected at the national level in Madagascar
given the apparent vulnerability of these sectors to projected climate change, despite the lack of
accurate national estimates of priorities and budget needs for adaptation.

Future Trends71

179. Rainfall is expected to decline in the south of the country, while cyclone intensity is
projected to increase by almost 50 percent, with important implications for agriculture, food
security and infrastructure. Between 1961 and 2005, rainfall declined in the central and east
coastal regions and was accompanied by increases in the length of the dry spells. By 2065, rainfall
in the southern part of the country is projected to increase during the summer months of January
to April, and again in October through November- with one exception being the southernmost
station, which in October may become drier. Also by 2065, rainfall in the southern part of the
country is projected to decrease during May, with greater decreases projected inland through June
and July, and also during August and September. Projected changes in rainfall are less certain for
the north, with some models suggesting drier conditions and others suggesting wetter conditions.
By 2100, the frequency of cyclones is projected to decrease over the Indian Ocean, particularly
between September and December. Cyclone intensity, on the other hand, is projected to increase
by 46 percent and shift northwards with implications for agriculture, food security, and
infrastructure.

Sector Risks

180. Agriculture and social services are particularly exposed to risks from climate change
and other natural hazards. Further to these general trends three key sectors: agriculture, health
(and other social services) and fisheries were screened to better understand the drivers of impact
as well as the current and future impact. Table 13 presents the overall risk to each sector, based
on climate and geophysical hazards and sector potential impact, but adjusted for the sector's
institutional readiness and for the challenges and opportunities presented by the larger
development context. The results indicate where there are potential risks. Further consultations,
diagnosis, and studies may be required to identify and ultimately reduce the risks posed by climate

181. Climate change will affect agriculture through its negative impact on soil fertility and
variations in rainfall and temperatures.                Agriculture is dominated by small-scale,
predominantly subsistence farming that is rain-fed and based on traditional technologies.
Deforestation and erosion, aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of fuel, are
serious concerns. Climate change adds a layer to the vulnerability of this sector. Climatic changes
will negatively impact soil fertility, particularly in highland areas where increased rainfall coupled
with deforestation is decreasing soil cover through erosion72. Variations in rainfall and
temperature, along with increased intensity of activity in some regions have already led to shifts
in the farming schedule/calendars of local farmers, and consequently an increase in crop failure.
Water supply for agriculture is expected to decrease.

182. Madagascar’s limited public health sector is vulnerable to climate variability and
change, particularly with regard to the increased incidence of nutritional deficiencies and
vector-borne diseases. Projected temperature increases, coupled with warmer and more humid
environments, could increase the incidence of malaria, diarrheal diseases, and acute respiratory
infections. There is a potential for an elevation migration of the Anopheles fluviatilis malaria

vector from endemic coastal areas to elevations above 1500 m. Diarrheal diseases are already a
significant problem in the country and flooding may exacerbate these and other water-quality
diseases, such as cholera, by increasing surface water pollution. Addressing the impacts of climate
variability and change on the health sector requires addressing issues of poverty, sanitation,
nutrition, and environmental degradation, all of which significantly hamper a community’s
vulnerability and capacity to adapt.

183. Offshore fish stocks have already been affected by increased sedimentation and runoff
from the country’s extensive river systems. This impacts corals as well as water acidity levels
and temperatures in the productive deltas, all of which have already faced significant degradation
from cyclones. An increased migration to new fishing grounds is well documented as are increased
supplementary livelihoods in fishing communities and the occasional livelihood conversion
altogether. Conversion from a fishing-based livelihood to a livelihood based principally on
agriculture may not be a viable or sustainable alternative, but it is already being practiced.
Fishermen have to travel longer distances out to sea to fish, creating an increased reliance on
material and financial aid to obtain the necessary equipment (e.g. motors) to do so. Climate-related
stresses, coupled with over-fishing, increase the vulnerability of fishing-based livelihoods.
Onshore fishing is most vulnerable to water supply and quality, sedimentation, and the migration
of species.73

DEPLETING NATURAL CAPITAL AND POVERTY – A VICIOUS CIRCLE

184. Poverty in Madagascar is closely linked to land degradation and deforestation. Land
degradation, defined as the temporary or permanent reduction in the productive capacity of land
as a result of human action, affects 31 percent of the country. Seventy percent of the country is
classified as agricultural land and in 2000, 53 percent of the population lived in areas with a high
proportion of land degradation.74 The most severe areas of land degradation are in the southwest,
the eastern coast and highlands, a pattern which corresponds not only with the highest poverty
rates, but also to the presence of lower fertility, highly erodible ferralitic and ferruginous soils.
Existing soil maps are based on global mapping which categorize Madagascar’s soils into four
broad classes: acidic ferralitic soils located on the east coast and highlands, and ferruginous
tropical soils in the west and south, which together cover nearly 70 percent of the country and are
highly subject to erosion due to the topography on which they are located and their physical
structure; and peaty hydromorphic soils in valley bottoms and alluvial soils on floodplains in the
west of the country that are less susceptible to erosion and have higher fertility, but which cover

only approximately 30 percent of the country. Between 1993 and 2003, 48 percent of hillsides in
one study in the east of the country had suffered loss of soil quality.75

185. Degrading lands are often a consequence of poverty driven short-sighted land
management decisions, including deforestation and over-tilling of soils. The need to survive
can compel a farmer to over-work fragile soils, or harvest the last trees on her farm, even if it
jeopardizes future productivity.76 Loss of soil fertility is traditionally blamed on tavy practices
that employ nutrient depleting fire, short fallow periods and enhance erosion rates. In addition,
Madagascar has suffered significant deforestation and forest fragmentation over the last 50 years
(in large part owing to agriculture), with the forest cover decreasing almost 40 percent from the
1950s to 2000 and much of the remaining forest land being highly degraded.77 In addition, much
of the agricultural land is severely eroded owing to unsustainable land-use practices.78

186. Woody biomass used as the dominant household energy source in Madagascar has also
imposed significant threats to forests. The nation’s current structure of household energy
consumption is highly skewed. Around 95 percent of households depend on woody biomass,
primarily wood and charcoal, with annual natural consumption of about 9 million cubic meters of
firewood and 8.6 million cubic meters of wood as charcoal. Electricity, natural gas and kerosene
provide cooking fuel for only a very small minority, with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
accounting for 11 percent in urban areas while being negligible elsewhere.

187. The recent increase in forest felling implies an increasing number of people is potentially
being brought into a poverty trap. Calculations of deforestation rates vary due to differences in
specificity of different studies over time and differing definitions of forest. While deforestation
rates had been declining, they have recently experienced a steep increase: deforestation at the
national level was estimated at 0.83 percent between 1990 and 2000, 0.53 percent between 2000
and 2005, and 0.40 percent between 2005 and 2010.79 More recent calculations of deforestation
rates for the Eastern Humid Forest ecoregion are illustrative of increasing rates of deforestation80:
0.50 percent between 2005 and 2010, and 0.94 percent between 2010 and 2013. Deforestation at
the local level means that forest dependent communities may suddenly find themselves in low
productivity crop-land which in turn translate into poorer livelihoods (Figure 56).

188. Remaining forests represent a safety net to those living near them. In poor communities
across the world, the income derived from forests is on average equal in magnitude to revenue
from crop sales. Neglecting this “hidden bounty” is analogous to ignoring the role of agriculture,
the primary occupation in rural areas. Where there is adequate forest cover, the level of
dependence on forests is surprisingly large (28 percent of income).81 In addition to timber
resources, forests also provide hunting opportunities. In northeastern Madagascar (case study on
the Makira Natural Park and Masoala National Park), the value of wildlife provisioning
represented 57 percent of annual household cash income in local communities, and harvested areas
produced an economic return of US$ 0.42 ha per year.82 Forests and their wildlife can also be an
important antidote against child malnutrition. In the same region of Madagascar, consuming more
wildlife was associated with significantly higher hemoglobin concentrations. The empirical
models demonstrate that removing access to wildlife would induce a 29 percent increase in the

numbers of children suffering from anemia and a tripling of anemia cases among children in the
poorest households.83

Forest as a stepping stone out of poverty: mixed evidence

189. Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) can be a pathway out of
poverty. Forests can provide a source of income and food to the poor and chronically poor.
Community-based NRM is one potential tool. The government legislated84 on community-based
NRM in the late 1990s to reduce deforestation and protect the significant part of the world’s
biodiversity that is endemic to Madagascar.85 The number of community managed forest units
increased rapidly and continues to grow.86 The Madagascar-based Anja Miray Association runs a
community forest reserve, using ecotourism to create jobs and fund basic social infrastructure such
as schools, health clinics and environmental education centers. Prior to the initiative, the vast
territory around the community was cleared every year for corn planting. Local communities were
hunting the lemurs as a source of protein to supplement their poor food diet. Today, the forest is
a popular attraction for tourists worldwide. Ecotourism has also provided substantial revenues for
alternative farming and new investments in agriculture, fishery and tree nurseries, helping the
community become self-sufficient in food.

190. In spite of encouraging examples, community-based natural resource management
(NRM) has generally failed on its promise. A recent impact evaluation conducted by the World
Bank87 shows that decentralization of forest management to local communities in Madagascar has
not, on average, achieved its forest conservation goal. In terms of deforestation, significant effects
cannot be identified between community managed forests and non-community managed forests,
even after restricting the treatment sample to those communities for which the forest management
contract has been positively evaluated by the State. At the national level, the findings support the
rather gloomy pictures of community forest management in Madagascar depicted in a number of
institutional and policy studies.88 To explain the ineffectiveness of community forest management,

these studies describe inadequate integration of local participation, ill-defined tenure security on
forest land, gaps in the community based NRM regulations, resource capture by elites, unfulfilled
support promises by different organizations, and lack of capacity of the community and the State,
among other factors. While these studies point to institutional and policy shortcomings, the impact
evaluation analysis undertook by the World Bank suggests that at the national level community-
based NRM has not delivered in terms of its central objective: reducing deforestation.

191. Community-based NRM has had minimal positive effects on well-being. The transfer of
forest management rights to local communities has not improved household economic living
standard at larger scale (municipality level). However, community-based NRM has enhanced the
economic living standard at a smaller scale, that is, for households living nearer to the forest edge.
This positive result for household nearer to the forest edge and the finding that community forest
management has not reduced deforestation reveal the challenge of achieving conservation and
development objectives simultaneously. This interpretation contrasts with evidence that
participation of local communities in forest management leads to win-win conservation and well-
being outcomes.89,90 The conservation and livelihood synergy may not be observed in Madagascar
because the size of the impact, although positive, is quite small.

6.2           Opportunities and recommendations

192. For structural transformation to occur, the productivity in agriculture must rise and
labor force participants must have alternatives to agriculture and informal sector jobs.
Opportunities and recommendations for promoting vibrant private sector that creates jobs are
discussed in Chapter 4. Improving agricultural productivity will require introduction of more
productive methods coupled with improved rural infrastructure, enhanced land tenure security and
higher human capital of the rural poor through better nutrition, access to health care and education
system. The issues relating to human capital are discussed in Chapter 6. Opportunities and
recommendations for the remaining aspects are discussed in turn below.

193. Strengthen private input distribution systems.           Sustained productivity growth in
agriculture will not be possible without continuous technological innovation, which depends
(among other things) on the timely availability of improved inputs such as seed, fertilizer, and crop
chemicals. Dissemination of modern crop varieties represents one of the largest potential “quick
wins” in Malagasy agriculture. Stimulating the development of an efficient, profitable, and
competitive fertilizer industry will require a two-pronged approach to strengthen demand for

fertilizer on the one hand and improve the supply of fertilizer on the other. State-led efforts to
improving input distribution systems attempted in the past have been costly and inefficient. In
recognition of past shortcomings, the government has developed national strategies for seed and
fertilizer that rely on private-sector service delivery mechanisms. The implementation of these
strategies, which had stalled during the crisis, should be resumed.

194. Overhaul agricultural advisory services. Improved inputs are unlikely to have much impact
unless farmers know how to use them. Keeping farmers well informed and knowledgeable is the
job of the extension system. In the absence of a public agricultural extension service, the only
practical option for providing extension services is via private service providers and Non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). In recent years, the government and several development
partners have been attempting to promote the emergence of private advisory services by funding
the establishment of Centres de Services Agricoles (CSAs), whose function is to help match users
with service providers. Implementation of the CSA network has slowed during the political crisis.
The long-term success of the initiative will depend on there being effective demand for agricultural
services, because without effective demand, there will be no incentive for private service providers
to emerge. For this reason, there is a need to continue to support the CSA approach by channeling
funds to producer organizations for use in paying for advisory services, as is already being done
through a number of development projects, and has been institutionalized through the Fonds de
Développement Agricole (FDA). This will allow producers and producer organizations to engage
private service, increasing the likelihood that a viable service provision industry will emerge.
Efforts also are needed to strengthen producer organizations themselves, as these remain very
underdeveloped in Madagascar compared to many other countries.

195. Exploit quick wins in farm-level infrastructure. Lack of infrastructure remains a major
constraint at the farm level, particularly infrastructure related to irrigation and infrastructure
needed for processing and storage of crops. There is evidence that relatively modest investments
in small-scale infrastructure can have rapid and significant impacts on production. An urgent
priority will be to expand irrigation by stimulating investment in affordable small-scale irrigation
technologies (both gravity systems and pump-driven systems). A second urgent priority will be to
promote investment in construction and effective use of village-level grain storage facilities. Most
farmers in Madagascar are unable to store grain for extended periods without experiencing
significant losses. As a result, they are forced to sell their production right after the harvest, when
prices are low, and to buy grain later in the season, when prices are high. Access to storage
facilities and functional grain warehousing systems, combined with the capacity of users to
manage stocks effectively will enable them to secure household food supplies and time sales more
strategically to take advantage of favorable prices

196. Improve roads serving high-potential production zones. Madagascar’s farmers will not
be able to make the transition from subsistence to commercial agriculture without significant
improvements in the road network that links them to markets for inputs and outputs. Some of the
nation’s leading agricultural production zones remain poorly linked to Antananarivo and other
major consumption centers. Similarly, agribusinesses located in and around urban areas will not
be able to obtain reliable supplies of low-cost, high-quality raw materials without improved access
to rural production zones. To ensure that investments are targeted to areas where they will have
maximum impacts on growth, it is necessary to examine the relative emphasis on targeting primary

roads vs. secondary vs. tertiary roads, as well as the appropriate balance between constructing new
roads and maintenance of existing roads.

197. Nurture local organizations which can demand policies and public services adapted to
the farmers’ needs. Although many of the constraints facing the agricultural sector in
Madagascar are well known, as are many of the interventions needed to overcome those
constraints, little progress has been made in the past because approaches have been overly top-
down, with implementation too often entrusted to public agencies and parastatal companies who
lacked capacity and commitment. The record of public service delivery is poor, in part because of
the lack of social capital in rural communities, which generally has its roots in the limited
knowledge and weak skills found among most of the rural population. Compared to most other
developing countries, Madagascar has few well-functioning farmer associations, producer
cooperatives, savings and loan societies, and other types of community self-help groups. Policy
reforms and supporting investments are needed to stimulate the emergence of dynamic and vibrant
local organizations which can generate effective demand for goods and services, and which can
hold public service providers accountable by mobilizing political power.

198. Consider aligning with the process being promoted by the African Union through the
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). With the help of
technical assistance and financial support made available through CAADP, more than 20 African
countries have made significant progress during the past two years in developing national
agricultural development strategies, preparing national agricultural investment plans and medium-
term expenditure frameworks, and organizing roundtable events during which major stakeholders
and partners have signed compacts committing themselves to supporting the implementation of
the national agricultural development strategy. The CAADP process is one that could provide
significant impetus to Madagascar’s efforts to rebound from the crisis and restore the capacity and
the authority of the public institutions working in the agricultural sector.

199. Make it a priority to protect the poor against natural disaster-related shocks, because
they tend to be the largest negative shocks to the lives of the poor for which they are ill-
equipped to cope, and also because mitigation and adaptation against natural disasters are
unambiguously a public good, and hence the use of public resources to provide it is
uncontroversial. While a zero risk is not expected, research show that the following investments
are cost-effective and reduce the social and economic impacts of natural hazards:
 Investing in risk reduction: Studies have shown multiple economic benefits of investing in
    mitigation which varies depending on the scale, hazard type and type of interventions
    (structural or non-structural).
 Investing in risk information: The benefits of enhancing forecast information and making it
    available to the public is cost-effective. Investing in hydro-meteorological could also reap a
    cost-benefit ratio of 4 to 36.
 Investing in disaster recovery: The decision of investing in disaster recovery right after the
    relief can reverse the negative economic impacts of disasters in the long run. Having in place
    robust disaster risk financing strategies can help the country to address both recurrent as well
    as catastrophic events.

environmental degradation on poverty. Environmental sustainability is not only or primarily

about preserving the pristine forests and beaches for tourism. The role of environmental and
natural resources in poverty reduction has largely been ignored by governments and development
partners alike, partly a consequence of the complexity of the interactions and the difficulties of
measurement. Data on critical indicators, such as forest cover, fish stocks and water quality, have
historically been sparse and inaccurate. The traditional focus of poverty measures on consumption
rather than wealth levels, though justifiable on practicality grounds, has often diverted attention
away from issues of resource availability and sustainability. The policies for poverty reduction
need to take this consideration into account for them to be robust and accurate.

201. Fill the gaps in the community-based NRM legal and regulatory frameworks. The
cornerstone of the community-based NRM legal framework is represented by the law called
“Gestion local sécurisée des ressources naturelles renouvelables” or (GELOSE law), approved in
1996. The law was never complemented by a full body of regulations de facto leaving some key
principles of the law without a clear implementation tool. Key gaps include: the delimitation of
State land, which can then be transferred to local communities, leaving de facto unclear use rights
on the land; clear guidelines for the management transfer to be considered by the municipality and
in this way made compatible with the municipality’s land management plan; and, definition of the
benefits the community has the right to obtain from the use of the resources being transferred.
Subsequent decrees have not filled these important gaps and have given rise to contracts for which
land tenure rights are not always clear, the participation of the municipality is only marginal, and
the community could not see its needs fully represented.

202. Enhance coherence in sector policies with respect to natural resources management. In
order to strengthen the land tenure and use rights of communities, some inconsistencies in the
existing sector laws need to be dealt with. The issue is particularly important with respect to the
land tenure legislation. The land tenure reform introduced in 2005 gave right to municipalities to
recognize land use rights to private individuals. This responded to an obvious development need:
ensure land tenure for farmers. However it made it more difficult for communities in charge of
forest resources management to see their rights clearly recognized, unless the land comes clearly
from the State’s private domain. Other gaps include the legislation on energy (e.g. rural
electrification and use of biomass) and on mining. These two regulatory bodies do not make
explicit reference to community-based NRM regulations opening the way to potential conflicts in
the use of resources.

203. Strengthen the capacity for law enforcement. The key to functioning forest management
contracts, whether with private operators or with local communities is the capacity to clearly apply
the law and respond to non-compliance. Building capacity of judiciary, administration and civil
society is necessary to improve effectiveness of the legislative framework. Strengthening of the
capacity of all parties involved in the application of environmental legislation is required ranging
from the judiciary to technical field agents. In addition, environmental justice and information
needs to be taken to the people. Procedures need to be less complex and in line with the capacity
of local communities to be involved meaningfully in environmental action and mechanisms such
as traveling courts and/or reopening of local courts need to be supported. Another important
element is the development of information tools capable of detecting pressure on natural resources
at an early stage so as to be able to address the causes at the onset.

204. Develop a landscape approach to project finance and carbon finance.                Involving
communities into conservation will often require boosting agricultural productivity. Agricultural
intensification will in turn require healthy watersheds and forests. Developing actions that are
spatially integrated will mean a bigger solutions space and the possibility to exploit synergies
across sectors. In addition, being a pioneer on forest carbon, Madagascar could potentially be a
leader in addressing reforestation, reduced degradation, agriculture, and biomass energy in an
integrated approach that enhances food security, increases the resilience of local communities and
environments to climate change and raises new finance for conservation.

Chapter 7. Summary of Challenges 	
205. This chapter will suggest priorities from among the many constraints that have been
analyzed in previous chapters to identify those that can be expected to have the largest
impact in accelerating Madagascar’s progress toward the goal of ending extreme poverty in
a sustainable manner. As a reminder, this report is built on the premise that poor governance,
which partially finds its origin in poor dynamics among economic elites and political instability,
is affecting the ability of the State to collect revenues, contributing to a poor investment climate
and thus low investment, and preventing proper control of the country’s natural resources. The
low level of fiscal revenues in turn prevents the State from undertaking investments to support a
structural transformation of the economy and from providing sufficient basic services to develop
the country’s human capital. Weak economic growth, stagnating human capital, and fast
population growth have translated into a continuously declining per capita income, leading
communities to rely more and more on natural resources thus contributing to resource depletion.
This resource degradation could reach such a level that it would prevent people from coming out
of poverty. Each chapter makes a series of recommendations. The main ones are summarized in
Table 14.

Table 14: Summary of main issues identified
    Thematic issues                                            Broad Issues identified
 Improving governance        1. Understand the dynamic of degradation of law and order and reverse the trend by
                                strengthening relevant entities; adopt decisive measures to stop trafficking of precious
                                woods as a signal to end impunity and promote better local livelihood
                             2. Improve the center-periphery relations through decentralization (e.g. implementation of
                                the existing law) and greater community engagement in economic and social processes
                             3. Weaken the elite bargain by cultivating counter-powers, (e.g., civil society, press and
                                national assembly) empowering citizens with access to information, and protecting press
                                freedom
 Strengthening public        4. Increase tax revenues by tackling the underlying causes of low collection
 finances, a pre-condition   5. Establish or re-institute budget oversight mechanisms to create greater accountability and
 for improving public           better performance on the expenditure side
 service delivery and        6. Finalize PPP framework to engage the private sector in financing infrastructure and
 financing high impact          service delivery
 investments
 Instituting policies that   7. Provide priority complementary public investments in areas propitious for private sector
 help unleash the private       development and job creation (e.g. seeking partnerships in air transport to unleash tourism
 sector potential               potential)
                             8. Identify and prioritize policy reforms through the new public-private dialogue platform to
                                improve investment climate and promote FDI, to enhance the performance of the judicial
                                sector, and to address anti-competitive behaviors and enhance firms’ corporate governance
                             9. Address the main constraints identified by the private sector: reliable access to electricity,
                                broader access to finance, and expanded transport infrastructure. Where relevant, improve
                                governance and performance of state-owned enterprises

    Thematic issues                                          Broad Issues identified
 Aiming for higher        10. Support the poorest in accessing education, basic health, and nutrition through the
 human capital                development and implementation of a social protection policy (such as conditional cash
                              transfer programs)
                          11. Improve the quality and equity of education by investing in pre- and in-service training for
                              all teachers, improving the distribution of teachers across the country, and gradually
                              integrating trained community teachers in the system while maintaining local
                              accountability mechanisms
                          12. Prioritize and invest in first-level rural health facilities, train and distribute health
                              personnel across the country, and remove out-of-pocket costs at facility levels, particularly
                              for poorest communities
                          13. Renew focus on nutrition and scale up interventions that tackle stunting
                          14. Implement policies and increase investment to improve water and sanitation, starting in
                              large urban areas
 Tackling poverty –       15. Improve agricultural productivity through the introduction of more productive methods,
 improving the lives of       support for local organizations, financing for better farm-level and road infrastructure,
 the rural poor               enhanced land security, and higher human capital
                          16. Enhance management of natural resources, by improving the mechanisms through which
                              communities benefit from it, adopting a landscape approach that integrates mechanisms
                              for better watershed and forest management, and strengthening the capacity of law
                              enforcement
                          17. Institute mechanisms for protecting the poor from weather-related shocks through
                              mitigation and prevention measures and disaster response financing mechanisms



206. To define priority interventions, each of the challenges identified above was assessed
against a set of criteria, the first of which is the impact on reducing extreme poverty:
    Impact on poverty reduction: To what degree will the reforms proposed impact the
       reduction of poverty and ensure a sustainable increase in the welfare of the less well off?
       The main area assessed in here is the impact that the proposed reform has on raising the
       income of the poor and the most vulnerable.
    Time horizon of impacts: Over what timeframe will the impact be realized? Madagascar
       has five-year presidential and legislative terms and the Government has developed a five-
       year National Development Plan that runs until 2019. In a context of repeated political
       instability, the State faces the difficult challenge of asserting its authority by demonstrating
       to all Malagasy people that it can quickly deliver results for them. Still some of the priority
       issues will be longer term, as many of the challenges are structural and related to moving
       the country to a new growth path that will require time to be implemented. Short period is
       considered when impact of the reforms could be achieved in 1-2 years, medium in 3-5 years
       and long period beyond 5 years. It is important to note that recommendations that may
       have an impact on poverty in the long term need to be initiated in the short term for the
       impact to materialize in the long term.
    Preconditions: To what degree does this issue need to be addressed in order to unlock wider
       potential in other areas? This criterion assesses whether the reform identified would serve
       as a building block to reforms supported in other areas.



                                                                                                              104
                                                   


      Contribution to reducing fragility: To what degree does the issue have the potential of
       contributing to a reduction of instability over the long term by strengthening checks-and-
       balances on elites and on natural resources management, and/or by improving social
       cohesion across the country (including through decentralization)?
      Evidence-base: Based on the quality of the evidence, how confident are we in the
       identification of the issue as a priority? This criterion acknowledges reforms in which not
       enough granularity can be offered and additional analytical work is required to better detail
       a reform plan.
      Political capital required: This criterion assesses the political cost that the intended reform
       will have on the government. The political cost reflects the fact that some rights, privileges
       or support are removed from existing beneficiaries as well as the fact that the reform will
       have substantial redistributive impact. Those rated as high are expected to have strong
       resistance from a narrow but powerful base of vested interests, while those rated as medium
       are expected to confront strong resistance from the population at large. A low rating would
       signal mild opposition to the reform proposed.

207. The main criterion for selection of the challenge as a priority is its impact on poverty
reduction. The second and third most relevant criteria are the time horizon for the challenge to
affect poverty and the ability to reduce sources of fragility. Under each thematic group of issues,
the recommendations are thus ranked per that order, starting with the ones that will have the largest
impact on poverty reduction within the shortest time. Table 15 summarizes the results of the desk
prioritization assessment, followed by a description of the challenges identified and how they are
assessed against the main criteria selected.

208. Madagascar’s sustained development is hampered by several governance challenges
originating in the concentration of political and economic powers within a few networks led by
powerful leaders. This balance of power creates a bias in the provision of public goods and services in
favor of the center, although the capital has the lowest incidence of extreme poverty (see paras. 7 to 18
for an overview of poverty). The fight for resources among those networks generates recurrent political
crises that interrupt growth spurts and discourage investment (see paras. 25-34). Political instability is
reported as the top impediment to doing business by firms (see paras. 39; 43). Three types of actions
could be supported to address those weaknesses:
    Understand the dynamic of degradation of law and order and reverse the trend by strengthening
       relevant entities (e.g., anti-corruption bureau, security forces, justice services); adopt decisive
       measures to stop trafficking of precious woods as a signal to end impunity and promote shared
       prosperity – Periods of instability have created an environment complicit for trafficking, growing
       insecurity, and a weakening respect for law and order (see paras. 44-46). The pillage of precious
       woods is symbolic of how poor governance can erode the country’s asset base with few
       development returns to the country as a whole and to the local communities in affected areas
       (paras. 20-24). There are ongoing efforts to strengthen the anti-corruption agency and to update
       the national governance strategy, but more systematic efforts, including greater monitoring of the
       effectiveness of those actions and stronger international cooperation on combating organized
       crime, are needed. Such measures will likely run into strong resistance from networks who will
       favor maintaining the status quo.
    Improve center-periphery relations through decentralization and greater community engagement
       in economic and social processes – The limited public resources are devoted primarily to
       financing the functioning of the central administration, at the expense of social services and public
       investment (see paras. 38, 61-62). The success of participatory budgeting at the commune level
       suggests that moving public decision making closer to the people by decentralizing may help make
       policies more responsive to ordinary citizens’ needs. While successive governments in
       Madagascar have discussed and promised decentralization since at least the 1990s, most public
       finances and decision-making remain centralized. (see paras. 68-70). Implementing the existing
       law on decentralization would allow for a greater share of the public finances to be determined at
       the local level. In the long run, such reform could have a strong impact on both inclusiveness and
       sustainability, thus reducing significantly the risks of fragility. It would likely face some
       resistance from the central administration. Further analysis would be required to design
       implementation mechanisms.
    Weaken the elite bargain by cultivating counter-powers, (e.g., civil society, press and national
       assembly) empowering citizens with access to information, and protecting press freedom – As
       institutions tend to be controlled by elite networks, there is a need for a stronger system of checks-
       and-balances on the government and this could be done by (i) reinforcing the capacity of
       Parliament so they are better able to legislate and scrutinize the actions of the government (e.g.
       stronger and more regular engagement in the budgetary process), (ii) supporting measures to
       improve the regulatory framework and capacity of CSOs, particularly the ones operating beyond
       the capital, and (iii) adopting a communication code protecting the freedom of the press and
       guaranteeing citizens’ rights to access to information (see paras. 40-41). While these measures
       would not by themselves have an immediate impact on poverty reduction, they would help limit
       over time the sources of political instability.

209. Madagascar’s development is also hampered by the lack of revenues and poor provision of
services. Tax potential has been estimated at 15 percent of GDP, compared to the current level of 9.7

                                                                                                         108
                                                      

percent, one of the lowest in the world (see paras. 53-59). Low revenues, compounded by the drying up
of external financing during the 2009-2013 crisis, meant that Madagascar has maintained
macroeconomic stability by cutting drastically spending on social services and investment. Over 40
percent of public resources are allocated to civil service wage bill and in 2014, nearly half of the
discretionary spending went to regressive subsidies for fuel and electricity (see paras. 60-62). A priority
is thus to strengthen public finances, a pre-condition to improving public service delivery and financing
high impact investments. The following actions are recommended:
     Increase tax revenues by tackling the underlying causes of low collection – Tax policies are
       generally sound, but tax administration is weak, compliance is low, monitoring is scarce, and there
       is no effective mechanism to sanction agents who engage in corruption (see paras. 55-57). If
       measures are adopted and implemented forcefully, they could quickly help finance a tangible
       increase in service delivery and investments, which – if well targeted – could have a significant
       impact on poverty. It is undeniable that such reforms will face opposition from some agents and
       from businesses that have benefited until now from privileged treatment.
     Establish or re-institute budget oversight mechanisms to create greater accountability and better
       performance on the expenditure side – the regulatory framework for public financial management
       policies has been improving as a result of a series of reforms in budgeting, procurement, and
       treasury and cash management over the last decade. Still, implementation has been weak and
       deteriorated during the last crisis (see paras. 66-67). It is thus recommended to operationalize the
       system to investigate and sanction wrong-doing by civil servants; to audit and publish financial
       accounts of the government and submit them for scrutiny by the National Assembly in a timely
       manner; enforce rules for procurement to assure value for money; and clean up the extra-
       budgetary procedures.
     Finalize PPP framework to engage the private sector in the financing of infrastructure and service
       delivery – building on past experiences in the telecom, energy and transport sectors, the
       government has expressed strong interest in expanding public-private partnerships as a way to
       finance and deliver better services to the people. It will require finalizing and adopting the PPP
       law and strengthening capacity at the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry for Presidential
       Projects, Equipment, and Territorial Development so that PPPs are technically and financially
       sound (see paras. 74-75). Such measures should not meet any opposition, though some groups
       may oppose them as “privatizations.”

210. Unleashing private sector potential will be key to accelerating economic growth. The country
has diverse endowments and the private sector (outside of agriculture) is small but diversified, which is
an asset for stability. The business environment is constrained, however, by strong administrative red-
tape favoring back-channel relationships, back-hand rewards and unfair practices. Disruptions caused
by the recurrent political crises make long-term planning difficult and investment riskier, especially for
those without connections. The findings of the Doing Business and Enterprise Surveys demonstrate that
the private sector is also constrained by poor access to social, financial and physical infrastructure (see
paras. 80-86). The formal SME sector remains small and a large share of informal firms do not see any
benefits from formalization. Although they do not contribute to the central government revenue, they
pay “contributions” to local governments (see paras. 87-90). Three broad areas of reforms are proposed:
     Provide priority complementary public investments in areas propitious for private sector
        development and job creation – with targeted public interventions, some sectors could rebound
        quickly and generate employment, particularly in urban areas: textile and garment, agribusiness
        and industrial fisheries, tourism, and extractive industries (see paras. 102-113). Many of the
        specific measures such as increasing competition of the rice market or seeking regional
        partnerships on air transport would likely run into strong opposition, but they could have a large

                                                                                                       109
                                                     

       impact on job creation, including for workers with limited skills. By providing opportunities for
       increased income to a large number, those measures could also reduce the willingness of low-
       income groups to accept payments in exchange for their participation in political events, thus
       contributing to greater stability.
      Identify and prioritize policy reforms through the new public-private dialogue platform to
       improve investment climate and promote FDI, to enhance the performance of the judicial sector,
       and to address anti-competitive behaviors and enhance firms’ corporate governance – the
       establishment of a credible public-private platform would help ensure that the priority measures
       that the government wishes to adopt to improve private sector growth and employment benefit
       from the views of the private sector (see paras. 114-115). The implementation of measures
       aiming at improving the investment climate could be spearheaded by the Economic Development
       Board of Madagascar. Such measures are straightforward to develop and together with political
       stability, could encourage a rapid growth of investments and the generation of jobs, particularly
       in urban areas.
      Address the main constraints identified by the private sector: reliable access to electricity,
       broader access to finance, and expanded transport infrastructure – the difficulty of accessing
       electricity, a major impediment for investors, is a consequence of three factors: weak government
       capacity to supervise the sector, poor governance in the sector, as well as poor performance of
       the SOE in charge of urban electricity, JIRAMA (see paras. 91-92; 116). The measure that would
       have the greatest short-term impact on business profitability would be to improve the
       performance of JIRAMA. The financial system is mostly stable but long-term financing is
       largely unavailable, financing costs are high, and few individuals access it (see paras. 93-99).
       Increasing financial intermediation will hinge on a combination of supply-side measures (e.g.,
       promoting competition and product innovation), demand-side measures (e.g., improving firms’
       business plans) and financial system improvements (e.g., credit bureau, collateral registries,
       strengthening the capacity of supervising entity). Increasing access to finance, primarily for
       SMEs and individuals, will require enhancing the use of alternative payment services such as
       mobile phones and improving financial literacy (see paras. 118-120). Beyond the immediate
       need to rehabilitate some core transport corridors, the transport sector would benefit from
       continuing reforms that had been initiated in the 2000s to improve the management of the sector
       and develop a medium-term plan of prioritized investments (see paras. 100; 121-123). The level
       of complexity of these reforms means that their impact will be felt in the medium to long term,
       but it would have a strong positive impact on generating employment and reducing poverty.

211. Madagascar’s long-term development will depend on the country’s ability to invest in higher
human capital. The low labor productivity undermines the country’s cost advantage arising from low
wages. It is partly due to low and stagnant educational attainment, but also poor health and nutrition.
Not only the system is not yet capable of providing education to all children, it is failing to prepare
students for both the formal and informal sectors. The country does not fare better on health outcomes:
while there have been some gains in the reduction of child mortality, maternal mortality is stagnating at
a high rate of 500 per 100,000 live births, chronic malnutrition among children under five is one of the
highest in the world, and immunization coverage has decreased in recent years. Those problems affect
disproportionately the poor. They are compounded by persistently high fertility and population growth
rates (respectively, 4.6 births per woman and 2.8 percent growth), and by one of the lowest access rates
to safe drinking water and sanitation. In education, health and nutrition, the main constraints are first
and foremost a lack of public resources and, second, a better targeting of the financial and human
resources so that they help the poorest access those services at a limited out-of-pocket cost (see paras.
130-139). While measures to improve access to education, health and nutrition would not have an

                                                                                                     110
                                                       

immediate large impact on poverty, other than lowering out-of-pocket costs in the short term, they would
be welcomed by communities as tangible signs that the government is intent on providing services to all
Malagasy people. Based on a recent Public Expenditure Review of those sectors, the main
recommendations are the following:
     Support the poorest in accessing education, basic health, and nutrition through the development
       and implementation of a social protection policy (such as conditional cash transfer programs) –
       it is essential to limit out-of-pocket costs to families so they send their children to schools, can
       enhance their nutrition and are not reluctant to go to the first-level rural health centers. Systems
       such as conditional cash transfers or second-chance education programs for children who have
       been out of school for long periods have proven effective in other countries in reducing the
       number of out-of-school children and improving health coverage (see para. 145). One challenge
       is for the Government to develop a strategy for social protection while already starting to deliver
       some flagship initiatives to meet people’s high expectations. The main challenge in adopting
       such measures and implementing them consistently over time is one of availability of financial
       resources.
     Improve the quality and equity of education by investing in pre- and in-service training for all
       teachers, improving the distribution of teachers across the country, and gradually integrating
       trained community teachers in the system, while maintaining local accountability mechanisms –
       quality of education is highly correlated with the quality of teachers. Madagascar has to tackle
       several challenges: reverse the declining trend in public financing for education so it can do
       more than finance civil servant teachers; focus on training teachers and particularly community
       teachers, 90 percent of whom do not have any teaching certificate; ensure that teachers are located
       across the country in a way that matches the distribution of children; and implement a policy to
       regularize gradually qualified community teachers (see para. 132 and box 3). The main challenge
       in implementing these measures will not only be financial, but also in managing the expectations
       of community teachers and in keeping parents engaged in the local decision making and
       monitoring of performance (close to 80 percent of the teachers are community teachers, a third
       of whom are entirely financed by parents).
     Prioritize and invest in first-level rural health facilities, train and distribute health personnel
       across the country, and remove out-of-pocket costs at facility levels, particularly for poorest
       communities – a similar set of recommendations applies to the health sector, focusing on
       community health workers. The use of results-based financing could encourage better
       availability of resources at the facility level (see paras. 150-151).
     Renew focus on nutrition by scaling up interventions that tackle stunting and implement policies
       to improve water and sanitation, starting in urban areas – poor nutrition, limited access to safe
       drinking water and sanitation and indoor air pollution have negative impacts on public health,
       education attainment, and poverty. Actions to address those constraints would have a sustained
       impact on poverty over the longer term. Research is ongoing to identify optimal intervention
       packages to address chronic malnutrition.

212. The lack of progress in reducing extreme poverty is to a large extent due to the failure to
improve the lives of the rural poor, a vast majority of whom work in agriculture or the informal
sector and depend on natural resources for their livelihoods. Labor productivity in the agriculture
sector has been declining over the past 50 years. It can be attributed to limited use of improved
technologies and weak extension services, limited availability and high costs of improved inputs, limited
access to credit, deficient infrastructure (e.g., irrigation infrastructure, storage and roads), lack of land
tenure security, soil degradation as well as weak human capital base (see paras. 157-162; 168-170).


                                                                                                         111
                                                      

Reducing rural poverty will require a set of actions to improve agricultural productivity but also to
increase resilience and improve natural resources management:
     Improve agricultural productivity through the introduction of more productive methods, support
       for local organizations, financing for better farm-level and road infrastructure, enhanced land
       security, and higher human capital – the shortcomings that have been identified as plaguing the
       agricultural sector for decades lead to a set of recommendations that are straightforward, well-
       researched, and accepted by a large number of stakeholders, but they are complex in their
       implementation (see paras. 192-198). These would have the largest and most sustained impact
       on poverty reduction.
     Enhance management of natural resources, by improving the mechanisms through which
       communities benefit from it, adopting a landscape approach that integrates mechanisms for
       better watershed and forest management, and strengthening the capacity of law enforcement – a
       better management of natural resources is essential to ensure that poor rural communities have
       the opportunity to improve their livelihoods in a sustainable way. Land degradation and
       deforestation are mostly consequences of short-sighted actions that farmers make to survive, even
       if they jeopardize future productivity (see paras. 184-188). It is compounded by weak law
       enforcement. Community-based natural resource management can be a pathway out of poverty
       though the evidence has been mixed (see paras. 189-191; 200-204). More analysis and
       experimentation would be required to ensure complementarity of poverty reduction measures
       and sustainability.
     Institute mechanisms for protecting the poor from weather-related shocks through mitigation
       and prevention measures and disaster response financing mechanisms – Madagascar is one of
       the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, suffering from high exposure to climate-
       related events and of a lack of readily available resources to respond and recover. Climate-related
       events are expected to worsen over the next 50 years: rainfall in the south of the country would
       decline while cyclone intensity would increase by 50 percent, potentially affecting agriculture,
       fishing, and social services (see paras. 172-182). A combination of measures to mitigate the
       impact of disasters, to increase preparedness of the communities, and to accelerate post-disaster
       recovery would limit the impact of such disasters on poor people (see para. 199). There is no
       constraint to implementing such measures other than the availability of public resources.

213. The prioritization exercise also highlights additional trade-offs around impact, time horizons
and political opposition to reforms which suggests the need to sequence reforms and ensure
complementarity. A few measures can improve rapidly the lives of a large number of people. Lifting
the financial constraint is essential to expanding investments for infrastructure and in basic services but
would require adopting measures that will face strong opposition from groups that have benefitted from
tax and customs exonerations and from subsidies. . Enabling private sector growth, on the other hand,
would not require major public financing, could have a rapid and sizeable impact on poverty, particularly
in urban areas, and would not be met by unsurmountable resistance from vested interests. Efforts to
increase agricultural productivity and improve natural resources management would have the largest
impact on extreme poverty, but only over the medium to long term. All recommendations to increase
human capital require additional financing, reinforcing the need to prioritize lifting the financial
constraint, and while they do not reduce poverty significantly overnight, they bring hope of a better
future. Finally, when measures are to be implemented at the local level, it would be beneficial to do so

donors have started increasing their funding for Madagascar and are considering further increases. They
are encouraged by the government’s efforts to develop a National Development Plan and an
Implementation Plan. One critical factor in their decision is likely to be the willingness and ability of
the government to break with past practices and tackle some reforms that would generate large public
goods, but require overcoming strong vested interests. A better management of public finances is an
example of such reform.

sanitation       and evaluate the sector performance (increasing access and sustaining services delivery). Collection
                 and consolidation of data not made in systematic manner due to staffing and information gathering
                 constraints. Monitoring system not operational in all 22 regions, as lack of human, financial, logistic
                 resources does not allow systematic data gathering, check of facilities’ conditions, nor relay of
                 information to central level (responsible for update of the functionality data and predictive
                 indicators). Inconsistency observed with data produced by other sources (INSTAT and Joint
                 Monitoring Program by Water and Sanitation Program) despite attempts to revisit definition of
                 objectives and indicators, and harmonize terminologies to allow data reliability, consistency and
                 comparability at local and global level.
