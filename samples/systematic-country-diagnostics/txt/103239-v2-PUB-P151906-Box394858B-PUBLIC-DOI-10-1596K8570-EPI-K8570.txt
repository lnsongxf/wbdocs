   BOX 2.1  International Benchmarking: Poverty and Inequalitya

   Honduras’ global extreme poverty rate is higher than its structural peers and four times higher than
   its aspirational peers; its inequality rates are the highest among both structural and aspirational peers.
   As of 2012, the last year for which comparable global poverty rates have been published, Honduras’
   extreme poverty rate was slightly higher than the average poverty of countries identified as structural
   peers (­figure B2.1.1). Compared to aspirational peers, Honduran poverty was four times, or about
   19 percentage points, higher. Similarly, inequality, measured using the Gini Coefficient, has been
   consistently higher in Honduras relative to its peers (figure B2.1.2).b On average, both structural and
   aspirational peers have inequality of around 0.40 throughout the period even while Honduras’
   fluctuates near 0.60. Notably, Peru and El Salvador have decreased their inequality levels over the
   last decade: Peru’s Gini decreased from 0.53 in 2003 to 0.45 in 2011 while El Salvador’s decreased
   to 0.42 during the same period.

   Note: See appendix A for how the aspirational and structural peers were identified. The average Gini coefficient was calculated for structural
   and aspirational peers. For Nicaragua and Chile values were interpolated using WDI data for years in which data were unavailable. For
   Senegal, only 2001, 2005 and 2011 were available. For Morocco only 2001 and 2007 data were available. For Latvia 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007,
   2009 values were missing. Finally, for Lithuania 2007 and 2009 were missing.
   a. For global comparisons, two sets of countries have been identified. Structural peers and aspirational peers (see appendix A).
   b. Care should be taken in interpreting the Gini coefficient across regions as many countries outside of the LAC region rely on welfare
   aggregates based on consumption, while in LAC, the welfare aggregate is based on income. Income-based inequality measures tend to be
   higher than consumption-based measures.

BOX 2.2  Indigenous Peoples and Afro-Descendants in Honduras

An estimated 8.6 percent of the Honduran population is made up of Indigenous Peoples and
­Afro-descendants.a There are seven indigenous groups (Miskito, Pech, Tawahka, Nahua, Tolupán,
Chortí y Lenca), one group considered both indigenous and Afro-descendant (the Garifunas) and one
­
Afro-descendant group, the Creoles. While the IP are concentrated in the southwest and northeast
corners of the country, the AD are primarily along the Caribbean coast (map B2.2.1). Social structures
­
in these groups remain strong and, except for the Lenca and the Chorti, the groups have kept their
­
languages. Given the lack of information about the IP and AD populations in the Honduran household
surveys, there are no official estimates of the poverty rates for these groups. However, other analysis
suggests that poverty rates are high among indigenous groups: rough estimations from indigenous
organizations indicate that over 70 percent live in poverty and over half of the population is not
employed (Faúndez-Meléndez and Valdés-Castillo 2011). Agriculture is the predominant activity for
most IP and AD groups in Honduras.

 Note: The figure is the result of the Huppi and Ravalion (1991) decomposition of labor income poverty. The decomposition calculates the change in
 poverty that is due strictly to changes in labor income. This approach abstracts from the effects of changes in non-labor income, such as public
 transfers or pensions. To accomplish this, changes in poverty are calculated using labor income poverty rates–the proportion of households with
 labor income of less than US$4 per day per capita. The intrasectoral component refers to the sector of employment of the main earner in the
 household.

 Poverty	23
          BOX 2.3  Improvements in Honduras’ CCT System

          In 2010 the Government launched a national consolidated conditional cash transfer (CCT) program,
          Bono 10,000, which rapidly became the country’s main social assistance vehicle. Its annual funding was
          equal to 0.7 percent of GDP (US$ 130 million), and by 2013 the program reached almost 20 percent of
          the population, including 270,000 rural households and 50,000 urban households. Before 2009 the
          Government had operated two CCT programs that provided income transfers to extreme poor rural
          households in extreme poverty: Bono Solidario, which encouraged regular health checkups for infants,
          and Bono Escolar, which promoted primary school enrollment among children aged 6–13. Bono 10,000
          consolidated these programs and expanded its targeting to include both extreme and moderately poor
          families with children under the age of 5 or in primary school. The program paid a benefit of 10,000
          lempiras (US$500) per year to its beneficiaries, ranking it among the most generous CCT programs
          in the world.
          In 2014 the CCT program, now called Bono Vida Mejor, was enhanced, and it became the core intervention
          of the government’s social development strategy, Estrategia Vida Mejor. To improve the fiscal sustainability
          of the program, the targeting formula was revised to restrict eligibility to beneficiary families classified as
          extremely poor. Coverage was expanded to students in lower secondary school to address the country’s
          relatively high dropout rate. Benefits are now based on the number of eligible children in the household
          and capped at 10,000 lempiras. The program’s expansion prioritized areas that (a) had high rates of extreme
          poverty, (b) were prone to severe droughts, (c) were home to indigenous communities, and (d) suffered
          from a high child incidence of child migration during the recent surge in undocumented child migrants
          leaving for the US. The program is still evolving and the government is keen to strengthen the institution
          that executes the program.

                        BOX 2.4  Characteristics of Migrants

                        The first significant wave of Honduran migrants to the United States left in the aftermath of Hurricane
                        Mitch in 1998. After the hurricane devastated much of the country, Honduran immigrants were granted
                        Temporary Protected Status (TPS) by the US government, granting them work authorization and
                        protection against deportation. Even though the TPS only applied to those arriving before the end of
                        1998, increasing numbers of Hondurans continued to migrate to the US. Today, the majority of the
                        Honduran-born population in the US is undocumented.
                        In recent years Honduran migrants have become increasingly bimodal in terms of their education and
                        skill levels, revealing the changing dynamics that motivate and facilitate migration. Since 2010 Honduran
                        migrants have become more likely to have either a primary education or less, or a completed secondary
                        education or more. Whereas those with an incomplete secondary education accounted for more than half
                        of post-Mitch migrants, they accounted for just one in ten adult migrants after 2010 (figure B2.4.1).
                        The job profiles of Honduran immigrants have also changed: prior to 2000, only 25 percent of Honduran
                        migrants worked in construction or food service, but by 2010 this share had doubled. These patterns
                        reflect increasing emigration by poorer Hondurans. This is confirmed by the change in the distribution of
                        receipt of remittances observed between 2003 and 2013. In 2003, the bulk of remittances went to the top
                        quintile, but most now go to the middle quintiles.
                        Recent Honduran migrants to the US are younger on average and include more children. While in
                        the initial wave, approximately 80 percent of migrants were 25 or older, this age group accounted
                        for 70 percent of those arriving in the US between 2010 and 2013; instead, more than a quarter
                        of migrants were 15 or younger during this period, suggesting more family migration and
                        reunification.
                        The recent surge in child migrants to the US has led to a joint effort with El Salvador and Guatemala
                        to address the structural causes of migration. Fleeing poverty, lack of opportunity and some of the
                        highest crime rates in the world, the number of unaccompanied minors from Honduras detained at the

                                  BOX 2.5  Analyzing the Determinants of Remittances in Honduras

                                  Although external factors are the most relevant explaining changes in remittance flows to Honduras,
                                  domestic factors are also important. A time-series Vector Autoregressive Regression (VAR) analysis
                                  conducted for this SCD finds that, in line with findings in the literature, the economic cycle in the U.S. is
                                  the most important factor explaining changes in remittance flows to Honduras: almost 40 percent of the
                                  variation in remittance flows is explained by U.S. economic activity. Similarly, a deterioration of
                                  employment among Honduran workers in the U.S. is associated with weaker remittance flows back home.
                                  Conditions in global financial markets and the stance of monetary policy in the U.S. also appear to
                                  influence remittance flows. But not everything is external, as Honduras’ GDP explains around 25 percent
                                  of the variability in remittance flows. Higher economic activity in Honduras implies a greater demand for
                                  labor and higher wages, as well as an increase in wealth. Hence, as GDP growth in Honduras accelerates,
                                  the demand for non-labor income falls and so remittances decrease.

                             BOX 3.1  Honduras’ Exposure to Natural Hazards

                             Disasters associated with natural hazards, in particular climate-related events, have repeatedly derailed
                             growth. Honduras’ inherent vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change is an additional source
                             of macroeconomic uncertainty. The country is highly exposed to hurricanes and tropical storms, mainly
                             from the Atlantic, as well as dry periods associated with the El Niño weather cycle.a Between 1994 and
                             2013 Honduras suffered the highest average annual economic losses due to climate-related disasters in
                             Central America. During this period the cumulative impact of small-scale climate-related disasters
                             ­
                             (without taking into account damages from Hurricane Mitch) resulted in average economic losses of
                             2.5 percent of GDP per year (Global Climate Risk Index 2015). Hurricane Mitch, the worst disaster in
                             Honduras’ recent history, devastated the country in 1998, abruptly ending a period of economic expan-
                             sion. It affected 90 percent of Honduras’ territory, resulting in over 5,700 dead, 8,000 missing, and almost
                             half a million people displaced (GFDRR 2010). It also destroyed more than 50 percent of the country’s
                             road infrastructure and 70 percent of its water network and damaged about 400,000 houses (ECLAC
                             1999). Subsequent extreme hydro-meteorological events since Hurricane Mitch suggest that Honduras’
                             disaster vulnerability is on the rise. Most recently, eight tropical storms and hurricanes of various magni-
                             tudes had pronounced damages on the Atlantic coast with effects extending to the entire territory, nota-
                             bly Hurricane Felix in 2007, Tropical Depression Sixteen in 2008, and Tropical Depression 12E in 2011,
                             which caused economic losses estimated at US$ 200 million (ECLAC 2010).
                             a. Honduras is also vulnerable to earthquakes, though in recent years only a single major earthquake has struck the country. Nevertheless,
                             probabilistic risk models estimate losses associated with an event of a 500 year return period at approximately US$2.2 billion, represent-
                             ing 6.3 percent of GDP, and an average annual loss due to earthquake equivalent to US$ 35.5 million, or 0.103 percent of 2013 GDP (CCRIF
                             SPC 2014).

  Economic Growth in Honduras: Challenges and Opportunities	35
  Knowledge Gap  What Are the Determinants of Low Returns to
  Investment in Honduras?

  Since the 1990s Honduras’ investment-to-GDP ratio has been high by regional standards, yet productiv-
  ity gains have been persistently low. This strong accumulation of capital was sustained throughout the
  period but did not result in higher productivity growth and hence faster economic growth. A majority of
  this investment is private, including substantial FDI inflows, with public investment making a limited
  contribution. However, in contrast to other countries Honduras demonstrates no significant positive
  ­
  correlation between the investment ratio and GDP growth. Capital accumulation has contributed an
  average of just 1.7 percentage points to GDP growth since the early 1980s. The reasons for the apparently
  low impact of investment on growth are not fully understood. Possible explanations may involve the
  sectoral allocation of investment or the high cost of doing business. Appendix E presents preliminary
  ­
  research on the relationship between investment and growth in Honduras.

  Knowledge Gap  What Is the Full Cost of Crime to the Honduran Economy?

  Media reports suggest that gang violence and extortion have resulted in the closure of small businesses,
  causing employment losses. While some gangs profit from the international drug trade, others gener-
  ate income primarily through extortion payments from businesses and citizens, commonly known as
  the “impuesto de guerra,” or “war tax”a. Extortion demands range from US$20 to US$5,000 per month,
  and failure to pay often results in harassment, death threats, or violence by gang members. In 2012, the
  impuesto de guerra was estimated to have caused the closure of approximately 1,600 businesses in
  Tegucigalpa alone. Together these firms employed nearly ten thousand workers and consisted primar-
  ily of bakeries, beauty salons, food stands, hardware stores and other small and medium enterprises
  (El Heraldo 2014). Extortion payments have also affected activity in the capital’s central market,

  BOX 3.2  Quality of Schooling

  Quality of schooling in Honduras remains internationally low, with Honduran students underperforming
  in language, mathematics and science. International assessments in 2011, the Trends in Mathematics and
  Science Study (TIMSS) and Progress in International Reading and Literacy Survey (PIRLS), confirm that
  Honduran students are performing below average. Even though 4th grade tests were applied to 6th grad-
  ers in Honduras, by recommendation of the TIMSS and PIRLS International Study Center, Honduran
  6th graders underperformed in TIMSS Mathematics (figure B3.2.1) and PIRLS. Similarly, despite the
  8th grade test being applied to 9th graders, results in TIMSS Mathematics were even lower.

  BOX 3.3  Governance Challenges in ENEE

  ENEE is one of the few remaining vertically integrated power utilities in Latin America and faces
  governance challenges. In Honduras, only the generation business has been opened to private investors.
  ­
  ENEE is solely responsible for the transmission and distribution businesses, which are aggregated in
  regional clusters with a high level of decision autonomy in expenditures. In contrast, ENEE’s decisions on
  power purchases to meet the demand are centralized, and billing and collection are outsourced to the pri-
  vate sector, with suboptimal control from ENEE. As a result of this decentralized/centralized structure,
  the regional clusters hold limited accountability for financial results and hinder corporate control on
  loses and expenditures, impacting negatively on ENEE’s performance. At the same time, ten CEOs have
  led ENEE since 2005; this has resulted in weak governance, lack of a long-term strategy, limited internal
  control and has deteriorated the company’s operational and financial performance.
  Obsolete internal control systems lessen the management capability to run the company efficiently.
  Information provided by the internal control systems to the decision-makers is usually inadequate,
  unreliable and frequently not available in a timely manner. A symptom of this deficiency is the unsuc-
  ­
  cessful attempt of ENEE to go through an audit process of its financial statements in the past. The lack
  of reliable information and acceptable internal control procedures have been central arguments raised by
  the Auditing Companies for not subscribing ENEE’s financial statements. Last auditing took place in
  2010 with negative results. Based on the comments of the auditing company and supported by multilat-
  eral organizations, including the World Bank, ENEE has undertaken the auditing of its 2014 financial
  statements. This exercise is expected to be concluded by 2016.
  The World Bank Group is collaborating with the Government of Honduras to improve ENEE’s
  institutional framework. The Bank has supported the implementation of adequate internal control
  ­
  ­
  systems and the definition of a modern organizational structure, in line with best international practices.
  These instruments altogether with ENEE’s further modernization, legislative reforms in the power
  sector–General Law of Electric Industry approved in 2013—and strong political willingness and support,
  ­
  will be key to overcome the current situation and improve the governance of the institution. The
  Government of Honduras has given first steps towards a structural change in the sector, by appointing
  the three Commissioners of the recently created Regulatory body (Comisión Reguladora de Energía
  Eléctrica, CREE) on June 19, 2015 and by approving ENEE’s new organization structure.

  Knowledge Gap  What Is the Effect of Labor Market Regulations on
  Job Creation, Informal Employment and Unemployment in Honduras?

  Formal employment in Honduras is heavily regulated; these regulations may contribute to the high rate
  of informality by restricting the ability of firms to adjust their workforce. Evidence that these rigidities in
  regulation may hurt job creation is seen in the creation of 177,000 new jobs after the passage of the
  Hourly Employment Law of 2010, which allowed for the temporary hiring of workers for specific tasks at
  an hourly or daily rate.

 Equity, Equality, and Social Inclusion in Honduras	73
    While the labor market should be expected to                large increase in minimum wage in 2008, formal
reward workforce skills, the small size of the                  sector workers earned nearly 30  percent more
Honduran formal sector and the country’s rela-                  than informal workers, but by 2013 the wage gap
tively high minimum wage exacerbate the gap in                  had widened to 65 percent. Yet informal employ-

      Knowledge Gap  What Is the Impact of the Country’s High Minimum
      Salaries on Job Creation, Particularly for Unskilled Workers?

      Economic research has found evidence that high minimum salaries deter the creation of employment,
                                                                                                           ­ alary
      and jobs requiring low skills are the most likely to be affected. Evidence suggests that the minimum s
      increase has led to a widening earnings gap between formal and informal workers in Honduras. However,
      no analysis has yet measured the impact of this policy change in terms of lost employment in the formal
      and informal sectors.




      BOX 4.1  The Minimum Salary and Inequality

      The large gap between the minimum salary and the average wage in the labor market limits the extent to
      which the minimum wage can influence wages in the informal sector. In 2008 the minimum wage for most
      formal sector workers was increased by 60 percent, and it now significantly exceeds the average wage in the
      economy as a whole. Though they are not enforceable in the informal sector, minimum wages often operate
      as a strong pay signal by indicating what is considered “fair” or “adequate” compensation.a This effect can be
      observed in the wage distribution of workers in countries like Brazil and Colombia, for example (World Bank
      2015e). However, evidence suggests that in Honduras, setting the minimum wage too high has weakened its
      effect on the informal sector (figure B4.1.1). The informal wage distribution shifted when the minimum wage
      was raise. In 2013, 62 percent of informal workers earned less than 90 percent of the minimum wage, down
      from 47 percent in 2008. By contrast, more modest increases in Brazil’s minimum wage between 2005 and
      2006 (15 and 17 percent, respectively) did not affect the share of informal sector workers earning less than the
      minimum. This may be due to Brazil’s minimum wage being closer to the average wage.
      Minimum wages in Honduras are set by sector, and the low minimum wage for agricultural workers—who
      are among the poorest in the country—may be widening the overall wage gap. Between 2003 and 2013, the
      average minimum wage grew by 225 percent in nominal terms, but the agricultural sector’s minimum wage
      increased by just 159 percent. Meanwhile, the gap between the wages of agricultural workers and workers in
      all other sectors widened. In 2003, the maquila, utilities and financial sectors all had minimum salaries that
      were 123 percent higher than the agricultural sector. By 2013 all sectors of the Honduran economy had
      minimum wages that were at least 134 percent higher than agriculture. Notably, the minimum wage for
      ­maquila workers fell from the highest in 2003 to the second-lowest in 2013, with only agricultural workers
      earning less. Even so, the labor costs of the country’s maquilas are high by international standards.b

  Knowledge Gap  What Are the Challenges Facing Increased Female
  Inclusion into the Labor Force?

  Approximately two thirds of agricultural workers’ wives do not report being in the labor force, even
  though production activities in small farms are typically undertaken by all family members. Low labor
  force participation rates among women in Honduras may be due in part to the underreporting of
  ­
  women’s involvement in agricultural production, food processing and distribution (Dewalt et al. 1985;
  Colverson 1995). However, traditional gender roles, poverty, lack of access to capital, and violence may
  be limiting the ability of Honduran women to gainfully enter the labor force.

  BOX 4.2  The Social Security System

  Though it covers less than 20 percent of workers, the government spends a considerable amount of
  resources on the social security system. In 2012 the country’s social security schemes, most of which
  operate on a pay-as-you-go contributory mechanism, amounted to 4.6 percent of GDP. The Honduran
  Social Security Institution (Instituto Hondureño de Seguridad Social, IHSS) is the country’s largest
  scheme. It covers formal workers in the private sector and offers health insurance and workers
  compensation in addition to social security benefits. Separate social security institutions cover public
  employees (INJUPEMP), teachers (INPREMA), police and military (IPM) and employees of the National
  University of Honduras (INPREUNAH). The social security regime at IHSS is a defined-benefits system
  funded by a 3 percent contribution rate with a cap that is currently lower than the minimum wage and
  therefore insufficient to finance any meaningful social security benefit. The government has made
  various efforts to reform the country’s social security institutions, all of which suffer from actuarial
  deficits and poor management. The most recent reform was carried out in 2011 at INPREMA and
  successfully reduced its actuarial deficit from 29 percent of GDP to between 9 and 13 percent.
  The IHSS social security regime suffers from structural weaknesses. The IHSS lacks a digitalized
  history of contributions. When applying for a benefit, the member is asked for a list of his or her former
  employers, and then IHSS manually reviews the paper records of the employer’s historical declarations
  to establish the history of contributions. IHSS only has a database of affiliates in digital form, some of
  whom may end up never contributing to the system. Weak information management also limits the
  information available to project future liabilities and analyze the impact of reform efforts. As a result of
  low ­contribution rates and an outdated benefit formula, IHSS members receive low benefits.
  Due to its focus on formal sector workers the IHSS is deeply regressive, and the system’s regressivity is
  exacerbated by its use of housing saving accounts. These are individual saving accounts financed through an
  uncapped contribution of at least 3 percent of salaries. Although all workers in the formal sector contribute
  ­
  to this system, only those who earn more than double the minimum wage (approximately 20 percent of
  covered workers) are entitled to request mortgage credits backed by this account, making it steeply regressive.

  BOX 4.3  The Education System

  Poor teacher performance, including high rates of absenteeism, has been a core contributor to the
  country’s low educational outcomes. Although Honduras spends heavily on teachers’ wages, both in
  terms of GDP and as a share of the education budget, its student-teacher ratio is higher than in
  neighboring countries and twice as high as in comparable countries worldwide. Weak institutional
  oversight has led to the accumulation of ghost workers, which accounted for 23 percent of the public
  payroll in 2010.a In addition, an estimated 60 percent of teachers are not qualified for their position, and
  only 90 of the 200 official school days are spent on academic tasks (World Bank 2015b). Honduran
  teachers tend to score poorly on university entrance exams, suggesting negative selection into teaching.
  Over the last decade the school year has been frequently disrupted by teacher strikes and demonstrations,
  and between 2002 and 2011 Honduran schools were closed for approximately a third of the total number
  of class days.b Even when school is in session, teachers spend an average of just 64 percent of class time
  on learning activities (SEDUC 2011).
  Between 2012 and 2015 the government passed the Fundamental Law of Education, the Higher
  Education Law and the Law for Strengthening Public Education and Community Participation. These
  reforms extended the school year by about 25 days to compensate for lost days, and Honduran schools
  now regularly achieve the 200 school-day mark. In an attempt to increase enrollment in secondary school
  the targeting formula for Bono Vida Mejor was expanded to cover students in lower secondary education
  as well as primary. The government has also taken steps to ensure the timely payment of teacher salaries,
  thereby addressing a core complaint of teachers unions, and enacted new regulations designed to curb
  absenteeism and limit strikes.
   The government has also established an Integrated Education Management Information System (EMIS)
   consolidating student-level, teacher-level and administrative information. The EMIS helped eliminate
   ­
   almost 3,000 ghost workers from the education payroll, saving an estimated US$20 million annually.
   The EMIS also helped prioritize capital investment in education through the creation of a sectoral
  ­master plan.
  a. Due to the inaccuracies of the Ministry of Education database, the true number of ghost teachers cannot be determined, in addition, it is
  possible that some teachers were actually working in other schools and not included in the sample or were not recorded at the time.
  b. Teachers represent about half of all civil servants and are highly organized with a strong union. The World Bank 2007 Country Assistance
  Strategy (CAS) suggests that much of the school year is lost to teachers’ work-stoppages. For further information on teachers’ unions in
  Honduras, see Arcia and Gargiulo 2010.

   BOX 4.4  Public Procurement in Honduras

   Public procurement systems in Honduras suffer from institutional weaknesses, including a lack of
   clarity in the roles of leading agencies, inadequate staff and funding, and unreliable information
   systems, which negatively impact the efficiency of public spending. The National Procurement Office
   (ONCAE) recently launched a new electronic procurement platform (HonduCompras) linked to the
   public financial management system. However, ONCAE has consistently suffered from high staff
   turnover and is currently understaffed. This jeopardizes the consolidation of the savings achieved
   through the implementation of the electronic procurement system, as well as a first set of pilot
   framework agreements for interinstitutional coordination. The agency is attempting to perform a
   strategic analysis of public procurement trends and their policy implications, but the success of this
   work depends on the opening of staff positions in ONCAE by the Civil Service Directorate. During
   the development of the HonduCompras platform ONCAE lacked the institutional capacity to serve as
   a counterpart to the software development firm that installed the system. As part of the reorganization
   of the Executive Branch initiated by the new administration ONCAE was shifted from the Ministry of
   Finance to the newly created Presidential Directorate for Transparency and Modernization of the
   State (PDTMS), which has a distinctly different vision regarding the role of ONCAE. The government
   has also resorted to outsourcing the procurement of medical supplies to UNOPS in an effort to
   improve transparency and efficiency.

BOX 5.1  Recent Measures Aimed at Reducing the Fiscal Deficit

Tax policy and tax administration. Key tax policy measures include: (a) an increase in the VAT rate
from 12 to 15 percent, bringing it slightly above the LAC average of 14 percent; (b) the elimination of
selected VAT import and income tax exemptions; (c) the reduction of the minimum tax-exemption
threshold for the income tax; and (d) an increase in the average fuel tax by about US$0.25 per gallon
(excluding fuel used for electricity generation). The authorities are restructuring the Revenue Authority
by: (a) strengthening the Large Taxpayers Unit (LTU); and (b) modernizing the DEI’s IT system.
Public debt management: A medium-term debt management framework has been adopted, and the
authorities have exchanged short-maturity bonds (due in 2016–18) for new bonds with longer maturities.
Power sector: To reduce ENEE’s structural deficit, electricity tariffs were increased by 12 percent in
October 2014 and by a further 9 percent in December 2014. Electricity subsidies were eliminated for
those consuming more than 75 kWh per month. A new Electricity Law was adopted in 2014 which
(a) defines sector responsibilities under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; (b) creates a new
Electricity Regulatory Commission responsible for defining methodologies for establishing tariffs and
technical standards as well as overseeing transparency in bidding processes; (c) allows private sector par-
ticipation in transmission and distribution; (d) establishes an Independent Market Operator to develop
generation contracts and guarantee supply adequacy; and (e) restructures ENEE into a holding company
with subsidiaries for generation, transmission, and distribution in order to improve accountability and
cost efficiency, and reduce cross subsidies. In 2015 ENEE’s wage bill was reduced by 40 percent, reducing
its deficit by 0.25 percent of GDP.
Public financial management: Supported by a Fiscal Emergency Law the government has begun stream-
lining the public sector through: (a) nominal wage freezes in 2014 and 2015, and (b) the elimination of
60 percent of positions that were unfilled at end-2013. As a result, the non-financial public sector wage
bill declined by 1.4 percent of GDP in 2014, though the full impact of the reform will only materialize
over the medium-term due to the cost of severance payments. A public employment census was com-
pleted in 2014, and public sector employees are now recorded in a central database integrated with the
automated payroll system. To enhance the scope of public-private partnerships (PPPs) the authorities
have: (a) introduced a PPP framework law creating a fiscal risk unit within the Ministry of Finance; and
(b) repealed the law allowing government guarantees for debt contracted by companies involved in PPP
projects. The government has also implemented measures to enhance procurement mechanisms, includ-
ing the adoption of an e-procurement law and the signing of shared services agreements to eliminate
duplicate procurement functions.
State-owned enterprises: The government adopted a plan to restore the medium-term financial sustain-
ability of the state telephone company (HONDUTEL) by (a) appointing a new administration in 2014
with a plan to reduce the number of business units by half; (b) reducing non-essential spending, includ-
ing a 35 percent reduction in the workforce, limiting overtime hours, curbing outsourcing and decreasing
energy consumption; (c) improving network efficiency and enhancing maintenance and monitoring
mechanisms; and (d) building a strategic partnership with a private company to provide bundled
services.
Monetary, exchange rate, and financial sector policies: The authorities adopted a multiyear plan to
recapitalize the Central Bank through non-negotiable bonds bearing a positive real interest rate, and the
central bank has implemented short-term liquidity-management policy. The Central Bank is also taking
advantage of the flexible exchange-rate regime, allowing the Honduran lempira to depreciate by 5 percent
during 2015. Financial sector reforms include: (a) stricter regulations aimed at reducing exposure to cur-
rency mismatches by unhedged borrowers, (b) stronger pension fund investment policies designed to
protect resources and maintain adequate returns, (c) the passage of Anti-Money Laundering and
Combatting the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) legislation.

    Knowledge Gap  How Does Crime Affect the Welfare of the Bottom
    40 Percent in Honduras?

    There is limited information on how crime affects the welfare of lower-income households in Honduras.
    Data collection in this area is challenging not only because of the high levels of violence in poorer neigh-
    borhoods, but also because of the reluctance of respondents to speak openly about crime. Efforts to
    improve data collection and analysis will be necessary to develop evidence-based policies in this areas.

  BOX 5.2  Improving Environmental and Social Safeguard: Corporación
  Dinant Case

  In 2009, International Finance Corporation (IFC) provided a loan to Corporacion Dinant a large verti-
  cally integrated Crude Palm Oil, snacks and food producer based in Honduras. IFC’s investment in
  Dinant was subsequently audited by the compliance advisor ombudsman (CAO) in 2013 following com-
  plaints from Human Rights NGOs referring to Dinant’s security forces involved in confrontation with
  armed farmer groups. Both campesinos and Dinant security guards died in the course of campesino land
  incursions on Dinant palm plantations. The CAO identified shortcomings in the environmental and
  social due diligence carried out by IFC at the time of its investment and during supervision.
  Improvements and Remedial Actions: At the institutional level IFC has taken a number of steps to
  strengthen its Performance Standards (particularly with respect to agricultural supply chains) in response
  to lessons learned from cases such as Dinant. At the micro level, and prepared in consultation with stake-
  holders, an Enhanced Action Plan (EAP) articulates IFC’s response to the CAO audit and is currently
  under implementation. The EAP seeks to address both Dinant-specific environmental and social
  improvements as well as some of the critical and more systemic social, security and environmental issues
  that are manifested in the agrarian conflicts around land in the Aguán Valley. In parallel, IFC with the
  support of consultants experienced in conflict resolution and the Voluntary Principles on Human Rights
  (Consensus Building Institute and Foley Hoag), are carrying out a stakeholder Engagement and Dispute
  Resolution process and monitoring Dinant’s security plan to ensure consistency with the Voluntary
  Principles for Security and Human Rights (VPSHR) and also advising on investigative protocols for past
  allegations regarding Dinant’s security personnel.
  To date, there has been significant progress in implementing the EAP. At the company level and as per
  IFC requirements, Dinant has undertaken a social baseline study for all project sites to better inform
  engagement with communities, is implementing a grievance management mechanism, and has hired new
  community liaison officers. The company has updated its security procedures following the VPSHR
  (reviewed by security consultant and Foley Hoag); hired a new Security Manager and currently in process
  of hiring a new private security contractor and now vets all new security personnel against defined proto-
  cols as per VPSHR. The company has carried out a security forum with communities in order to produce
  Community Risk Assessment for some locations and is the first company in Honduras to disarm its secu-
  rity guards to reduce the likelihood of armed conflict.

  Under the stakeholder dialogue process led by Consensus Building Institute, campesino organizations,
  local communities, Dinant and the GoH are deeply engaged in a process which seeks to address
  systemic issues relating to impunity, land and the future economic development of the Aguán. The
  ­
  Government of Honduras has expressed support for this initiative and has indicated at the highest
  ­
  levels that it is committed to find sustainable solutions to address the structural issues related to the
  Bajo Aguán conflict by: a) promoting dialogue with key stakeholders; b) strengthening capacity and
  capacity of the investigative bodies looking into human rights crimes; c) clarifying and reviewing his-

   BOX 5.3  Measures to Improve Resilience and Disaster Risk Management

   •	 Develop an effective budget management strategy that allows for the rapid mobilization of resources
      in the event of a natural disaster while still protecting fiscal accounts. When a disaster strikes,
      Honduras will have to mobilize resources quickly without jeopardizing its fiscal stability. A financial
      protection strategy that combines a number of instruments in a risk-layering approach could help
      the country meet its financial needs and manage fiscal volatility. The strategy should incorporate:
      (a) budget allocations and reserves, (b) contingent credit, and (c) risk-transfer instruments.
   •	 Improve the management of meteorological and geological knowledge, early warning systems and
      climate data to support informed decision making. Effective risk reduction and climate change
      adaptation policies should be based on reliable data. Improving monitoring, forecasting and early
      warning systems, and generating the required evidence base for climate variability and climate change
      would be important steps in this regard. The monitoring and modeling capacity of geological hazards
      should also be strengthened. This will require bolstering existing observation networks, as well as
      reinforcing the financial sustainability of the recently established National Center for Atmospheric,
      Oceanographic and Seismic Studies and improving other coordination mechanisms focusing on
      climate and geological information.
   •	 Assess and reduce the structural vulnerability of public assets. Focusing on the structural dimensions
      of resilience by conducting risk assessments of public infrastructure, including schools and other
      public buildings, would identify vulnerabilities and improve risk mitigation. At the same time, the
      capacity to understand infrastructure vulnerability and effectively incorporate this information into
      decision making at the local level must also be enhanced.
   •	 Strengthen territorial and sectoral planning processes to better integrate risk-reduction criteria and
      land-use planning. Effectively managing disaster risk and reducing vulnerability will require substan-
      tial efforts to build strategic planning capacity at the local and sectoral levels. The integration of
      risk-management strategies into planning tools would help reduce vulnerabilities associated with
      inefficient land use, poor water management and inappropriate building practices. This should be
      complemented by efforts to better incorporate disaster-risk management and climate change adapta-
      tion criteria into the public investment process.

Note: Formality is defined as workers that contribute to the social security system; the question for social security starts in 2005, thus no data is
presented for 2003. Wage refers to hourly total labor income (2005 PPP dollars). Employers and unpaid family workers are excluded from this table.

Note: Formality is defined as workers that contribute to the social security system; the question for social security starts in 2005, thus no data is
presented for 2003. Wage refers to hourly total labor income (2005 PPP dollars). Unpaid workers are excluded from this table.
