PREAMBLE

This SCD was prepared during the still unresolved conflict in northern Mali. The roots of this conflict are
multiple. One major element is Mali’s system of ‘consensus politics’ which has led to governance problems
that are also responsible for poor levels of service delivery and elite capture of budgets, policies and
institutions. Addressing the conflict is a priority in the short term. In its presence little meaningful
development and poverty reduction can take place. In the long term, addressing the underlying governance
problems is of primordial importance. The feasibility of attaining these ambitions may, however, be limited.

1.       This document presents the Systematic Country Diagnosis (SCD) for Mali. The SCD
was prepared following a consultative process within and outside the World Bank. It identifies
constraints and opportunities for achieving the twin goals of ending poverty and improving shared
prosperity by 2030 while acknowledging (i) the need for selectivity in pro-poor interventions, and
(ii) the many competing “binding” reasons for poverty in Mali. The objectives of the twin goals
are similar for Mali as the incidence of dollar-a-day poverty exceeds 40 percent of the population.

2.      Selectivity means the identification of principal opportunities for poverty reduction
in the next 15 years, as well as the identification of binding constraints to reaping such
opportunities. In the search for selectivity, there is the risk of not identifying the correct set of
opportunities and constraints. However, the risk of not being selective would probably have more
serious implications as it could lead the government and its development partners to disperse their
resources and attention too thinly over too many competing priorities.

3.      Selectivity also implies making trade-offs between immediate and longer term
objectives. In this document priority is given to the identification of poverty reduction
opportunities which could deliver results before 2030, while acknowledging that efforts should not
undermine the prospects for poverty reduction and shared prosperity beyond 2030. In this regard,
particular attention is paid to environmental and fiscal sustainability.

4.       This SCD is prepared as Mali experiences protracted insecurity following a
resurgence of the conflict in the north. Significant areas of the north are not under government
control and there have been numerous attacks on soldiers from the Malian armed forces and the
UN peacekeeping mission (MINUSMA), as well as occasional fighting among rebel groups. A
preliminary peace accord was signed between the government and six rebels groups, but whether
it will be ratified (planned for June 20, 2015) and bring lasting peace remains to be seen. Many of
the rebel groups that operate in the north did not participate in the negotiations and violence
continues unabated.

5.      This tumultuous period comes after two decades of relative stability, with a
multiparty democracy viewed as West Africa’s success story. Mali’s transition to democracy
started when coup leader Amadou Toumani Touré (ATT) did not present himself as candidate for
the elections in 1992. The new leadership under president Alpha Oumar Konaré got off to a good
start aiming to generate economic growth to help the poor get out of poverty. The new impetus
managed to enhance access to services (between 1990 and 2010, life expectancy increased from
47 to 54 and gross primary school enrollment from 27 percent to 80 percent) and led to the
implementation of reforms such as the liberalization of the grain market.

6.     Mali’s democratic transition benefitted initially from strong legitimacy. It was shaped
during a national conference1 (1991) with nearly 2,000 participants representing a broad range of
society during which the building blocks for a democratic system were agreed: a civilian
government with regular elections, an independent constitutional court, political decentralization,
and various participatory mechanisms which built on a strong tradition of dialogue.2 During the
subsequent two decades, Mali passed the “elections” test of a peaceful electoral transition by
bringing to power a president who did not belong to the incumbent’s party.3 At the same time, a
small political elite continued to dominate - out of more than one hundred political parties, only a
few could ever mobilize more than 5,000 votes.

7.      Legacies from the past put stress on the consolidation of the newly secured
democracy. Mali’s centralized and hierarchical administrative system, with a strong presidency,
and “the problem of the North” with calls from various groups (including some Tuareg groups)
for both more autonomy and more economic support was at odds with a strong support for national
unity. The 1992 National Pact was the culmination of negotiations between the Malian government
and several Tuareg factions to end the rebellion that started in 1990. It integrated Tuareg
combatants into the Malian armed forces, demilitarized the north, stimulated economic integration
of northern populations, and resulted in a special administrative structure for the three northern
regions. Concomitantly, the quest to secure democracy was associated with attempts to weaken
the security forces to avoid future coups d’états. Spending on security was reduced to about 1.5
percent of GDP. While this figure was comparable to the regional average, embezzlement,
nepotism and corruption assured that no real investments were made (with the exception of the
berets rouges which protect the president), and the army quickly lost its effectiveness.

8.      ATT deepened the system of consensus politics and, by doing so, gradually diminished
the legitimacy of the state. When a divided presidential party was not able to field a candidate for
the 2002 presidential elections, ATT, the “soldier of democracy”, presented himself as an
independent candidate and won. ATT did not have a political party to fall back on and promulgated
a politics of consensus instead, an apolitical coalition of all political parties and some civil society
representatives. While seemingly progressive, this approach led to constant redistribution of
positions and resources amongst members of a fragile coalition, and strengthened existing
tendencies to co-opt any potential opposition through pay-offs, corruption, nepotism, and
impunity. This approach undermined the creation of a professional bureaucracy, independent
oversight institutions and a proper judicial service and weakened the army further as recruitment
and promotions became largely based on political and familial affiliations. External accountability
was limited as civil society organizations were co-opted and as a mostly illiterate rural citizenry
remained outside the formal political process. This situation led to a gradual deterioration of the
legitimacy of the government and fueled resentment towards the political elite (viz. the downward
trend in trust in democracy and political institutions4). Consensus politics and associated capacity
problems also prevented the implementation of the government’s economic vision of growth and
poverty reduction.

9.     Financial resources from gold mining and ample donor funds facilitated the
consensus politics. In return for its commitment to peace and return to democracy, Mali was
bestowed with the largesse of the international community, which seemingly ignored deteriorating
governance indicators and public perceptions that grew more and more dissatisfied with
corruption.

10.     The politics of co-optation led to the demise of the decentralization process which in
1992 had been one of the cornerstones of the new democracy. The decentralization process
stemmed from a dual objective: appeasing the tensions in the north, and supporting stronger
development and accountability via bottom up development. Initially lauded for its scope, it
encountered resistance from a centralized and hierarchical bureaucracy which was quick to point
out inefficiencies and the lack of accountability of some decentralized entities. Confronted with
political realities, decentralization became a means to enhance loyalty to the center by devolving
responsibilities without the transfer of the resources and capacities necessary to meet the new
obligations.

11.     The system of pay-offs and co-optation was also employed in the aftermath of the 2006
Tuareg rebellion during which security control of the north was gradually replaced by an
almost demilitarization of the region. The non-governed area that emerged allowed elements of
Algeria’s GSPC (Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat) to settle in northern Mali. Likewise,
international crime such as drug and arms trafficking and hostage taking increased, creating highly
attractive economic alternatives both for the deprived population in northern Mali, and also for
selected high level officials.

12.     Mali’s population became increasingly disillusioned with these political realities. This
manifested itself in low confidence in the country’s leaders and their policies (Afrobarometer
2008)5, low participation rates in national elections (participation never surpassed 38 per cent), and

5
  In 2008, 74 percent of the population agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that the government’s economic
policies have hurt most people and only benefited a few; 38 percent trusted the president a lot, while 65 percent trusted
traditional leaders a lot.

                                                                                 x
the opening up of political space for religious leaders.6 Disillusionment led to several kinds of
‘rebellions’ or incivisme: in the West of Mali, youth emigrated in high numbers; commune
dwellers refused to pay local taxes (in 2002, for example, only 39 per cent paid their taxes7) and
when in 2012 the armed secessionist rebellion in the north ended in a successful coup d’état by
military who refused to fight the rebels, many cheered for the new leadership.

13.     Consensus politics, crippled by a general long-term deterioration of governance, thus
laid the foundation for its own demise. Facing a very weak army, the three northern regions of
Gao, Tombouctou and Kidal were rapidly occupied by various rebel and militant factions in early
2012. It took until early 2013 when a coalition composed of the Malian Army, French troops, the
ECOWAS-led African-led International Support Missions to Mali and other countries, was able to
recapture the occupied areas.

14.     In June 2013, a new president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta (IBK), was elected, supported
by a coalition of 12 political parties, and also by the army, religious leaders, economic operators
and a large segment of the international community. However, the participation rate for the
presidential election was low (46 percent). The legislative elections that followed a few months
later had a participation rate that was even lower (38 percent) and did not give IBK’s party a
majority.

15.     The road to recovery will be long and fraught with difficulties. Institutions in Mali
remain personalized with continued rent-seeking behavior and weak enforcement of laws and
regulations. Addressing existing governance constraints will be necessary to strengthen legitimacy
and inclusion and to lay the foundation for short and long-term development. However, following
a period of optimism that immediately followed the election of IBK as president, a number of well
publicized scandals and continued nepotism are making it increasingly clear how deeply
entrenched the resistance to change is.

16.     Finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in the north remains as urgent as ever. Rebel
groups control many of the urban centers in the north, and most of the area north of Timbuktu and
east of Gao are inaccessible for government and international actors without force protection.
Finding (and implementing) a lasting peaceful solution will not be easy due to a number of factors:
largely incompatible bargaining positions between the government and the rebels –the peace
accord is not yet ratified; the continued access to easy sources of (illicit) funding; the limited punch
of existing accountability mechanisms; and the likely presence of large mineral reserves (oil, gas,
phosphate) in the north. However, ending the insecurity is of utmost importance as in its presence
poverty reduction cannot happen.

17.     The SCD was prepared in collaboration with the entire Mali country team and
benefitted from an intensive consultative process inside and outside the Bank. This process is
summarized in one of the background documents (see annex to the preamble for a complete list of
background documents and studies). The SCD covers two related tasks, the SCD itself (P151730),
as well as “Mali: Political Economy of Poverty Reduction” (P151364).

and effectively blocked a modernization of the Family Code that dated from 1962.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Background
19.     This document presents the Systematic Country Diagnosis (SCD) for Mali. It identifies
how to achieve the twin goals of ending poverty and improving shared prosperity by 2030 in a
sustainable manner. These objectives are considered to be comparable because the incidence of
dollar-a-day poverty exceeds 40 percent of the population. The document thus focuses on reducing
headcount poverty.

20.     Mali is a landlocked economy with a population of approximately 14.9 million, mostly
illiterate, people. With a per capita GDP of USD 480 (2005 constant prices) in 2012, Mali is one
of the poorest countries in the world. Life expectancy is low (54 years) and levels of malnutrition
are high (28 percent of under five children are stunted). The economy is predominantly rural and
informal: 73 percent of the population resides in rural areas; 80 percent of jobs are in the informal
sector. The formal sector is largely located in Bamako, the capital city, and is highly concentrated.
As few as 40 firms pay 80 percent of all formal private sector salaries. These firms operate in
(gold) mining, telecommunications, cotton ginning, sugar manufacturing, banking and electricity
generation.

21.     Mali is culturally and geographically diverse. The country can be divided along a north-
south axis, with the northern areas extending into the Sahara and Sahel, and the southern ones
blessed with more fertile land and contributing most economic activity. Large-scale cattle
husbandry takes place in the north and around the Niger inland delta, whereas food and cash crops
are produced in the Office du Niger and in the southern regions where levels of rainfall are higher.
The semi-arid region linking the north and south has limited agricultural potential and the people
living there combine farming and animal husbandry. The main commercial agricultural crops are
rice and cotton. Farmers also produce significant quantities of millet, sorghum and maize, mostly
for their own consumption. Half of the national rice crop is produced under rain-fed conditions but
yields are low (at 0.5-1.5 tons/ha). The other half is concentrated in the center-north, along the
Niger river, and involves modern irrigated or flooded rice cultivation techniques, yielding an
average of 5-6 tons/ha.

22.     Bamako is by far the largest city in the country, hosting 15 percent of the population
and generating 40 percent of GDP. Bamako is the destination of choice for internal migrants;
between 1998 and 2009 the population of Bamako grew at an annual average of 6.1 percent
(compared to a national average of 3.0 percent). Bamako is particularly popular with migrants
from the northern regions of Ségou, Mopti, Tombouctou and Gao. Internal migrants tend to be
better educated than the average person in the country, but less well educated relative to the
average person in Bamako. Better educated migrants have a greater likelihood of success while
poorly educated migrants are more likely to return to their home towns and villages.

23.    Bamako is not an engine of growth and between 2001 and 2010 per capita consumption
in Bamako grew at 0.4 percent per annum, less than the national average of 0.6 percent. The lack
of dynamism is corroborated by other evidence: the sectoral composition of jobs in Bamako
changed little between the two population censuses of 1988 and 2009 and the secondary sector
(which is largely located in Bamako) did not grow in per capita terms.

24.     Poverty incidence is high and most of the poor live in rural areas. In 2010 more than
half the population (51 percent) lived below the dollar-a-day poverty line. Since that time, drought
(2012) and conflict (2012-present) have taken their toll and poverty incidence is likely to have
risen. Reliable estimates do not exist, however, and there is a dire need to improve welfare
measurement and to collect data that permits a better understanding of the livelihoods of poor
households.8 Poverty incidence is much lower in urban areas (14 percent) and 90 percent of all
poor live in rural areas. Poverty is concentrated in the south where population density is highest.

25.     Between 2001 and 2010 Mali experienced rapid poverty reduction as growth was pro-
poor. Particularly between 2001 and 2006 poverty declined substantially. Poverty incidence
declined from 60 percent in 2000, to 53 percent in 2006 to 51 percent in 2010; the Gini coefficient
dropped from 0.40, to 0.39 to 0.33 respectively. Rapid poverty reduction occurred despite a
sluggish overall consumption growth rate of 0.6 percent per capita over the period. The high rates
of poverty reduction are associated with a rapid increase in the production of cereals following
market liberalization, as well as sustained subsidies on fertilizer, increased remittances, improved
off farm income opportunities (informal gold mining; telecom) and improved road connectivity.

26.     Improvements in cereal production were particularly effective at reducing poverty.
The poorest in Mali, even those who make a living from farming, are net-buyers of food. Low
levels of own-production do not allow for self-sufficiency. To make ends meet, poor households
depend on income from casual labor and gifts. Casual labor opportunities are usually found in the
community and, if the transport costs can be afforded, via seasonal migration (at times as far as to
Abidjan). In this context, policies that lead to increases in cereal production, and particularly in
the production of cereals grown and consumed by the poor (millet and sorghum), offer three
pathways to poverty reduction: through increased production; through lower cereal prices
(important not only for the rural poor but also for the urban poor); and through increased demand
for wage labor by commercial cereal farmers.

27.     Households and the overall economy are prone to shocks. A dependence on rain-fed
agriculture, in a region where droughts, floods and locust infestations occur regularly, makes
household incomes and overall GDP growth subject to large fluctuations. The economy is
undiversified (gold makes up 67 percent of exports, followed by cotton, 12 percent, and livestock,
5 percent; all oil is imported) and dependent on aid. This creates vulnerabilities to changes in
international prices and the readiness of donors to offer support. Seasonal price fluctuations,
conflict, climate change and competing demands for land by pastoralists and farmers present
additional sources of risk. Finally, in the absence of formal safety nets and low levels of household
wealth, ordinary life events, such as illness or the death of a family member, often result in
significant welfare shocks.

28.    The conflict which erupted in 2012 is the consequence of deep rooted governance
problems. The conflict is not an isolated event but is the last in a series which started shortly after
independence. It is one manifestation of a governance problem that affects the entire nation. The
problem springs from a personalized competitive political settlement that emerged since Mali
became a democracy in 1991. In this settlement the elite secured its grip on power by maintaining
a weak security apparatus and by buying loyalty by doling out rents (‘consensus politics’). Few
8
  The so called Sikasso paradox –the fact that the region with the greatest agricultural potential has the highest
incidence of poverty, is attributed to the fact that food prices are not accurately measured. As a consequence the
poverty line for Sikasso is overestimated and consumption underestimated.

                                                      xiv
competitors for power emerge as the education system is of low quality and as there are few ways
to become wealthy that do not require loyalty to the state (procurement contracts; import
monopolies; tax exemptions). The system of consensus politics has led to the emergence of a
procedural democracy with a corrupted bureaucracy characterized by elitist, urban-oriented
policies and captured institutions which are incapable of (and uninterested in) delivering quality
services.

29.      Consensus politics has led to high levels of discontent. In the south discontent manifests
itself through incivisme (not paying taxes; withdrawal from the state; self-provision of services),
low participation rates in elections and low approval ratings of officialdom. In the north popular
resentment is exploited by rebel groups to justify their participation in a conflict to gain greater
autonomy (an independent state preferably), but which is also motivated by the desire to secure
profits from illegal trade in weapons, drugs, people, fuel, food stuffs, stolen cars and cigarettes.
The conflict is made more complex by the participation of jihadist groups, the interests of
neighboring countries and the agendas of the MINUSMA and the countries which came to Mali’s
rescue when rebels were advancing towards Bamako in 2012.

30.    The conflict undid much of the progress achieved prior to it. Once the conflict erupted
36 percent of the total population of the north fled to the south of Mali and to neighboring
countries. The crisis had dramatic effects on public infrastructure and services. The conflict
reduced human mobility, limited access to markets and led to theft of assets. Farmers were cut off
from their fields; traders were unable to move and herders with many livestock were forced to
leave places of conflict for safer areas. The conflict shook investor confidence, decimated Mali’s
tourism industry and led to the near withdrawal of donor support (it has subsequently returned).

31.      Violence continues even though on March 1st 2015 a preliminary peace accord was
signed between the Government and six rebel groups. This accord puts emphasis on
decentralization and partner support towards implementing it. Whether the accord will also be
ratified by all parties (planned for June 20th 2015) and will bring lasting peace remains to be seen.
The fact that five past peace agreements were not fully implemented, continues to leave doubts
among the rebel groups of the government’s commitment to addressing their demands. Moreover
not all armed groups operating in the north have been represented at the negotiations. The situation
continues to remain volatile and explosive with negative spillover effects on the south, including
terrorist attacks and the risk of more widespread destabilization.

Poverty reduction strategy
32.     The scope for economic transformation is limited and until 2030 opportunities for
poverty reduction will need to be found in the rural sector. Mali ranks low on the economic
complexity index which measures the total amount of productive knowledge embedded in an
economy. The low ranking reflects that the economy produces mostly basic products and suggests
that opportunities for future diversification are primarily in agro-processing. A buoyant supply of
rural labor (high population growth), extremely low levels of education (adults have on average
2.4 years of formal education), and the limited scope for embracing labor intensive manufacturing
or services (high transport and communication costs; long distances to the nearest sea ports), all
suggest that large-scale ‘between-sector’ structural change (away from agriculture and towards
manufacturing and services) is unlikely to materialize in the short run. This is reinforced by the
limited capacity and leadership needed to resolve the complex coordination problems associated

                                                 xv
with developing new sectors. A successful poverty reduction strategy will thus need to start by
raising the incomes of those engaged in the primary sector and by putting in place the foundations
for economic transformation. Over time, when incomes increase, improvements in human capital
are realized, and when transport costs decline, successful rural-urban migration, economic
transformation, and a demographic transition will become feasible.

33.      Within the primary sector, opportunities for growth and intra-sector economic
transformation exist. Selected crops (papaya, mango) are already being processed and exported.
Opportunities to expand the area under cultivation by poor households as well as the area under
irrigation are ample. Small-scale irrigation schemes are particularly attractive for poverty
reduction as they benefit smallholders and have the highest rates of return on investment. The yield
gap for crops grown under rain-fed conditions by the majority of poor farm households (sorghum,
millet, maize) is high and reducing this gap by half would imply a doubling or tripling of current
production. The demand side is favorable to increased food and meat production too. Rapid
urbanization and a region that has a structural food deficit guarantee a solid uptake of increases in
agricultural and livestock production. Mali’s location even presents a comparative advantage, as
the transport costs to serve the markets of Niger or Burkina Faso are less than those incurred by
overseas producers.

34.     To systematically identify opportunities for poverty reduction, an analytical
framework was developed that elicits constraints to income generation by poor households.
The framework is summarized graphically in Figure 4.1 on page 49. It starts from the observation
that poverty can be reduced in three ways: by alleviating the budget constraint of poor households
through income growth, through a redistribution of consumer goods, assets or income, and by
making consumption goods less expensive.

35.     Poor households support their consumption via income from wage labor and by
producing goods and services which are auto-consumed or exchanged for money and other
goods and services. Low levels of own-production can be the result of low productivity (which in
turn is affected by lack of access to land, to equipment or inadequate technology) or could be the
result of poorly functioning markets which prevent the fruits of specialization and economies of
scale from being realized. As net purchasers of food (i.e. the poor need cash), and active
participants in the labor market, demand for casual labor is critical for the welfare of poor
households.

36.     The potential of safety nets to significantly reduce poverty is substantial. To eliminate
poverty by 2030 would take less than 2 percent of GDP in perfectly targeted transfers in
combination with 2 percent per capita growth (of the poorest households). Mali’s current safety
nets program, however, does not meet the criteria of a well-designed program. It is small, poorly
targeted, and emergency driven as it concentrates on the sale of food at subsidized prices.

37.    The entire household ‘production function’ is embedded in an institutional
environment which determines whether the household is able to appropriate the fruits of its labor
and the provision and quality of public services.

38.     Poor households do not lack access to land. Conflicts over land use are frequent, in urban
and peri-urban areas as well as in rural areas, particularly around irrigated areas and in areas where
the interests of pastoralists and farmers collide. Legal pluralism and the coexistence of different

                                                 xvi
land tenure systems contribute to this. However, land for rain-fed farming remains relatively
abundant: about 3.2 million hectares are used out of a total of 12 million with cultivation potential.
The difference between poor and non-poor households in crop farming areas is therefore less
determined by access to land than by the ability to bring land under cultivation.

39.     Poor households lack the able-bodied household members and equipment to cultivate
larger areas. Poor households lack the assets necessary for plowing (draft animals; plows) or the
cash to hire plowing services. Poor households may also lack the time for cultivating their land, as
the obligation to repay old debts may force them to prepare the land of other farmers. Consequently
poor households tend to be stuck in a cycle of planting late, planting small areas, weeding less,
and consequently producing little, forcing them into debt and to supplementing their incomes with
low casual wages.

40.     Cotton is not grown by the poorest households (they lack the equipment to cultivate
sufficient land), but is critical for more commercially oriented farmers who, in turn, hire the
poorest farmers as casual labor. In 2004/5 29 percent of all rural household grew cotton; in
Sikasso as many as 86 percent did. Cotton has long been upheld as a bastion of poverty reduction
and shared development as the vertically integrated value chain managed by Compagnie Malienne
pour le Développement des Textiles (CMDT) facilitated local community organization and
channeled resources into schools, adult-literacy, extension services, clinics, and road maintenance.
Yet throughout its history CMDT has been plagued by financial mismanagement and producer
discontent. CMDT was meant to be privatized in 2002 but the sell-off was repeatedly postponed
out of fear of a collapse of the system, which would have had a devastating effect on farmers’
incomes. Some reforms were implemented however; increased producer prices and the payment
of arrears to producers and subsidies for fertilizers helped cotton production to rebound from
190,000 tons in 2007-08 to 450.000 tons in 2012/13 and 440,000 tons in 2013/14. Further reforms
are needed to enhance transparency, reduce cost, increase resilience to changes in world market
prices, and possibly, to restore the developmental functions of CMDT.

41.     Financial markets could be instrumental for increasing farm production by offering
financing for equipment, irrigation or to repay debts. However financial markets, though
liquid, have not shown much appetite for agricultural financing (or medium term financing in
general) and have failed to develop instruments suited for smallholders, such as equipment leasing,
warehouse receipt systems, or crop and seed insurance. Given the persistence of asymmetries and
high transaction costs (both are pertinent problems given the low population density), the
feasibility of such products emerging and being offered at scale is doubtful, even though
developments in the ICT market, particularly the high rate of mobile phone subscriptions, do create
new opportunities for financial inclusion.

42.     Small and medium sized enterprises are scarce and in rural areas agricultural
produce is typically bought by (informal) traders. These traders are mainly self-funded (limited
access to financing). They maximize the return to their working capital by rapidly turning over
small quantities. Quality grades are rarely standardized, nor are the weights and measures used,
making personal inspection by buyers essential. As a consequence, traders travel extensively,
increasing transaction costs. Transaction costs are further increased by the large number of layers
of intermediaries between producers and consumers. The provision of storage is hampered by the
absence of a marketable surplus (due to the seasonality and the small scale of production), the
absence of quality standards, limited possibilities for financing and a tax system that makes it hard

                                                xvii
for formal small and medium enterprises to compete with informal ones as the latter do not pay
VAT and other taxes. As a consequence even in Sikasso, the most developed agricultural region
of the country, only 30 percent of communities have a storage facility and the coefficient of
variation of producer prices is high (0.27 for maize; 0.35 for millet; 0.48 for sorghum 0.48).

43.      Stronger farmer organizations and better developed value chains for products
important to poor farmers can be instrumental for reducing transaction costs and improving
market access. At the local level cooperatives and other types of producer organizations have the
potential to aggregate and attain the scale needed for the efficient supply of critical products
(fertilizers, seeds) and services (storage, transport, access to finance, skills training and extension).
Interventions that structure and organize (poor) farmers so they can participate in the agricultural
value chains (as cotton farmer associations already do) offer an alternative to overcoming market
access constraints.

44.     Low levels of human capital are a big obstacle to poverty reduction. Levels of anemia
are high, as is exposure to diseases like diarrhea, respiratory infections and malaria. The latter is a
particularly serious risk for farmers as the prevalence of malaria is highest during the planting
season. Illiteracy and low levels of education are strongly correlated with (low) levels of
consumption. This seems like an argument for increased investments in education but the quality
of formal education is so low that in the short run, preference would have to be given to adult
literacy training, skills training and extension services. Reforms leading to a higher quality of
education are critical to attaining acceptable rates of return to investments in formal education.

45.     Access to electricity, improved infrastructure and ICT contribute to poverty
reduction, but policy reforms are needed to improve returns on investments. High transport
costs can be attributed to poor maintenance of rural roads, a high frequency of road blocks and the
presence of trucking cartels, requiring policy reform and improved budgetary allocations to be
addressed. Limited access to electricity in rural areas is attributable to the failure of the financial
sector to offer medium term financing, while in urban areas electricity tariffs are lower than
production costs even though demand exceeds production capacity. Meanwhile private operators
are not interested in investing in this loss making sector. In the ICT sector, the fiber-optic backbone
is present, but policies to increase competition, enhance coverage, reduce prices and stimulate
innovation are not in place. In the absence of these policy reforms, investments in these sectors
(with the exception of rural electricity) can be expected to yield low (or even negative) returns.
However, while the need for reforms is high, their feasibility is unclear.

46.      Successful policy reforms require an opportunistic approach, improved transparency
and stronger accountability institutions. In a personalized competitive political settlement,
standard technocratic reform, such as the liberalization of the transport sector or a meritocratic
public sector, go contrary to the personalized-competitive political logic, and are unlikely to gain
much traction. Rather, improvements are likely to come incrementally via a combination of two
strategies: a sustained (rather than a big-bang) approach addressing specific capacity, policy and
institutional constraints as and when opportunities to do so arise; and an ‘islands of effectiveness’
approach -- where groups of developmentally-oriented stakeholders co-operate opportunistically
to achieve a specific developmental purpose for which they have an incentive to see results. The
former approach has de-facto been followed with respect to the cotton sector; efforts to contain the
recent ebola outbreak are an example of the latter. Enhanced transparency and stronger institutions


                                                  xviii
of (social) accountability can catalyze reform as the risk of exposure changes the incentives of elite
members in favor of less predatory approaches.

47.    Exposure to shocks and the presence of poverty traps justify greater reliance on social
safety nets. In addition to the need to protect the already low levels of consumption of the poor
during adversity, safety nets are also needed to help the many poor households who find
themselves in a poverty trap that is often brought about by the simple fact that the investment to
obtain a pair of oxen requires a significant amount of money. Once in a poverty trap and faced
with exclusion from financial markets, a poor household’s only remaining option to avoid chronic
poverty is an autarkic savings strategy. This requires substantial medium-term sacrifice in the form
of diminished consumption which many very poor households cannot afford. Already prior to the
harvest, many adults are found to lose significant weight.9 In such instances safety nets help
chronically poor households maintain and build their productive asset base.

Binding constraints
48.     The greatest impact on poverty reduction can be attained by increasing the off and
on farm incomes of poor households with a focus on subsistence as well as high value cash
crops. In the short run poverty reduction efforts will need to focus on (i) restoring security in the
north, (ii) increasing the incomes of the rural poor, and (iii) redistributive efforts to reduce extreme
vulnerability.

49.      In the long run poor governance and low levels of education (especially of females)
are key obstacles to poverty reduction. Improving the incomes of the poor in the short run will
facilitate higher public and private investments in education and health. But if governance
problems remain unaddressed and the quality of education remains low, insecurity is likely to
remain, service provision will stay inadequate and levels of human capital will remain too low to
realize “between-sector” economic transformation and a demographic transition –even in the
longer run.

50.     Policies to reduce rural poverty extend beyond improving the lot of subsistence
farmers (and agro-pastoralists) alone. Subsistence farmers participate in the wider economy and
benefit from improvements therein. While the on-farm incomes of poor households are low they
rely on social networks for resilience, and depend on casual labor opportunities (and migration)
offered by better off households to make ends meet. Poor urban (and rural) households benefit
from reductions in food prices brought about by increased production of business farmers. Poor
rural households benefit from technologies and value chains developed for more commercially
oriented farmers.

51.   To alleviate these obstacles, three clusters of binding constraints to reducing poverty
have been identified based on the SCD criteria (impact, feasibility, evidence base,
implementation capacity) while also considering alignment with the sustainability objective.

Binding constraint 1: a personalized competitive political settlement

52.     The personalized political settlement is behind the unacceptably low levels of public
service provision. It explains the persistence of policies which favor the rich and urban class, the
mismanagement of public finances and the failed attempts at decentralization – essential to a
sustainable resolution to the conflict in the north. Avoiding the spread of insecurity towards the
more densely populated areas in the south and restoring security in the north are of great
importance if the objective is development and not emergency assistance. In the short run,
restoring security starts with a credible peace accord but to be implemented and sustained,
governance reforms are needed to improve service delivery and to restore state legitimacy.

53.      Instead of ranking policy reforms by priority and attempting to achieve first-best
solutions, an adaptive, opportunity driven, incremental, good-enough approach to policy
reform is more likely to succeed. In a personalized competitive country-setting it is preferable to
follow a sustained approach to governance reform -- addressing specific capacity, policy and
institutional constraints as and when they become binding; and an ‘islands of effectiveness’
approach -- where groups of developmentally-oriented stakeholders co-operate opportunistically
to achieve a specific developmental purpose for which they have an incentive to see results. This
necessitates flexibility, adaptability and, persistence, and, as resources are limited, the
identification of a small number of policy reforms that are pursued vigorously (in addition to those
that occur opportunistically).

54.      Policy reforms to improve PFM systems, the functioning of the cotton sector and the
quality of education should take priority. Improved PFM systems are critical for restoring state
legitimacy and for increasing the budget envelop. A large share of public resources goes
uncollected, is lost through inefficient procurement or is poorly allocated. If these issues are
addressed, 3 to 5 percentage points of GDP could feasibly be generated - this would be sufficient
to create the large scale safety net (requiring 2 percent of GDP) that in combination with 2 percent
growth per capita could eliminate poverty by 2030. The cotton sector is of importance because it
touches the lives of many farmers, generates casual labor opportunities and because it has
demonstrated its potential to act as an engine of rural development. The quality of education,
finally, is critical because if the human capital base is not improved, economic transformation and
demographic transition will remain out of reach and investments in education would yield a low
rate of return.

55.      Weak (social) accountability and transparency mechanisms create space for the
political and economic elites to behave in anti-developmental ways. Elite capture happens at
all levels and can be reduced by increasing the risk of exposure and by strengthening accountability
institutions. Improving the collection of information, the capacity to analyze it and to share results
in the public domain are important. Technological advances provide new opportunities for the
monitoring and dissemination of findings. Donor agencies, whose resources are the equivalent of
40 percent of the budget, can play a catalytic role by insisting on transparency around the spending
and results of their own programs and interventions.
Binding constraint 2: low productive capacity of poor farmers and pastoralists

56.    The inability to plow and lack of access to irrigated land are major constraints to
increased farm production. Plowing allows bringing more land under cultivation than manual
land preparation, while access to irrigated land allows obtaining multiple harvests throughout the
                                                 xx
year. Increasing production requires a multi-sectoral effort to realize greater integration between
farming and agro-pastoral systems, for skills development (animal traction; mechanics),
development of adapted financial products (leasing) and the development of a market for farm
services. Increased production will also increase the demand for casual labor, thus creating an
indirect channel for poverty reduction.

57.    The yield gap for crops grown mostly by the poor (sorghum, millet, maize) and by
those who engage with the market (rice, maize, cotton) needs to be reduced. Addressing the
yield gap in the presence of climate change and weather shocks, necessitates soil improvement,
better water management, seed development and better access to inputs. On-farm extension
services and enhanced literacy will help farmers to adapt their farming techniques in the face of
climate and other changes. For the more commercial crops, reforms of the fertilizer market are
needed. In addition, the functioning of the cotton sector needs to be strengthened as it offers a
unique value chain with many positive developmental spillover effects.

58.     The functioning of value chains for selected crops, animals and animal products
remains a constraint. Value chains for food grains, chicken, meat and milk need to be
strengthened as they have a direct impact on the production and consumption by poor households.
Value chains that increase the demand for (casual) labor should also be strengthened. Doing so
will require interventions at the village level (stronger producer organizations to facilitate access
to inputs, credit, storage, quality control and marketing), the middle-level (small and medium sized
traders who aggregate, package, store and distribute) and the national level (where large businesses
provide a gateway to urban and export markets). The latter is particularly important to prevent
prices from collapsing following successful increases in production. Policy reform (discussed
already in the previous section) is needed to address biases against the proper functioning of value
chains (tax policies, export bans, import subsidies).
Binding constraint 3: exposure to uninsured risks

59.     Exposure to uninsured, exogenous shocks is a binding constraint. Weather variability
(aggravated by climate change), food price variability and health shocks are the main risks
affecting poor households along with exposure to conflict for those living in the north. Exposure
to uninsured shocks takes a big toll on poverty reduction: farmers opt for low-risk, low-return
activities and are prone to falling into poverty traps. On average, rural households which sell their
assets to deal with a shock take 7 years to return to their initial state. When food prices rise, levels
of consumption drop and poverty increases. Farmers who fall sick during the planting season lose
their income for the year.

60.     Well targeted transfers can lift many poor people out of poverty and increase
resilience. Productive safety nets such as public works programs increase resilience by offering
access to income opportunities when these are needed most (during a crisis, or after the harvest)
and by improving community infrastructure that helps improve productivity (rural roads, irrigation
schemes). They require multi-sector approaches and can also be used to reduce fragility, for
instance as part of the reintegration of ex combatants in support of the peace process.

61.    Investments in health and education increase resilience and create long term
opportunities for economic transformation. In the short run, healthier, better educated
individuals have more options to reduce exposure to risk and to deal with shocks when they arise;

                                                  xxi
they also have more opportunities for successful outmigration (particularly critical for those
dependent on low-productivity agriculture, or those living in conflict affected areas). Literate and
trained farmers are more likely to successfully adopt new farming techniques; educated girls marry
later and have fewer children. It is no coincidence that those who fled the crisis in the north were
the better educated.

62.     Stronger local organizations increase resilience. Mali has a strong tradition of non-
formal assistance and organization. Strengthening these local systems –either in the form of
producer organizations (cotton), or community based organizations for social accountability can
strengthen risk coping mechanisms. It can also act as barrier to elite capture at local and even at
the national level (as the successful ‘boycott’ by cotton producers in 1991 demonstrated). The risk
of the country sliding into a situation of increased fragility due to conflict and climate change
presents another reason to focus on strengthening resilience at the local level.

1.    CONTEXT

Mali is a poor landlocked country with low population density and great geographic diversity. The formal
economy employs few people and is dominated by a small number of large enterprises which are
concentrated in Bamako. Cotton and gold mining are the most important export sectors and gold
contributes up to 30 percent of revenue annually. Most people live in rural areas and make a living from
pastoralism and farming. Sorghum, millet and maize are the main food crops; rice and cotton are the most
important cash crops. Access to services, levels of education, and governance indicators are all poor.
Weather variability is high and, combined with a poor population that depends on rain-fed agriculture,
results in extremely high levels of vulnerability. Drought and the recent conflict in the north of the country
have undone much of the social progress that was achieved in the previous decade. The conflict continues
unabated and has started to spill over to the south.

1. Geography and Population
1.      Mali is a large, landlocked country. Mali is bordered by Algeria to the north, Niger to
the east, Burkina Faso to the south, Guinea to the south-west, and Senegal and Mauritania to the
west. Mali is geographically divided along a north-south axis, with the northern areas extending
into the Sahara and Sahel, and the southern ones blessed with more fertile land and accounting for
most of the country’s economic activity. Population density is low (11.8 people/km2) and varies
from less than 1 in the desert to over 50 in Sikasso in the south of the country. Despite covering
61 percent of Mali’s land mass, only 6 percent of the population lives in the north10. The Senegal
and Niger rivers are major lifelines offering opportunities for transport, electricity generation,
fisheries and irrigation. Water from the Niger River is used for irrigation in the Office du Niger
and electricity generation at the Sélingué dam, while approximately 40 percent of Mali’s livestock
migrate to the floodplains in the Niger Delta region during the dry months which start in October.

2.     Mali’s population of approximately 14.9 million people is poorly educated and
growing rapidly. The majority of Malians (65 percent) have no education and the average years
of schooling amongst adults is 2.4 years. At about 540 per 100,000 births Mali is among the
countries with the highest maternal mortality rates and nearly a third of children under five are
stunted. Mali also has one of the highest fertility rates in the world with 6.9 children per women
leading to an exceptionally high rate of population growth of 3.0 percent. This growth rate is
expected to continue, given the country’s young age structure (68 percent of Malians are under the
age of 24), low levels of (female) education and low levels of contraceptive use (8 percent in
2012/13 DHS). The very high age-dependency ratio (among the very highest in Africa) represents
a heavy economic burden on active adults, and the high rate of population growth implies that the
labor market will have to absorb 6.2 million new workers between now and 2025 (over 250,000
annually) and that the total population will (almost) double between now and 2030, with
concomitant consequences for the demand for public services or cultivable land.11

3.     The rate of population increase is highest in urban areas. A combination of rural-urban
migration and high levels of ‘natural’-growth make cities grow more quickly, particularly Bamako.

Between 1998 and 2009 the population of Bamako grew at an annual average of 6.1 percent.12 By
contrast secondary cities and rural locations grew at 3.6 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. It is
estimated that by 2020, the population of Bamako will exceed 4 million, making Bamako even
more dominant than it already is (at present the population of Bamako is 5 times larger than that
of the next three largest cities combined: Ségou, Sikasso and Kayes). By 2030 47 percent of the
population will live in urban areas, up from 37 percent in 2014.13

4.       Levels of inter-regional migration are high and an important contributor to city
growth. The regions of Bamako and Koulikoro are net recipients of migrants; the regions of
Ségou, Mopti, Tombouctou and Gao are the largest net providers of migrants. Intra-regional
migration is relatively marginal: migrants move to urban areas in other regions, and less to other
(rural) localities in their region of origin. Those who migrate tend to be better educated than the
average person, but relative to the average person living in Bamako, migrants are less well
educated. About 6 percent of people in Mali have secondary education compared to 15 percent of
migrants. Better educated migrants have a greater likelihood of success and poorly educated
migrants are more likely to return: amongst the returning migrants one finds few people with a
secondary education (3 percent) while the vast majority (72 percent) has no education.

5.      Rapid urbanization does not lead to agglomeration effects. Bamako is the dominant
city in the country. The primacy of Bamako in generating income is such that it generates about
40 percent of GDP with only 15 percent of the population. With 18 percent of GDP, the region of
Kayes is another important contributor to GDP followed by Sikasso (12 percent) and Koulikoro
(11 percent). In other aspects Bamako is equally dominant. There is, for instance, a concentration
of doctors, nurses and midwives in the capital, while rural areas are largely underserved. Despite

12
   The crisis in Côte d’Ivoire may have contributed to the acceleration of Bamako’s growth, as migrants who used to
travel south, opted to go to Bamako instead. If this is the case, the growth of Bamako can be expected to slow down
as the economy of Côte d’Ivoire picks up.

its primacy and attractiveness to migrants, per capita income growth in Bamako hovered around
0.4 percent per annum between 2001 and 2010. Decomposing the overall change into two periods,
2001-2006 and 2006-2010, one finds that the city transformed from a place with high levels of per
capita growth in the early 2000s to a place in which per capita consumption growth is negative.
This lack of dynamism is corroborated by other evidence: a comparison of the 2009 and 1998
population censuses shows that the sectoral composition of jobs has changed little; macro-
economic statistics show that the secondary sector (which is largely located in Bamako) did not
grow – at least not in per capita terms.14

6.      Mounting population pressure due to migration and population growth, land
degradation and increasing non-agricultural use put localized pressure on land tenure
systems. Conflict, climate change and competing demands by pastoralists and farmers create a
rapidly changing demand for land with productive potential in the Niger Delta and Sikasso and
lead to pressures on the land tenure systems. In general, land is still available, but conflicts over
land use are frequent, in urban and peri urban areas as well as rural areas, particularly around
irrigated areas and in areas where the interests of pastoralists and farmers collide.15

7.      Mali’s rural livelihoods are diverse and include pastoralism, sedentary farming (often
combined with animal husbandry and fishing. Large-scale cattle husbandry takes place mostly
in the north and around the Niger inland delta, whereas most food and cash crops are produced in
the Niger Basin and in the southern regions. Artisanal river fishing is of great importance, mostly
in the Niger inland delta. The main commercial agricultural crops are rice and cotton, although
farmers also produce significant quantities of millet, sorghum and maize, mainly for their own
consumption. Half of the national rice crop is produced in the south of the country, under rain-fed
conditions, but yields are low (at 0.5-1.5 tons/ha). The other half is concentrated in the center-
north along the Niger River and involves modern irrigated or flooded rice cultivation techniques,
yielding an average of 5-6 tons/ha.

8.      Rainfall is highly variable exposing households and the overall economy to hazards
(droughts, floods, strong winds, crop pests) which will worsen as a result of climate change.
Dependence on rain-fed agriculture and on pastoralism makes rainfall patterns and levels hugely
important. These patterns are changing as a consequence of global warming, but the precise
changes are hard to predict. Depending on the model used the predicted average level of rainfall
varies from -22 to +25 percent by the 2090s. It is clear that decreases in rainfall will be largest in
the north of the country, whereas increases in total rainfall will affect the south-west. Coupled with
a progressive increase in temperature (temperatures in Mali have increased by 0.8° Celsius since
1975.16), the predicted impact of climate change on livestock keeping and agricultural productivity
varies from negligible to very high, with millet and sorghum –the main food staples, being
particularly vulnerable.17 What is clear, however, is that change is happening (it has in fact been
happening since the 1980s) and that farmers and pastoralists will need to (continue to) adapt to it.

                                     Box 1. 1: Mali’s livelihood zones


 Rainfall is a decisive factor in identifying different rural livelihood areas as rainfall drives the degree of
 dependence on livestock in certain areas, the use of arable land in others and the degree of dependence
 on labor and other sources of income such as from remittances or artisanal gold mining. Four broad
 livelihood areas are identified, which can be further subdivided into a total of 12 rural livelihood zones
 and one urban livelihood zone, Bamako.
 In the dry area nomadism, transhumant pastoralism and long distance trade are dominant. Kidal, Gao
 and Tombouctou lie in this area. Households living in this area have strong commercial and social ties
 with Algeria, and also with Niger, Burkina Faso and Mauritania (livelihood zones 1 & 2).
 In the transitional area households rely on a mix of income derived from transhumant livestock rearing,
 remittances from migration and agriculture as rainfall is too low to make a living based on crop income
 alone. The further south one
 goes in this area, the less the                Livelihood zones identified for Mali
 dependence on livestock
 and     the     greater     the
 importance of cultivation.
 The location of this
 transitional zone means that
 it dominates the north-south
 commercial axis with grain
 moving from the south
 towards the food deficit dry
 area in the north, and with
 livestock and seasonal
 migrants moving from the
 north towards the south
 (livelihood zones 4, 5, 8 &
 9).
 The agricultural area in the
 south is where farming is
 most productive. Income
 from livestock is less critical
 in this area as rainfall is
 adequate for households to
 fully depend on income          Source: FEWSNET 2010.
 from cultivation. The main
 crops grown are cereals (sorghum, millet and maize), cotton as well as fruits. It is the area with the highest
 population density.
 The potential to irrigate defines the last livelihood area. This area includes the fluvial basin of the Niger
 stretching from Tombouctou to the international border between Mali and Niger. It includes the delta
 stretching from Tombouctou to south of Mopti as well as the Office du Niger, a manmade irrigation
 scheme reclaimed from the Sahel by irrigation canals and dams (livelihood zones 3, 6 & 7).

1.2      Access to services

9.      Access to services is generally poor, though significant improvements have been
achieved over the past decades. In education, for example, primary school gross enrollment has
increased from 32 percent in 1980 to some 80-90 percent in 201118. Both secondary and tertiary
enrollment rates have also increased substantially (gross secondary enrollment was 45 percent in
2011; tertiary enrollment 7 percent). Nevertheless the proportion of out of school 12 to 17 years
old, at about 50 percent, is very high, and adult literacy remains extremely low at 34 percent in
2011, well below the average for sub-Sahara Africa. Access to potable drinking water (defined as
reliance on any water source except unimproved wells or “other sources”) improved from 69
percent in 2001 to 79 in 2006 and 81 percent in 2009/10. Health indicators have also shown
improvement. Notably, the infant mortality rate has declined (from 161 per 1,000 births in 1980
to 81 in 2011); an indication of improved access to health care. (Curative consultation rates
increased from about 20 percent to 30 percent over the 2006-2012 time period), but remains
considerably above the sub-Sahara African average.

10.     Differences in population density pose difficult trade-offs between access for all
(equity) and efficiency (providing access to as many people as possible for a given budget). It
implies that capital intensive services (electricity, roads) are found in areas of high population
density, whereas services requiring less in terms of capital investments (health, education) tend to
be more equally spread. It implies that for areas where population density is very low, less capital
intensive modalities of service delivery may have to be relied upon and explains why tarmacked
roads, piped water and hospitals are found in high density areas like cities, and dirt tracks, wells
and clinics in low density areas like rural villages.

11.     Limited access to education and health services has particularly adverse
consequences for females and for the poorest. Access to services is worst for the poorest
households. Poor households are disadvantaged in access to all services but particularly with
respect to access to electricity, secondary schools and pre and post natal care. Girls and women
are also disadvantaged in access to services. Fewer girls than boys attend school and girls are more
likely to drop out, in part because of early marriage and pregnancy (in 2004, half of Malian girls
aged 5 to 19 were already married) and face very high risks of medical complications or even death
following maternity (all the more if poor). High levels of adolescent fertility— 176 children born
to every 1,000 young women under 19 - contribute to very high levels of maternal mortality and
high levels of lifetime fertility.

12.    Access and use of services differs across the nation. This is illustrated for education.
Figure 1.2 shows that between 64 and 100 percent of people live within 2 km of a primary school.
The vast majority of the population (more than 80 percent) lives within 2 km of a school, but in
the regions in the north (Kidal, Tombouctou and Mopti) the percentage is significantly lower.
Distance is important for school attendance and children who live further from school have a
smaller chance of enrolling. A standard deviation increase in time to local school, for example,
decreases the probability of attendance by 13 percent, and one standard deviation in the distance


18
  Estimates vary according to the source, with administrative and household survey data pointing to a figure closer to
80 percent.

decreases the probability of attendance by 8 percent.19 This too can be found in Figure 1.2 where
one notes that the regions with the lowest enrolment rates are those with least access to schools.
But distance is not the only explanation for enrolment. The percent of people living within 2 km
of a school is comparable for Kidal, Mopti and Tombouctou, but in Kidal enrolment rates are twice
as high as in Mopti and Tombouctou.

13.      Access to services is particularly low in the north. Access to education was already
discussed, but access to health care is also worse in the north than elsewhere in the country. As a
result, according to the 2012/13 DHS, an average of 56 percent of women deliver in a health
facility, but in the northern regions of Tombouctou, Gao and Kidal it is only 27 percent. According
to administrative data, in 2011 on average, 58 percent of births were attended by a skilled
personnel, but in the northern regions this rate was only of 27 percent. The gap increased
dramatically after the crisis, as will be discussed below.

14.     Access to safe drinking water and sanitation has improved but remains low. In 2009,
the access rate to safe drinking water was estimated at 73 percent of the population (71 percent in
rural areas and 77 percent in urban areas, lower in Bamako), exposing a large fraction of the
population to water borne diseases. Only 32 percent of households had access in 2009 to improved
sanitation services in rural areas, and 45 percent in urban areas. Since 2001, progress has been
                                                                              7
made in expanding access, but the challenge remains. Meanwhile a lack of maintenance and
underinvestment put at risk gains made in the expansion of the service. This is evidenced by the
large number of rural water systems that are not operational and the insufficient water production
and distribution capacity in Bamako.

15.     Road connectivity poses major challenges. Not only is the distance to the nearest sea
ports large, within the country connectivity is limited. Transport costs are high and 90 percent of
all goods and people are transported using roads. Over the last two decades major investments
have been made to improve the road network. Most investments extended the main roads
connecting major cities and offering access to neighboring countries. In rural areas less was
invested leaving Mali with one of the lowest road densities in West Africa.20

16.     Access to markets is worst in the dry livelihood zones of the north of the country,
better in the transitional zones and best in agricultural zones in the south. Even in the south
where access is best (and population density highest), many locations become isolated during the
rainy season. Infrastructure built between 1994 and 2007 –in response to the crisis in Côte d’Ivoire,
has improved the connectivity between Bamako and Senegal. Beyond that, infrastructure
development kept pace with increases in population, but its efficient use is hindered by inadequate
maintenance and a high number or road blocks (Mali has the highest number of road blocks per
100 km in the region)21.

17.     During the rainy season, many rural roads become impassible and it is not a
coincidence that the difference between consumer and producer prices peaks during this period,
and that this difference is much more pronounced in Kayes where rural access is much worse than
in Sikasso. Investments in road infrastructure have reduced the differences in consumer prices
between the regions. This is illustrated by the differences between the maximum regional price
and the minimum regional price, which has been declining gradually, suggesting improved market
integration (and connectivity).

18.     Despite significant progress over the last decade, access to modern energy services
remains low, especially in rural areas. In 2011/12 rates of access to electricity were at about 34
percent nationally (up from 8 percent on 2001), corresponding to an access rate of 80 percent in
Bamako, 34 percent in other urban areas and 25 percent in rural areas.22 Electricity service
provision in urban areas is under the responsibility of Energie du Mali (EDM), a vertically
integrated state-owned utility. Over the last decade, EDM has been able to expand access to
electricity and at the end of 2013, EDM served about 300,000 connections, versus 120,000 ten
years earlier. Over the past years, the quality of electricity services deteriorated and the number
and duration of power shortages has increased mainly due to distribution bottlenecks and old
equipment. Load-shedding remains relatively limited, however (around 8 percent during peak time
in 2013) as capacity shortages were offset by the use of expensive rental generation23. Access to
electricity in rural areas is under the responsibility of the rural electrification agency, AMADER.
While the progression in rural access has been impressive (a ten-fold increase from about 1 to 2
percent of the rural population, to 25 percent in less than a decade), the large majority of rural
households still satisfy their lighting needs by using kerosene and dry-cell batteries, which are
expensive and unreliable.

19.    ICT connectivity poses major challenges, but not because of a lack of infrastructure.
Mali benefits from a fiber-optic network that links all major cities to the rest of the world and
approximately 82 percent of the population lives in an area covered by a mobile network.24 Mobile
phone penetration stood at 129% at the end of 201325 while mobile broadband penetration remains
very low at 1.8 per 100 inhabitants in 2013.26 The combination of potential access with limited
broadband use suggests that customers can’t afford the service27, and is illustrative of the lack of
competition in the sector (there are only two functioning operators).

1.3     Economy
20.     With a per capita GDP of USD 480 (2005 constant prices) in 2012, Mali is one of the
poorest countries in the world. The economy is predominantly rural and informal. 73 percent of
the population resides in rural areas; 80 percent of jobs are in the informal sector. Of the active
population aged 15 and above (approximately 4.4 million people in 2009) 64 percent are employed
in the primary sector, 7 percent in the secondary sector and 25 percent in the tertiary sector. In
rural areas 78 percent of households are primary engaged in crop farming, 13 percent in
pastoralism and 2 percent in fishing and hunting.28

21.     The formal economy is highly concentrated and a small number of very large firms
makes up most of the formal economy. These large firms mill cotton, generate electricity, and
operate in telecommunications or in mining. Of the 4,648 firms that reported their salary payments
to the tax authorities in 2012, less than 1 percent (39 firms) are responsible for 80 percent of all
salaries. At the other end of the scale, 94 percent of all formal firms, pay 5 percent of all salaries.
The formal sector is lopsided and very few medium sized enterprises exist.

22.     Gold production accounts for 7 percent of Mali's GDP and the mining sector
contributes directly and indirectly some 20 percent of fiscal revenues. The adoption of a new
mining code in 1999 transformed Mali into Sub-Saharan Africa’s third-largest gold producer (after
South Africa and Ghana). Mali’s gold reserves are estimated at 500-600 tons, and Mali’s seven
industrial gold mines produced around 46-47 tons in 2012 and 2013. A further 4 tons is produced
by artisanal and small scale miners (many of them children29). A key issue affecting the gold sector
in Mali is the decline in the price of gold over the last few years ($1,920/oz in 2011 to about $1,268
in 2014), leading mining firms to either suspend or halt projects. Gold is not the only mineral in
Mali, and explorations are ongoing in uranium, manganese, iron ore and petroleum.

23.     Cotton is a particularly valued productive sector in Mali. Mali’s cotton sector accounts
for about 5 percent of agricultural GDP and, after gold, cotton is the main export good. In 2004/5
29 percent of all rural household grew cotton; in Sikasso as many as 86 percent did. Cotton has
long been upheld as a bastion of poverty reduction and shared development as the vertically
integrated value chain managed by CMDT facilitated local community organization and channeled
resources into schools, adult-literacy, agricultural extension, clinics, infrastructure and road
maintenance. Nevertheless throughout its history CMDT has been plagued by financial
mismanagement and producer discontent. The CMDT was due to be privatized in 2002 but the
government has repeatedly postponed the sell-off as it fears a collapse in the cotton trading system,
which would have a devastating effect on farmers’ incomes. Some reforms were implemented:
CMDT sold its cotton seed oil division, the company was divided into four subsidiary public
holding companies and the CMDT disengaged from public service provision. Increased producer
prices, the payment of arrears to producers and subsidies for fertilizers helped cotton production
to rebound from 190,000 tons in 2007-08 to 450.000 tons in 2012/13 and 440,000 tons in 2013/14.
Still many lament the decline in rural development activities and the discussion about the future
of CMDT is far from resolved.

24.     An emerging economic sector in Mali is hydroelectric power. Electricity accounts for
approximately 1 percent of the national consumption of energy, with the majority coming from
biomass (wood for cooking, charcoal). Mali is exploiting only a fraction of its domestic
hydropower potential. Only about 60 MW (equivalent to 225 GWh) are exploited at present, owing
to the Sélingué and Sotuba power plants, to which additional 131 MW (equivalent to 520 GWh)
should be added from the energy share imported from OMVS hydro generation of Manantali and
Felou. The hydroelectric potential of domestic hydropower resources is estimated at about 1,000
MW (equivalent to 5,500 GWh during a one-year average), excluding developments associated
with the OMVS (along the Senegal River). The government of Mail is keen to tap into this
potential. Frontrunner projects, such as the Markala (10 MW) and Kenie (42 MW) hydropower
projects are at an advanced stage of development, with the potential of bringing about 50 MW of
additional capacity.

25.      The financial sector remains highly bank-centric, is relatively stable and profitable
but is almost exclusively accessible in Bamako. As of 2012 there were 13 banks, out of 15 credit
institutions, with five banks accounting for two-thirds of assets and over 70 percent of deposits.
The banking sector is well capitalized but is insufficiently diversified. Over 50 percent of total
resources are in short-term demand deposits, which are highly seasonal, while term deposits
accounts for 32 percent. Other financial institutions include 11 insurance companies (of which 3
life insurance companies), 2 financial establishments, and a pension system comprised of a social
security and pension fund for private sector employees and another for civil servants. The regional
stock exchange based in Abidjan deals primarily with sovereign financing.

26.    Bank intermediation has been increasing, but remains low. Banks hold considerable
excess liquidity in part due to the lack of bankable projects, problems with loan recovery and the
extremely shallow interbank market. The ratio of credit-to-GDP has increased from 15 percent in
2000 to 21 percent in 2013, while the currency-to-deposit ratio has declined from 57 percent to 42
percent during the same period, reflecting financial deepening. Interest rates do not appear to have
adversely affected bank intermediation, as they seem to reflect cost of doing business. At end-
2012, the average spread between deposit and lending rates was about 4.2 percentage points.

27.     The microfinance sector reaches more depositors than the banking sector (Figure
1.6), but the majority of these institutions are in financial distress. Providing deposits accounts
to 1.15 million members, the microfinance sector is fragile, and 92 out of 126 institutions are in
financial distress. Recovery of public confidence in the microfinance sector is critical to improving
financial inclusion (in particular in rural areas) in Mali. Rapid developments in ICT offer new
opportunities for mobile payment systems, mobile saving schemes and even mobile banking.
Currently more than 2.1 million accounts exist for the “Orange Money” service launched in May
2010, of which more than 35 percent are active on a monthly basis30.

28.      Agriculture (including agro-pastoralism) is by far the biggest employer with 63
percent of all jobs and 86 percent in localities with less than 5,000 inhabitants. The second
biggest sector, commerce, is much smaller and represents 11.0 percent of the total number of jobs
followed by administrative jobs (6.7 percent), services (4.7 percent) and manufacturing and crafts
(4.1 percent).Trade jobs are found across Mali but the bulk are in Bamako, confirming the
important function of the capital city for commerce. The limited importance of manufacturing jobs
(even in the big cities) is noteworthy, though not unexpected given Mali’s landlocked status and
low education of its work force. In neighboring Senegal, the share of employment in the industrial
sector is much higher and had already reached 14.8 percent by 2006.31 Noticeably, employment
in the formal extractive sector has increased since 1998 reaching a total of 35,631 jobs in 2009.
Still the sector still represents only 0.9 percent of all jobs in Mali.32

29.     Farm households grow a variety of crops and the crops grown vary by region. In
Kayes sorghum and maize are the most popular crops as is the case in Koulikoro where many
households also grow millet. In Sikasso, maize and cotton are most popular, but many also grow
millet and sorghum. In Ségou and Mopti millet and sorghum are grown most frequently, whereas

households are not crop farmers but depend on animal husbandry.

30.     Improvements in agricultural production over the last few decades have principally
been achieved through liberalization of the cereal markets, better water management /
irrigation and sustained subsidies on inputs (notably in cotton and rice). The subsidy of
importations of fertilizers has played a big role in the increase in production of maize and rice
production. Subsidies have increased overall access and predictability in the supply of fertilizers,
thus favoring consumption. Under the rice program, farmers paid only 12,500 FCFA/50 kg sack
for eligible fertilizers at a time when market prices were in the 17,500 to 20,000 FCFA/sack range
(Staatz et al., 2011). However limited access to markets and improved technology (only a small
percent of farmers uses improved seed) climate change, including drought, and volatility in
primary commodity process have left the country economically vulnerable and have resulted in
repeated food insecurity crises.

31.     The government has placed the agricultural sector towards the top of its development
priorities for several decades. In 2014, budget allocations to the sector increased from 11 to 15
percent of the total budget. The Government Action Plan (Plan d’Action Gouvernemental)
developed in 2013 for the period 2013-2018 reiterates the new government’s commitment to the
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (Cadre Stratégique Pour la Croissance et la Reduction de
la Pauvrété 2012 - 2017 - CSCRP) which was adopted by the Council of Ministers in 2011 prior
to the crisis.

1.4      Conflict in the north
32.     The conflict that erupted in 2012 in north Mali and which led to a coup d’état is the
last in a series, and is a manifestation of long-standing problems in the country’s governance
and social structures.33 The causes of the conflict are diverse and multi-layered and do not fit the
simplified narrative of an underserved region populated by an ethnic group that has been vying for
independence ever since the Republic of Mali was formed and that is frustrated about the lack of
implementation of past peace accords. What drives conflict in Mali can be traced to a breakdown
in the social contract, growing competition over resources (public funds as well as illicit rents),
weak institutions, inequality, and underlying social tensions. These drivers of fragility are
exacerbated by climate change and population growth that has put people’s livelihood under stress,
growing access to arms and illicit rent seeking opportunities, and persistently high levels of
unemployed youth who are more easily recruited for such illicit activities.34

33.     Illegal trade and trafficking fueled and continues to fuel the conflict. The arrival of
highly profitable income opportunities from smuggling cigarettes, drugs, weapons and fuel (from
Algeria), from keeping hostages for ransom and from the misappropriation of public funds, led to
the emergence of a new set of actors with the means and the motivation to protect their interests
through violence.35 These networks have been able to develop as a consequence of the
demilitarization accord granted with the National Pact and Alger Accords, which left the region
vastly uncontrolled. The new income opportunities upset traditional social structures and youth
found new pathways to economic independence. As the new elite exploited existing grievances to
gain legitimacy, matters were aggravated by authorities in Bamako who benefitted from the new
opportunities for self-enrichment but who also tried to exert control by favoring certain ethnic
groups over others, by coopting selected leaders and by appointing civil servants from the south
instead of from the north. This contributed to social instability, high levels of corruption and low
levels of service delivery and created space for extremist religious interpretations.

34.     The conflict had very negative welfare consequences. The conflict disrupted the
provision of public services, such as hospitals, pharmacies and schools, as well as infrastructure
for the distribution of water and electricity. According to the 2013 Afrobarometer survey, close to
one out of three Malians were affected, personally or through family members.36 Pervasive looting
of financial service providers and cereal storehouses by armed groups reduced the capacity to
provide credit and mitigated food security in the region. The crisis had dramatic effects on health
infrastructure and services as many facilities were destroyed, medical stores pillaged, and vehicles
stolen. By mid-2012 only 23 percent of qualified medical staff were still at their posts, and 17
percent of community health centers were still operational.37 With breakdowns in the supply chain,
vaccination rates collapsed in north Mali. The rate of BCG vaccinations for children under the age

   The return of heavily armed fighters from Libya and the possible presence of large mineral deposits (oil, gas and
phosphate) in northern Mali are additional complications. Prospecting for oil and gas started in 2004 and there are
strong indications of significant oil and gas reserves. However, these reserves are not yet confirmed and the economic
viability of extracting them from geographically isolated areas is unclear, particularly amid a resurgence of conflict
and lower world prices.

of one fell to 8 percent in 2012 from 92 percent the year before. Also the use of curative and
prenatal health services declined dramatically in north Mali. Effects were as pervasive in
education. Fighters destroyed, looted and occupied over 130 schools in 2012, while over 1,300
teachers had left, reducing local capacities to teach by at least a quarter, and by as much as two
thirds in Kidal.

35.     The conflict displaced around 353,000 people within Mali, while another 170,000
people fled to neighboring countries, representing approximately 36 percent of the total
population of the north of Mali38 and leading to overcrowded education and health facilities in
areas which welcomed the Internal Displaced People (IDPs) in terms of class size, pupil-teacher
ratios and bed occupancy ratios 39,. As of July 2014, the date for which the latest statistics are
available, the total number of refugees and IDPs was still around 266,000, and with the latest surge
in fighting, this number is likely to have increased again.40

36.      Drought and conflict had a negative impact on social services delivered in the south
and gains in access made during the previous decade were undone, although there was a
partial recovery in 2013. In the education system, for instance gains in access made during the
previous decade were undone. Between 2001 and 2011, primary gross enrollment rate improved
by 28 percentage points, going up to 80 percent; gains in secondary education were even higher.
After the crisis, enrollment rates fell across all levels of education erasing much of the gains made
since 2001 in a matter of two years. For example, had growth in gross enrollment rates continued
their trend increase, at the lower secondary level, one would have seen rates of 63 percent in the
south and 56 percent in the north in 2013; instead the prevailing rates were 50 percent and 20

37.     Herders, traders and large farms were hit hardest because the conflict reduced
human mobility, limited access to markets and led to the theft of assets. Herders who owned
many livestock were forced to leave places of conflict for safer areas in southern Mali or
neighboring countries, whereas those who had fewer livestock were forced to raise their animals
within their compounds. Traders were unable to move or faced the risk of being attacked and losing
their goods and money. The absence of a well-functioning banking system exacerbated the
insecurity of traders who had no secure way of storing the cash they had earned. Farmers were cut
off from their fields and unable to produce their crops. Others engaged in fishing and subsistence
farming, experienced lower levels of disruption during the crisis as their operations were already
isolated from support services; their profit margins were also not attractive for marauding rebel
groups.42

38.     The conflict, which coincided with a drought, also had a negative impact on the
overall economy. There was a serious economic contraction in 2012, mostly for two reasons. The
first one was the strong reduction of Official Development Assistance (ODA), following the
military coup of March 2012, leading to a slashing of the public investment budget and a large
contraction in the construction sector. The second source of economic contraction was the poor
security situation, which decimated tourism, increased transport costs and limited the willingness
of foreign investors to consider investing in Mali (in the mining industry in particular). As a result,
GDP per capita in 2013 (when the consequences of the 2012 drought also were felt –the
agricultural sector contracted by 14 percent), was at the same level as it was in 2007-8.

   It is important to note that the administrative data published by the education ministry depicts a different picture at
the regional level. At the primary level, administrative data suggests that reductions in the enrolment rate generally
happened in 2012 (a year for which we do not have survey data) and recovery began in 2013 in almost every region
except for Bamako. Administrative data on secondary is more in line with the survey data for both gross enrolment
rates and regional variation.

39.     While the situation was difficult, Malian society demonstrated its resilience. Internally
displaced persons were taken in by already poor families; schools accommodated the influx of
newly displaced students. The children of the displaced families were generally able to register in
their host communities. Basic institutions like municipalities, parliament and local councils
remained operational – even in some cases in the north. The EITI report was prepared and
published and presidential and parliamentary elections were successfully held in 2013. Throughout
the crisis the budget was rigorously managed to avoid heavy indebtedness and to ensure macro-
economic stability. Starting in 2013, the economy benefited from the rapid resumption of foreign
assistance and GDP growth returned to pre-crisis levels.

40.     Since the signing of a preliminary peace accord, north Mali remains insecure and
services remain disrupted. Episodes of fighting are common between the armed groups and the
army but also between armed groups themselves. Improvised Explosive Device (IED), rocket and
suicide attacks occur regularly. The redeployment of civilian administration and resumption of
public service delivery remains limited and, as violence has increased recently, are being
interrupted again.43 Rebel groups have carved out an area, demarcated by the line Lerneb –not far
from the border with Mauretania – Tombouctou – Bourem – Gao - Ouattagouna at the border with
Niger, north of which they are in control and which they are unlikely to give up. In this area pro-
independence forces (amongst whom the MNLA is most widely known) are building their
legitimacy by creating basic governance structures, while militant factions (AQMI; Anser Dine;
Mujao) use the absence of state control to rebuild their strengths.44

1.5      Governance
41.     Governance indicators are poor. Mali’s democracy was long hailed as a model in Africa
but the crisis changed this perception. Irrespective of the indicator that is selected, its ranking for
2012 is substantially less than it was for 2007. The deterioration cannot only be explained by
developments in the north, declining scores for the control of corruption and government
effectiveness point to more widespread problems.

42.    Poor generic governance indicators translate into a poor performance on the Doing
Business Indicator; with an overall rank of 155 in 2014 Mali belongs to the worst 20 percent
performers. Trading across borders and paying taxes are the areas in which performance is weakest
(with rankings of 160 and 157 respectively). On the global competitiveness index, Mali also
performs poorly; it was ranked 128th out of 139 countries in the 2013-14 report.

43.     Two examples illustrate the consequences of poor governance for the development
prospects of Mali. The first is for education, with an average of 2.4 years of education, Malians
aged 15 and above are the third least educated in the world.45 Addressing such low levels of human
capital is a development priority for the government, and approximately 15 percent of the total
43
   983 schools have reopened (74% of a total of 1,320 schools before the crisis) and 4,424 teachers have resumed their
positions (77% per cent of a total of 5,772 teachers before the crisis). In the health sector, access to basic health
services improved in Gao and Timbuktu while the situation in Kidal remains precarious. As of July 2014, some 50
per cent of health workers in Gao and Timbuktu regions were delivering services (SG report, draft August 2014).
44
   All rebel groups benefit from what may be coined the ‘economics of insecurity’ and are able to finance themselves
through illegal trade in weapons or drugs, kidnapping for ransom, or by smuggling fuel and cigarettes.

budget is allocated to primary education. None the less, primary school enrollment and the
efficiency and quality of learning remain distressingly low. In 2013, 20 percent of students
repeated their grade and in rural areas only 40 percent of pupils who started primary school also
completed it. In urban areas, completion rates are higher, but at 74 percent, are equally low. Poor
efficiency is also reflected in poor quality of learning; of every 100 children who are eligible to go
to school, only 63 actually do. Of these, 41 reach grade 5, of whom only 5 (13 percent) are able to
analyze a text in French and express themselves in writing.46 This is in part due to the quantity of
instruction; students in Mali received 71 percent of the planned instructional time in 2009-10. 47
Underlying these results are poorly functioning public sector systems. Public financial
management is weak and the budget made available for education is not used efficiently;48 teachers
are few, under-qualified and poorly trained.49 This state of affairs leads to a situation in which
many parents – themselves often uneducated – are reluctant to send their children to school,
particularly their daughters, as primary school costs money (in unofficial fees) and provides a
barely discernible education.

44.     The second example relates to tax policy. Tax evasion is huge and 80-90 percent of
importers and public service providers are estimated to have errors in their tax declarations which
means that the state misses 2.8 percent of GDP in taxes. Fiscal exemptions are enormous (4.2
percent of GDP in 2013) and lack a clear rationale.50 On the other hand, the implementation of the
tax system is very imperfect, generating important distortions. For instance the application of the
VAT 18 percent rate and other taxes can be costly for small businesses and creates a strong
disincentive for small and medium entrepreneurs to formalize particularly if they will have to
compete with informal sector firms that escape VAT or those in the formal sector that are
exempted. It is one of the (many) reasons for the relative absence of small and medium sized
formal firms and the dominance of entrepreneurs who focus on commerce (which has a rapid
turnover and is easier to hide from the tax-man) rather than on economic transformation. It also
explains why 25 percent of medium sized enterprises and 70 percent of the small ones do not meet
their tax obligations and why only 1 out of every 5 formal enterprises is a net VAT payer.

45.     Governance problems continue throughout the public sector. The off budget purchase
of a presidential plane and non-lethal military equipment under “national interest” or “secret
defense” procedures are just the latest illustrations of governance issues that stretch from the petty
(long procurement delays and highly bureaucratic procedures; poor targeting of (fertilizer and
electricity) subsidies; inadequate distribution of health workers51), to serious (corruption in the
collection of water fees by the Office du Niger; limited competition in the telecom sector), to
outrageous (if confirmed -- claims of the involvement of public officials in drug trade or
kidnapping for ransom; the inability to address long standing issues with the quality of education).

46.     The decentralization process has been slowed by governance problems.
Decentralization and local governance reform–a priority for the government since the start of the
third republic in 1991, have progressed very slowly. Some formal authority was decentralized in
a relatively bottom-up process in the 1990s, but consolidation of decentralized governance has
lagged, especially in the areas of local autonomy, fiscal transfers and downward accountability.52
The central state continues to exercise a significant degree of top-down authority (tutelle), despite
the fact that sub-national governments are independently elected and have had public service
responsibilities decentralized to them. The fiscal autonomy of sub-national governments is limited
and accountability is upward and more focused on whether administrative (PFM) rules have been
followed and on whether political imperatives are met than on actual performance in service
delivery.53 54 55

47.      The conflict in the north gives new impetus to the decentralization process.56 Its
effective implementation will entail major changes and there is likely to be resistance in the central
part of the administration (as powers and resources would be devolved). Successful
implementation will depend on the ability to build local capacity and to transfer real
responsibilities to the local level. The litmus test on decentralization is whether actual resources
will be transferred to local entities and whether service provision improves as a result. To date,
this test largely fails to be passed.

48.     These governance problems are not new and have been well documented. Box 1.2
presents an illustration from 2003. In 2005, the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in an
independent review of World Bank support to capacity building in Mali, noted how “efforts to
introduce institutional change confront challenges not only of patronage in senior public
employment but also instability of government structures, lack of clear boundaries among
structures, and weak systems of both monitoring and evaluation and checks and balances. [..].
Efforts at organizational strengthening confront the tendency to create or maintain redundant

   According to WHO standards Mali has enough health workers but with a large concentration of doctors, nurses and
midwifes in the capital rural areas area largely underserved.
52
   For instance, communes are required to present their budgets publicly, but rarely do so.
53
   The Bank’s urban development project is amongst the first attempts to create a clear relation between performance
and fiscal transfers and it will be worthwhile to study this example more closely and to explore options to more
systematically introduce performance based approaches.

agencies to benefit politically influential actors. And human resource capacity building is impeded
most directly by deficiencies in the National Directorate of Public Service and Personnel—the
central agency in charge of strategic planning of human resources, formulation of human resources
policy, and management of public servants recruitment and careers.”(OED, 2005, page 5).
        Box 1. 2: The deterioration in the public sector environment: a perspective from 2003
 Corruption: Corruption in Mali is systemic. Accusations of corruption contributed to the 1991 coup that
 ushered in Mali’s democratic ‘Third Republic’. Yet, under the Third Republic, corruption has worsened.
 Democracy brought a new group of leaders to power, many of whom equated democracy with license.
 According to economic actors, under the former republic it was only necessary to pay a bribe at one
 level; now bribes are paid at all levels.

 The relationship between state and society: The administration is isolated from society and is not
 governed by the notion of serving clients. Having long experienced an ineffective administration in
 addressing their needs, Malians expect little from the state. Citizens and economic operators are devoid
 of political ideology, and they adhere to political parties to access public resources. They typically require
 from the government and the political system private, rather than public, goods and services, and they
 sell their political support for meager, immediate, private benefits rather than the investment in public
 infrastructures: “receiving one dollar today is better than getting a school in the village the next year.”

 The performance of the bureaucracy: Mali has a political system marked by patronage, whereby public
 sector posts are filled with those who produce rents for their patron, for the political party and for
 themselves. The system of human resource management is not objective. Senior posts are filled through
 connections instead of qualifications; as new political officials are appointed existing senior servants are
 sidelined often without explanation. The sale of administrative influence often has high pay-offs, and
 clients exist in virtually all areas of the society. The posts in public administration can be viewed as assets
 that generate licit flows of income including wages and allowances, and illicit incomes flowing from
 embezzlement of public property, sale of public influence, and use of discretionary power to get private
 gains. Those who have the power to recruit and to fire require to be given part of the benefits associated
 with the posts to be filled or request other personal services. As a result, promotions and vacant posts are
 filled with incompetent and untrustworthy people, explaining the drop in the quality of the personnel.
 These practices spread in the administrative hierarchies, widening the circle of complicities, and making
 it difficult for those involved in the system to get out from the network.

2.      POVERTY AND SHARED PROSPERITY PATTERNS
In 2010 and using the dollar a day poverty line headcount poverty was 51 percent. Since that time poverty
has increased as a consequence of the 2012 drought and the conflict in the north. Prior to this, between
2001 and 2010, poverty declined very rapidly as growth was pro-poor. The decline in poverty is closely
associated with the increase in cereal production, with increased remittances, improved on and off farm
employment opportunities (casual labor; artisanal gold mining) and improvements in road infrastructure.
The poorest households are food insecure and even though they are primarily farmers and pastoralists,
they depend on casual labor opportunities to make ends meets. The poorest households depend on
purchased foods and payments in kind to sustain themselves and their welfare is affected strongly (and
negatively) by food price fluctuations, health and weather shocks. The poorest households cultivate small
areas of land and do not own livestock. The most destitute households have few able bodied household
members (widows); they are trapped in poverty and often work for low wages on other people’s farms.

2.1       Incidence of poverty
49.    Levels of poverty are high as more than half the population (51 percent) lived below
the dollar-a-day poverty line in 2010. Other indicators of welfare confirm the high level of
poverty. On the 2014 Human Development Index, Mali occupied the 176th rank (last but twelve);57
the multi-dimensional poverty index (which uses 10 indicators) puts Mali amongst the three
poorest countries in the world.

50.     Poverty is a rural phenomenon, now and in the foreseeable future. In 2010, 90 percent
of all poor people lived in rural areas. Even with rapid urbanization, the vast majority of poor
people will continue to live in rural areas. For instance, if levels of rural and urban poverty remain
unchanged, and the pace of urbanization continues as it does today, then by 2030, 83 percent of all
poor will reside in rural areas. Even under a more optimistic scenario in which poverty in rural
areas is reduced to the same level as that in urban areas (i.e. a drop in poverty incidence from 51
percent to 14 percent) and despite a significant number of people moving to urban areas, the
majority of poor people (53 percent) would still reside in rural areas by 2030.

51.     Weak statistical capacity hinders the accurate measurement and interpretation of
poverty and poverty trends. Mali has no shortage of household surveys collecting information
about household consumption, information critical to the measurement of poverty. Since 2000,
representative household surveys were fielded in 2001 (EMEP), 2006 and 2010 (ELIM) and in
2011 and 2013 (EMOP). However each of these surveys is affected by structural weaknesses.
Amongst the most critical shortcomings are (i) the separate collection of information on quantities
and prices (EMEP and ELIM) leading to low data quality; (ii) the absence of a price questionnaire
to collect stratum specific prices; (iii) the change in recall period (from 12 months to 7 days)
between ELIM and EMOP and (iv) the change in the way consumption information is recorded
(as values only) starting in 2011. As a consequence, poverty trends are not comparable before and
after 2010. Moreover by using national (instead of regional) prices to value the basket of goods

used to compute the regional food poverty lines, poverty incidence is overestimated in some
regions (surplus food producers with low food prices), and underestimated in others. 58
                                       Box 2. 1: Gender inequality
 At the national level, Mali has established some important legal underpinnings for the promotion of
 gender equality. In practice, however, there are considerable social, economic and institutional barriers.
 Men are considered the heads of households and are, in rural areas, the managers of farm activities.
 Consequently women have limited control over household income and restricted access to other means
 of production such as equipment, raw material, and technology. This situation marginalizes women into
 less profitable activities and means that men and women operate according to different incentives and
 needs. Women spend more time on domestic chores – over three hours per day, compared to 35 minutes
 for men - and the processing and selling of fish, milk and hides and skins59. On the farm, women
 concentrate on food crop production and small animal husbandry while men own cattle and dominate
 cash crop production. When activities that women are involved in reach a certain level of profitability,
 men tend to enter in increasing numbers – this is thought to have happened in the case of shea butter
 production60, and also happens when irrigated plots become more productive.61

 Social norms contribute to high levels of domestic violence and lower levels of education. Only 25
 percent of adult women are literate, compared to 43 percent of men; 89 percent of women believe that a
 man has the right to beat his wife for reasons like going out without permission, refusing to have sex and
 neglecting the children. Levels of female genital mutilation are very high, 94 percent. Women face
 distinct health challenges compared to men; malaria is a serious for pregnant women62; and the maternal
 mortality rate, though decreasing, remains high.

 Among women, widows are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence on men for many aspects of
 their livelihood. Female headed households are 15 percent poorer than male headed households, a
 difference that is entirely accounted for by marital status, rather than female headship per se. Widowhood
 causing many women to fall deeper into poverty63. This may partly be due to the fact that women’s rights
 in Mali are dependent on men. For example, women’s access to land tends to be gained through use
 rights during marriage, with husbands remaining the sole owners of family property. When a husband
 dies, only 40 percent of widows receive any assets64. Even if female widows remarry they may continue
 to be at a disadvantage, as they are likely to have a lower status in their new household upon remarrying.
 Women who are married but previously widowed were found to be more likely to report problems getting
 permission to access health care and less likely to have the resources to access care. The gender specific
 impacts of widowhood are not restricted to the widow herself – evidence suggests that marital shocks in
 Mali lead to greater negative impacts on human capital investment in daughters than in sons.

   The differences in women’s and men’s main areas of activity mean that there are different incentives and needs
driving their actions. This can be illustrated by the findings of a randomized insurance experiment in Burkina Faso
and Senegal which showed that female farm managers were less likely to take out weather insurance and more likely
to invest in savings for emergencies. The authors speculate that this result is a reflection of the fact that women face
risks that are not covered by weather insurance, such as the risks of childbirth or risks to production and income
resulting from the need to care for sick children (Delevallade et al, 2014).

52.     A regional comparison of consumption and non-monetary estimates of poverty
illustrates the measurement problem. Using the traditional (consumption) poverty measure,
Sikasso is the region with the highest incidence of poverty (83.2 percent) even though the region
is generally believed to have relatively low levels of poverty on account of its agro-ecological
potential and its association with cotton as a consequence of relatively good market accessibility
and availability of inputs. But when using an asset based measure, which yields the same poverty
headcount at the national level as the consumption based measure (42.5 percent in 2010 – using
the national poverty line), we find a rate of poverty incidence in Sikasso that is below the national
average: 34.7 percent)65. The issue seems closely associated with the fact that food prices vary
across Mali. Data from the Observatoire des Marchés Agricoles show, for October 2014, that a
kg of millet costs 240 FCFA in Kayes but only 187 FCFA in Ségou; for maize the difference was
more pronounced: 250 FCFA in Tombouctou versus 128 FCFA in Sikasso. These price differences
are not adequately reflected in the food poverty lines, leading to an overestimation of poverty in
food surplus regions such as Sikasso, and an underestimation of poverty in the food deficit regions
such as Tombouctou, Gao, Kidal and Mopti.

53.     In the absence of improvements in the way consumption and poverty are measured,
the spatial pattern of poverty is subject to major uncertainties. A new LSMS-ISA survey
which addresses the shortcomings of the aforementioned surveys is in the field and first results are
expected for late 2015. This survey will allow reassessing the spatial patterns of poverty as well
as the poverty profile and possibly remaking the poverty map. Meanwhile extreme caution has
been used when interpreting poverty and poverty trends and combined approaches (consumption
poverty, asset based poverty and livelihoods approaches) has been used to construct the narrative.



65
  Asset poverty is estimated based on the Multiple Correspondence Analysis from several indicators of the ownership
of durable goods (radio, television, landline phone, mobile phone, refrigerator, freezer, computer, air-conditioner,
ventilator, time piece, jewelry, land, dish, bicycle, motorcycle, car, cart, canoe, stove, table, carpet, mat, chair,
armchair, dressing table, sewing machine, bed, couch, sideboard, wardrobe). The asset poverty line is set such that the
asset poverty is equal to monetary poverty at the national level.

2.2      Changes in poverty since 2001

54.    Between 2001 and 2010 poverty and inequality decreased rapidly. Particularly between
2001 and 2006 the reduction in poverty was substantial. Poverty incidence (using the dollar-a-day
poverty line) declined from 60 percent in 2000, to 53 percent in 2006 to 51 percent in 2010; the
Gini coefficient dropped from 0.40, to 0.39 to 0.33 respectively. Even though the incidence of
poverty declined, the rate of decline was too slow to reduce the absolute number of poor which
increased by around 360,000 as a consequence of Mali’s high population growth.

55.     Since 2010 poverty has increased but probably not by much. Estimates from a general
equilibrium model of the economy suggest consumption declined by 2 percent per capita between
2011 and 2012. If this estimate is followed it suggests that poverty increased slightly since 2010.66

56.     Malnutrition trends mirror the poverty trends. Mali’s malnutrition rates dropped
considerably between 2001 and 2010. Between 2010 and 2012, malnutrition increased as a result
of the food, political, and security crisis, but it began to improve again by 2013, at least in the
south.67 The prevalence of stunting in children under five declined from 43 percent in 2001 to 28
percent in 2010, and then—after a small increase in 2011 and 2012—dropped to 27.5 percent in
2013. Wasting declined from a high of 15 percent in 2006 to 9 percent in 2010, and the percent of
children who are underweight declined from 29 percent in 2001 to 19 percent in 2010, with a slight
increase in 2011 and 2012.68

57.     Ownership of consumer durables follows the same pattern; it increased significantly
between 2001 (EMEP) and 2011 (EMOP) and declined thereafter. Information on the
ownership of consumer durables is comparable across the various household surveys. Since 2001
the fraction of households owning fridges doubled from 5 percent to 11 percent, while the
ownership of televisions almost tripled going from 14 percent to 37 percent. The increase of mobile
phone ownership amongst households is remarkable. It increased from virtually zero in 2001 to 67
percent in 2011, suggesting they are now an essential utility, including for poor households. A
similar trend is observed with respect to motor bikes. Over the course of one decade ownership
almost tripled from 17 percent to 48 percent. The increase in asset ownership can be attributed to
the drop in real prices for many consumer durables and the increase in disposable income amongst
the poorest households. Post 2011 asset ownership declined slightly.




66
   The EMOP data for 2013 are preliminary and it is critical that a final dataset becomes available. It is even more
important that a survey is fielded that collects consumption information that is comparable to what was collected by
EMEP/ELIM.
67
   Given that the 2012 and 2013 Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) surveys
did not cover the whole country but focused mainly on the southern regions (where 90 percent of the population lives),
we needed to verify how different the trends in nutritional outcomes between the North and the South were before
these dates. The analysis shows that, most of the time, the level and trend of under-nutrition are not significantly
different between the North and the South, validating the interpretation of the latest trends. It is likely, however, that
the 2013 improvement would not be reflected in the data on the North, as also later illustrated by the case of Gao.
68
   These levels indicate a serious problem of malnutrition according to the WHO classification.

2.3    Explaining the observed poverty trends
58.     A pro-poor pattern of consumption growth was the main reason for the rapid decline
in poverty between 2001 and 2010. Considering the entire period, consumption growth was
higher amongst the poorest households than amongst the richest, whose consumption stagnated or
even declined. Because of this pattern of consumption growth, the Gini-coefficient dropped from
0.39 to 0.33. Breaking the 2001-2010 period into two, one notes that between 2001 and 2006
poverty declined particularly rapidly as per capita consumption increased for all wealth groups:
poor households benefited about as much as the rich did (the Gini-coefficient remained more or
less constant over this period). This changed in the period between 2006 and 2010. Now only the
very poorest households experienced positive consumption growth and few were actually lifted
over the poverty line (i.e. the decline in poverty was limited). The middle class experienced no
growth and per capita consumption for those in the top 30 percentiles declined. Because poor
household consume significantly less than the non-poor, average annual per capita consumption
growth was negative during this period (-2.0 per cent).

59.     Even though the household surveys were not designed to be representative at the
livelihood zone level, it is possible to calculate per capita consumption growth by zone. The
figure which presents per capita consumption growth at the mean and for the bottom 20 percent of
households confirms the pro-poor pattern of consumption growth observed earlier; on average
consumption growth for the bottom 20 percent was higher than that for the mean (3.4 percent

                                                  31
versus 0.6 percent). The figure also illustrates how in some livelihood zones, consumption growth
amongst the poorest households was considerably higher than that for other households. This holds
particularly for zones 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12in south Mali.

60.     Increases in consumption are associated with areas where rice, maize and sorghum
are grown. This is unsurprising given that following the liberalization of the food grain markets,
food grain production increased              Figure 2.5: Food grain production 1984-2015

61.    Increases in remittances also explain the rapid reduction in poverty. This can be
concluded from the increase in consumption for households living in livelihood zone 8.
Households in this zone have a tradition of international migration (often to France) and their
incomes are derived from remittances, sorghum cultivation and livestock rearing (agro-
pastoralism). Between 2001 and 2010 there was a three-fold increase in per capita remittances and
households in this zone benefited from it.

62.     Increases in infrastructure and new labor opportunities brought about by artisanal
gold mining have allowed increases in consumption in livelihood zones 9 (west and central),
8 (north of Kayes) and 12 (south of Kayes). Newly built infrastructure has substantially
improved connectivity between Bamako and Senegal, a response primarily due to the civil war
that broke out in Côte d’Ivoire in 2002.69

63.     The decline of consumption in livelihood zone 10 (north Sikasso) is noteworthy as it
suggests an area with low levels of consumption and negative consumption growth. One
explanation for the decline in consumption in this zone is that whilst it used to be a productive
agricultural zone that produced much cotton, this has changed as a result of climate change. As the
zone is becoming more arid, its high level of population density can no longer be sustained.

2.4      Comparing poor and non-poor households
64.   A comparison of better off and poorest farmers reveals four critical facts that are relevant
when preparing a poverty reduction strategy

65.     Finding 1: Poor agricultural and pastoralist households earn most of their cash
income through casual labor, trade and self-employment. As illustrated in Figure 2.6 the
poorest do not earn the majority of their cash income from the sale of crops, fruits and livestock
but from (casual) labor, trade and self-employment. This in contrast to better off rural households
who do earn most of their cash from the sale of crops and animal (products). Typical labor
opportunities open to the poorest are associated with agriculture. They arise during the planting
and harvesting seasons and involve clearing and preparing fields and sowing, weeding and
harvesting crops. As peak labor demand is during and after the rains, labor opportunities compete
with working in one’s own fields. Labor opportunities outside the peak agricultural season are few
and involve brick-making or construction. The poorest households also obtain a large fraction of
their cash income from trade and self-employment. The options are limited as the poor lack the
capital to engage in more remunerative self-employment activities such as trade, commerce or
agricultural transformation and artisanal gold mining. Firewood/charcoal and wild food/product
sales are the activities in which the poor engage commonly, followed by handicrafts and
hay/bourgou sales.

66.     One implication is that additional casual labor opportunities, particularly those that
arise after the crop season, would be beneficial to the poorest households. Policies to facilitate

69
   Contrary to popular perception the development of industrial gold mining did not drive the improvement in
infrastructure. The dependence of gold mines on road or rail infrastructure is limited because gold tends to be shipped
out by airplane.

seasonal labor migration could be instrumental to poverty reduction70 as would be labor intensive
public works. In the pastoral zone where most livestock is owned by the better off (Figure E.1)
policies that increase the demand for labor from poor pastoralists in, for instance the Office du
Niger or in the Niger delta, may be more effective in reducing poverty than interventions aimed at
cattle or other large animals which are largely owned by the better off.

67.     Finding 2: Poor households lack the productive assets needed to cultivate substantial
areas. In arid and semi-arid farming systems, timing is everything as the growing season is short.
When the time for land preparation arrives, being able to plow is critical, as it allows bringing
more land under cultivation. Those who are unable to plow are forced to prepare their land using
the traditional daba (a type of hoe) and end up cultivating small areas. Poor households typically
do not own traction animals and lack the ability to pay for plowing services. At times they may
also lack the time as they may be forced to first work on the fields of wealthier households, before
devoting themselves to their own fields. This happens for instance when debts have to be paid off.
As a consequence the poorest cultivate small areas of land. This is illustrated in Figure 2.7. It
shows that in every agro-ecological zone, poor households grow the smallest areas per capita; poor
households are also the ones with the least animals.

70
   The poorest often lack the means to migrate to casual labor opportunities, either because they have too few able-
bodied household members or lack the cash to pay for transport. If poor households do migrate they tend to migrate
less far than better off households who have the means to pay for travel over long distances. Poor household thus have
to forego the most remunerative sources of income open to the better of who may end up working in Ghana,
Mauretania, Côte d’Ivoire, Algeria or even in Europe and depend on local casual labor opportunities.

                                                                34

68.      Finding 3: Poor households are short in labor. The most destitute households are small
and comprise few able bodied household members (widows; those with high dependency ratios).
71, 72
       In the absence of productive assets, labor is the primary asset of poor households. The
criticality of labor explains the limited demand for family planning services as there is a preference
for large families. The precise advantages for large households probably lay in different directions,
including the ability to rapidly command labor (for planting) in the absence of an active labor
market73, more disciplined labor use, more intensive use of costly productive assets and different
savings patterns74. As human capital is their prime asset, poor health and limited education reduce
labor productivity, affecting poor households disproportionately. Those living in a household
where the head has no education or is illiterate are much more likely to be poor than those living
in a household where the head completed primary or secondary education. Ill health also affects
the productivity of households directly. Malaria is an acute source of risk because it is most
prevalent when labor demands are highest: during the rainy season. Malnutrition is a more chronic
risk: high levels of anemia (in part caused by frequent bouts of malaria and regular infections) and
stunting caused by poor diets (poor households rarely drink milk) reduce labor productivity. One
implication that follows from this is that improvements in human capital are of direct relevance to
poor households.

   Some poor households seem to become victim to a negative feedback loop between poverty and ‘escaping’ able
bodied dependents who spent very long periods on labor migration remitting very little.

69.     Finding 4: Poor households purchase a large share of their consumption needs.
Because poor households cultivate relatively small areas of land and because they lack access to
modern inputs which would allow them to intensify their production, harvests tend to be
insufficient to cover their needs. Even when harvests are sufficient, the need to settle debts often
forces poor households to sell part of their crop after the harvest (when prices are relatively low).
As a consequence, poor households purchase a large share of their food needs using cash earned
through paid labor. Wealthy households, however, consume mostly what they have self-produced
as illustrated in Figure 2.8. One implication from this is that low food prices are beneficial, not
only to rural households, but especially to poor rural households.

2.5     Vulnerability and exposure to shocks
70.      As Mali’s population sustains itself from subsistence agriculture and pastoralism and
lives in dry-land areas that are poorly connected to markets and heavily dependent on
rainfall, the majority of the population is highly vulnerable to shocks. Exposure to weather
shocks (drought) and shocks affecting productive assets and output (illness, crop pests, animal
diseases) can lead to major crises characterized by food insecurity and widespread malnutrition.75
It is estimated that more than 25 percent (over 3 million) of the population are chronically food-
insecure, and that around 1.7 million of people are permanently at risk of hunger.76 Orphans and
vulnerable children, those with reduced physical capacities (people with disabilities and elderly)
and those unable to access or use productive assets (widows, those affected by the conflict in the
north) are particularly vulnerable. Households are also exposed to significant health risks. The
risks associated to childbirth are high given a maternal mortality rate of 368 deaths per 100,000
live births in 2012/3 and an average of 6.1 children per women. The most common causes of death
–respiratory infections (16 percent), diarrhea (9 percent), malaria (9 percent), perinatal conditions
(5 percent), HIV/AIDS (5 percent), tuberculosis (4 percent) and malnutrition (4 percent), are all

71.     Extreme events and other shocks have negative and long lasting consequences. Shocks
affect the poorest most, forcing families to rely on a range of largely informal, sub-optimal coping
mechanisms such as high-interest borrowing, rescheduling of or default on existing loans,
reductions in consumption, sale of household and productive assets (sometimes at highly reduced
prices), withdrawal of children from school, and, to the extent possible, reliance on family and
community support. Opportunities for the latter may be limited however, as covariate weather
shocks or conflict affect entire communities, placing a significant financial strain on everyone.
Poor households are particularly vulnerable when food prices rise and casual labor opportunities
are absent77. For pastoralists the worst possible combination is one of falling livestock prices and
rising food prices, a combination that typically occurs when a covariate shock (drought, insects,
insecurity) affects an area.78

3.       PATTERNS OF GROWTH

Despite the emergence of new sectors such as gold mining and telecommunications, the economy remains
geared towards the primary sector. GDP growth has been subject to large fluctuations, another reflection
of the vulnerability to weather shocks, and the absence of diversification. A low ranking on the Economic
Complexity Index reflects that the economy is mostly capable of producing basic products. In combination
with low levels of human capital and high transport costs, opportunities for economic transformation are
limited and growth will need to be found by increasing productivity in existing sectors.


72.    GDP growth fluctuates considerably from one year to the next but has, on average,
been positive. Average annual GDP growth was 4.4 percent since 1970 or slightly less than 2
percent per capita. GDP has shown large swings moving from as low as -11 percent in 1984/5 to
as high as + 12 percent four years later in 1989. Much of these swings can be attributed to the
compound effects of erratic rainfall as the production in the secondary and also tertiary sectors is
largely dependent on agricultural output. Changes in world market prices (cotton prices,
devaluation) and political instability took their toll too. The large influence of weather conditions
can also be observed in the evolution of prices; average rates of inflation are modest (less than 5
percent) but in times of adverse weather huge spikes in food prices can be observed, while prices
in non-food are relatively stable.

73.    The structure of GDP has remained relatively stable since 1990 with the primary and
tertiary sectors each contributing 35-40 percent to GDP and the secondary sector making up
the balance. Some changes in the relative importance of sectors occurred as new activities
emerged (gold –including from artisanal producers, mobile telecommunications) and as the
fortunes of the agricultural sector changed with the weather. The contribution of the primary sector
to GDP, for instance,79 has varied from 33 percent to 42 percent. Within the primary sector food

crops contribute approximately 50 percent followed by livestock rearing (25 percent). The cotton
sector is relatively less important contributing about 5 percent to primary GDP (and 1.7 percent to
overall GDP) but has been rebounding strongly recently.

74.     The share in overall GDP of the secondary sector, which depends in large part on the
primary sector for its inputs (food processing, cotton milling) and on the production of gold
fluctuated from 14 to 25 percent. Mali’s industrial sector is tiny (4 percent of GDP) and consists
largely of privately owned small enterprises, and a few large enterprises (cotton milling, electricity,
and mining). There was a surge in the contribution to GDP by the secondary sector between 2000
and 2006 when the production of gold came on steam and the construction sector was expanding
on account of large public investment projects. Since 2006 the contribution has leveled off and by
2012 the contribution of the secondary sector to GDP was comparable to that during the mid-1990s
in part because of the reduction in public investments following the 2012 crisis. Within the
secondary sector, gold production is the most important activity; it contributes about a third to
secondary sector GDP. Other important activities include construction (20 percent), energy (16
percent) and agribusinesses (12 percent) and textile (11 percent).

75.     The contribution of the tertiary sector to GDP is about as important as that of the
primary sector (37 percent on average since 1990). The sector is dominated by commerce,
which is at the heart of Mali’s informal economy. Most retail and trading activity takes place in
street markets and the modern retail distribution network is limited to shops that are often owned
by expatriates.80 The tertiary sector has increased in relative importance after 2006 as the transport
and commerce sectors benefited from improved infrastructure and as mobile telephony took off.81
The latter is revolutionizing the way certain services are delivered including in banking, health and

education. Trade is the most important contributor (43 percent) to tertiary sector GDP, followed
by transport (22 percent) and public administration (21 percent).

76.     Between 2000 and 2013, the rate of GDP growth was highest in the primary sector
(4.9 percent per annum on average) closely followed by the tertiary sector (4.8 percent). The
crop sector did well during this period as it benefitted from the liberalization of the cereal market.
Growth rates for rice production and cash crops (tobacco, fruits, and vegetables) were particularly
encouraging (around 8 percent) and yields for rice and particularly maize increased rapidly.
Growth rates for cotton and livestock were more sluggish and were around 3.7 percent per annum
on average. Unlike the primary sector, the secondary sector largely stagnated as the average annual
growth rate was 3.7 percent, barely above the rate of population growth. Within this sector, energy
production grew most rapidly (9 percent per year) followed by gold production (4.7 percent). In
the tertiary sector with an average real growth rate of 4.8 percent, trade and transportation were
the sectors with the highest rates of growth (6 and 8 percent respectively). The overall contribution
to GDP growth (which is the combined effect of sector size and growth rate) was highest for the
tertiary sector, averaging 1.7 percent over the 2000-2013 period, followed by the primary sector
(1.3 percent) and the secondary sector (0.8 percent). The crop and trade subsectors alone
contributed as much to growth (0.8 percent) as the entire secondary sector.

77.     From a use of GDP perspective, investments increased (from 16 to 22 percent of GDP)
at the expense of household consumption which declined from around 77 percent in 1999 to
around 68 percent in 2010. Public sector consumption remained stable at around 14 percent of
GDP. Throughout, the balance of payment has been negative (Mali imports more than it exports)
with an overage of around -8 percent of GDP. In terms of contribution to growth, household
consumption contributed around 3.3 percent to GDP growth, and capital formation, 2 percent.

78.     Growth can be decomposed into its components and attributed to changes in the size
of the labor force, the stock of knowledge (levels of education), capital goods available in the
economy and the efficiency with which everything is put together-total factor productivity.
In Mali growth has been driven by increases in the labor force (accounting for 2.2 percent per year
since 1990) and the stock of capital (1.1 percent per year). Increases in total factor productivity
(0.9 percent per year) and increases in human capital (0.7 percent per year) contributed less.
Because of the volatility of GDP growth, such growth accounting exercises are sensitive to the
period covered. For instance, total factor productivity increased by 0.5 percent per annum over the
period 2000-2010 and by 1.19 percent over the period 2001-2010. Still the important fact is that
total factor productivity remains positive implying that the economy is becoming more efficient.82

79.     Since 2000 the economy appears to have been less affected by shocks. Between 1970
and 2000 huge fluctuations can be observed in GDP growth rates but following the crisis in the
year 2000 when cotton producers went on strike, fluctuations in GDP (and TFP) have been less
extreme. This is not for a lack of shocks as Mali was affected by the 2002 crisis in Cote d’Ivoire,
a locust infestation in 2004, a combined food and financial crisis in 2008, a drought in 2010 and
the security crisis starting in 2012. It would be tempting to conclude that the economy has grown
more resilient. To some degree this may be correct as liberalization of producer prices and an open

cereals market, along with successful integrated rural agriculture programs and improved
management of the Office du Niger, led to an increase in cereal production. At the same time, the
increased resilience is partly due to luck as the negative impact of certain shocks was offset by
favorable other developments. For instance, the impact of the 2002 crisis in Côte d’Ivoire was
partly offset by the organization of the African Cup of Nations; the 2012 security crisis coincided
with a good agricultural season and an increase in gold prices. In 2013 the reverse happened: the
positive impact of the resumption of aid was partly offset by unfavorable weather conditions.

80.     Mali’s trade in goods has been characterized by large structural deficits. Export
performance has historically been weak, owing to a poorly diversified economy, a lack of skilled
labor and a difficult business operating environment that has constrained the development of
manufacturing exports. However, export receipts increased considerably from the late 1990s,
owing to the significant expansion in gold mining; gold replaced cotton as the most significant
source of foreign exchange in 2000. Mali remains heavily dependent on imports for capital
equipment. Food imports represent 17-20 percent of total imports in a typical year, while spending
on petroleum products weighs heavily on the country’s import bill. The trade balance is usually in
deficit and is financed by donor assistance and remittances.

81.     Although data on regional trade in food staples and livestock for Mali is not known
with certainty due to the largely informal of the trade, anecdotal evidence points toward the
sizeable nature of international exchanges and impact on populations engaging in this trade.
Mali is a large exporter of livestock. By one recent estimate (Josser and, 2014), exports of livestock
from Mali accounted for $240 million (in 2013), compared with cotton exports of about $380
million. Mali exports livestock mainly to Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, and to a lesser extent to
Guinea. There is also overall a surplus at the national level in cereal production. In particular, the
more than tripling of the maize production over the past 20 years has been fueled by both an
increase in domestic and foreign demand (Staatz, 2011).

82.      Macro and fiscal management do not present a major source of risks. Mali’s fiscal
situation and management are sound and its debt is at manageable levels. Commitment to solid
fiscal management is such that even during the 2012 crisis strong fiscal discipline was maintained.
Faced with an unexpected drop in tax revenue and aid (compared with the Budget Law 2012), the
government chose in 2012 to drastically cut public investment expenditures, so as to protect current
expenditures (salaries for education and health sectors in particular) and debt service (with a view
to facilitate the rapid resumption of aid as soon as political conditions would permit), while limiting
its financing on the domestic market to roll-over needs. End 2012, Mali’s external and domestic
public debt stood respectively at 26 and 4 percent of GDP but due to the vulnerability to changes
in gold prices as well as concessional financial inflows, the Debt Sustainability Analysis (2014)
put Mali at a moderate level of debt distress.

83.     The exchange rate and monetary policies are firmly set within the WAEMU
framework. In the West African Economic and Monetary Union the monetary and exchange rates
policies are independently run by the Central Bank, the BCEAO, which is mandated to ensure
price stability. Over its fifty years of existence, the BCEAO has established a strong track record
in terms of macro-economic management, keeping inflation under control in the monetary union
and protecting countries’ balance of payments from major disruptions. Owing to this lack of

                                                  42
monetary independence, Malian governments rely on fiscal policy as the main instrument for
achieving monetary stabilization.

84.    In the longer run a process of economic transformation will need to take place,
requiring a gradual expansion of the productive knowledge embedded in the economy. The
economy of Mali remains dominated by the primary sector. This dominance is reflected in the
country’s low ranking on the economic complexity index. According to this index which was
developed by Hausmann and Hidalgo (2008), a country should seek a development path that builds
on the knowledge captured in its existing product mix and aim to increase the complexity of the
products produced. Country’s don’t ‘jump’ from exporting cotton or gold to exporting cars, but
gradually build their productive capacities until the economy possesses the knowledge required to
move into a complex product area like cars. The Economic Complexity Index captures this
processes by measuring the total amount of productive knowledge that is embedded in an
economy. The index is calculated by accounting for the number of different types of products a
country produces and the complexity of these products as measured by the number of other
countries that are also able to make these products.

85.     In the short run Mali should focus on transformation within the agricultural sector.
In 2012 Mali ranked 102nd out of a total of 128 countries on the economic complexity index. The
low ranking reflects that the economy is capable of producing mostly basic products. In
combination with low levels of human capital and high transport costs, opportunities for moving
up (or for economic transformation) are limited and the country will need to explore the prospects
for growth that exist within the existing sectors. Mali should try to expand towards products that
are relatively low in economic complexity and close to what is already being produced: garments
and processed food. In addition there are opportunities to capture a larger share of the market for
products whose economic complexity is also relatively low and in which Mali has already shown
promise: the exports of cereals, tropical fruits, fish and cotton. By gradually expanding the
complexity of products that are produced, and by improving human capital in general, productive
knowledge is expanded and the foundation for economic transformation laid.

4.    POVERTY REDUCTION OPPORTUNITIES

An analytical framework to identify opportunities for poverty reduction and concomitant binding
constraints is presented. Achieving the twin goals is found to be feasible provided a pro-poor growth
strategy is put in place. As the conditions for economic transformation are not in place, and the majority
of the poor are (and will be) engaged in agriculture, pastoralism and the informal sector, a household
based analytical framework has been developed. It starts from the observation that to meet their
consumption needs, households face a budget constraint. This constraint can be alleviated through
increases in own production, wage labor and through redistribution. Critical building blocks for the
analysis are thus identified. They include human capital, equipment, geography but also interactions with
the market and the institutional environment. These building blocks are subsequently discussed in detail.

4.1     Analytical framework for poverty reduction
86.      It is feasible to significantly reduce poverty in Mali. With the majority of the population
living in poverty, the task of reducing poverty to 3 percent by 2030 may seem daunting. However,
the average poverty gap to the dollar a day poverty line was 16.5 percent in 2010. A poverty gap
of this magnitude adds up to a shortfall of $ 570 million dollar per year to bring all Malians up to
the modest $ 1.25 per day standard of living. This amount is equal to 7.6 percent of GDP83, 52
percent of all revenue or about twice the grants received by Mali in 2013. These numbers suggest
that it is feasible to significantly reduce poverty in Mali.

87.     Mali already has positive experiences with poverty reduction through income growth
and in combination with transfers, poverty could be eliminated by 2030. Between 2001 and
2010 poverty reduced significantly because, between 2001 and 2006, the incomes of all households
(rich and poor) increased while between 2006 and 2010 the incomes of poor households increased
while that of everybody else stagnated or even declined (growth was pro-poor). Using the annual
consumption growth rates observed between 2001 and 2010 by the poorest quintile (3.7 percent
per annum) to project poverty incidence by 2030, we find that poverty can be reduced to 4.4
percent by growth alone. This scenario may be overly optimistic, but a combination of (perfectly
targeted) transfers of 2 percent of GDP with 2 percent per capita growth for the poorest households
could feasibly eliminate poverty by 2030.

88.      A pro-poor growth strategy will have to raise the incomes of the poor in situ by raising
the productivity in the primary sector. The vast majority of poor households lives in rural areas
and depends on agriculture and livestock rearing for their income. The primary sector accounts for
a significant share of output and external trade and is likely to continue to do so in the medium
term. The continued buoyant supply of rural labor (as a result of high levels of population growth),
the low levels of formal education and the limited scope to enhance economic complexity by
embracing labor intensive manufacturing, suggests that large-scale ‘between-sector’ structural
change through a significant shift in the share of workers in agriculture to the manufacturing sector
is unlikely to materialize in the short run. A successful poverty reduction strategy will thus need
to start by raising the incomes of those involved in the primary sector.

83
  To compare, in 2010 0.26 percent of GDP was spent on social protection programs (World Bank 2015: Mali Social
Protection Policy Note).

                                                      45
89.     Primary sector development cannot be seen in isolation from the development of the
secondary and tertiary sectors, or from urban development. The interrelation between rural
and urban sectors is such that one cannot discuss one without the other. Urban areas demand food;
the rural sector provides migrant labor. The nature of development is such that urban areas play a
critical and often first-mover role: urban areas are the nodes in distribution networks; rural
financial instruments will not be developed in the absence of a healthy (urban) financial sector.
Telecom services are first developed for urban areas where purchasing power is highest. In other
words, well-functioning cities (this includes large cities, but also rural towns) are essential for the
development process.

90.     Within the primary sector off-farm growth strategies need to complement farm based
growth strategies. This includes strategies to vitalize small rural towns and district centers. Many
rural households depend on casual labor opportunities to supplement their incomes. Others engage
in artisanal mining84 or opt for (seasonal) migration. A large body of literature confirms the
importance of employment diversification into non-farm activities as it raises income and reduces
poverty, but off-farm economic activities also offer essential services to farmers (transport,
commerce and storage services; access to information; repair services).85 It is probably no
coincidence that amongst the zones with the most rapid reduction in poverty are those with
substantial off-farm income opportunities from migration (north Kayes), or cross border trade and
artisanal gold mining (south Sikasso).

91.     Despite the importance of off farm and urban growth for poverty reduction,
increasing agricultural production will be foundational to structural transformation and
sustainable poverty reduction. In this process agricultural (and livestock) sector output continues
to grow by expanding the area under cultivation and through productivity gains --powered by the
adoption of new technologies (including irrigation). In the process, as the share of food consumers
relative to food producers grows (urbanization), markets become more important, the non-farm
and agribusiness sectors grow along the food value chain and rural-urban linkages are
strengthened. The reallocation of resources from and to agriculture, the adoption of new
technologies and the development of new (irrigated) areas are sources of growth within the sector
but support economic growth in other sectors as well. The urban poor benefit from lower food
prices. The rural poor who farm benefit from productivity gains while non-farmers benefit from
spill-over gains. As incomes grow, the stock of human and physical capital increases, leading to
further productivity gains and to migration of (now better)-educated people to urban areas (which
supports the realization of positive agglomeration effects) and demographic transition as women
become better educated and marry later.



84
   In 2013 20 tons of gold (30% of total exports) came from artisanal and small scale mining (ASM). Because of
seasonality, informal, and transitory nature of ASM, exact numbers of miners are difficult to estimate but based on
production and census work from other countries in gold areas it is believed to be more than 300,000. The distribution
of income varies between different kind of workers in a “pit” (owners, diggers, haulers, loaders, etc.), but an artisanal
and small scale miners can earn up to CFA 20,000 per day. This income has helped revitalize farming activities, as
the money is often used to purchase fertilizers and pesticides (study on artisanal and small scale mining in Mali (Keita,
2001).

92.     Demand for increased primary production exists. A growing urban population can be
expected to sustain demand for cereals, milk, processed foods as well as animal products, the latter
fueling in turn a growing demand for livestock feed. Within the region there seems to be ample
scope to benefit from increased demand. Already regions close to neighboring markets have
witnessed positive poverty reduction suggesting that access to regional markets might be a factor.
The North-West Kayes and South region bordering Senegal (region 8 and 12) have benefitted from
the redirection of trade away from the Abidjan corridor following the crisis in Côte d’Ivoire and
the improvement of road infrastructure.

93.     A strategy to increase food production would turn high transport costs and a large
irrigation potential into a comparative advantage. Transport cost to the ports of West Africa
are notoriously high so increased local food production could substitute imports of rice and wheat
(Table 4.1 illustrates that both products appear in the list of 10 most important imported goods) as
well as sugar. In the longer run, increased food production in Mali could be exported to food deficit
countries in the Sahel.

94.     The scope to increase primary production is enormous. Despite the increases in
production realized over the past decade, agricultural productivity remains relatively low; much
arable and irrigable land remains undeveloped and there is substantial scope to substitute imported
food stuffs with locally produced food as well as to increase the exports of food and other primary
produce (livestock, cotton).

95.     A pro-poor growth strategy would need to be inclusive and adapted to Mali’s different
livelihoods. An inclusive pro-poor growth strategy will need to ensure that production is increased
in all major livelihood systems including in the (i) cotton-maize production system found in
southern Mali (a system that would need to be made more beneficial to the poor), (ii) the irrigated
system used by smallholders as well as large scale farmers in the Office du Niger, the Niger Delta
and elsewhere in the country, and (iii) production systems that evolve around the more traditional
crops like millet and sorghum. Separate strategies would have to be developed to enhance

                                                      47
productivity in (iv) agro-pastoral and pure pastoral systems of northern Mali as well as (v) in the
fisheries subsector.86 Urban areas (vi) will require their own approach.

96.     To systematically identify opportunities for poverty reduction, the SCD presents a
household based framework. The choice for a household based (micro) approach (as opposed to
e.g. a macro-framework) reflects the fact that growth and poverty reduction need to be achieved
in the short run through intra-sectoral productivity increases and the fact that most poor are self-
employed –either as farmers, fishermen and pastoralists, or in the informal off-farm sector. An
approach that puts households, their income generation efforts and their interactions with markets
and institutions as consumers and producers of goods and services, seems an appropriate way to
identifying critical binding constraints. The framework is summarized in Figure 4.1 and is detailed
below. It starts from the observation that poverty can be reduced in globally two ways: by
alleviating the (real) budget constraint of poor households through income growth or through a
redistribution of consumer goods, assets or income.

97.    One way to alleviate the (real) budget constraint (and hence to reduce poverty) is by
making consumption goods less expensive. The rapid (and welfare improving) increase in the
ownership of consumer durables like mobile phones and motor bikes between 2001 and 2010 by
poor and non-poor households alike is explained, in part, by the drop in the price of consumer
durables as a result of the increased availability of cheap goods produced in Asia.87 This makes
trade policies, and the cost of importing goods of immediate relevance to poverty reduction. The
new 2015 ECOWAS Common External Tariff, for instance, raises the tariff to 35 percent for a
number of important consumption products and is expected to augment the price of goods
consumed by the poorest by over 1 percentage point.88

98.     Lower prices for food grains on which poor households spend a large fraction of their
budget, matter for poverty reduction. Households spend a significant share of their incomes on
cereals, households in the poorest wealth quintile as much as 26.9 percent. 89 A declining price as
a result of increased cereal production is therefore an effective poverty reduction policy. 90 Such a
strategy would also be pro-poor as poor households spend more on cereals than better off
households it.

99.    Budget constraints can also be alleviated by raising household incomes. Income is
generated from wage labor or from producing goods and services which are auto-consumed or

86
   Livestock plays an important role in crop agriculture, providing manure and traction services; while livestock
products like meat and milk are essential to people’s health. There exists an intricate relation between pastoralism and
farming in which pastoralists breed and raise livestock which is subsequently fattened and used by sedentary farmers.
Such integrated approaches need to be explored more.

   The new tariff structure is also regressive in that the 10% richest are less impacted than the rest of the population
(Gourdon and Maur, 2014).

   A study by Nouve and Wodon (World Bank 2008), finds for instance that the increase in rice prices as a result of
the 2008 food price increase had a significant impact on poverty. The study which presents a CGE analysis also finds
that increases in the productivity of rice production have a much greater and even positive consequences on poverty,
whereas a reduction in tariffs for imported rice has a much small effect. Kofi Nouve and Quentin Wodon. Impact of

exchanged for money and other goods and services. Low levels of own-production can be the
result of low productivity (which in turn is affected by a plethora of factors), or could be the result
of poorly functioning markets which prevent the fruits of specialization and economies of scale
from being realized.

100. In the presence of poverty traps, safety nets can be instrumental to raising household
incomes. Safety nets can help chronically poor households build their productive asset base,
instrumental to structurally reducing poverty. By offering goods or income, they also help reduce
poverty directly as they bring the consumption of households above the poverty line.

101. The entire ‘production function’ is embedded in an institutional environment which
determines whether the household is able to appropriate the fruits of its labor and the presence and
quality of public services.

102. Sustainability is incorporated in the framework in an integrated manner. Fiscal
sustainability is subsumed in the discussion on the institutional environment (PFM in particular)91,
whereas environmental sustainability –which in Mali is largely related to land and water resources

91
  Section 3 already demonstrated that macro and fiscal management do not pose any serious risks as the authorities
are committed to prudent fiscal management. Moreover, with a debt to GDP ratio of 30 percent Mali is only at a
moderate level of debt distress. Consequently fiscal sustainability is not discussed any further.

                                                       49
as well as weather variability (climate risk), is integrated in the section on (agricultural)
productivity. Worth flagging are the environmental risks associated to mining: these risks are not
discussed in detail but are duly noted.

103. In the remainder of this chapter we discuss the five core components of the analytical
framework: (i) the institutional environment, (ii) low productivity, (iii) poorly functioning
markets, (iv) human capital and (v) redistribution.


4.2.    Institutional environment
104. A permanent resolution to the conflict in the north of the country is essential for
sustainable poverty reduction. In its absence, violence can be expected to continue, with negative
repercussions for welfare for those living in the affected areas. An unresolved conflict will limit
interventions to emergency assistance and even this might be ill-advised given the risk of the
misappropriation of funds which could prolong the conflict. Continued instability is likely to add
to existing (climatic) pressures for outmigration from the north and will have consequences for
poverty reduction in the south through the negative spillover effects on investor confidence, aid,
the ability to trade with Burkina Faso, Niger and Algeria and increased budget allocations to the
security sector.

105. Peace talks in Algiers have resulted in the signing of a preliminary peace accord
between the government and six rebel groups. This peace accord needs to be ratified following
consultation of the rebel groups with their supporters. However not all the active armed groups are
party to the negotiations, including the opportunistic armed groups which emerged motivated by
possible gains from the peace agreement. The situation is further complicated by the multiplication
of auto defense militias. But even if a peace accord is signed– which given the pressure that is
exerted on the various actors is not implausible, without credible commitments that the accord
would be implemented (requiring deep governance reforms)92 and the commitment from all armed
groups (not just the signatories) to adhere to the agreement, it may not hold in the long run. As
long as no sustainable peace is reached, the risk of the conflict spreading remains.

106. As neither side of the conflict has the means to defeat the other(s) and as a peace
accord alone does not guarantee a lasting resolution, the status quo with regular outbreaks
of violence and two authorities controlling different territories presents a likely scenario for
the future. If this scenario plays out, it may be expected that the pro-independence forces will aim
to create basic governance structures and to contain the militant groups as a means to gain
legitimacy. Whether they can do so successfully is complicated by the changing nature of the north
itself, due to a combination of presence of criminal and fundamentalist networks, a breakdown in
traditional authority, and a rising level of social and inter-communal tension.

107. A more violent scenario is also a possibility particularly when the army of Mali intends
to retake the north and major clashes break out. This may lead to the forging of a close


92
  On the rebel side there are considerable doubts about the government’s intention to implement the peace accord, as
the five past agreements concluded in the past 23 years were not implemented.

                                                        50
 collaboration between those seeking legitimacy for an independent state and the militant groups
 whose main interests are a combination of financial gain and ideological proficiency.

 108. Both scenarios have the intrinsic risk that they further undermine the legitimacy of
 the authorities in Bamako though the time frames for this may differ. An unsuccessful military
 intervention by the government could lead to the rapid deterioration of the Government’s
 legitimacy. If a status quo persists, it may give extremists groups the opportunity to recover and
 regain their strengths which might eventually be used to challenge the authorities in Bamako –as
 happened in 2012. It also poses the threat of a breeding ground for Jihad, especially because of the
 financial benefits it may bring the poor. Already insecurity tops the list of issues the government
 should address (Figure 4.2) and the status quo sends signals to groups in south Mali about the
 inability of the state to guarantee security, a situation that has already led to violent attacks in
 different locations across Mali’s territory. A continuation of the status quo in which citizens have
 limited confidence in the state, opens space for religious leaders to venture into politics, potentially
 threatening the secular nature of the state.

 109. Stability in the north and poverty reduction across Mali’s territory requires
 addressing deep rooted governance problems. Mali’s tradition of seeking consensus is an asset
 when it comes to bringing about reconciliation in and with the north and in identifying pathways
 to poverty reduction. But the system of consensus politics which has emerged since 1991 saw little
 in terms of consolidation of state institutions and evolved into a system which critics refer to as a
 “procedural democracy”.93 This system systematically buys off potential opposition: public
 officials through corruption, nepotism, misappropriation of funds; private entrepreneurs by
 offering tax exemptions, import licenses, opportunities for money laundering and public contracts
 and civil society through co-optation. This approach to political survival has been at the expense
 of the decentralization process and has led to deep routed distrust in officialdom across the nation.

It has also undermined the ability of the police and the army to provide security and of the public
service in general to deliver services.

110. A strong sense of injustice and impunity is fueling a legitimacy crisis that ultimately
limits the ability of the state to reduce poverty. The press (which is relatively free) and the
“Bureau du Vérificateur General” have brought major corruption scandals to the attention of the
public. But as very little sanctions followed, it added to a strong sense of injustice and impunity.94
This is aggravated by the fact that criminal networks have been allowed to settle and expand. It
made government less relevant as a government that fails to address impunity, to correct illegal
transaction, to fight money laundering and criminal behavior in general and which is not able to
clear itself from involvement in such actions, quickly loses the confidence of its population. If this
kind of impunity is not addressed a further deterioration of the legitimacy of the state seems
unavoidable with negative consequences for the ability to bring peace to the north and to undertake
developmental activities across the nation.

111. There is a window to restore state legitimacy but this may be closing, putting the
prospects of poverty reduction by 2030 at risk. The presidential and parliamentary elections of
2013 resolved the institutional legitimacy aspects of governance but the social contract remains
weak. After an initial surge in confidence in the presidency just after the elections in September
2013, disillusionment seems to be settling in. One year after the election, in August
2014confidence in the president had dropped 20 percentage points to 75 percent (Friedrich Ebert
Stiftung 2014). This is still high but masks that the percent of Malians with a very positive
appreciation of the president declined appreciably from 58 to 31 percent, while those without any
confidence in the president increased from 3 percent to 22 percent.

112. A professional civil service, effective and accountable decentralization, improved PFM
systems, improved business environment, stronger (social) accountability institutions and greater
transparency are critical elements for regaining state legitimacy.

Professionalism of the civil service

113. Patronage undermines the capacity of the civil service. As noted in a 2003 report95, Mali
has a political system marked by patronage, whereby public sector posts are filled with those who
produce rents for their patron, for the political party and for themselves. Senior posts are filled
through connections instead of qualifications; as new political officials are appointed existing
senior servants are sidelined often without explanation. The sale of administrative influence often
has high pay-offs, and clients exist in virtually all areas of society. Posts in the public
administration can be viewed as assets that generate licit flows of income including wages and
allowances, and illicit incomes from embezzlement of public property, sale of public influence,
and use of discretionary power to get private gains. (Illustrative of this is the fact that all graduates
of the civil service entry exam want to join the customs or tax departments). As a result, promotions

   A survey by the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung in August 2014 found that 72 percent perceives governance in Mali as
poor. Most affected are: justice (72 percent), police (68 percent), schools (61 percent), municipalities (58 percent),
health services (58 percent and customs (55 percent). Respondents were also asked what they considered good
governance. State of law (35 percent), good management of state resources (32 percent), transparent management of
resources (31 percent), provide services (30 percent) and fight against corruption (30 percent).

and vacant posts are filled with people whose credentials may be questionable. These practices
spread in the administrative hierarchies, widening the circle of complicities, and making it difficult
for those involved in the system to get out from the network. Attempts at promoting a multi-racial
Mali (through postings based on regional origins) also demonstrate the reality of a country in which
the public service’s rules and practices reflect a complex political equilibrium which often but not
always trumps technical goals, with dire effects on service provision. Because of this, and because
of the low quality of the education system, capacity issues are salient at all levels, and are even
more acute outside the urban centers: 66 percent of category A civil servants are based in Bamako,
and only 0.7 percent in Kidal96.

Decentralization:

114. Decentralization, a flagship agenda for the newly democratic Mali in 1991, has
struggled to achieve its dual objective of bottom-up development and peace and stability. The
impetus for decentralization that existed following the democratic transition in the early 1990s
dissipated after a few years, and its objectives were not met. Although Mali’s decentralization is
labelled devolution, it remains a very controlled process, with the territorial administration
exercising an ex ante control (tutelle) on most important decisions of the Communes. The dual
institutional structure in which a territorial administration co-exists with a sectoral deconcentrated
administration overseeing the decentralized entities, increases uncertainties and leads to
inconsistencies when implementing respective mandates. It also puts pressure on already limited
resources (financial and human); fiscal decentralization is very weak, and only fully effective for
the education sector. The government of Mali has decentralized significant expenditures at the
level of the regions, yet communes receive very little public resources, and are not able to collect
much (cases of incivisme), partly because the population perceive municipalities as corrupt
(although there are strong local variations). Furthermore, some of the resources that are deemed
“decentralized” are in fact earmarked for special programs. Capacity (especially outside Bamako
and the few urban centers) is very weak, and decentralized entities as well as deconcentrated
services, which in theory should support the communes, have little financial and technical means
to operate.

115. Successful decentralization will be particularly important for peace building in the
north. All past peace agreements, as well as the preliminary agreement signed on March 1st,
feature decentralization as a tool for peacebuilding and increased economic development of
northern Mali. In practice it has had very limited success, either because agreements were not
followed up or because their implementation mechanisms were contested – see table 4.2. The fact
that decentralization did not meet the development promises for the North created resentment and
has fueled cyclical rebellions, making it particularly important that this time around it is
implemented well and informed by lessons from the past.

116. Tax revenue, presently about 15 percent of GDP remains below the estimated
potential of 20 percent of GDP. Revenue collection has improved in line with WAEMU
guidelines since 2008 but remains below the WAMEU average. Fiscal administration and policies
suffer from inefficiencies, with very high levels of tax exemptions, fiscal subsidies, low yield,
fiscal evasion and “incivisme”, and a low tax base. Mining revenues, while making up a large
share of the budget, could be increased.97 Aid, which makes up more than half the capital
expenditures (2006-14) and unpredictable budget support, are a complicating factors for revenue
management.98.

117. Distortionary aspects of the tax and tariff system need consideration. Under the
WAEMU external tariff, processed food can be imported after paying an external tariff of 10
percent. Agrobusinesses transforming foodstuffs pay 18 percent value added tax. Imported food
stuffs, if sold through formal channels will pay 18 percent VAT, but in practise much of the imports
are sold in the informal market where no value added tax is collected. This puts local
transformation of agricultural produce at a disadvantage, even more so when importers are exempt
(or avoid) paying taxes.

118. Public spending is broadly aligned with the poverty reduction strategy but is very
poorly targeted. The overall pattern of spending is broadly aligned with the poverty reduction
strategy, which puts much emphasis on strengthening the agricultural sector and improving
education. The conflict has affected budget allocations and capital investments declined
significantly in 2012, but these have since recovered. Spending on the army increased in 2012.
Regional allocations have increased over time, with a stable share for each region and an increase
in the northern region’s share of overall expenditures. Targeting of spending is an important issue,
however: electricity subsidies ($100 million) and fuel subsidies ($ 60 million) largely benefit non-

poor urban dwellers; fertilizer subsidies (18 percent of the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture)
benefit the better-off farmers. All together it has been estimated that 75 percent of public resources
allocated to education benefit the 20 percent wealthiest. The 10 percent most educated appropriate
50 percent of public resources on education; children from the wealthiest quintile consume 18.5
times more public resources than those from the poorest quintile.

119. Procurement’s prevailing rules and regulations are inoperative. Procurement planning
is weak and procurement processes are excessively long. The average time limit for awarding
contracts in 2011 and 2013 was respectively 183 days and 121 days. Such delays increase the
chances of frauds and corruption. The consequences of poor procurement systems are dire:
completion rates for investment projects managed by country systems reached a low 39 percent in
2010, and 40 percent in 201199. A high share of donor’s projects also suffers from suboptimal
rates of execution (56 percent in 2010, 69 percent in 2011). A complex and heavy regulatory
system also include provisions that allow for exceptions and waivers with negative effects on
planning and transparency – for instance, “gré à gré” procurement processes or the inclusion of
“sovereignty projects” (“projets de souveraineté “) without prior feasibility study or financing
available100.

120. Internal and external control institutions lack financial and human resources, and
their independence is limited (links to presidency). The creation of the Bureau de Vérificateur
General, in 2003 duplicated to some extent existing institutions. Largely based on the Canadian
model, it differed in a fundamental way by reporting to the President instead of reporting to
Parliament. It has nevertheless brought information on mismanagement and corruption to the
attention of the public. In its 2012 annual report, the Bureau identified financial losses amounting
to FCFA 49.4 billion of which FCFA 35.2 billion (3 percent of the total budget and 71 percent of
identified losses) were related to mismanagement and fraud. Remarkably, most of the
mismanagement occurs in areas with significant and often redundant controls including public
procurement. Mismanagement thus seems to be the result of the absence of sanctions rather than
the absence of control (in fact there may be too many controls)101. The fact that the Bureau has no
power of sanction and that there is very little follow up on the implementation of audit
recommendations underscore the severe problem of impunity.

Business environment

121. Personalized (as opposed to anonymous) relations characterize the business
environment and prevent the emergence of a vibrant private sector. The bi-modal structure of
Mali’s formal business sector with few very large firms, very few medium sized firms, and many
small firms is characteristic for an environment where firms either operate under the protection of
the state, or try to stay under the radar. The huge tax exemptions accorded to some, the reliance on
(import) licenses to favour one firm over the other and the presence of a tax system that is biased

    The off budget purchase of a presidential plane and non-lethal military equipment under “national interest” or
“secret defense” procedures are just the latest illustrations of governance issues that permeate all sectors and activities:
In response to this scandal, the Government adopted the arête No 241-2037/MEF-SG adopted by the government on
July 31, 2014 that provides the list of emergency spending procedures (extra budgetary expenditures) “Dépenses
Avant Ordonnancement - DAO) and the modalities for regularization.

against medium sized enterprises (high levels of VAT; complex tax procedures) support this view.
Low rankings on the doing business indicators for paying taxes (145), trading across border (163)
and contract enforcement (128) confirm it. The bias that results goes at the expense of private
initiatives, and is one factor explaining the underdevelopment of rural value chains,which depend
on many small and medium sized firms to ‘aggregate’ produce.

122. Difficulties in accessing land for development impairs private initiative. The land
tenure system is characterized by legal pluralism, and the coexistence of different systems
(customary tenure systems are combined with European principles of ownership). The lack of
transparency in the administration of rules, profound contradictions and inconsistencies between
the laws, the splintering in the system of authority and the unregulated plurality of arbitration
bodies lead to opportunistic behaviours and elite capture. The lack of clarity on who owns what
land and which institution holds jurisdiction when reduces investor confidence. It also decreases
the overall efficiency of the economy as land is ‘lost’ to speculative purposes, remains unused or
managed sub-optimally (low investments); because of different claimants to the land, it cannot be
used as collateral.

123. Unreliable accounting information for investors, bankers and other economic agents
to base their decisions on contributes to the poor investment climate and weak financial
intermediation, and is a major constraint to access to credit. Lack of financial transparency in
the business sector, due to lack of strong regulation and relatively weak practices in accounting
and auditing affect the ability of the authorities and development partners to deliver development
results and ensure that these funds are used for their intended purpose. This also affects the ability
of the Malian tax authorities to properly assess and collect taxes.

Accountability and transparency

124. Effective and accountable decentralization, improved PFM systems and improving
the business climate are hard to achieve reforms as they are of immediate interest to the
economic and political elites but approaches to address these issues are emerging. A first
approach is to change elite incentives by strengthening accountability and transparency, building
on the realization that when poor performance is exposed, publicly or privately, it can motivate
service providers to behave better –especially in tight-knit communities at the local level. Greater
versatility and flexibility to act decisively when reform opportunities arise, or to adapt
interventions using feedback on the success of the intervention is another approach that comes
from the literature on successful reform in a personalized competitive settlement.102

125. An increased ability to deliver requires strengthening the power of citizens to demand
accountability. Since 2012, donors appear to have become more attuned to the deep-seated
governance problems in the country and are more engaged, to the point103 where presently the
government is held more accountable by powerful donors, while the domestic population’s
knowledge and capacities are too limited to hold the government accountable. This places
development partners in an influential position but it is a situation that is neither sustainable nor

desirable. Strengthening civil society is not straightforward however. Not unlike other countries
where external aid represents a significant share of revenues, formal civil society organizations in
Mali comprise a multiplicity of small organizations with limited membership and
representativeness, and poor accountability (or, in some cases, upward accountability to the
donors).104.

126. Yet there is a strong tradition of dialogue and accountability in Mali, on which one
can build. The Annual Question and Answer Assembly is an interesting example of a modern
mechanism based on this tradition – which has been replicated at the level of the municipalities.
The indigenous civil society entities, whose own institutions are crafted to incorporate tested pre-
colonial institutional arrangements, seem to offer opportunities to build authority, cultivate
autonomy, enhance accountability, and capitalize on existing capacity to reinforce governance
efficacy at the local level. At the local level, indigenous socio-political institutions but also
(cotton)-producer organizations, continue to provide multiple centers of governance at the levels
of the village, inter-village geographic areas and significant natural resource units (watersheds,
forests, fisheries, pastures). These entities, mostly informal, are controlled by their members, and
leaders are accountable on terms widely understood and supported by members; thus they enjoy
considerable legitimacy, authority and power. One key indicator of the legitimacy and authority
disparities between such institutions and formal state institutions is the facility with which they
mobilize members’ funds to implement their activities.105

127. Despite its limitations, decentralized entities have been able to mobilize the population
in the definition of local development plans, and to start a process of increased access to
services, albeit limited to the creation of social infrastructure (health, education, water).
Interestingly, local elections participation rates are structurally higher than for national elections
(43 percent in 2004 and 45 percent in 2009). Supporting stronger accountability mechanisms at
the local level, based on existing organic institutions, together with increased human and financial
capacities, might go a long way in rebuilding the social contract.

                            Box 4.1: The annual Question and Answer Assembly
The annual Question and Answer Assembly (Espace d’interpellation démocratique) was created during the transition
to democracy in 1991. Building on a strong national tradition of dialogue, it allowed individuals to bring human rights
violations before responsible government officials – including top officials such as ministers.

The day’s events were broadcast on radio and television, creating a strong interface and allowing individuals to bring
issues at the forefront of the national debate.

The event lost its appeal because of a lack of follow-up on the issues brought forward. Although government ministers
would participate, they did not necessarily answer the questions or followed up with tangible actions.

128. Accountability can be enhanced by putting citizens in a position of choice. In many
instances citizens are opting out of the public system, providing services themselves – as is the

financing, which favors development projects over advocacy. Furthermore, when CSOs support advocacy, there is
sometimes a disconnect between the fight for issues at the forefront of the national debate in the capital, compared
with issues that matter for the majority of the population.

case with community schools and Koranic schools. In such cases they end up paying for services
twice, as tax paying citizens and as consumers buying a private service. But citizens can also be
supported in exercising their choice. Voucher systems have successfully introduced in systems
varying from education to the provision of extension services, and if designed well, can provide a
catalyst for private sector investments in a sector (thus leverage public funds).


4.3      Increasing productivity on and off farm
129. As land for rain-fed farming is still relatively abundant (only 3.2 million hectares out
of a total of 12 million with cultivation potential is cultivated) 106 thus the difference between
poor and non-poor households in crop farming areas is largely driven by the ability to bring
land under cultivation. In most livelihood zones, access to land is not a limiting factor (although
good quality land may be had to find) but access to labor, to agricultural inputs and to productive
assets is. Hence a key difference between wealthier and poorer households is how much land they
are able to cultivate.

130. In addition to this general finding each farming system presents unique opportunities
and constraints. Some more affluent areas have strong potential to reduce poverty through
intensification of staple cereal production (crop yields for millet and sorghum are estimated at 0.8
tons / ha, despite the potential to obtain 3.4 and 6.6. tons, respectively107) and diversification into
high value-added commodities (fruit and vegetables, sesame, fonio etc.) that is oriented towards
processing and exporting quality products. In areas of low agricultural potential, poverty reduction
is best achieved through approaches that mitigate risk, rather than maximizing production.
Assistance transitioning out of agriculture would be important complements to agricultural
interventions in these areas.

131. In all areas, support for research and extension services is essential. A wide range of
studies on the returns to investments in agricultural research and development show that these
returns are exceptionally high. A global meta-analysis of 1,886 evaluations of the payoffs to
investments in agricultural R&D, found an average rate of return of 81 percent per year, indicative
of a widespread and persistent underinvestment.108 More recent meta-analysis puts the median
annual return of agricultural R&D investments at 9.8 percent109 and 33 percent per annum for
Africa.110 Recognizing the high social profitability of spending on agricultural R&D, members of

    Some caution is warranted before accepting the argument of relative land abundance. Much existing land may not
be exploitable due to the lack of sufficient water, or is inaccessible due to insufficient infrastructure. Demographic
changes are predicted to increase Mali’s rural population density from 18 people per km2 of arable land in 2010 to 29
people per km2 of arable land in 2050 (Jayne, Chamberlin & Headey 2014).

the African Union declared in Malabo (June 2014) their target of investing 1 percent of agricultural
GDP in public agricultural R&D. At 0.61 percent in 2011, Mali’s agricultural research intensity
ratio falls well below this 1-percent target. Four public agencies conduct agricultural R&D in Mali.
These agencies are dependent on donor funding, their staff is aging rapidly and the relation with
extension services is limited, hindering knowledge exchange with farmers. Agricultural R&D
performed by the private sector is minimal.

High potential rain-fed

132. High-productivity semi-arid agriculture in southern Mali has excellent growth
prospects. Cultivated land in this zone is generally abundant but is under-utilised. The large gap
between observed and potential crop productivity, even when recommended rates of inorganic
fertilizer are used, reflect constraints related to soil fertility and moisture111. Although land is
sufficiently abundant to permit substantial fallow periods in the crop rotation, there are signs of
fertility decline and an increasing acidity level in some soils, sometimes associated with prolonged
use of inorganic fertilizers without attention to maintaining organic matter levels. As the
application of mineral fertilizer to cereals has declined, due to deteriorating input/output price
ratios, farmers are experiencing increasing difficulty in maintaining soil fertility, while weeds such
as striga have become more difficult to control. Analysis of nutrient balances in southern Mali’s
cotton zone show that overall community-level nutrient balances are negative and that nutrient
depletion is concentrated in ‘hot spots’ where the surrounding households also have low soil
fertility and limited access to inputs (manure, carts)112.

133. Value chains for fruits (mango, papaya), vegetables (shallot / onion, potato) and other
non-traditional products such as fonio have demonstrated their potential export
competitiveness in international and regional markets. Mango has shown great potential for
both the export of fresh fruit and processed products (dried mango, mango
concentrate). Significant new revenue (25 percent of rural GDP) is derived from this sector,
positioning it as an important diversification away from cotton. This sector is already positioned
as a base for industrialization of the country. Strengthening the organization of value chains and
market access in more productive areas of the country would help to improve the supply of
affordable grains, fruits and vegetables to drier, more vulnerable areas.

134. The performance of the CMDT and the structure of the cotton sector in general is a
binding constraint to growth and poverty reduction in Mali. In contrast to the other cotton
producing countries in the region, the liberalization of the cotton sector in Mali has been
particularly protracted. Many small producers have left the system due to the crisis of debt and
declining yields and soil fertility.

135. Weak producer organizations limit farmers’ access to technical knowledge, input
markets, and output markets in the current system. Extension services typically rely on farmers
organizations to disseminate research. With regard to output markets, producer organizations

                                                            61
would help to overcome the farm size restrictions of small producers and create economies of scale
to help those farmers connect with traders and processors, avoiding income losses due to
perishability and poor market access. Access to input markets, including leasing solutions and
fertilizer distribution, is also constrained for small farmers who do not have the purchasing power
or the credit worthiness of farmer organizations. Successful seed distribution relies on farmers
associations. Despite seed sector reform, no certified seed of these crops is sold in local markets;
instead, farmers prefer to rely on themselves or each other for seed. Women are mostly excluded
from this type of informal seed exchange. Mali’s highly structured farmers’ associations could
play an even stronger role in testing and promoting demand for certified seed, including new
approaches to systematically include women.113

Low potential rainfed

136. In semi-arid farming systems, crops and livestock are of similar importance. The
main sources of food are sorghum and pearl millet, which are rarely marketed. Other crops such
as sesame and pulses are sometimes sold. Livestock are kept for subsistence (milk and milk
products), offspring, transportation (camels, donkeys), land preparation (oxen, camels), sale or
exchange, savings, bride wealth and insurance against crop failure. The population generally lives
permanently in villages, although part of their herds may continue to migrate seasonally.

137. Households vary in their food security status. Upper stratum households are food secure
even in most bad years, because they have enough livestock to trade for the grain they lack.
Households in the lower stratum are chronically food insecure - in both good and bad years -
because they cannot grow enough grain to feed themselves and they have few livestock or other
assets to exchange for grain. Coping mechanisms include: (i) growing early-maturing, drought-
resistant millet and sorghum varieties; (ii) storing grain from one year to the next; (iii) selling or
exchanging small ruminants to buy grain in the hungry season; and (iv) in years when crops fail
and where off-farm work opportunities are available, earning off-farm income to buy grain in order
to minimize distress sales of animals. The poorest, who no longer have any animals to sell, cope
by reducing meals, collecting and eating wild foods, cutting and selling firewood and working for
others in exchange for meals.

138. The main cause of poverty is successive droughts, leading to crop failure, weak
animals, and the distress sale of assets. Typical households take seven years to recapitalize after
a shock. Destitution occurs when households have eaten all their seed and lost all their breeding
animals, so that they cannot plant or start reconstituting their herds after the drought ends. Apart
from drought, typical household problems include: (i) acute dry season water shortage for people
and animals; (ii) shortage of seasonal grazing; (iii) physical isolation, lack of roads and market
access; (iv) disadvantageous terms of trade for both crops and livestock; and (v) lack of health
facilities and schools.

139. A successful poverty reduction strategy rests on stabilizing yields and reducing risk,
rather than maximizing yields. Agricultural growth potential is modest and climate risk is likely
to increase due to climatic changes. A key priority in areas without irrigation potential will be to

reduce the risk of crop failure in drought years through improved land husbandry and water
harvesting, in addition to the multiplication of the use of palatable, drought-resistant, early-
maturing millet and sorghum varieties. Another important poverty reduction strategy in this region
is support for exit out of agriculture.

140. Wide-spread adoption of sustainable land and water management practices could
form the foundation for climate resilience and food security. There is increasing recognition
that raising organic matter, moisture retention, and other forms of soil rehabilitation in addition to
greater inorganic fertilizer use are preconditions for sustainable agricultural productivity growth114.
Soil management practices such as demi-lunes (half-moon-shaped bunds) and stone contour bunds
have proven highly successful in Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Burkina Faso to mitigate water erosion
and improve soil fertility. These practices are labor intensive and could lend themselves to pairing
with some social protection schemes implemented after the harvest. Other strategies to promote
resilient agriculture include soil and water conservation, watershed planning, water harvesting,
integrated nutrient management, low tillage, secure biodiversity and agroforestry.

141. Degradation of the savannah vegetation reduces forage reserves, fuel wood supplies,
and agricultural productivity. Over the past few years, a deforestation trend has been observed
mainly due to overgrazing, wood trading, seasonal uncontrolled bushfires, and domestic energy
demand; (almost 90 percent of household rely on fuelwood and charcoal for their energy needs. 115
More than 100,000 ha of forest land is lost each year, much more than the annual reforestation rate
of 10,000 ha/year.116 The protection and management of wood species is a low-cost way for farmers
to intensify and diversify their rural production systems and increase their incomes. Farmers can
support regreening without procuring expensive inputs simply by investing their labor in the
protection and management of wood species, which produces much better results at lower costs
than tree planting.117 Acacia reforestation would promote the rehabilitation of degraded areas that
have become unfit for agriculture. Acacia’s powerful rooting system makes it is efficient for dune-
fixing as well as wind and water erosion control and its nitrogen-fixing ability improves soil
fertility, thereby restoring agricultural productivity. The cost of agroforestry strategies such as
natural regeneration of tree cover, live fencing, shelterbelts, and woodlots can vary greatly, from
US$166 a hectare to as much as US$906. Depending on the technology and local circumstances,
the benefit-cost ratio can turn positive after four years from adoption.

142. Inadequate soil fertility management limits farmers’ yields and increases their
reliance on expensive inorganic fertilizers. Combining organic and inorganic fertilizers in
strategic amounts, based on certain combinations of crops and agro-ecological zones and coupled
with soil and water-conserving mulch, can help farmers adapt to climate variability while also
contributing to soil carbon, soil health, and higher yields. Organic fertilization can come from
manure, mulch, crop residues, or nitrogen-fixing trees or legumes. Supported by extension, the
benefits of this technology can outweigh the costs in the short, medium, and long terms. It can also
reduce the financial burden of private and public expenditure on inorganic fertilizer. Fields can be

Irrigated

143. The Office du Niger area in Mali [zone 7] is the largest irrigated scheme in West
Africa, with nearly 100,000 ha currently under cultivation, and the potential for expansion of
irrigable cultivation area to cover between one and two, million hectares. The area covers the flat
dry lands in the command area of the Markala dam, situated in the interior delta of the Niger River,
approximately 250km from the capital Bamako and close to the major town of Ségou.

144. The Office du Niger area is the most important production area in Mali for both rice
(about 60 percent of national production) and sugar (100 percent of national production).
Mali is among the few West African countries which meet close to 90 percent of domestic needs
in rice through national production; the Office du Niger zone provides 87 percent of total supply
of rice commercialized outside of the region of production.120

145. High demographic growth rates and declining soil fertility have made the Office du
Niger area a particularly prized area for land ownership / occupation. As the availability of
fertile, irrigable land diminishes and demand for access to Office du Niger land increases, the
opportunities for profiteering and rent-seeking in the publicly managed land and irrigation scheme
have grown. Concerns over ‘land-grabbing’ and speculative land acquisitions by politically well-
connected elites and investors have emerged and point to the significance of the area for the
consolidation of political legitimacy or control.121

146. The incidence of poverty is lower than in other farming systems and absolute numbers
of poor are small. Crop failure is generally not a problem, but livelihoods are vulnerable to water
shortages, scheme breakdowns and deteriorating input/output price ratios. If institutional problems
in the Office du Niger can be solved, future agricultural growth potential is good. Poverty
alleviation in this region depends on individual households’ continued access to sufficient irrigated
land, in the face of demographic pressure and the emergence of large-scale farms122.

147. Other irrigated areas outside Office du Niger also contribute significantly to poverty
reduction. Despite the low rainfall, these areas have and can continue to benefit from the irrigated
rice and vegetables along the River Niger (Mopti, Timbuktu, Gao) and along the Senegal River
(Kayes). Village-level irrigation schemes along the rivers contribute significantly to self-
sufficiency and poverty reduction.

148. The Office du Niger would benefit from additional private investment funds for the
development of irrigation, modernization, and diversified cash crop production. These
private investments could ensure self-sufficiency in rice countries, create export surpluses in the

sub region and promote high potential diversification crops like shallot / onion, potato and other
tropical crops such as flowers. The development of this area could lead to increases in the demand
for casual labor, strong growth of agricultural GDP and national food security. To realize these
opportunities, some pressing governance issues would have to be addressed.

149. There are four major, interrelated governance challenges in the management of the
Office du Niger. The first governance challenge, which is the most widely covered by analytical
work and academic research on the Office du Niger, is the potential for land allocations to become
heavily politicized and fragmented – as was the case between 2005 and 2009. Second, weak
managerial and technical capacity of the Office du Niger has undermined earlier restructuring and
capacity building reform efforts. Third, the lack of effective accountability mechanisms has
exacerbated the risks associated with politicized investments in the Office du Niger zone and
masked weak governance practices within the Office du Niger. Finally, the absence of a
consolidated vision for the Office du Niger zone, has until recently, limited reform momentum.

150. As in high potential rainfed areas, there is scope to increase the profitability of
agricultural production. Gaps include diversification into higher-value crops, market linkages
for inputs and outputs, improvement of product grading and packaging, support for small-scale
agro-processing of perishable products, and identification of niche markets - for instance those for
organic produce. The promotion of farmer-based seed multiplication should also be accorded high
priority in connection with both intensification and diversification efforts. Further priority areas
include: promotion of self-sustaining, rural micro-finance systems to cater for farmers' demand for
short-term credit for seasonal inputs, hired labor, small-scale processing and produce trading;
improving water use and productivity on existing schemes by building the capacity of water user
groups for greater participation in scheme operation, maintenance and rehabilitation; strengthening
the capacity of farmer associations to buy agricultural advice and market information; and,
supporting farmers' field schools in connection with the integrated management of pest control in
vegetables.

151. Farmer-managed schemes and traditional irrigation outside the Office du Niger could
contribute to livelihood security, poverty reduction, and sustainability. Risk of drought-
induced crop failure would be reduced by promoting, where feasible and environmentally
compatible, extension of the irrigated or water harvesting area through low-cost techniques - such
as flood recession and run of river - that build on indigenous technical knowledge. Low-cost and
small-scale on-farm water harvesting may serve as both an intermediate technology in the absence
of larger-scale irrigation and to increase the efficiency of water use on irrigated farmland. For
example, planting pits surrounded by demi-lunes act as tiny catchments to direct and hold water in
the soil. Some farmers have added termites to these planting pits to increase soil fertility. Where
markets exist, the reduction of risk often encourages higher input use and intensification.

152. The impact of small-scale irrigation investments on household consumption, assets,
and informal insurance has been found to be substantial. Dillon uses a panel of Northern
Malian households (1998–2006) to estimate its impact.123 Access to irrigation increases household
consumption by 27–30 percent relative to water-recession and rain-fed cultivators. Dillon also

investigated whether irrigation has secondary impacts on risk-mitigating strategies by reducing
covariate risk and reinforcing informal food sharing networks that allow households to insure
against idiosyncratic risk. He found that households with irrigation save between 4.5 and 6.4 more
tropical livestock units and are 20 percent more likely to engage in informal food sharing with
non-irrigators. In a separate paper, Dillon compares the impact of large and small scale irrigation.
He concluded that small-scale irrigation has a larger effect on agricultural production and
agricultural income than large-scale irrigation.

153. The water needs of downstream users in the inner delta would be constrained by any
large-scale expansion of irrigation infrastructure.124 While irrigation takes a fixed amount of
water throughout the year, hydro-electric structures store water at peak flood levels and
subsequently release it. The hydrological effects of both are felt most profoundly during the dry
season and in years with low floods125. The Sélingué dam is the only hydropower reservoir in the
Upper Niger at the moment but the Fomi dam’s is planned to be 2.9 times larger than Sélingué,
and it is expected that the impact on the flow during the wet and dry period will be similar to that
of Sélingué, yet with a magnitude 2.9 times larger126, with profound consequences on agriculture,
navigation, fisheries, and biodiversity.

154. The Office du Niger uses 2.7 km3 of water per annum, or 8.3 percent of total annual
river flow, in order to irrigate more than 700km2 of the “Delta mort”. The impact of this water
intake on the hydrological regime of the Inner Niger Delta varies from year to year. Because the
water intake remains practically constant, annual water use by the Office du Niger irrigation zone
declines to 4 percent of total flow in years with high flow, but increases to 15 percent of total flow
in years with low flow. The intake ratio also varies seasonally. The Office du Niger takes around
100 m3/s of water from August to November and around 60 m3/s from December to April. That is
equivalent to only a small fraction in the flood period, but up to 50-60 percent of water in the dry
period. It is also estimated that the Office du Niger irrigation area increased from 40,000 ha in the
1980s to 84,140 ha in 2009, while the Plan d’Action du Schéma Directeur de la Zone Office du
Niger plans a 130 percent expansion in the 2009-2020 period, to 193,394 ha. Since it is
increasingly difficult to use the river water during the dry season (March-May) and the required
maximum water intake by 2020 during the rainy season is estimated to be 280m3/s (compared to
146m3/s today), the irrigation practices of the Office du Niger are bound to be largely dependent
on more efficient irrigation methods, water released from the Sélingué reservoir in the dry
season127, as well as a rehabilitation and re-dimensioning of the Sahel and the main adductor
canals128. The number of people potentially impacted – 1.5 million people are living in the Inner
Delta region – and the environmental risks posed by climate change and human activities make
the protection of the Niger River one of Mali’s most pressing socio-economic and environmental
challenges.

155. Outside the Office du Niger, where there are fewer governance constraints, broad
scope exists to sustainably increase agricultural productivity in irrigated areas. Other Rice
Offices and rice zones have to date received limited external support (Gao, Mopti, and Timbuktu).
Vulnerable small scale producers have piloted improved water management systems (initiated by
other agencies such as GIZ), but these have not been adopted at scale. Complementary
interventions such as access to improved seeds, extension, input markets, farmers associations,
and market access are also lacking.

Pastoral

156. Of the total population dependent on agriculture, a large share – on the order of 80
percent – is estimated to depend at least in part on livestock (including pastoralists and agro-
pastoralists). Arid and semi-arid zones in the North (Mopti, Timbuktu, Gao, Kidal) [zone 1, 2]
are classified as pastoral systems. During the driest period of the year, Sahelian pastoralists move
south to the higher rainfall zones and they return north during the rainy season. The meat value
chain [zones 3, 4, 6], is positioned as a major source of growth in the country in the regions of
Mopti, Gao and Kayes. Low productivity (extensive farming, low productivity of dairy, low milk
processing etc.) reduces the potential of this sector.

157. The main source of vulnerability is climatic variability and the high incidence of
drought. Socio-economic differentiation is considerable - many herders have lost most of their
animals due to droughts or stock theft. Recent modeling work undertaken in the context of the
World Bank regional report on drylands suggests that growth in human population and in herd size
is likely to result in the next couple of decades (even without climate change) in a 160 percent
increase in the share of animals that will be unable to meet their feeding needs with local grazing
resources. In the presence of more frequent droughts that climate change may bring about, the
increase may be of 190 percent, and up to 260 percent under a severe drought scenario,
exacerbating the pressure on the country’s fragile natural resources base and the likelihood of
associated social conflicts. The situation in the semi-arid zones is much less acute, stressing the
need for mobility.

158. Poverty reduction in this system rests on securing existing natural rangeland and
animal capital, particularly for women. In conflict-affected regions, smaller ruminants may be
a more resilient investment than cattle because they are difficult to steal and can be kept closer to
homes. In Mopti, the “Projet de compétitivité et de diversification agricoles” is piloting
improvement of breeds and production of milk and milk processing. This experience could be
intensified and extended to the whole country through the introduction of breed sires and
insemination. With respect to rangelands, secured land tenure systems that recognize mobility for
resources management are needed to resolve conflicts and protect access to rangelands and water
points, particularly in the context of climate change. Complementarities between extensive
pastoral systems and semi-intensified agricultural farming systems are under-exploited.

159. Pastoral systems face a long list of constraints to unlock economic potential of animal
value chains. These include: infrastructure, regional integration, market access development,
access to basic social and financial services, and an enabling business environment (strengthened
institutions, policies, regulations, and investments) for trans-boundary mobility (people, animal,
goods, and services), disease control, and livestock trade facilitation. A major lesson learnt is to

                                                 67
include herders, particularly pastoral communities, in inclusive decision making processes through
decentralization. Interventions are most effective within a value chain approach including product
distribution to end markets, where public funding should encourage private sector participation.

160. In summary the main proposal is to (i) improve the ability of poor farmers in all zones
to bring more land under cultivation; (ii) to develop the value chains for cereal crops and
livestock products across the nation; to (iii) focus in areas of high growth potential on
increasing productivity; and (iv) focus in areas of low agricultural potential on resilience.


                                 Box 4.2: Benefits of Fertilizer Subsidies
 Fertilizer subsidies have helped to close the yield gap in some settings, such as Senegal, that are
 comparable to Mali. However, reviews of the crop response to increased fertilizer use across all the
 African programs was generally disappointing, leading most programs to result in a benefit/cost ratio
 below one (Jayne and Rashid 2013). That is, the programs cost more than the value of the incremental
 production. Very different responses were found in irrigated areas than in rain-fed areas, yet the latter
 predominates in Mali. A conclusion of many studies has been that poor and declining soil quality has
 substantially reduced the efficiency by which fertilizer nutrients are utilized by food crops. Thus, rather
 than facing all kinds of input and credit market ‘failures’, many African farmers have found it not
 profitable to use significant amounts of fertilizer on soils which have been depleted from continuous use.

 These latter findings may be instructive for Mali and also provide at least a partial explanation for the
 limited production response from the recent growth in its fertilizer subsidies. Rising land pressures, more
 continuous cultivation, and soil degradation may be a strong contributing factor. As an alternative to ever
 more fertilizer subsidies, more efforts could be made to better educate and advise farmers about
 agronomic practices to rebuild soil organic matter and to practice inter-cropping or crop rotations to help
 fix nitrogen and otherwise help restore the responsiveness of soil to fertilizer applications. In lieu of
 fertilizer subsidies, a comprehensive soil fertility management program could be implemented involving
 soil testing services, more specific fertilizer blends appropriate for farmers’ specific conditions,
 investment in drainage, and restoring soil organic matter through various conservation farming practices
 (e.g. minimum tillage; use of green manures). Tying this to better water management (including
 irrigation) would have an even bigger impact.

 Distribution innovations - such as e-vouchers or new operational approaches– could help to increase the
 economic efficiency of fertilizer subsidies, but the weight of the evidence indicates that the costs of
 fertilizer subsidy programs generally outweigh their benefits. Findings from other developing areas with
 a higher proportion of crop area under irrigation and with lower fertilizer prices—factors that should
 provide higher returns to fertilizer subsidies than in Africa—indicate that at least a partial reallocation of
 expenditures from fertilizer subsidies to R&D and infrastructure would provide higher returns to
 agricultural growth and poverty reduction.

4.4     Functioning markets

161. To realize increases in production, to allow for specialization and to benefit from the
opportunities offered by domestic and regional markets, the efficiency with which markets
function has to be improved. When transaction costs are high and markets can only be accessed
with difficulty the profitability of farm production goes down as the price received for crops sold
is lower while the cost of inputs used is higher. Moreover, the price of consumer goods that can
be bought with a farm’s profits is higher. As transaction costs rise, the returns to labor (in terms of

                                                      68
consumer goods) thus reduce rapidly, and with it the motivation of households to increase
production. The fact that the better off farmers tend to rely on self-sufficiency in terms of food
consumption, is an indication of poorly functioning markets which do not offer efficient
opportunities for marketing agricultural produce at a profit nor the possibility to specialize
production and diversify consumption patterns.

162. Other indications of the weakness of markets in Mali are the small size of the formal
private sector and the fact that much agricultural trade is carried out by one-person
businesses dealing in several commodities. There are less than 500 manufacturing companies
registered in the country and the informal sector represents about 80 percent of the country’s
economic activity. The business environment is such that small and medium sized enterprises are
scarce and in rural areas agricultural produce is typically bought by (informal) traders who are
mainly self-funded as they have limited access to credit. These traders maximize the returns on
their working capital by rapidly turning over small quantities, with little storage. Their quality
grades are rarely standardized, nor are the weights and measures they use, making personal
inspection by buyers essential. As a consequence, traders travel extensively, increasing transaction
costs. Transaction costs are further increased by the large number of layers of intermediaries
between producer and consumer.

163. Differences in seasonal patterns and in the gap between consumer and producer
prices suggest that markets in some regions function better than others. Figure 4.4 shows the
gap between consumer and producer prices for Sikasso, Koulikoro, Ségou and Kayes. Not only is
the gap lower in Sikasso, so are seasonal variations. Particularly during the rainy season, when
many areas become inaccessible, differences between consumer and producer prices are
pronounced. If the gap between producer and consumer prices is taken as an indication of the
                                                      69
functioning of markets, then markets operate best in Sikasso and worst in Kayes and Koulikoro.
Ségou takes an intermediate position. This is of limited surprise as Sikasso and Ségou are areas
with the highest agro-ecological potential, with relatively high population and market density and
with the greatest road density (see Figure E.2 at the end of the executive summary).

164. High transaction costs and poor market access are brought about by a host of factors.
Defective physical infrastructure is an important reason as it renders many rural roads unusable
particularly during the rainy season. Unlike the main roads and regional roads which tend to be
well maintained, rural roads are in a poor state. 47 percent is in a poor state and only 5 percent in
good condition.129 Other sources of (transaction) costs are the insecurity that continues to prevail
in the north with negative repercussion for trade with Algeria, Niger and Burkina Faso, the lack of
competition in the transport market and the poor governance prevailing on the regional corridors.
CILSS (2014) roadblocks survey show that the Malian portion of corridors is the one encountering
the highest proportion of road blocks: 11 road blocks on the corridor between Mali (Kati Dralé)
and Guinea (Conakry) and 9 road blocks per 100 km on the road between Burkina (Bama) and
Mali (Kouri). The costs associated with these road blocks are significant, especially compared to
neighboring countries, reaching a maximum of 470 USD per 100km on the Malian portion of the
Burkina-Mali corridor for the transport of rice.

165. Efficient markets require institutions, services and support infrastructure that
establish grades and standards or provide storage which the objective to improve the
quantity and quality of goods. The availability of these services and infrastructure is limited. The
provision of storage for instance is hampered by the absence of a marketable surplus (due to the
seasonality and the small scale of production), the absence of quality standards and a tax system
which makes it hard for formal small and medium enterprises to compete with informal ones
(which do not pay VAT for instance). As a consequence, few storage services are offered. Even in
Sikasso, the most developed agricultural region of the country, only 30 percent of communities
have a storage facility. Efficient markets will only exist if these institutions, services and
infrastructure are agreed upon through an inclusive public private dialogue (PPD) process which
has to include disadvantaged communities for economic, environmental and social reasons.


129
          To improve market access adequate resources need to be allocated to rural road maintenance and to upgrading
rural roads to an all-weather status. The policy measures needed to improve rural access are aptly summarized in the
2008 “Strategie Nationale du Transport Rural au Mali”. This strategy recognizes that improved rural access can be
brought about in a decentralized and participatory manner, using labor intensive technologies. It requires that adequate
resources are set aside and transferred to the decentralized local government entities that are responsible for rural road
maintenance –something which is presently not the case. If done and this may require an increase in the fuel levy
and tolls which even in the best of circumstances only cover 50 percent of the road maintenance needs, it would make
rural access an excellent candidate for public works initiatives. Of essence is that roads are maintained regularly and
systematically, that spot improvements of bottlenecks in the road network take place and that this is accompanied by
critical accompanying measures to ensure road quality such as the closure of dirt roads after heavy rains or the
prevention of overloading. A rural access policy will need to be complemented with a selective extension of the main
infrastructure network but a master plan which identifies infrastructural priorities based on the impact on poverty, is
not available. Main bottlenecks appear to be the highway to Gao and the border with Burkina Faso (important for
exports but also for security purposes), the navigability of the Niger River and the rehabilitation of the railroad to
Senegal –representing as large share of all imports and offering an alternative to road transport.

166. Efficient markets also require the availability of market information keeping farmers
and traders attuned to the demands and changing preferences of consumers. Market
information encompasses timely and accurate prices, buyer contacts, distribution channels, buyer
and producer trends, import regulations, competitor profiles, grade and standards specifications,
postharvest handling advice and storage and transport recommendations. In Mali price information
on cereals generally moves from the northern (production deficit) areas of the country to the
southern (production surplus) areas. Price information is transmitted to a significant degree130 but
if far from complete.131

167. The efficiency of markets is reduced by limited competition. Even though the
government is no longer involved in the day-to-day moving and selling of staple foods (the
liberalization of Mali’s cereal markets was completed in the late 1980s) and direct government
participation in staple food markets is limited to monitoring crises132, efficient markets require
more competition between agents to ensure efficiency. In the transport sector, for instance, profit
margins are large, reflecting a lack of competition in the attribution of road freight.133 Imports of
fertilizers, rice and wheat, are either linked to government programs or are highly concentrated.
According to Staatz (2011), Toguna and Yara import 97 percent of fertilizer needs134; 85 percent
of imports of rice according to World Food Program (WFP) (2010) are done by three operators.

131
     Public market information systems have often been disappointing, with information disseminated too slowly, in
the wrong form, or too infrequently to be of real use to market participants. Mali is no exception and the information
available from, for instance, the Observatoire du Marché Agricole is very limited. On the other hand, Local FM radio
broadcasts of market information and private (or NGO sponsored) market information systems are slowly taking root
such as the “Sènèkèla” a mobile phone platform which operates in Sikasso and Koulikoro and which has as many as
154,000 subscribers.
132
    The authorities still interfere in the cereals market for reasons of food security and during the 2008 food price crisis
have, for instance, forbidden cereal exports in an effort to try to protect urban consumers. Such policies are ill-advised
as they undermine the incentives of farmers to increase production. To shield urban consumers from large increases
in cereal prices, social protection mechanism would be preferable.
133
    Terivaninthorn and Raballand (2009) calculate for instance that profit margins on the Tema-Bamako corridor are
80 percent.
134
     Even though the fertilizer subsidy program had appositive impact on raising production, the program also raises a
number of questions. The first is the sustainability of current levels of production in Mali, in the absence of subsidized
price. Secondly, whether subsidies have enabled or not private sector participation in the distribution of agricultural
inputs is unclear (Staatz, 2011). And finally, the program seems to be ill targeted with relatively well-off farmers
benefiting most from the fertilizer subsidies.



                                                              71
168. To improve the functioning of markets, improved access to infrastructure would have
to be combined with a plethora of measures varying from improved storage, to improved
access to information and finance to improvements in governance leading to enhanced
competition and fewer market distortions. Improving infrastructure hard and software
(competition in the transport sector, roadblocks) alone is unlikely to lead to rapid poverty reduction
(as the right panel of Figure 4.5 illustrates) and would have to be combined with other measures.
However, solving each constraint one by one is unlikely to lead to better integration of the poorest
into markets as other constraints would remain. This necessitates an approach that allows
addressing multiple constraints at the same time.

         Figure 4.5: Presence of market facilitation institutions in communes (n=11,731)
 Many communities lack basic market institutions.   Roads and market institutions may have to be

169. At the local level stronger farmer organizations can be instrumental in reducing
transaction costs and improving market access. It seems unlikely that individual farmers, even
with some degree of assistance, could reach the scale needed to procure services (such as transport,
storage, finance, etc.) that would help them to connect to markets. But cooperatives and farmer
organizations, once their capacity and governance structures are built, can play the role to
aggregate and thus gain the necessary scale that enables the efficient supply of critical products
(fertilizers, seeds, etc.) and services (financial, skills, etc.). It follows that interventions which
structure and organize (poor) farmers in such a way that they can participate in the agricultural
value chains (or parts of the value chain) are necessary to overcome these constraints. This is
hardly a new idea: the cotton sector has for years been organized along these lines with farmer
associations being the interlocutor with the CMDT and responsible for identifying village demand
for fertilizer and for assuring the collection and sale of cotton.

                Box 4.3: Access to markets and access to equipment help reduce poverty
 In their paper: “Determinants of income diversification amongst rural households in Southern Mali”
 Abudulai and CroleRees examined the income portfolios of farm households in Southern Mali. They use
 data from a farm household survey in Sikasso and Koutiala covering three farming years of 1993/94–
 1995/96. The authors focus on four main activities: food-crop production, cash-crop production;
 livestock rearing and non-farm work. Their findings suggest that households hold very different
 portfolios of incomes and these in turn are related to the different levels of income and asset holdings.
 Poorer households are found to have fewer opportunities in cash-crop production as well as non-crop
 activities, resulting in less diversified incomes. Lack of capital is found to be a major reason why poorer
 households have less diversified portfolios.

 The authors also examine the determinants of participation in various activities. They find that household
 wealth has a large positive impact on participation in livestock-rearing and non-farm activities. Moreover
 households who live closer to local markets are more likely to participate in non-food production
 activities than those in remote areas, lending support to the notion that households with superior access
 to markets are in a better position to overcome factor market constraints and develop private marketing
 initiatives to promote the shift of producer resources into diversification activities.

170. At the national level, large producers may have to be supported, particularly when
they help establish new value chains or structure existing ones. Anchor investors can catalyze
the development along the value chain from farm to market. They can help create a spatial
ecosystem in which large and small producers co-exist, and that is conducive to agro-industrial
activities, transformation and agglomeration. Indeed, large scale actors can guarantee a minimum
demand for products which would otherwise not be developed (improved seeds, fertilizers,
logistical support, cold storage, irrigation)., They can also invest in new transformation initiatives
(chips factories, industrial bread) or can access new export markets. Anchor investors are not only
the ones with the financial cloud to bring this about; they may also have the political access needed
to overcome pressing business environment constraints (such as access to land or electricity). The
latter is also a key risk to supporting large scale actors. They have the ability and interest to limit
the arrival of competitors and could act as a break on market development.

171. Small and medium scale enterprises are critical to ensuring that smallholder farmers
participate in value chains. Once value chains have been developed, poor households might be
able to benefit from them, as wage laborers or, provided the value chains have been set up in an
‘open’ manner, by selling their produce to it. This requires small and medium sized enterprises
that aggregate small quantities and provide quality assurance. These functions are typically
provided by storage services, but at present such services are largely absent (e.g. there exists only
135,000 tons of cereal storage capacity versus 5 million tons of cereal production). Even for value
chains for which large producers already exist, local farmers benefit little. The production of
chicken feed is a case in point. Even though all its ingredients are locally grown (maize, soya,
groundnuts), supplies are sourced internationally because the national market cannot offer the
desired quality and quantity.135 In the presence of a more vibrant local market with ample small
and medium scale firms, this would not happen, but they are not there.

4.5       Human capital: health, nutrition and education

172. Mali’s efforts to reduce poverty depend on its ability to increase its human capital. In
an agrarian economy like Mali where initial growth in productivity will need to come from its
agricultural sector, investments in health and education are extremely important. The effects of
education and health on economic growth are well documented.136 Healthier workers are more
productive, live longer, learn more, are more creative, and can cope better.137 This is especially
true in subsistence agriculture since households usually have a hard time replacing labor lost to
sickness.138 Caloric intake is shown to increase agricultural productivity in Sierra Leone139, and
wages in rural India140 , Sri Lanka141 and Philippines142. Similarly, increases in height—signaling
lower exposure to nutritional deficits in youth—have positive impacts on wages in Ghana; similar
results hold for the relationship between body-mass index and wages in Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire,
especially for women in Cote d’Ivoire.143

173. High fertility rates are closely correlated with poverty. As fertility rates go down, the
composition of the family changes with more working-age adults relative to the number of
children. With fewer dependents to feed and take care of, people invest more in the education of
each child and more adults can move into paid jobs. Positive effects on human capital are
reinforced by decreased pressure on social sectors which are otherwise put under great strain by
the high population growth. Countries with high age-dependency ratios, like Mali, are generally
much poorer and decline in age-dependency ratios typically begin in the richer households leading
to a widening in income inequality. In Mali, richer women have fewer than five children whereas
women from extreme poverty have 7.6 children during their fertile years. Fertility is also higher
among uneducated women than among other women: seven children, against 6.3 children among
women with elementary-level education and 3.8 children among women with secondary-level or
higher education.

174. Use of family planning services and greater emphasis on women’s education can
reduce maternal and child deaths, ease dependency-ratios and improve family wellbeing,
and reduce the costs of education and health. One in three married women ages 15–49 want to
136 See for instance Barro & Lee 2010; Krueger & Lindahl 2000; Gyimah-Bremponga & Wilson 2004; Becker et al.
1994. The direct relation between education and agricultural productivity is more tenuous among the poorest countries
(Reimers & Klasen 2013), but there are reasons to believe that education will have a positive impact in agricultural
growth. Education through extension services is important for improve farming techniques, but also generally better
education would matter for managing the business of running a modern farm.
137
    The research on the impact of health on economic growth is relatively more recent and somewhat more complicated
than research on returns to education since one could measure health in many different ways such as height, calories
taken, and productive days. Schultz and Savedoff & Schultz point out two other problems: first, because most
measures of health involve self-reporting, measurement errors could be substantial. Second, it is not easy to
distinguish between inherited, environmental, and behavioral factors that affect health outcomes.
Difficulties arise because the two sources of variation are not only determined by different factors, they may also exert
different effects on labor productivity.

space or limit births but are not currently using any method of family planning,144 yet family
planning consultations are rare (around 5 to 6 percent between 2006 and 2011) and use of
contraception is around 8 percent, which is less than half the rates in neighboring countries. The
main reasons for not using contraceptives suggest demand-side issues, including opposition by the
respondent (22 percent) and the respondent wanting more children (18 percent)145. In contrast, cost,
lack of access, and not knowing a source from which to purchase contraception seem to be less
relevant. 146 However, other sources147 suggest that adequate family planning supplies and personnel
to distribute contraceptives, in particular in rural areas, is missing. This suggests that women’s
education (including education about family planning, also including men), combined with better
organization and wider availability of family planning services, are important tools for poverty
reduction.

175. Education has a key role to play for poverty reduction. Returns to education are lower
in Mali compared to countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, a reminder of the low quality of
education, but they remain nonetheless significant, also in the agriculture sector. International
and national estimates suggest that each additional year of education in Mali increases earnings by
about 6 to 7 percent compared to 8 percent in the neighboring Ghana, and 9 percent in Burkina
Faso. Estimated returns to completing various levels of education confirm however the significant
positive relationship between education and earnings, even though the evidence is less clear in
agriculture. Because the average years of schooling among Malian workforce are under 3 years,
for upper education levels, the sample sizes are small. Still data show that completing primary
school education creates a significant boost in earnings (compared to those with no education).
Secondary education, as well as technical and vocational training and post-secondary, also have
significant impact on wages, but the graduates are extremely small in number (Appendix to chapter
4, Table 1). Separate estimations within the agricultural sector show that incomplete primary
education does not have an impact on earnings in contrast to what is found for other sectors, but
completing primary school is a consistently significant predictor of higher earnings in the
agricultural sector (by about 40 percent). Technical and vocational training and post-secondary
education tend to have positive and significant returns. This is an important finding since it
suggests that improving the education of wage workers (with possibly a combination of basic and
technical skills) in the agricultural sector could improve productivity and earnings within this
sector.

176. Traditional returns estimates give only a partial picture of the role of education in
reducing poverty. This is because a large percentage of the Malians work in unpaid jobs in
agriculture. Rates of return calculated in terms of consumption for urban and rural areas confirm
the positive and significant impact of all education levels on consumption growth (showing an
increasing effect by education level including TVET education). (Appendix to chapter 4, Table 2).
The effect is overall positive and significant for completed primary education but less consistent
indicating that other constraining factors may be at play. Finally, and importantly, there is a strong,

    2006 DHS. The continuing demand for large family sizes may partly be ascribed to culture, but it may also be a
rational decision given the lack of mechanization in Mali’s agriculture sector and the consequent dependence of
farming on family labor.

although somewhat varying, positive effect of literacy on consumption (with being literate
associated on average with between 20 and 40 percent increase in consumption in rural areas).

177. There is also a strong interplay between education and health. Education affects health
in adulthood; life expectancy affects educational investment in childhood; and the health and
education of parents—particularly mothers—affect both outcomes in their children. Youth
programs that combine training and education appear to lead to better health outcomes and less
risky activities. Children of educated parents are also more likely to receive proper healthcare
according to Mali’s data: only about 1 percent of women with no education make use of pre-natal
care versus almost 30 percent for women with at least secondary education.

178. Better health is another key component of a poverty reduction strategy. There is
significant international evidence on the costs associated with poor health which also apply
to Mali. Sicknesses have high costs for the poor and particularly affect family farmers. Malaria
transmission generally coincides with the planting and harvesting seasons making the illness’s
impact particularly damaging. Estimates of days lost to malaria vary across Africa and across
studies but are generally high—up to a month per year148, and in one case 64 days149. Days lost to
other diseases like TB and HIV-AIDS can be even higher. These estimates are very relevant to
Mali where malaria is the disease with the highest incidence (reported by about 13 percent of
individuals150).

179. Data from Mali underscore the weaknesses associated with tracking health outcomes
especially among the poor, but disparities in the use of health care underpin some of the key
linkages between poverty and health. While under-reporting constrains the interpretation of
sickness data, the positive relation between use of health care services and non-self-reported
measures of sickness, also illustrated by the fact that as the usage of many health care services
decreased with the crisis the reported sickness rates increased, indicates that lower access to health
care for the poor and rural populations is a key constraint to poverty reduction. There is also
additional evidence that recent consultations to health care facilities are associated with higher
household consumption levels in Mali (by about 20 percent), also pointing to the beneficial effect
of preventive health care on productivity. Overall, universal health care is a powerful poverty
reducer in Mali as elsewhere.

180. Poor health and malnutrition also impair the households’ ability to invest in/benefit
from education and work capacity later. Both child and parent health problems affect
education. Sick or hungry children miss school or cannot learn151, and early interventions such as
better nutrition earlier in life lead to greater work capacity, especially for boys, and is shown to be
linked to better education outcomes. Iron supplementation and deworming drugs have been shown
to increase weight and reduce absenteeism, especially among children who were most anemic. The
effects also hold through generations, with studies showing that improvements in nutrition and
health associated with birth cohort height account for a significant share of the wage growth

150
    And this rate is very likely to be under-estimated because of under-reporting, in particular of the poor.
151
    In Tanzania a recent World Bank study estimated the productivity losses due to anemia to be $167 billion per year
or 0.86% of GDP.

associated with schooling. Overall, children receiving better post-natal care are shown to be
healthier and more productive adults later.

181. Mali’s education and health outcomes are extremely poor, however, and gains in
health and education are quickly erased in the face of shocks. Largely this dire situation reflects
constraints in both access to education and health care services and quality and efficiency of
services, which in turn reflect other more specific constraints. Inequities in access to services
between poor and non-poor, urban-rural households and males-females, and quality and
inefficiencies issues, were already documented above. Rural households engaged in subsistence
agriculture have limited access to basic services in health and education. The coverage of health
activities is also systematically lower for the poorest; they are less likely to be immunized, they
use fewer antenatal and delivery services, and their children are less likely to use services when
ill. Socioeconomic and locational differences have also been shown to be large in attendance and
completion of schooling, and widening since the 2012 crisis. Additionally, learning outcomes
measured by scores in standardized tests are very low, and poorer children appear to fall further
behind as they get older. Moreover, regression analysis shows that while urban and richer
households appear to weather learning difficulties by continuing to send their children to school,
poor and rural households appear to take their children out. The quality of health care for the poor
is also an issue.

182. Going one step further in understanding the quality constraints, low performance
and poorly trained teachers stand out as a key explaining factor of the low levels of education
quality. School performance is low as illustrated by the loss of instructional time due to teacher
absenteeism. Schools are open only 70 percent of the official time (122 days of learning during
the 2009-2010 academic year out of the 172 official days), sometimes because teacher
appointments were delayed and sometimes because teacher supervision is weak and teachers do
not show up for work.152. The total number of teachers is also low as evidenced by the student –
teacher ratio for the country in 2010/11: 60 to 1 (45 to 1 is generally considered an upper bound
of what is acceptable), constraining both quality and supply. This average hides significant
variation, and the student – teacher ratio varies from as low as 35 to 1 in Kidal to as much as 73 to
1 in Bamako. Increasing the number of teachers –or for that matter increasing the number of
classrooms as also the number of students per classroom is very high, seems to be a matter of
policy priority but only if teachers themselves are qualified. This is an issue. In 2011, only 4
percent of teachers at the primary level and 6 percent at the lower secondary were graduates of
some teacher-training program (Table 4.5). Primary school teachers are considered qualified to
teach after completing the equivalent of vocational courses, but even with low requirements, the
percent of teachers that is considered trained is low, below 50 percent. Teacher trainees do not
benefit from a formal mentoring program, and thus may not be getting the most benefits from the
required in-class training. The lack of mentoring continues into actual tenure, and new teachers
have limited or no access to master teachers who could guide them. Similarly, teachers are not
required to participate in professional development activities and there is no targeted professional
development. Mali’s teacher policies do not match teacher skills and student needs. Additionally,
little incentives exist for qualified teachers to take hardship positions or teach in hard-to-staff areas
or show up in the classroom.

                               Box 4.4: Do adult literacy programs work?

 With very low levels of adult literacy and numeracy, it may be worth considering adult literacy
 programs. What is the evidence?

 Three World Bank studies considered the rate of return on investment in adult education. From 1977
 through to 1999, the government of Indonesia borrowed money on interest-bearing terms from the World
 Bank to support its national literacy program. In 1986, the World Bank examined the rate of return
 (ROR) on the investment; it found that the individual rate of return was 26 percent. Thirteen years later,
 the World Bank did a similar study for the Ghana National Functional Literacy Program, for which the
 government had borrowed money on interest-free terms. The findings were: Ghana (1999) female
 private ROR 43 percent; female social ROR 18 percent male private ROR 24 percent; male social ROR
 14 percent Two years later, in 2001, in a project it was supporting in cooperation with the Asia
 Development Bank in Bangladesh, again on interest-free terms, the World Bank found that the private
 rate of return was 37 percent. These calculations suggest that investment in adult education with literacy
 is in overall terms as productive as investing in primary, secondary or university education. Investments
 in adult literacy and numeracy has been associated with the adoption of new agricultural techniques, a
 sustained increase in savings and investments and improvements in nutritional status and school
 enrollment.

 Evidence from at least three “total literacy campaigns” in India shows that only a small minority of
 adult learners are unable to learn the skills of reading, writing and written calculation. The three
 campaigns recruited virtually all the non-literate adults of their areas and succeeded in teaching most of
 them at least enough to succeed at the official “graduation test”. They thus tended to vindicate the
 learning abilities of the average non-literate adult and to justify appropriate learning programs. At the
 same time caution is needed. Field studies nearly ten years after the campaigns did suggest that many,
 if not most, of the successful learners had largely forgotten how to read and write. The findings suggested
 either that the learners had not learned the skills to a “permanent,” usable degree (and did not benefit
 from a “refresher program”) or, had no reason to practice their skills.

183. Mali’s teacher policies need to address the key reasons why teacher quality and
performance have remained low. To the extent possible, potential candidates for teachers’
schools need to be selected among students finishing upper secondary education (and not as largely
the case now just exiting grade 9). In-service training needs to be greatly improved, and there needs
to be a serious debate on the language of instruction to prioritize teaching in French rather than in
multiple local languages on which teachers have not been trained. Mali has not conducted a needs
assessment based on subject areas and very little information exists on what subject areas have the
largest shortages of quality teachers and what are the key skills teachers need to be effective:
implementing such an assessment is critical. At the same time, strategies to strengthen incentives
for teachers to relocate across regions and areas (including by building on some of the successful
steps that were taken to relocate teachers from the northern regions to the south following the
crisis) and to show up in the classroom (such as exploring larger roles for the school management
committees in monitoring attendance) should be developed and implemented.

184. The performance of public health workers is also very low for reasons similar to those
of teachers. The lack of incentives to provide quality maternal and child care is reportedly linked
to low salaries, poor career prospects and limited accountability for performance. Major gaps are
reported in the quality of health worker training, in part because of the expansion of unregulated
private training institutions.

185. Access constraints are in part indicative of supply-side constraints that need to be
tackled. Availability of facilities and human resources is an issue in poor and rural areas for both
education and health, and made worse with the crisis. Availability and quality of facilities matters
because they have a large and strong impact on attendance. A standard deviation increase in time
to local school, decreases the probability of attendance by 13 percent, and one standard deviation
in the distance decreases the probability of attendance by 8 percent. Girls’ attendance is higher in
schools with separate latrines for girls and boys. The marginal effect is four percent higher
attendance probability for a standard deviation change in school quality supply. As for education
there is a strong relation between time to a health clinic and the consultation rate (concerning all
types of consultations). (Appendix to Chapter 4, Table 3). Access to education and health services
is worsened by the inadequate distribution of health personnel. The richer quintiles have eight
times more teachers per 10,000 residents compared to the poorest quintiles (with evidence that up
to 39 percent of teachers’ allocation is not explained by student numbers). In health there is a huge



                                                       80
concentration of doctors, nurses and midwives in the capital, while rural areas are largely
underserved.


186. Actions to improve the deployment of human resources to make it more needs-based
have to be taken, and innovative strategies to bring service delivery closer to beneficiaries
envisaged, including striving to address the specificities of the north. In education, attendance
has been found to be higher in circles where there is a larger share of community schools, and
religious and non-religious private schools. Community school supply is associated with higher
attendance, even with extensive controls for family background and region controls, which
suggests that this may be a useful mechanism for improving access for marginalized families,
together with the strengthening of school management committees153. Other strategies would
include make further use of non-formal education and training programs for youth and adults. A
significant proportion of the population will continue to be left out if skills development and
literacy opportunities are not upgraded or redesigned. The existing skills development and literacy
programs are small in scale and cannot absorb the growing demand for training. Vocational
training schools and centers are characterized by several imbalances: a concentration of centers
in Bamako, curricula that do not respond to labor market needs, lack of focus on literacy and other
cognitive and non-cognitive skills, and a lack of partnerships with the productive sector. To rectify
these shortcomings, existing skills development programs need to be scaled up to absorb the
growing demand for training, coordinated with the labor market, and focus on literacy as well as
other skills for the agriculture sector. In health, community primary health care centers have shown
strong potential to reach out to hard to reach communities and the scope for mobile health teams
could be further explored, in particular for the north.

187. There is a need for more nutrition related interventions. To address the serious
malnutrition levels and avoid its negative consequences for health, human capital formation and
the ability to be productive, a two-pronged strategy is needed: it must address the immediate effects
of malnutrition with an emphasis on very young children; and it must invest in nutrition
interventions that increase the resilience of vulnerable populations (including the poor, farmers,
women, children, populations in vulnerable regions, etc.) in the face of ongoing crises, while
fostering long-term benefits. Mali needs a combination of cost-effective relevant “nutrition-
specific” interventions, largely delivered through the health sector; and multi-sectorial “nutrition-
sensitive” interventions, delivered through the agriculture sector and through social protection,
water and sanitation, and poverty reduction programs, all of which have the potential to strengthen
nutritional outcomes in Mali (Figure 4.6).

188. Demand-side constraints are also part of the explanation for the access constraints,
in particular in health. Insufficient financing of health by the public sector poses a heavy burden
on households as out-of –pocket expenditures remain the main source of health financing and now
represent about 60 percent of total health expenditures. Health financing relies heavily on direct
153
    The community-school management committees can bring parents and other community members to discuss,
negotiate, and agree on the role of education in their communities. Discussions go beyond the basic maintenance and
administrative issues to include the type of ever-present risks that are aggravated by shocks and crisis, and the
resilience factors that can mitigate them. The committees sometimes step in as a corrective force, for example to
prevent a family from taking their child out of school for marriage or work, negotiating with families alternatives that
will keep the children in schools.

                                                          81
payments by households, and this system inevitably puts a higher burden on the poor. The share
of spending on health as a percentage of GDP was relatively unchanged for the 2000-2011 period,
but experienced a decline to 5.8 percent of total GDP in 2012. This is mainly a result of the decline
in the public health expenditure from 3 percent of GDP to 2.3 percent between 2011 and 2012.
Private contribution to health expenditure remained higher than the public share at 3.5 percent of
GDP in 2012. Malian households are the primary source of health financing through direct
payments, and therefore they are extremely vulnerable to risks of exclusion and impoverishment.
Additionally, there is also evidence that the crisis, through its effect on consumption, triggered
some households to take their children out of school and decrease consultation rates (as evidenced
from a decrease in non-food consumption) suggesting that even as supply gets better, income and
consumption may still constrain use of services if not addressed.

189. Finally, overarching constraints in the governance of education and health also need
to be taken into account. The weak institutional capacity and stewardship capacity of the Ministry
of Health (MOH) is a constraint for effective alignment and coordination of health interventions.
Numerous changes in the composition of the government, lack of effective control mechanisms
and insufficient strategic planning capacity produce ineffective policies and leadership in health.
In education, allocative inefficiencies are clear from the biased distribution of resources across
education sub-sectors and geographic areas; these are compounded by the weak management of
resources and performance at all levels.

Finance
190. Limited access to financial services is a binding constraint for households, farmers,
micro-entrepreneurs, SMEs and corporations in Mali. Without inclusive financial systems,
poor people must rely on their own limited savings to invest in their education, manage crops and
harvests, or become entrepreneurs – and small enterprises must rely on their limited earnings to
pursue promising growth opportunities. Conversely, when financial inclusion becomes more
widespread, there is growing evidence that there are significant benefits for individuals. Providing
individuals access to savings instruments increases savings, female empowerment, productive
investment and consumption.154

191. Mali’s population remains financially excluded, particularly in rural areas. With less
than 8 percent of Malians using a formal bank account (compared to 24 percent in Sub-Sahara
Africa), less than 4 percent borrow from a formal institution (compared to 11 percent in low
income countries), while 23 percent borrow from family or friends (compared to 30 percent in Sub
–Sahara Africa). In particular, the poor, the unemployed, young adults, women and those out of
the workforce are less likely to have a formal account. Financial exclusion in rural areas is
particularly acute. Adults living in rural areas are more than half as likely to be banked as those
living in cities. Outside Bamako, access to finance is negligible and rotating savings and credit
associations, tontines and borrowing from friends and family remain by far the most informal
methods to save and access credit due to a lack of physical presence of either a bank or savings
institution.

192. Financing constraints are also binding for private enterprises. Credit to the private
sector has hovered close to 20 percent for the past several years, and firms are financially
constrained. Less than 16 percent of firms use a loan or line of credit, while over 45 percent of
firms find access to finance their most binding constraint. Not surprisingly, usage of bank credit
is even lower for SMEs and women-headed companies (12 percent and 9 percent respectively).

193. For households, micro-entrepreneurs and poor farmers, financial access to savings,
credit, and insurance products is seriously affected by the moribund microfinance sector..
While this sector is not systemically important, the number of microfinance depositors is actually
greater than the number of banking sector depositors (950,000 versus 900,000), and it is estimated
that over 70 percent of microfinance depositors have lost or are unable to access their savings. In
a country where financial inclusion is so low, the complete loss of confidence in all saving and
lending institutions geared towards the poor represents a fundamental obstacle to financial access
to households, individuals, and micro-enterprises, affecting a major portion of Mali’s population
at the bottom of the pyramid.

194. The range of low-income financial services that are available in other economies
(micro-insurance, mobile banking, e-wallets, and microenterprise loans) have not yet been
developed. The absence of these services has direct implication for the ability of poor households
to generate an income. Absence of access to credit or crop insurance forces farmers to opt for low
risk, low return crops (like sorghum and millet) and limits the use of modern inputs which have to
be purchased using cash. Following a shock, assets can only be rebuilt through a process of savings
and self-accumulation as credit and leasing opportunities are not available. In the absence of a
warehouse receipt system poor farmers are often forced to sell at low prices to repay debts; the
absence of leasing services hinders access to ploughing services, for example.

195. Financing constraints are acute for private enterprises, including agri-businesses
which often need seasonal credit. Credit to the private sector in Mali has not passed 21 percent,
and less than 12 percent of SMEs have a loan or line of credit. Bank lending is concentrated in T-
bills, direct investment into state owned enterprises and large companies. Medium term credit and
equity financing are not available, forcing small and medium scale entrepreneurs with business
ideas that require substantial upfront investments (such as solar mini-grids) to self-financing.
Firms report that most investments (80 percent on average) are financed primarily from internal
funds or retained earnings, while only 10 percent come from bank financing. Supplier credit (value
chain financing, leasing, factor and other forms of agricultural credit) accounts for less than 5
percent of investment finance and 3 percent of working capital, while less than 5 percent of
investments come from equity on average. Less than 3 percent of all bank loans are allocated
toward agricultural investments.

196. The opportunity cost of these missing financial services is significant in the Malian
context. For example, access to micro insurance (crop, livestock, and weather) is tied to better
protection for farmers in times of bad weather or disaster, increased take-up of new production
technologies, and improved farmer access to credit and financial services due to credit history,
better productivity and income profiling, and access to information.155 The availability of mobile

financial services has been transformative in reducing levels of the unbanked across Africa, but
has not yet reached Mali. In Kenya, where mobile money has been available since 2007, 83 percent
of mobile users subscribe to various services, including the bulk of the unbanked poor since the
introduction of M-Pesa.

197. For SMEs and rural non-farm businesses, financial products such as factoring,
leasing, and warehouse receipts could mean increased productivity and competitiveness,
particularly in manufacturing and agriculture sectors.156 Factoring plays an important role for
SMEs and new firms in emerging markets that often have difficulty accessing bank financing.157
Similarly, for farmers and rural businesses, warehouse receipt systems can foster higher
productivity, higher producer prices, greater access to financial services, and better quality crops.
158
    For example, following the introduction of a warehouse receipt system in Tanzania for cashew
nuts, farmers doubled both prices and output over a two year period.

198. The regime for creditors’ rights in Mali is a key factor in discouraging private sector
credit. Improving collateral and insolvency regimes are important to investment because they
contribute to lender confidence in loan recovery upon default, which encourages more lending and
leads to financial inclusion for more businesses. Out of 189 economies ranked by the Doing
Business Indicators, Mali ranks 131st on the Getting Credit indicator, and is 108th for Resolving
Insolvency. This is reflected in the terms and conditions of the loans for Malian firms. The value
of collateral needed to secure a bank loan, for example, is over 200 percent of the value of the loan.

199. Private sector lending is also constrained by competition from the State. Bank lending
is concentrated in T-bills, direct investment into state owned enterprises, and large companies.
Medium term credit and equity financing are not available forcing small and medium scale
entrepreneurs with business ideas that require substantial upfront investments to self-finance.

200. The lack of an array of financial products available for poor people is missing because
the microfinance sector is often the industry leader in developing and delivering these financial
services. Even prior to the crisis, however, the sector was fragmented, inefficient, and subject to
political capture, and was largely a conduit for subsidized funds or grants to target populations.
Without an overhaul of the sector, including consolidation, liquidation, combined with robust
supervision and private sector investment, the sector will continue to preclude, rather than foster,
savings, credit, and other financial services so critical for Mali’s poor.

Electricity


201. Electricity is widely recognized as indispensable for raising households’ standard of
living and broader economic development. Access to reliable electricity is a pre-requisite for
firms in rural and urban areas. Mali ranks low on the Getting Electricity indicators of the Doing
Business ranking 2014 (132 of 189 countries, in 2014), but relatively better than other countries in
the region (Capo Verde ranks 133, Senegal 183, Burkina 177, Niger 165). Once households
‘electrify’ they get an immediate benefit from better household lighting. With brighter light in the
home, children spend more hours studying, adults have more flexible hours for completing chores
and reading books, and home-based businesses remain open longer in the evenings, producing
more items for sale. Rural electrification can also raise productivity and income when small
entrepreneurs begin using electric tools and machinery. Access to electricity can be provided in
different ways using the grid or non-grid solutions. The most suited way depends largely on
economic density, with grid solutions being most appropriate for high density urban areas and off
grid solutions for rural areas.

202. Only selected rural areas can be connected to the grid. Expanding the national
electricity grid to reach a larger proportion of the population requires huge investments in
transmission and even more in distribution because the overall population density of Mali is low
and the rural population dispersed. For this reason, the national network expansion will remain
limited in the foreseeable future and focus on: (i) expanding the distribution network in peri-urban
or recently urbanized areas (especially around Bamako), and (ii) connecting to the national grid
isolated localities with a relatively high level of demand that live close to the existing grid.

203. In rural areas alternative solutions for providing access to modern energy services
are needed. A possible approach is the development of rural mini-grids, which has been the
primary strategy promoted by AMADER. It is a bottom-up model, driven by decisions from local
private entrepreneurs/cooperatives to construct and operate small-scale mini-grids in rural areas
based on their perception of the local market. AMADER offers investment subsidies up to 75
percent of the capital investment costs, with local private operators providing an average matching
co-financing of 25 percent. No subsidies for energy consumption or operating expenses are
provided. Electricity prices in rural mini-grids are typically around 250 FCFA/kWh (50
USc/kWh). In comparison, the average regulated tariff for EDM clients remains on average below
100 FCFA/kWh (20 USc/kWh).159 More than 60 operators are currently active for about 190 mini-
grids. Existing mini-grids are mainly diesel-run and serve about 75,000 households and
enterprises.

204. Still, financing has been a problem for both AMADER and potential operators. Most
of the rural electrification activities are today based on donor contribution, making funding
insufficient and uncertain. Potential operators have had difficulty raising equity or obtaining loans
for the 20–25 percent share of capital costs not funded by AMADER. A tendency towards
concentration of the sector however can be observed. While a large number of single site operators
remain, four multi-site companies, with pre-financing capabilities, have emerged with 15 to 20

159
   The fact that users in rural mini grids are ready to pay CFAF 250 / kWh (as opposed to CFAF 100 / kWh paid by
urban electricity users) is an indication of the latent demand for affordable electricity.

                                                      85
sites each. This consolidation appears to facilitate professionalization of the operators, through
diffusion of experience and best practices and increased specialization and can contribute, if
sustained properly, to the sustainability and the expansion of the rural electrification sector. Given
the political and security situation of Mali, local actors are likely to conserve comparative
advantages for the management of rural energy concessions, possibly in partnership with foreign
firms. Promoting leasing arrangements and instituting a loan guarantee program for Malian banks
that would be willing to lend to potential private sector operators have been discussed as methods
of reducing financial barriers for operators.

205. For the majority of the rural population, non-grid solutions, such as Solar Home
Systems or efficient solar powered lighting products is a more viable option than grid based
systems. As 0.3 percent of total household consumption is spent on paraffin (ELIM 2010), the
market for solar lighting is potentially huge as it offers a cost-effective alternative. Even for the
poorest households and without considering the spending on dry cells, car batteries or cell phone
charging, for those who spent approximately $ 5 per capita on paraffin per annum, purchasing
simple solar lights is a cost-effective alternative. Solar home systems have been found to increase
evening study hours of both boys and girls; reduce fuel collection time of women; and help
improve access to information (adoption of TVs, phone charging). These in turn help promote
women’s decision-making power and information sharing and have also been found to reduce
women’s and children’s morbidity from respiratory diseases by reducing kerosene consumption.160

206. Low awareness of solar lighting technology amongst consumers and retailers and the
(relatively) high upfront cost of solar solutions limit the demand however. 161 Solar lanterns
face price elastic demand due to the availability of substitutes (such as kerosene lights) with low
upfront fixed costs, but high recurring costs. The successful introduction of solar lights may thus
require an awareness campaign but also improved access to finance by households (microcredit;
mobile savings) and retailers (supplier credit) as well as the consideration of other financing
solutions such as leasing.162

207. Quality of on-grid electricity services is deteriorating as Energie du Mali (EDM) is in
financial distress. The reliability of grid electricity is affected by the fact that EDM faces serious
capacity shortages, dilapidated infrastructures and is in financial distress as a result of high oil
prices, large efficiency losses, poor management and, most critically, a substantial gap between
cost of production and electricity pricing. Electricity tariffs are largely disconnected from costs.
For 2013, the sector regulator (CREE) estimated the average cost recovering tariff at 123
FCFA/kWh (US cents 26/kWh), while the average tariff was 96 FCFA/kWh (US cents 20/kWh)163.

208. Improved access to mobile phone services (voice, text, mobile money and banking,
internet) benefits households in multiple ways. Mobile phones can improve access to and use
of information, thereby reducing search costs, improving coordination between different parties,
and increasing market efficiency. This is the most obvious benefit of mobile phones. As mobile
phones have greatly reduced communication costs, they allow individuals and firms to send and
to obtain information quickly and cheaply on a variety of economic, social, and political topics.
An emerging body of research shows that the reduction in communication costs associated with
mobile phones has tangible economic benefits including improving agricultural and labor market
efficiency and producer and consumer welfare 164;165.

209. Another benefit of mobile phones is that increased communication should improve
productive efficiency by allowing firms and service providers to better manage their supply
chains and delivery of services. Fishermen, for instance, who can choose where to land their fish
are known to first enquire about prices in different markets before deciding where to sell. As a
consequence, findings showed a significant reduction in the dispersion of fish prices across
markets.166 In Senegal, the Manobi platform was created primarily to provide real-time information
on agricultural prices in local and international markets, resulting in an increase in certain farmers’
incomes by more than 40 percent.167 Health practitioners remind patients about their therapy or
drug schedule.

210. Mobile phones create new jobs to address demand for mobile-related services. This is
a third benefit of mobile phones. These can be services directly related to mobile phones, such as
the sale of airtime or services to repair a phone or to charge a phone’s battery. But they can also
be indirect services such as motor-taxi services, which can be requested by people living remotely
simply ‘beeping’ the driver. Such services can be life-saving, for instance when someone urgently
needs to be taken to a health facility.

211. Mobile phones facilitate communication among social networks and geographic areas
in response to shocks. Covariate shocks such as floods or drought, but also violence and
epidemics routine affect households clustered in certain localities. By offering the ability to solicit
assistance from relatives or friends living in areas not affected by the shock, mobile phones help
to cope with households’ exposure to risk. For instance, ICT platforms recently played a central
role in improving the effectiveness of healthcare institutions and emergency coordination centers
fighting ebola in contaminated countries, by improving information flows and electronic payments
for emergency response teams as well as the public. In combination with a last benefit of mobile

phones, the potential to facilitate the delivery of financial, agricultural, health and educational
services, this enhances the resilience of households. In Sierra Leone, World Bank social protection
team used mobile payments successfully to issue $450,000 of payments to 6,000 community
workers. In Mali, mobile phone banking for those with a bank account is taking off; even more
citizens convert cash to ‘store’ it on their mobile phones or to transfer it to others. As of September
2014, there were more than 2 million subscribers to the mobile money platform. Amongst these,
35 percent used the platform on at least a monthly basis.168

212. The poorest households and communities benefit least from the advantages mobile
phones have to offer. Despite the rapid spread of mobile phone ownership (almost all households
now have one mobile phone), poor households are still much less likely to use their phones.
Moreover, the poorest communities are least covered by a mobile phone network. Of the 4,229
communities identified by the 2013 ODHD census as very poor, only 32 percent was covered by
a mobile phone network capable of providing voice, text as well as mobile money and banking.
This compares to a coverage rate of 89 percent amongst the non-poor communities.

213. Broadband internet remains limited to main urban areas. Despite its potential to
increase business efficiency, expand markets, create new opportunities for jobs and provide an
important tool for social connectivity (especially amongst the youth), broadband internet does not
reach much beyond Bamako and the provincial capitals. Also within the government, the power
of ICT to enhance public service delivery and to expand communications channels for engagement
and empowerment of citizens remains largely untapped. Mali ranks 181 out of 193 countries in the
2014 E-Government Development Index169, down from 175 in 2008.

214. A universal access policy is needed to increase access and use of mobile phone services.
A universal access policy will help ensure that poor communities are covered by a mobile phone
network too. A policy is needed because progress on mobile phone network coverage has been
very slow. In 2008, 198 out of 666 rural communes were not covered by a mobile phone network.
By 2013 as many as 108 remained uncovered. This despite a more than five-fold increase in the
number of mobile phone subscribers. Other policies may also have to be put in place to ensure
access for all including policies regarding financial regulation regarding the security of mobile
money, savings and transfer as well as policies to accelerate the roll out of broadband networks.

215. Increased competition can be expected to put downward pressure on mobile phone
prices and foster quality improvements, making access more affordable and more ubiquitous
to all households. With only two companies active in the mobile phone market (Orange and
Malitel), competition remains constrained and with it, the incentive to cut prices and improve the
quality of service not only for the voice service which is approaching saturation but more
importantly for the burgeoning broadband Internet service, where there is an urgent need for a
more leveled playing field between the mobile operators and the independent service providers.

4.7     Reducing poverty through social transfers

216. Social Safety Nets (SSNs) programs contribute to poverty reduction in the short-term,
directly through transfers of income and consumption goods and indirectly, as well as in the
medium and long term by protecting or expanding the productive assets of households. Social
safety nets can be used as short term instruments to help the poor cope with economic shocks, but
also as medium/long-term poverty alleviation programs, supporting minimum consumption levels
and promoting the accumulation of human and physical capital. Particularly in environments
characterized by high prevalence of (weather) shocks, poverty traps and limited access to financial
instruments (credit, insurance), safety nets can play an important role in enhancing household
productivity.

217. Predictable, multi-annual social protection support to households has been shown to
result in investments in human capital and assets. When transfers are provided over multiple
periods to poor households, they are used to pay off debts, accumulate productive assets or to buy
inputs (fertilizer). 170 This enhances productive capacity and resilience such that eventually they no
longer require support. Experience shows that these objectives are more effectively achieved when
safety net support is combined with investments in livelihoods.171 Adaptive social protection is one
of the tools to be used. It enables beneficiaries to invest in productive assets, stimulates use of
basic social services and reduces sensitivity to future shocks.

218. The choice of safety net depends on circumstance; safety nets need to reflect different
livelihoods and require a profound understanding of the binding constraints to poverty
reduction. In areas where the vast majority of households is poor, geographic targeting may be
preferred over household specific targeting. In such situations a transfer program that is ‘a mile
wide and an inch deep’ may be very effective especially if it prevents households from selling
productive assets or from reducing food intake (a common strategy in Mali)172. Yet the same
approach would predictably be very ineffective in the presence of critical wealth thresholds below
which an autarkic savings and asset accumulation strategy is no longer feasible and households
are stuck in chronic poverty. In such instances large significant transfers may be more effective
than small frequent transfers.

219. Well-designed safety nets strengthen community resilience. The capacity of central
government to identify the most vulnerable or to design location specific programs is limited. It
necessitates an approach that embraces decentralized, local level decision making to identify the
types of programs that are needed and its beneficiaries.173 Such an approach fits well in the
Governments stated objective of decentralization and, in a context of heightened and continued
insecurity, helps build resilience. At the same time, successful local level approaches require

    In this regards some lessons can be drawn from the conflict in the north which has demonstrated that some sectors
such as fishing and subsistence farming were more resilient than others. As mobility became increasing risky, actors
in all value chains moved production closer to home. Investments in small animal production, kitchen gardens and
fishing offer options to maintain a minimum livelihood.

central level support: funds have to be transferred, the quality of construction assessed and policies
to facilitate the adoption of new technological solutions (such as mobile phone cash transfers)
adopted.

220. Well-designed safety nets can address multiple constraints at the same time. Labor
intensive public works schemes offer such possibilities. By offering guaranteed access to income
in time of need (off-season), they induce households to adopt higher risk, higher return activities.
By offering a safety net when a shock materializes they help prevent the sale of productive assets
and inputs and by creating public infrastructure, they help mitigate weather risks (irrigation),
enhance access to markets (maintenance of all-weather roads) or facilitate reconstruction of public
infrastructure that has been destroyed by the conflict in the north. For non-able bodied, or in
situations where public works programs are too costly, conditional cash transfers offer similar
advantages with the main difference being that human capital instead of community assets are
accumulated.

221. Mali’s present safety net program has few of the desired features and an overhaul is
needed. Most of Mali’s safety nets are concentrated on food support. Food sales at subsidized
prices implemented through cereal banks and local authorities, and ad hoc measures to stabilize
food prices such as the closure of the border for food exports or the waiver of import duties on
imported foods are the main strategies. These are not specifically targeted towards the poor174 and
disturb the effective functioning of the market for cereals. Cash transfers and labor intensive public
works programs are implemented only on a limited scale (cash transfers) or in response to crises
(public works), while asset transfers programs are not even under consideration. Given the
potential of a well-designed safety net program to directly reduce poverty through transfers, and
indirectly by increasing household productivity175 an overhaul of the transfer program is needed.

222. The fiscal costs of a large scale safety net program are not insurmountable. In the
introduction to this chapter it was noted that the current level of ODA is sufficient to bring all poor
households to the poverty line. A transfer of FCFA 10,000 per household over 36 months 176 to
43.5 percent of the population (which constitutes all households that are classified as poor under
the national poverty line) would cost approximately FCFA 51 billion (US$102 million) per year.
This is equivalent to one percent of GDP and the same as presently is being spent on electricity
subsidies which largely benefit better off urban households. Simulations of the potential impact of
such a cash transfer on poverty suggest a 4.6 percent reduction in the poverty rate, a 5.8 percent
reduction in the poverty gap, and an over 7 percent reduction in the severity of poverty in the
targeted regions, even accounting for targeting errors.

    The FAO LEWIE (Local Economy-wide Impact Evaluation) model constructed for the cash transfer programs in
Kenya, Lesotho, Ghana, Zambia and Ethiopia generated nominal income multipliers ranging from 2.52 in Hintalo-

    A transfer of FCFA 10,000 per month per household (equivalent to US$20) is: (i) commensurate with international
experience (below 15 percent of the poverty line and below 20 percent of beneficiary households’ expenditure levels);
(ii) likely to have a significant impact on the level and quality of household food consumption; and (iii) likely to
reduce food poverty headcount by 4.6 percent and food poverty gap by 5.8 percent.

OPPORTUNITIES

The main obstacles to poverty reduction in the short run are insecurity, the low incomes of the rural poor
and vulnerability to shocks. In the long run, poor governance and low levels of (female) education need to
be addressed to strengthen the foundation for economic transformation and to facilitate demographic
transition. To address these obstacles three sets of binding constraints are identified: (i) a personalized
competitive settlement within which the most pressing issues are: peace; policy reforms leading to
improved revenue generation and more efficient pro-poor spending, a resilient and developmentally
oriented cotton sector and improved education quality; and transparency and social accountability. In the
second cluster of binding constraints; (ii) low productive capacity by poor farmers and pastoralists
increasing agricultural production (irrigation; seed development; ability to plow; fertilizer and skills;
training and extension) and the development of selected value chains are the most pressing issues. In the
third cluster (iii) exposure to uninsured risk the introduction of safety nets and improvements in the health
and education systems are identified as most pressing constraints.

5.1     The prioritization process


223. The prioritization process took place in three phases. As a first step the characteristics
of an environment in which poverty is sustainably reduced were identified. Desk analysis
suggested that for poverty reduction in Mali to be sustainable, economic and demographic
transformation are needed. The analysis also noted that the foundations for such transformation to
materialize by 2030 are not in place: levels of human capital are too low (chapter 1), the capacity
of the bureaucracy too limited (chapter 1), transport costs too high (chapter 1) and the degree of
economic complexity too low (chapter 3). This was confirmed during field visits early in the SCD
process during which discussions were held with smallholder farmers, commercial large scale
farmers, those involved in the value chains of horticultural products as well as with manufacturers
working in the agricultural value chain. The review also noted that there are no major long term
macro-fiscal concerns (see chapter 3), and identified risks associated to climate change as serious
(see chapter 1).

224. Recognizing that “between-sector” transformation requires a foundation to
materialize, the prioritization process then considered, as a second step, the poverty
reduction strategy that could yield the largest reductions in poverty by 2030, in a way that
does not jeopardize, but in fact supports, the long run trajectory for poverty reduction. This strategy
started from the joint observation in chapter 2 that most of the poor live in rural areas, are engaged
in agriculture or pastoralism and that in the early 2000s rapid poverty reduction was achieved
through a combination of improved infrastructure, increased remittances, increased off farm
income generating opportunities and above all, increased cereal production. On the basis of these
observations, chapter 4 explored opportunities for poverty reduction that builds on a process of
economic transformation that starts with the primary sector.

225. The next step in the prioritization process was a two-day country team retreat during
which binding constraints were identified, discussed and ranked. The retreat elaborated on the
question how to increase resilience, and on and off-farm income generation by poor rural
households with a focus on cereal crops and selected high value crops (cotton; tropical fruits;

                                                     92
horticulture). Prior to the retreat the draft SCD (chapters 1-4) had been distributed to the country
team. Participants at the retreat gave presentations on: poverty; human capital formation and
transfers; governance challenges; increasing productivity in agriculture and improving the
functioning of markets value chains. The retreat identified 54 constraints, which were discussed at
length and categorized into 13 challenges. To rank the constraints, retreat participants voted on
each of the constraints/challenges using as criteria: impact on poverty reduction (short and long
run); feasibility; capacity to implement; cost and evidence base (the list of 54 constraints can be
found in the annex to this chapter). Informed by the retreat, the challenges were grouped into 3
“core binding constraints”: a personalized competitive political settlement; low productive
capacity of farmers and pastoralists and exposure to uninsured risks. The ranking of the challenges
under each of the core binding constraints is presented in Table 5.1.

226. The third step of the prioritization process were in-country consultations and a
consistency check of the identified binding constraints with the long term objectives of
economic transformation and demographic transition. Consultations were held on February
9th, 10th, and 11th in Bamako with representatives of Parliament, government, and of the
administration gathered for the event. Members of non-governmental institutions, associations,
research NGOs, universities and representatives of the civil society, and representation of
development partners also participated. Separate consultations were held with donors, the private
sector, and representatives of Malian youth. Like the country team retreat, consultations were
structured around different themes: poverty, agriculture, private sector development, governance
and social protection. The three core binding constraints were broadly confirmed, though different
accents were expressed. Security of tenure, for instance, was raised as a major concern as was the
need to improve data collection and the need for donors to coordinate their actions. Poor
governance; low levels of education and inadequate health were seen as main obstacles to growth;
private sector development was seen as essential for growth. Following the consultations, the
identification of core binding constraints was finalized. Part of this process was to confirm that the
“short term” binding constraints were aligned with the constraints to long term development. This
process ensured that an identified risk and source of fragility like climate change was fully
integrated in the constraints related to increasing the productivity of agriculture (climate smart;
sustainable irrigation) as well as the constraints associated to resilience.

5.2    Focusing the poverty reduction efforts

227. The evidence presented in the previous chapters suggests that the main obstacles to
poverty reduction in the short run are insecurity in the north, vulnerability to shocks and
low off and on farm incomes of poor households. The focus on incomes of poor households in-
situ in rural areas is informed by the geographic location of the poor now and as projected by 2030
(in rural areas); their core income generating activities (primary sector production and casual labor)
and consumption patterns (cereals make up a large share of the consumption of the urban and rural
poor); the high exposure to shocks (weather, price variation, health, security, violence and
fragility) and the limited opportunities for economic transformation by 2030 (landlocked country,
extremely low levels of education, low economic complexity). Strengthening selected value chains
in areas in which Mali is performing will deepen the productive knowledge in the economy while
improving the incomes of the poor will facilitate higher public and private investments in human
capital. The latter will also increase resilience thus leading to a virtuous cycle of higher incomes
and reduced vulnerability. Together, improvements in human capital and economic complexity are
expected to facilitate successful rural-urban migration and to lay a strong foundation for between-
sector economic transformation.

228. Poverty reduction efforts focused on reducing vulnerability and increasing the
incomes of the poor need to be complemented with redistributive efforts. Safety nets have the
potential to reduce the number of poor directly and at scale: less than 2 percent of GDP in perfectly
targeted transfers in combination with 2 percent of growth per capita (of the poorest households)
is sufficient to eliminate poverty by 2030. Safety nets not only have a redistributive function; well-
designed safety nets offer opportunities to enhance household incomes by allowing increased risk
taking and by improving the productive asset base.

229. An effective poverty reduction strategy needs to target the areas where the majority
of the poor live and to introduce interventions that are locally adapted. Population density and
the incidence of poverty vary across the territory of Mali, but as the vast majority of the poor live
in southern Mali –including Kayes and the Niger Delta, most of the attention would need to go to
these areas. And as livelihood patterns and productive potential vary considerably across the nation
(from transhumant pastoralism to farming in the high productivity zone), interventions have to suit
local circumstances. Interventions also need to take gender into account, for instance, to avoid that
productivity improving investments such as irrigation, lead to women losing access.

230. Policies to reduce rural poverty extend beyond improving the lot of poor farmers (and
agro-pastoralists) directly. Poor farmers participate in the wider economy and benefit from
improvements therein. While the on-farm incomes of poor households are low they rely on social
networks for resilience and on casual labor opportunities offered by better off households. Poor
urban households benefit from reductions in food prices brought about by increased production of
business farmers. Poor rural households benefit from technologies and value chains developed for
more commercially oriented farmers. As a result, increasing the incomes of the less poor can be
an effective strategy to reduce poverty, though it impact on poverty is not direct and its
effectiveness needs to be demonstrated.

231.       Three clusters of key binding constraints to reducing poverty have been identified.

 account                                                    poverty, but this may take time and the channels
                                                            through which it would happen need to be clear




5.3        Binding constraint 1: a personalized competitive political settlement

232. The personalized political settlement that has emerged in Mali allows the polity to
survive politically through elitist, urban policies and spending as well as captured institutions
at the expense of adequate public service delivery. In a personalized intermediate competitive
country-type177, contending factions are largely unconstrained by formal rules. Political
arrangements are organized around personalized interactions and distribution of rents among elites
(consensus politics), and between elites and non-elites. The incentives of the ruling elite sustain
high levels of favoritism and nepotism, and a bureaucratic culture in which kickbacks and the
diversion of public funds are the norm. Consequently dysfunctionality touches all activities and
levels of government. Poor governance is behind the conflict in the north and is the primary reason
why rural poverty remains pervasive. It explains the absence of progress to address the
unacceptably low levels of public service delivery. It also explains the persistence of policies
which favor the rich and urban class and the failed attempts at decentralization.

233. Creating peace and stability in the north take priority. The existence of a large
ungoverned space in the north, and the gradual expansion of the insecure area towards the south,
in combination with citizens who are disillusioned with their political class, created space for
extremism and popular resentment in the north and the south of the Mali. State legitimacy is low
and the situation fragile. Some poorly managed shock (a climatic event, a major terrorist attack, a
citizen revolt, coup d’état or a disease like ebola) could profoundly upset the existing political

settlement. If this were to happen it can be expected to derail the prospect for development of the
entire nation for a long time to come. Avoiding the spread of insecurity towards the more densely
populated areas and restoring security in the north are thus of critical importance. In the short run,
restoring security requires a signed peace accord but to be implemented and sustained governance
reforms are also needed: to improve service delivery, to reinvigorate the decentralization process
and to restore state legitimacy in general.

234. For poverty reduction those aspects of governance with a direct and negative impact
on rural development need particular attention. Even then the list is long. It includes reform of
the cotton sector, Office du Niger, allocation of the Niger river water, fertilizer policies. It covers
reforms in the telecommunications sector to improve geographical coverage, innovativeness and
cost and in the transport sector to reduce road blocks and increase competition. The financial sector
has to be reformed to spur the development of new products relevant to rural households. The land
registration system has to be reformed to improve security of tenure and to end land-grabbing and
speculation. The tax system has to be reviewed to reduce the bias against small and medium scale
enterprises and the collection (mining), allocation and spending (procurement systems) of public
resources has to improve. Reforms are also needed to improve public service delivery, particularly
those of direct relevance to the poor: education, health, water and sanitation, rural transport,
extension and veterinary services. The approach to public service delivery has to be reviewed with
an eye to creating more space for the delivery of services by private sector operators. Land policies,
finally, have to be addressed to reduce conflict (including between pastoralists and farmers), to
increase investor confidence and to reduce land grabbing and speculation. It needs to become clear
what type of law prevails in which situation.

235. In many areas, policy reforms have to be successfully completed before considering
major new investments. Access to electricity was found to be a problem, but investments in
additional generating capacity for the grid will have to be sequenced with adequate policy reforms
that bring tariffs in line with costs. Investments in infrastructure are unlikely to reduce the cost of
transport unless accompanied by reforms addressing the capture of rents at roadblocks and by
trucking cartels. Investments in ICT infrastructure have to be preceded by reforms that improve
competition in the sector. Low levels of education hinder efforts to reducing poverty both in the
short term and in the long term, however the rate of return to formal education will remain low
unless effective policy reforms to improve the quality of teaching are enacted. Adult literacy on
the other hand, has been found to be strongly associated with lower levels of poverty.

236. Instead of ranking reforms by priority and attempting to achieve first-best solutions,
an adaptive, opportunity driven, incremental, good-enough approach to policy reform is
more likely to succeed. In a personalized competitive country-setting, standard technocratic
reform – for example, the introduction of a ‘level playing field’ for business or a meritocratic
public sector -- are contrary to the personalized-competitive political logic, so are unlikely to gain
much traction. Rather, development gains are likely to come incrementally via a combination of
two strategies: a sustained approach to governance reform -- addressing specific capacity, policy
and institutional constraints as and when they become binding; and an ‘islands of effectiveness’
approach -- where groups of developmentally-oriented stakeholders co-operate opportunistically
to achieve a specific developmental purpose for which they have an incentive to see results. This
necessitates flexibility, adaptability and, persistence, and, as resources are limited, the

                                                  97
identification of a small number of policy reforms that are pursued vigorously (in addition to those
that occur opportunistically).

237. Policy reforms to improve PFM systems, the functioning of the cotton sector and to
improve the quality of education should take priority. Stronger, more transparent PFM systems
improve fiscal sustainability and are critical for restoring state legitimacy and for increasing the
budget envelop. Such a large share of (potential) public resources remains uncollected (from
mining companies and through import tax exemptions), is lost through inefficient procurement or
is used towards poorly targeted subsidies and tax exemptions. If these issues were to be addressed,
3 to 5 percentage points of GDP could feasibly be generated: money that could be used to improve
service delivery (it would be more than adequate to create a large scale safety net). The cotton
sector is of importance because it touches the lives of so many farmers and because it has
demonstrated its potential to act as an engine of rural development. The quality of education,
finally, is critical because if the human capital base is not improved, economic transformation and
demographic transition remain out of reach and though investments in education may improve
access, they would yield a low rate of return.

238. Weak (social) accountability and transparency mechanisms create space for the
political and economic elites to behave in anti-developmental ways. Strengthening these
mechanisms is a priority. Elite capture happens at all levels and can be reduced by increasing the
risk of exposure. Improving the collection of information, the capacity to analyze it and to put it
in the public domain are critical. Technological advances provide new opportunities for monitoring
and dissemination of findings. Donor agencies, whose resources are the equivalent of 40 percent
of the budget can play a catalytic role by insisting on transparency around the spending and results
of their own programs and interventions. But it is important to keep in mind that those same donor
agencies were instrumental in the emergence of the prevailing political settlement.

5.4      Binding constraint 2: low productive capacity of poor farmers and pastoralists

239. Low levels of production keep rural households poor. Poor rural households lack the
capacity to be productive. They have no farm equipment other than the hoe which limits the area
that can be brought under cultivation (land is not a constraint in most places)178. Rural dwellers are
uneducated and illiterate, and their capacity to work is negatively affected by poor health.
Consequently they cultivate tiny plots of (unirrigated) land that are too small to sustain their food
needs. To make ends meet, the poorest combine agriculture with casual employment. Outmigration
is less of an option as people lack the skills or formal education to succeed elsewhere in the
economy. Particularly in the low-potential rain-fed zone this is an obstacle as the potential to make
a decent living from farming alone is limited.

240. A first priority is improving access to equipment and irrigated land. Access to farm
equipment (draft animals, plowing services) will facilitate bringing more land under cultivation,
while access to irrigated land allows obtaining multiple harvests throughout the year. It requires a
multi-sector approach to bring greater integration between farming and agro-pastoral systems, for

178
   Conflicts about land do occur regularly, particularly in urban and peri-urban areas, in irrigated zone and in areas
where the interests of pastoralists and farmers collide. For the majority of farmers, however, land is available as
evidenced by the fact that about 3.2 million hectares out of a total of 12 million with cultivation potential is cultivated.

                                                            98
skills development (animal traction; mechanics), the development of adapted financial products
(leasing) and the development of a market for farm services. Increased levels of production will
also increase the demand for casual labor, thus creating an indirect channel for poverty reduction.

241. Reducing the yield gap for crops grown mostly by the poor (maize, millet) and by
those who engage with the market (rice, maize, cotton, horticulture) is another priority. The
yield gap for crops grown most by the poorest households (sorghum, millet) is particularly high.
While closing the entire yield gap may not be realistic, reducing the gap by half implies a doubling
or tripling of current production. Closing the yield gap would increase primary GDP significantly
(food crops make up 50 percent of primary sector GDP) but necessitates soil improvement, seed
development and better access to inputs while enhanced adult literacy and extension services will
allow farmers to adapt to changing farming techniques. For the more commercial crops, reforms
of the fertilizer market in combination with irrigation are needed. Even though cotton is not grown
by the poorest households (they lack the equipment to cultivate sufficient land) cotton is a critical
crop for more commercially oriented farmers. A better functioning cotton sector (a crop grown by
29 percent of farm households in 2004/5 and contributing 5 percent to primary sector GDP) will
increase demand for casual labor. It will also improve the provision of critical services associated
with the cotton value chain (producer organization, access to fertilizer on credit, extension, rural
roads and in some instances even literacy programs).

242. Improving the functioning of value chains for selected crops and animal products is
a third priority that requires a multi-sector approach. The value chains for food grains,
chicken, meat and milk as well as those of selected horticultural products need to be strengthened.
It means interventions at the village level (stronger producer organizations to facilitate access to
inputs, credit, storage, quality control and marketing), the middle-level (small and medium sized
traders who aggregate, package, store and distribute) all the way to the national level where large
businesses use the produce in their transformation processes or provide access to the urban and
export markets. The latter is particularly important to prevent that prices collapse following
successful increases in production. Policy reform (discussed in the previous section) is needed to
address biases against the proper functioning of value chains (tax policies, export bans, import
subsidies). A focus on food grains (and small animals) would benefit the poorest in rural and urban
areas alike, as it would reduce price levels and fluctuations for food stuffs that make up the bulk
of their consumption. In selected cases other value chains may also be considered: particularly
when it concerns for crops that create a large demand for casual labor.

243. Opportunities for the local transformation and off-farm employment need to be
developed. The farming season is short and the demand for labor seasonal. Off farm employment
opportunities are important to lengthen the time during which the rural labor force is gainfully
employed. Such opportunities can come from labor migration; artisanal gold mining may be
important as are sustainable ways to produce charcoal. When employment opportunities are
created by local enterprises they will often enhance the demand for locally produced goods and
thus strengthen the local economy. Access to electricity, to finance and to markets, along with
skills development are instrumental to realizing such opportunities.

244. Many of the approaches to address the production constraint are relevant to
addressing other binding constraints (complementarity). Stronger producer organizations are

                                                 99
instrumental to enhanced local accountability and increased farm production (viz. the political
influence of cotton producer groups). Improved irrigation, better health services, lower transport
costs and improved literacy increase rural incomes and resilience. The same holds for better access
to adapted financial products (access to equipment and seasonal credit, for crop and seed insurance
and for safe storage of money and cash transactions).

5.5       Binding constraint 3: exposure to uninsured risks

245. Exposure to uninsured, exogenous shocks affects poor households directly and
indirectly. Weather variability (aggravated by climate change), price variability and poor health
are the main risks affecting poor households directly; in north Mali conflict is another source of
risk. Exposure to uninsured shocks takes a big toll on poverty reduction: farmers opt for low-risk,
low-return activities. A farmer who falls sick during the planting season, loses his or her income
for the year; it takes a rural household who sells his assets to deal with a shock on average 7 years
to return to its initial state.

246. Well targeted transfers (conditional or not) can lift many poor people out of poverty
and increase resilience. Safety nets reduce the number of poor directly and have the potential to
do so at scale: less than 2 percent of GDP in perfectly targeted transfers in combination with 2
percent of growth per capita (of the poorest households) would be sufficient to eliminate poverty
by 2030 in Mali. Productive safety nets such as public works programs increase resilience by
offering access to income opportunities when these are needed most and by improving community
infrastructure that help improve productivity (rural road maintenance, irrigation schemes, producer
groups). They require multi-sector approaches and can also be used to reduce fragility, for instance
as part of the reintegration of ex combatants in support of the peace process).

247. Stronger local organizations are a priority when it comes to increasing resilience. Mali
has a strong tradition of non-formal assistance and organization. Strengthening these local systems
–either in the form of producer organizations (cotton), or community based organizations for social

                                                         100
accountability can strengthen risk coping mechanism and act as barrier to elite capture at local
level. Making the production systems of poor households more resilient is another priority.
Improved (drought resistant) seed and (small scale) irrigation, discussed in the previous section,
increase productivity and reduce dependence on the variable weather. Adapted financial products
such as crop or seed insurance do the same. Improved markets for livestock will allow pastoralists
to better deal with emergency off-take.

248. Increasing the resilience of individuals through investments in health and education
is a priority as it limits the consequences of exposure to uninsured risks. Healthier, better
educated individuals have more options to reduce exposure to risks or to deal with shocks when
they arise. Trained farmers are more likely to successfully adapt their farming system, educated
girls marry later and have fewer children and educated adults are more likely to migrate
successfully when a shock materializes. It is no coincidence that those who fled the crisis in the
north were the better educated, for instance. Increasing resilience thus starts by building better
systems of health and education. This is a long run strategy that will need to start with policy
reforms leading to improvements in performance and staff quality.

5.6    Additional analytical work

249. The preparation of this document has allowed identifying some knowledge gaps to
formulating and implementing an effective poverty reduction strategy. They are listed below:

250. Reliable data on household consumption and incomes is needed. In chapter 2 it was
pointed out that the available poverty surveys are not comparable over time and do not comprise
information on how (poor) households generate their income. An LSMS-ISA survey is in the field
and will address this, but it is important that this survey is repeated regularly. A new agricultural
census (the last one dates from 2004/5) should be considered as well. Once available, data from
the LSMS-ISA survey should be used to re-assess the geographic distribution of poverty and to
prepare a new poverty map that takes account of the wealth of spatial information that exists for
Mali.

251. Analyze the contribution of different agricultural inputs (irrigation, seed, fertilizer,
land cultivated, access to markets) to poverty reduction. The LSMS-ISA survey will facilitate
analysis of the relation between characteristics of the production process and poverty outcomes.
As such it allows resolving puzzles such as the finding that per capita consumption in cotton
growing communities is lower (and levels of malnutrition higher) than in non-cotton growing
communities, should further clarify the relation between access to land and equipment and
household production, and permit the identification of interventions, or combination of
interventions that would be most effective at poverty reduction.

252. The land question needs to be investigated. Land in Mali is still relatively abundant –an
observation supported by the observation that in the high population density zones, households
cultivate larger areas than those in the lower density zones. At the same time, during the
consultations, security of tenure was frequently identified as critical to growth and poverty
reduction. Various elements were mentioned: the importance of security of tenure to protect
against land-grabbing and displacement; to increase (foreign) investment; to avoid speculation and
to address conflicts between pastoralists and farmers. The land issue is multi-layered and varies

                                                101
by geographical location. A study to assess these aspects, and the adequacy of the legal framework
and options to address any eventual shortcomings therein, is recommended.

253. The impact of rural roads on poverty reduction needs to be better understood. The
presence of all-weather roads appears a logical pre-condition for producing and marketing an
agricultural surplus. There is anecdotal evidence to support this view and this document has
reported a correlation between food price variability and road access. On the other hand, the
empirical correlation between road access and poverty incidence was found to be weak. This may
be a consequence of poor data, but could also point towards other issues such as the necessity of
complementary economic services, the need to address governance constraints to transport (road
blocks; trucking cartels) or the poor quality of roads. A better understanding of the impact of
improved all-weather road access on poverty reduction, and the conditions under which improved
road access is most effective in reducing poverty is pertinent.

254. How to improve performance and quality in the health and education sectors?
Problems with access, quality and staff performance in the social sectors are well recorded (and
have been known for a long time). How to address these issues is less clear. Analysis of the Service
Delivery Indicator survey (in the field) will allow a better understanding of the factors driving
performance but the degree to which a quantitative survey can provide answers is limited.
Additional qualitative analyses are suggested along with a political-economy/governance
assessment on how to overcome the obstacles to improved staff quality and performance.

255. The constraints to the emergence of small and medium scaled enterprises are not well
understood. It was noted that value chains are poorly developed and that most trade is informal.
The relative absence of small and medium scale formal enterprises was also noted. The reasons
for this absence are not well identified and vary from a lack of skills, lack of access to (medium
term) finance, lack of access to electricity and a hostile business climate (regulatory and tax
burden; a biased tax system).

256. The impact of safety nets on poverty reduction. This report has argued –and shown
through simulations, that safety nets implemented at scale are an important vehicle for poverty
reduction. A Mali-specific study on the practical aspects of a large scale safety net would facilitate
an investment proposition to the authorities. Such a study should cover: sources of funding; scope
to rationalize the existing safety net programs; evidence on impact (preferably from Mali); and
implementation modalities. A study in this area could be combined with the analytical work to
identify the interventions, or combination of interventions that would be most effective at poverty
reduction.

257. How do stronger local organizations contribute to poverty reduction? It has been
argued that stronger local organizations improve resilience to conflict and climate change and can
be instrumental to overcoming market-access constraints. Local organizations can be vehicles for
literacy programs, or social protection interventions and could strengthen local accountability.
How local organizations could do so, what type of organizations might be supported (NGOs;
school committees; faith based organizations; farmer groups; savings groups) and how best to
support these organizations in ways that avoid elite capture or accountability towards donors
instead of members, needs to be investigated.
