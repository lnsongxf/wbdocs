                                 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.      Following the end of the armed conflict in 1986, the Ugandan government introduced
a number of structural reforms and investments, which boosted growth and reduced
poverty. The resultant macroeconomic stability, post-conflict rebound, and pro-market reforms
generated a sustained period of high growth during 1987–2010. The gross domestic product (GDP)
expanded at an annual average rate of 6.9 percent, one of the fastest among African countries, and
Uganda transformed from a failed state to one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Per
capita GDP, however, grew at a more modest pace of 3.6 percent per year during this period,
essentially because of the country’s high fertility rate. Growth has recently decelerated
to 5.5 percent during FY2011–14, largely attributable to shocks, including the global turbulence,
aid disruptions, and weather; domestic policy slippages (such as increased election-related
spending); and a waning growth dividend from the first spurt of reforms. The sustained output
expansion since the early 1990s had a significant beneficial impact on poverty reduction and
shared prosperity. Uganda’s stellar economic performance from 1987–2010 reinforces the need to
maintain macroeconomic stability and continue with structural reforms. But high fertility is
associated with obstacles to well-being which particularly afflict the youth.

2.      However, nearly three decades after the reforms began, Uganda still faces many
challenges. With gross national income (GNI) per capita at US$660 in 2014 (up from US$310 in
1987), Uganda lies below the low-income countries (LICs) average of US$709. Many of the
current development challenges facing Uganda are well-understood by the policy makers but there
has not been significant progress in addressing them. These challenges include poor infrastructure,
weak public service delivery, low levels of human capital, and underdeveloped institutions. These
aspects, along with a host of other constraints facing Uganda are reflected in the government’s
National Development Plan and Vision 2040. The key challenge is, therefore, to address these
constraints through a set of coordinated actions which close the large gap in implementing policies.
Hence, what is really needed in Uganda is ‘how to do’ rather than ‘what to do’.

Poverty and Shared Prosperity

3.      The proportion of the population living in poverty—whether measured using the
national poverty line or the international poverty line—more than halved from 1993 to 2013.
According to the national poverty line, the proportion of the population living in poverty declined
from 56.4 percent in 1993 to 19.7 percent in 2013. The incidence of extreme poverty measured by
the international poverty line of US$1.25 a day (2005 purchasing power parity [PPP]) declined
from 71.9 percent in 1993 to 30.6 percent in 2013. This declining trend is confirmed when using
the recently released international poverty line of US$1.90 a day (2011 PPP) as poverty incidence
declined to 33.2 percent from 68.1 percent over the same period. Over the last ten years, Uganda
reduced the proportion of the population living under US$1.25 a day faster than any other country
in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

4.    Moreover, prosperity was shared with the poorest segments of the population as
annual consumption growth of the bottom 40 percent in the income distribution averaged
around 3 percent during 1993–2013. This was higher than most other countries in the region.


                                                viii 
 
However, in relative terms, consumption growth of the bottom 40 percent was slower than the
consumption growth of the top 60 percent.

5.      Within the enabling environment of macroeconomic stability, most of the progress on
the twin goals was attributable to higher agricultural incomes. Poverty reduction among
households primarily engaged in agriculture accounted for 53 percent of the reduction in poverty
from 2006 to 2010 and 77 percent of the reduction in poverty from 2010 to 2013. The increase in
aggregate crop production came largely from the expansion of the area under cultivation, favorable
weather, and high prices (in the domestic and regional markets) and marginally because of an
increase in the use of modern production technologies. Improvements in access to markets and
extension services also seem to have helped. The dependence of agricultural incomes on
exogenous factors such as good weather and prices rather than on productivity-enhancing factors
such as technology, training, irrigation, and farm-to-market infrastructure, renders it susceptible to
shocks and raises concerns about sustainability. In addition, the contribution of the agricultural
sector to GDP has declined over time (about 25 percent of GDP currently) and the sector has grown
at an average annual rate of 2 percent over the past five years. For continued poverty reduction,
there is a need to raise agricultural productivity, including through the use of modern production
technologies, as well as sustainable land and water management.

6.      Growth in nonfarm self-employment, and to a lesser extent wage employment, over
the past decades also raised incomes of the bottom 40 percent. The bottom of the consumption
distribution has largely transitioned into self-employment in the informal sector to supplement
their incomes while those who have transitioned to wage employment have generally had higher
levels of education. Improvements in infrastructure, health, and education also contributed to
poverty reduction. Raising nonfarm incomes and reducing dependence on the agricultural sector
will require a boost to private sector competitiveness.

7.      Despite significant progress on the twin goals, vulnerability to poverty in Uganda is
high and the sparse social safety nets and limited access to finance have provided little
protection. Around 43 percent of Ugandans were insecure non-poor in 2013, defined as those
living above the national poverty line but living on less than twice the national poverty line.
Between 2005 and 2009, for every three Ugandans who were lifted out of poverty, two fell back
into poverty, illustrating the fragility of the gains realized by the poorest households. Uganda’s
success in reducing poverty has resulted in many households that are living just above the poverty
line remaining vulnerable to falling under the poverty line in the face of a negative shock. These
shocks can take various forms such as political and regional instability, particularly in neighboring
countries, unexpected health issues, and natural hazards which negatively impact agricultural
incomes. When faced with such shocks, the poor have limited recourse to social safety nets
(only 4.5 percent of the total population receive any kind of direct income support) or access to
finance (65 percent of the population lacks access to credit). As a result, they are unable to smooth
consumption or to afford health care and education, resulting in a depletion of assets. Given the
high level of vulnerability, there is a need to have some basic level of social safety nets, access to
savings instruments, and other means of finance and a need to improve the quality and efficiency
of public services. Notwithstanding these improvements, an increase in farm and nonfarm incomes
remains a prerequisite for sustained reductions in poverty and vulnerability.

8.      Inequality, as measured by the Gini index, rose from 0.36 in 1993 to 0.40 in 2013,
explained by the regional distribution of poverty and conflict. The sustained conflict in the
north, which has put the region back by several years, could also have contributed to increased
inequality and a slower rise in the incomes of the poor. In 2006, approximately 60 percent of the
poor lived in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Seven years later, this proportion
increased to 84 percent. There is therefore a need to maintain peace and stability and improve
public service delivery, particularly in the north. As a result, consumption growth of the bottom
40 percent (mainly from the northern region) was slower than the consumption growth of the top
60 percent. In addition, inequality was higher in cities possibly because consumption opportunities
are higher for the wealthier urban households. Nonetheless, Uganda faces moderately low
inequality in comparison to other countries in the region.

9.      Poverty is more prevalent in rural than in urban areas. In 2013, the poverty rate was
22.8 percent in rural areas compared to only 9.3 percent in urban areas. This was because income
opportunities are lower in villages than in cities and access to social and infrastructure services are
far more limited in rural areas. Therefore, any strategy to reduce poverty in Uganda will have to
account for the large fraction of the population living in rural areas (84 percent). Hence, poverty
reduction would need to entail productivity gains in agriculture together with better access to
markets, further diversification in the source of income of rural households, and migration toward
urban centers. This also highlights the need for increased urbanization in Uganda which remains
relatively low at about 15 percent in 2013. International experience shows that urbanization,
through agglomeration effects, can boost growth and the initial gains from urbanization are already
evident in Uganda. More than 70 percent of manufacturing activities are conducted in urban areas
while 65 percent of the new formal jobs over the past decade were created in cities and urban
centers. The key constraints to urbanization in Uganda include the policy and legislative
framework, the land tenure system and housing, among others.

10.     The bottom 40 percent live in larger families which erodes their ability to accumulate
assets. At 6.2 children per woman, Uganda has one of the highest fertility rates in the world.
Household size in the bottom 40 percent is estimated at 6 members on average compared to 4.6 in
the top 60 percent. As a result, the dependency ratio is 13 percentage points higher for those living
in the bottom 40 percent. The bottom 40 percent therefore have lesser resources to invest in health
and education which in turn impedes their income earning capacity. This reinforces the need to
reduce fertility rates.

11.     Against this backdrop, a change in economic and social policies is required to prevent
a slowdown in poverty reduction and an increase in vulnerability. Like most countries in the
world, poverty reduction in Uganda will largely be driven by the country’s capacity to grow at a
faster rate in the medium term and to share that growth with the population. Generating more
productive jobs will be at the center of this agenda. The country will either have to raise the
productivity of sectors employing the bulk of the labor force and/or shift the working force to
sectors and locations of higher productivity growth following the example of China or other East
Asian countries, which will eventually increase the elasticity of poverty reduction to GDP growth.
A combination of these two options will be optimal and there is a need to design and implement a
comprehensive growth and development strategy that will reduce poverty sustainably while
addressing vulnerability concerns.

12.     In this context, a comprehensive framework based on the three interrelated blocks of
growth, inclusion, and sustainability has been used to identify the challenges to and
opportunities for ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The first block emphasizes
the development of a competitive and resilient private sector to lead the growth process by
adequately capitalizing on all the available opportunities. The second block, complementary to the
first one, reinforces the need to ensure a fair distribution of the growth dividend across all
Ugandans, especially those living in the north and the east, by providing them with access to social
and infrastructure services so that they can increase their productive capacity and income-
generating opportunities. The third block emphasizes the need to undertake the inclusive growth
process in a fiscally, socially, and environmentally sustainable manner. The analysis includes a
macro-micro interactive approach. On one hand, it assesses macro factors such as the business
environment, macroeconomic policies, public sector effectiveness, and overall institutional
development which affect growth, inclusion, and sustainability. This is fused with an assessment
of factors influencing the productive capacity of households to contribute to the growth process
through the accumulation of assets. The income-generating capacity of individuals depends on
assets such as human, physical, natural, financial, and social capital.

Growth-Poverty Links

13.    Uganda’s poverty story evidences weak links with growth. Notwithstanding its sluggish
contribution to growth, the agriculture sector was the main driver of poverty reduction in the
country. In addition, the amount of poverty reduction achieved in Uganda was moderate given its
high rate of consumption growth over the past two decades. The growth elasticity of poverty
reduction during 2000–10 was 1.09 in Uganda, lower than its Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) counterparts (Kenya, 2.02; Zambia, 1.42; and Ethiopia, 1.39).
However, Uganda scored a far better growth-poverty reduction elasticity compared to its East
African Community (EAC) peers (Rwanda, 0.75 and Tanzania, 0.57).

14.      On the demand side, consumption was the main driver of growth in Uganda and this
is likely to continue given its low level of income. Private investment and consumption responded
favorably to the pro-market reforms and the increase in incomes of the population. Given its low
income level, the high share of consumption in income, and the relatively closed economy, an
increase in income can produce large multiplier effects. As a result, the share of private
consumption in aggregate demand has averaged around 80 percent since 1990. Public consumption
also contributed, although the ratio of public expenditures to GDP decreased slightly from 23
percent in 2002 to 20 percent in 2010. There is room for further growth in consumption as the
country develops. However, for this to happen, sustained growth will be crucial.

15.     On the supply side, the services sector has been driving the economy and this is
unlikely to directly benefit the poor who remain in agriculture and have low levels of
education and skills. The services sector currently accounts for more than half the GDP. Growth
in the sector was primarily led by communication, transport, and financial services, reflecting
higher local demand and technological changes (dominated by the mobile phone revolution).
Growth in these subsectors exceeded 7 percent during the last decade and is likely to continue in
the future. While services-led growth has reduced transaction costs and has raised the demand for
urban goods and services, it has not been a direct source of income for a majority of the population
because they do not have the skills to be employed in high-end services. Poverty analysis shows

                                                 xi 
 
that those who have transitioned to formal wage employment generally have more years of
education. Hence, building human capital by improving public health and education services will
help include more of the poor people in the growth process in the future.

16.     Since 2000, the contribution of total factor productivity (TFP) to growth has declined.
TFP explained about 34 percent of Uganda’s GDP growth during the period 1990 to 2000, and 28
percent over the period from 2001 to 2010, but its contribution to growth was minus 15 percent
during 2011–12. The reforms in the late 1980s resulted in significant growth in TFP during the
1990s, reflecting rebound on account of post-conflict reconstruction and policy reforms, as well
as transformational growth. Since then, TFP growth has slowed down indicating lower returns to
investment, possibly due to suboptimal allocation of resources and limited progress on
competitiveness. The decline in public investment also partly explains the lower overall returns on
investment since it complements private investment.

17.     The informal sector accounted for most of the jobs created in the nonagricultural
sector. The majority of the Ugandan population is still engaged in agriculture but the sector’s
contribution to the GDP has been on a declining trend. The Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS)
estimates that 79 percent of the firms in Uganda are informal. The World Bank’s 2013 Enterprise
Survey, which focuses on the urban sector, also shows that only 63 percent of Ugandan firms
which started their business in the past year were operating in the formal sector, which is low by
regional and international standards. Most of the poor and vulnerable are typically engaged in the
informal sector where they are underpaid, subject to hazardous working conditions, and unable to
improve their skill base. The majority of the informal enterprises are engaged in retail sales but a
large number of them are also in light manufacturing (brick making, charcoal manufacture, and
beverages). Nearly 31 percent of informal sector workers receive pay only in the form of food and
lodging and not cash.

18.     The bulk of jobs created in Uganda are in low-productivity sectors. Agriculture,
commerce, household-based services, and informal manufacturing are among the most common
activities in Uganda, all of them being at the low end of the productivity spectrum. While the jobs
are in general more productive than in subsistence agriculture, they require limited skills. The
average monthly wage is estimated at UGX 85,000 in agriculture and UGX 188,000 for other
services and commerce, most of which are informal activities.

19.     The waning reform dividend calls attention to the main constraints to broad based
growth. Several factors constrain growth in Uganda but a series of analytical studies and surveys
have repeatedly underscored inadequate infrastructure, both electricity and roads as well as water
supply. The electricity situation has improved with the commissioning of the Bujagali hydropower
plant but the cost of electricity remains high and many enterprises complain about the inflated cost
of electricity during peak hours (between 6 p.m. and midnight).1 In addition, power outages or
load shedding is frequent in Uganda. In the road sector, Uganda still suffers from poor transit and
transport infrastructure which has raised the cost of doing business. Being a landlocked country
with underdeveloped rail and inland water infrastructure, the national road networks are the main

    According to the 2013 Enterprise Survey

                                                               xii 
 
conduits to the markets and to consumers. Yet, overloading and inadequate road maintenance has
resulted in the fast deterioration of the roads.

20.     Other critical constraints for firms include access to finance, skills, and business
regulations. The cost of finance is particularly high in Uganda—very few Ugandan firms have a
bank loan/line of credit and the ones who have a loan get it at a high cost and huge collateral
requirements. This is partly because only 20 percent of Uganda’s land is registered and most of
the registered land is mailo (tenure) which is unsuitable as collateral since it cannot be liquidated
by banks as the rights of the landowners overlap with those of the tenants (legally recognized as
lawful or bona fide occupants) who enjoy inheritable and transferrable rights as landlords. With
limited access to formal credit facilities, most start-up capital for firms comes from own savings
or informal credit sources. On skills, although many graduates are not finding jobs, inward
migration of consultants and skilled workers, especially in hi-tech financial services,
telecommunications, and engineering indicates a shortage of specific skills and mismatch between
demand and supply of these skills. Lastly, several business regulations, particularly those
pertaining to taxes, land, buildings, construction permits, and border crossings also constrain firms.

21.    Looking forward, the oil sector, regional integration, information and communication
technologies (ICT) development, and efficient urbanization offer significant opportunities to
raise growth through structural transformation. The oil sector can stimulate growth directly
through increased exports and indirectly through the efficient use of public revenues and the
development of linkages with the local private sector. Regional integration can facilitate access to
markets and thereby boost the movement of goods, people, and capital. ICT developments can
improve firms’ competitiveness and improve the delivery of public services. The urbanization
process can provide new opportunities for job creation and improved living conditions as
experienced elsewhere in the world and in Uganda wherein urban areas have lower poverty and
high consumption levels compared with rural areas. Capitalizing on these opportunities will
require the policymakers to address constraints in several areas including public financial
management (PFM), governance, transport and ICT backbone infrastructure, and underdeveloped
land markets.

22.     However, agriculture will continue to remain relevant in future given its impact on
poverty reduction and backward and forward linkages with other sectors like agro-
processing. The productivity performance of the agricultural sector in Uganda has been rather
modest and the sector has been characterized by low yields and weak value chains and market
linkages. Ugandan farmers can increase their earnings through commercialization and crop and
market diversification. Commercialization in Uganda will require farmers to move away from
subsistence farming through improvements in productivity with the use of modern equipment and
improved quality inputs (fertilizers and seeds), sustainable land and water management to address
environmental concerns, improved skills, and better access to finance. However, progress within
the farms will not be sufficient as linkages with markets also need to be strengthened through better
transport and storage (post-harvest loss is estimated at 40 percent) infrastructure, transparent and
competitive value chains, and consistent government policies (including taxation). Crop and
market diversification is also important as it will help farmers to hedge the risks. A shift toward
high-value vegetables or fruits can also bring additional jobs and foreign exchange.

Asset Accumulation and Inclusion

23.      To ensure that future growth dividends are enjoyed by a majority of the Ugandans,
the government needs to build human and physical capital. So far, Uganda has underinvested
in its asset base, both human and infrastructure related, and this has had a significant impact on
the income-generation capacity of its citizens.2 For Ugandan citizens in general, and more so for
the extreme poor and the vulnerable (an additional 43 percent of the population), access to social
and infrastructure services is severely limited and of questionable quality. This has led to lower
levels of human capital and lesser income-generation possibilities. The Ugandan population aged
above 25 years has an average of 4.7 years of schooling whereas the women in this group have
only 3.8 years of schooling. Currently, there are almost no students belonging to the bottom 40
percent who are enrolled in tertiary education.

24.      Gender disparities are considerable. About 68 percent of children, especially girls, are
dropping out of school to help at home or join other economic activities. While there is gender
parity at the primary level, the percent of girls in total enrollment declined to 47 percent in
secondary education, and 44 percent in tertiary education. The country has one of the highest
fertility rates in the world and lower life expectancy at birth compared with other LICs. Malaria,
maternal and neonatal disorders, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and diarrheal diseases are the main health concerns and
about 40 percent of the population report to have suffered from an illness or accident over the last
30 days.

25.      Households lack the complementary public assets and access to markets to be more
productive. Access to electricity through the grid network in Uganda is estimated at 14 percent
nationally and 7 percent in rural areas, compared to the SSA average of 24 percent. Uganda’s
district and rural roads are in poor condition resulting in poor connectivity to markets and other
services, especially for the poor. And nearly 65 percent of the population has no access to credit
which together with the lack of a comprehensive social safety net, limits the ability of households
to smooth consumption in the face of shocks.

26.     Public spending on education, health, and social protection, is low, even when
compared with other LICs. This has contributed to limited asset accumulation by poorer
individuals which has in turn restricted their chances of moving out of poverty. With limited social
protection and lack of access to credit, vulnerable families have fallen back into poverty in the
event of an adverse shock and the poor have struggled to smooth consumption. In addition,
children have dropped out of school to help at home or in other economic activities while the poor
have not sought health care when needed. These difficulties faced by the poor highlight the need
to increase public spending on social protection, education, disease prevention, and health services
but along with efficiency improvements in the delivery of these public resources.

27.    There are quality concerns across the board in the delivery of public services. These
concerns reflect constraints on accountability arising from the incentive structure as well as
governance challenges that Uganda faces. There are neither sufficient rewards for good
performance nor sanctions for poor performance. This is coupled with a constrained frontline

                                                            
2
    However, Uganda fares better than the SSA average on the human development index.

                                                               xiv 
 
working environment in which there is a lack of textbooks in schools or drugs in health centers.
These constraints together with a low-skilled workforce has resulted in low-quality teaching and
health services. There is a need to improve the quality and relevance of health and education
services by addressing sector-specific challenges. Strengthened voice and accountability, on the
other hand, will raise the demand for better public services.

28.     There is inequity in access to finance and in access to public services, particularly for
the poor living in rural areas and in the north of the country. The poor depend on public
services much more than the rich, who can afford private services, especially in health care and
education. Access to infrastructure services is much more limited in rural areas where most of the
poor live. Access to electricity in Uganda is one of the lowest in the world. Given the difficult
working environment in the north as a result of conflicts and an influx of refugees from
neighboring countries, the quality of public service delivery is much worse in the north and has
resulted in poorer education and health outcomes and lower standards of living. It has also
contributed to intergenerational transmission of poverty. While access to public social and
infrastructure services needs to be improved throughout the country, special focus is needed in the
northern region.

29.    Raising the incomes of the bottom 40 percent in the medium term will require further
accumulation of assets. This will require that the poor get access to quality social services (for
example, education and health) to be provided mainly by the public sector. But, even if the
government had the resources to spend, building human capital takes time and in the meanwhile,
focused interventions in agriculture are needed to raise the incomes of the bottom 40 percent in
the short to medium terms.

30.     In the short to medium-term, a boost in farm incomes will require investments in
infrastructure (rural roads, irrigation, and storage), natural resource management, and
extension services, particularly in the north. The gains from increased agricultural income so
far have largely accrued from an increased area under cultivation, favorable weather, and high
commodity prices. Such gains are generally not sustainable and can easily be reversed. Moreover,
there are limits to further increasing the land under cultivation except in the north. Therefore,
agricultural productivity needs to be raised, which will need higher use of quality inputs, better
storage facilities, improved land tenure security, and increased access to markets and inputs. This
will need a strengthening of the rural and district road network, accelerating systematic land
registration, developing capacity of land dispute resolution institutions, and more effective
extension services to educate farmers on the advantages of using more inputs. In addition, various
measures, including among others, the development of the irrigation infrastructure, improving
agricultural water management, and insurance schemes will help reduce current and future
weather-related risks and will also support agricultural commercialization. In the north and, to a
lesser extent, in the east, where there is considerable scope to increase agricultural production
through area expansion, investments and policy measures are needed to promote rental markets in
communal land by formalizing landowning groups and registering their land.

Progressing Sustainably on the Twin Goals

31.    It will be important to make the growth and inclusion process sustainable to avoid
reversals in the gains made in poverty reduction and shared prosperity and also to make

                                                xv 
 
further progress on them. This will require progress on the twin goals to be fiscally, socially,
and environmentally sustainable. In this context, accumulation of wealth and effective
management of resources will be crucial. In addition, addressing the large infrastructure gaps and
poor social service delivery will require improvements in public sector management, particularly
fiscal management and governance. Similarly, a sustained increase in per capita incomes will be
aided by a reduction in the fertility rate.

32.      Diversified development—in the sense of a more balanced contribution from
institutions, assets, and natural resources—is the best way to sustainably achieve the twin
goals in Uganda. Achieving this contribution requires a strategy articulated around four building
blocks: (a) ensuring that oil revenues are able to ease the financing constraints on critical social
and infrastructure investments which currently face a difficult choice between them; (b)
strengthening of results orientation in the public sector to realize the benefits of existing
institutional reforms; (c) a reconfigured relationship with the private sector, more focused on the
enabling environment in terms of regulatory institutions, market functioning, and infrastructure;
and (d) spatial policies which can calibrate a policy mix matched to the distinctive needs of rural
and urban areas and the foundational market institutions for each, especially regarding land.
        
33.     Making growth sustainable will require accumulation and conservation of wealth.
Uganda’s total wealth is low compared to other countries in SSA. Its total wealth per capita
(excluding oil) at US$7,190 in 2010 represented a growth of over 30 percent during the last decade.
However, this was below most of its peers in East Africa, and well below the largest economies in
SSA.3 In addition, the share of intangible and produced capital in the total capital was relatively
low. Research has shown that across countries, the share of institutional capital tends to be lowest
for oil producers. Uganda cannot afford to enter the oil era with an already low institutional base
and hence there is a need to improve infrastructure, human capital, and institutions.

34.     With the majority of the poor and those in the bottom 40 percent dependent on
agriculture, sustainability of the natural environment is crucial for Uganda. Nearly 46 percent
of the land in Uganda is severely degraded. Land is increasingly being transformed because of
agricultural expansion (conversion to croplands, pastures, and so on), unsustainable agricultural
practices, expansion of urban areas, and other pressures. Average soil erosion is estimated to
exceed 5 tons per hectare per year, and the associated soil nutrient loss is particularly pronounced
because most of the nutrients in tropical agriculture are in the top 5 to 10 centimeters of the soil.
This has significant implications for future agricultural production. In addition, Uganda lost over
40 percent of its forest cover over the past two decades, largely due to fuel wood/charcoal
consumption, clearing for agriculture, and timber for construction. Also, significant
overharvesting, poor fishing methods, and degraded water quality have contributed to the 50
percent decline in the catch of the Nile perch in Lake Victoria since the mid-2000s peak. Given
the importance of the agricultural sector on poverty reduction, improving natural resources
management including land, forests, and water resources will be crucial for Uganda.

 In the absence of oil, Uganda’s total wealth per capita would have risen by only 12 percent in real terms from
2009/10 to 2014/15. If the discovery of oil is taken into account, Uganda’s wealth (measured as the discounted per
capita consumption expenditure over the next 25 years) grew by 26 percent in real terms during the same period.

                                                               xvi 
 
35.      Effective public sector management is not only a sustainability concern but it also
impacts growth and inclusiveness. The key issue in the public sector is the policy implementation
gap which is the result of a lack of enforcement of sanctions (mostly driven by political incentives)
and a lack of capacity. Public institutions in Uganda tend to perform poorly, the acquired capacity
is underutilized, and laws are not fully implemented. Uganda has one of the biggest
implementation gaps in anticorruption legislation in East Africa. According to the World
Governance Indicators, Uganda’s government effectiveness and regulatory quality are on a
declining trend. The voice and accountability environment, which improved between 2003 and
2008, has also deteriorated. Uganda’s capacity to control corruption appears to have reached an
all-time low and is only above that of Kenya’s, East Africa’s worst performer. Transparency
International’s Global Corruption Barometer Survey (2013) found that 61 percent of Ugandans
had paid a bribe to one of the eight institutions (judiciary, education, tax services and customs,
permits/registries, medical services, police, land services, or utilities) in the last 12 months. The
quality of the decentralization framework has worsened since 2005 mainly due to the proliferation
of districts without adequate manpower and budget. This has negatively impacted service delivery.
Uganda’s performance in PFM is good on transparency but weak on budget credibility, controls,
and compliance, essentially highlighting implementation gaps.

36.     Addressing the large infrastructure gaps and poor social service delivery will require
targeted improvements in fiscal management and governance. Uganda ranks 46th out of 71
countries on the Public Investment Management Index (PIMI) of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), with relatively poor scores in project implementation and evaluation. An IMF report (2013)
noted that Uganda’s public investment performance is characterized by poor planning, delayed
procurement, and under execution. The Auditor General’s annual reports regularly identify weak
compliance with PFM regulations, resulting in avoidable or wasteful expenditure, buildup of
arrears, inadequate accountability and, in some cases, the risk of fraud or misappropriation. The
unpredictability in the budget is often due to a lack of internal controls and poor planning. Some
of the most significant risks of wastage, errors, delays, and fraudulent losses are found in payroll
and pensions management. Around 70 percent of public expenditures go through procurement
systems that are affected by poor practices. While there has been a significant improvement in the
quality of audits produced by the Office of the Auditor General (OAG), there is a large backlog of
audit reports that are not debated in the parliament and these reports are not published, creating a
missing step in the accountability cycle. The recent adoption of the PFM Act was a big step toward
alleviating some of these concerns as it introduced a contingencies fund to finance unforeseen, but
urgent and unavoidable expenditures without destabilizing other components of the budget. In
addition, the government is committed to rolling out the Integrated Payroll and Pension System
(IPPS), introducing biometric payroll records for civil servants, and decentralization of the payroll
to improve accountability.

37.     Sound oil revenue management will be critical to leverage the benefits of extractives
while minimizing associated risks. Since mismanaged natural resources can have devastating
consequences, well-performing PFM systems and governance structures will be paramount to
mitigate these risks. The country is also challenged by a lack of sanctions against corruption,
ineffective accountability, and weak local institutions, among others. It is well-documented that
natural resource-rich countries risk experiencing retarded growth and development because of the
Dutch disease and other related consequences of the natural resource curse, if oil revenue is not
managed properly. Uganda therefore needs to address its governance and PFM institutional

                                                xvii 
 
capacities including public administration to sustainably benefit from the underground resource,
which entails a huge potential for its future growth and development.

38.     In the Ugandan context, social cohesion is also a crucial element of sustainability. The
significant differences in the standard of living of residents in different parts of the country, the
influx of refugees from nearby countries, and a growing labor force or the youth bulge with
insufficient jobs, can result in social instability. Systematic exclusion of certain groups from the
growth process can exacerbate the divide within the population and this is particularly true for the
Ugandans living in the north of the country who have a much lower standard of living, on average,
than those in the other parts of the country. These differences highlight the need to focus public
resources in the north, improve the linkage between skills development and labor market
requirements, and promote job creation initiatives for the youth.

39.      The high fertility rate has stretched the limited resource base of households and the
government and has lowered asset accumulation by the citizens. A sustainable improvement
in the standard of living of Ugandan citizens is unlikely with the existing fertility rate. The key to
reducing fertility is to promote programs which combine education and vocational training for
women together with training on family planning and health. In addition, it is also important for
men to be a part of the training on family planning. However, it is also important to recognize that
fertility preferences are rooted in social and cultural values and usually take time to reduce
perceptibly.

Prioritizing among Constraints

40.     Achieving the twin goals in a sustainable manner will be a tall order for Uganda but
business-as-usual is not an option either. There are several binding constraints facing a poor,
and landlocked country that has a deficit of infrastructure, low educational attainment, a high
disease burden, and weak institutions. These constraints coupled with a limited resource base make
it imperative for the government to prioritize its interventions. The prioritization of constraints in
this SCD are primarily based on their impact on the twin goals of reducing poverty and boosting
shared prosperity.

41.     The prioritization process included a review of the evidence, consultations with
stakeholders in Uganda, and team discussions. The starting point for the prioritization process
was the evidence and analysis presented in this report. This was used to identify the key challenges
in the growth, inclusion, and sustainability domains. A first round of consultations was held with
the government, academia, civil society organizations (CSOs), and the private sector on the main
constraints and opportunities facing Uganda. The team then used informed judgment to prioritize
the constraints. A second round of consultations was also held with the stakeholders during which
most of the identified constraints were reinforced. The priorities reflected in the SCD represent the
collective judgment of the team which has significant institutional memory on Uganda and the
process is more an art than science. These priorities are also reinforced by the existing evidence
base and analytical studies.

42.     The prioritization process resulted in the identification of eight priority areas which
are summarized below. These priorities are based on their linkages with the poverty reduction
story and the need to ensure continued progress on the twin goals in the future (table 1)

                                            INTRODUCTION

                 A.    PROGRESS SO FAR IS THE FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE

1.1.    After a destructive civil war and extreme political instability, Uganda began its
reconstruction process in 1987. Significant progress has been recorded since then. Uganda’s
output expansion during 1987–2010, at 6.9 percent a year, was one of the highest among African
countries. The sustained growth performance was the result of macroeconomic stability, post-
conflict rebound, and pro-market reforms which transformed Uganda from a failed state to one of
the fastest growing economies in the world. Growth in per capita GDP was however lower at 3.6
percent per year because of the high fertility rate.

1.2.    Concurrently, Uganda has made progress on some dimensions of welfare. The primary
education net enrollment rate had increased to 82 percent by 2013, from 67 percent in 1995. During
the same period, the share of underweight children under the age of five reduced from 25.5 percent
to 13.8 percent while mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people increased from 0 to 44. These
achievements are substantial and represent a success story in the African context.

1.3.    However, today, Uganda remains one of the poorest countries in the world. With GNI
per capita at US$660 in 2014, Uganda ranks below the LICs’ average of US$709. The proportion
of the population living under the national poverty line stood at 19.7 percent in 2013 while those
under the international poverty line of US$1.25 per day (2005 PPP) stood at 30.6 percent. Using
the recently released international poverty line of US$1.90 per day (2011 PPP), poverty incidence
declined to 33.2 percent from 68.1 percent during 1993–2013. Annual consumption growth of the
bottom 40 percent has averaged around 3 percent over the 20-year period from 1993 to 2013,
which is higher than most countries in the region. However, in relative terms, consumption growth
of the bottom 40 percent was slower than the consumption growth of the top 60 percent and
inequality, as measured by the Gini index, increased from 0.36 in 1993 to 0.40 in 2013. In addition,
vulnerability to poverty in Uganda is high. Around 43 percent of Ugandans are insecure non-poor,
defined as those living above the national poverty line but living on less than twice the poverty
line. Between 2005 and 2009, for every three Ugandans who were lifted out of poverty, two fell
back into poverty, due to shocks, particularly adverse weather, illustrating the fragility of the gains
realized by the poorest households.

1.4.    After two decades of strong growth, the expansion of the Ugandan economy has
slowed down in recent years. Economic growth decelerated from an average of about 6.9 percent
a year during FY1987–2010 to 5.5 percent from FY2011–2014. Uganda’s recent growth
performance has been lower than the average of LICs, in sharp contrast to its relative performance
in the earlier periods. This recent decline is partly related to the more volatile external environment
and partly to domestic policy slippages. It is also attributable to the waning growth dividend from
the economic reforms of the 1990s and the criticality of certain constraints like poor infrastructure.

1.5.   Looking forward, the on-streaming of oil production can have a far-reaching impact
on the economy. If managed well, oil has the potential to substantially raise government revenues,
increase exports, create forward and backward linkages, and result in impressive growth rates.
However, it will provide limited employment opportunities given the capital intensive nature of

the hydrocarbon industry. Hence, the role of the government will be crucial to manage resource
revenues efficiently and to support the development of synergies with domestic industries. Sound
oil revenue management stands on the two pillars of good governance and strong PFM.
Governance, through the establishment of strong institutions and effective accountability
mechanisms will be of particular importance because resource rents create perverse incentives for
the elites to appropriate them. Strong public expenditure policy and management is important for
every country but it assumes a more crucial role in resource-rich countries because resource
revenues accrue to the government in the first instance and get transmitted to the economy through
the level, timing, and composition of public expenditure.

1.6.    Beyond oil, Uganda’s other assets will require investment. With nearly half of its
population under the age of 15 years, Uganda has one of the youngest and most rapidly growing
populations in the world. This youth bulge requires investments in education and generation of
more productive jobs to bring them into the mainstream of society and reduce the risk of social
instability, but Uganda currently ranks 164 out of 185 countries in its human development index.
Uganda can also capitalize on its tourism potential and increase mineral exports but this requires
further investment in supporting infrastructure and skills. Uganda’s infrastructure investment
needs are estimated at US$21 billion over the next 10 years, more than 75 percent of 2014 GDP.

1.7.    Many of the development challenges facing Uganda are well-understood by
policymakers but little progress has been made in addressing them. With good data
availability (annex 5) and several analytical studies, Uganda’s progress over the years has been
well-documented. The main challenges facing the country include poor infrastructure, weak public
service delivery, low levels of human capital, and underdeveloped institutions. These aspects,
along with a host of other constraints facing Uganda are reflected in the government’s National
Development Plan and Vision 2040. The challenge is therefore, to address those constraints
through a set of coordinated actions and to close the gap in implementation of policies. Hence,
what is really needed in Uganda is ‘how to do it’ rather than ‘what to do’. The key factor affecting
the ‘how to’ is the political economy climate in Uganda, which manifests itself in public policy
and public sector performance.

1.8.     The political context in the country provides both opportunities and challenges. The
longevity of the ruling party, which has been at the helm for 29 years has provided a sense of
stability and direction to economic reforms. However, there have been relatively weak
improvements in governance implementation. The new National Development Plan (NDP)
provides an opportunity to consolidate reform initiatives and reap the benefits of ramped-up
infrastructure investment and decentralization.

         B.   A FRAMEWORK TO ASSESS AND PREPARE FOR A CHALLENGING FUTURE

1.9.    In this context, a comprehensive framework based on the three interrelated blocks of
growth, inclusion, and sustainability has been used to identify the challenges to and
opportunities for ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The first block emphasizes
the development of a competitive and resilient private sector to lead the growth process by
adequately capitalizing on all the available opportunities. The second block, complementary to the
first one, reinforces the need to ensure a fair distribution of the growth dividend across all
Ugandans, especially those living in the north and the east, by providing them with access to social

                                                 2 
 
and infrastructure services so that they can increase their productive capacity and income-
generating opportunities. The third block emphasizes the need to undertake the inclusive growth
process in a fiscally, socially, and environmentally sustainable manner.

1.10. The analysis includes a macro-micro interactive approach. On one hand, it assesses
macro factors such as the business environment, macroeconomic policies, public sector
effectiveness, and overall institutional development which affect growth, inclusion, and
sustainability. This is fused with an assessment of factors influencing the productive capacity of
households to contribute to the growth process through the accumulation of assets. The income-
generating capacity of individuals depends on assets like human, physical, natural, financial, and
social capital.

                      C.   OBJECTIVES AND STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT

1.11. This SCD identifies the constraints to and opportunities for reducing extreme poverty
and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The analysis is evidence based and
largely draws on existing analytical work done by the Bank and other stakeholders. It will form
the analytic foundation for the Country Partnership Framework of the World Bank Group. This
report draws significantly from the forthcoming Poverty Assessment in Uganda. It was also
informed by consultations with the government, civil society, academicians, private sector, and
the international donors. These consultations were held both in Kampala and in several regions
(annex 2). The SCD advisory committee, a group of experts from the government, private sector,
and civil society, also provided useful inputs.

1.12. This SCD is organized as follows. Chapter 2 presents the profile of the poor, Uganda’s
performance on the twin goals, and the factors influencing this performance. Chapter 3 discusses
the country’s growth dynamics in the past and the potential drivers for future growth. Chapter 4
presents the inclusion story and provides details of the use and accumulation of assets by
individuals and households and the opportunities to enhance inclusion. Chapter 5 discusses the
concerns on sustainability and risks, while Chapter 6 presents the priorities and the process of
prioritization.

        A.         OVERVIEW: POVERTY, SHARED PROSPERITY, VULNERABILITY, AND INEQUALITY

Uganda has been successful in reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity but vulnerability
to poverty is high and inequality has persisted.

30.6 percent in 2013 (table 2.1). This declining trend is confirmed when using the recently released
international poverty line of US$1.90 a day (2011 PPP) as poverty incidence declined to 33.2
percent from 68.1 percent over the same period. Over the last ten years, Uganda reduced the
proportion of the population living under US$1.25 per day faster than any other country in SSA.
The poverty gap has also fallen consistently during this period from 22 percent in 2003 to 12
percent in 2013.6 However, the poverty gap also indicates that Uganda is still a poor country and
that it will take an average payment of US$54.75 per capita per year to eliminate extreme poverty
in Uganda.

2.2.   On several other dimensions of well-being, progress has been slow. The government
estimates that 61.4 percent of the population was still food insecure or poor in 2013. While primary
school gross enrollment is near universal, many students do not complete primary school and

  This is calculated by converting the region-specific national poverty lines to U.S. dollar PPP 2005 and dividing by
the average ratio of adult equivalents to individuals (given the national poverty line is a per adult equivalent line).
5
  The national poverty line ranges from US$0.88 to US$1.04 PPP 2005 per capita depending on the region. Poverty
in Uganda is calculated using a cost of basic needs approach. Consumption expenditure data is collected on food and
non-food items through the UNHS conducted every 3–4 years. The poverty line was set in 1993 by calculating the
cost of consuming 3,000 calories per adult equivalent and then adding an amount (the amount depending on the region)
to capture non-food expenditures. The poverty line has only been updated for the cost of inflation since then and is
low by international standards.
6
  Poverty gap is the mean shortfall from the poverty line expressed as a percent of the poverty line. This measure
reflects the depth of poverty as well as its incidence. The indicator is often described as the per capita amount of
resources needed to eliminate poverty or reduce the poor’s shortfall from the poverty line to zero, through perfectly
targeted cash transfers.

                                                               4
 
secondary enrollment remains low.7 Life expectancy is only 51 years and the fertility rate is one
of the highest in the world. It has only recently declined to 6.2 children per woman in 2013 from
6.7 in 2010.

2.3.    The amount of poverty reduction achieved in Uganda was moderate given its high
rate of consumption growth over the past two decades. The growth elasticity of poverty
reduction during 2000–10 was 1.09 which compares well with the SSA average (figure 2.1), but
is much lower than the global average of 2.02 in developing countries. Uganda’s performance can
largely be explained by its rapid and sustained economic growth but the fruits of this expansion
have not been fully shared with the poorest segments of the population, at least not in the
magnitude observed in countries such as its East African neighbors (Ethiopia, and Kenya) and
Vietnam in Asia.

2.4.    Prosperity was shared with the poorest segments of the population but inequality
increased from 1993. Annual consumption growth of the bottom 40 percent averaged
around 3 percent during 1993–2013 which was higher than most countries in the region. However,
consumption growth of the bottom 40 percent was slower than the consumption growth of the top
60 percent (figure 2.2) and inequality, as measured by the Gini index, increased from 0.36 in 1993
to 0.40 in 2013.8 Although inequality was higher in 2013 than in 1993, it has declined since 2010
because incomes of the richest decile grew slower than the incomes of the poorest and the middle-
income households. Figure 2.3 shows that Uganda faces moderately low inequality in comparison
to other countries in the region, while figure 2.4 captures the inequality trend over the past two
decades, including in rural and urban areas. Inequality was higher in cities possibly because
consumption opportunities are higher for the wealthier urban households and social redistribution
mechanisms are less vibrant than in rural areas. Sustained conflict in the north, which has put the

  In 2012/13 the primary education net enrollment ratio was estimated at 82 and the secondary net enrollment ratio

  It is worth noting that on average, the top 20th percentile was actually the main beneficiary of consumption growth
over the period 1993–2003.

in the incomes of the poor.

countries (including the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan), to unexpected health
issues, when the key breadwinner falls sick, and to natural disasters. A large proportion of the labor
force remains dependent on subsistence agriculture, which in turn is highly vulnerable to climatic
conditions, crop disease, and price fluctuations. Droughts are commonplace in the northeast and
floods have caused crop losses in the eastern region. Commercial commodities, such as coffee and
tea, are sensitive to fluctuations in international prices. Maize and matooke (important cash crops

     B.                          POVERTY PROFILE: WHO ARE THE POOR AND THE BOTTOM 40 PERCENT IN UGANDA?

The poor in Uganda, live in rural areas, mostly in the northern and eastern regions, have large
families, own few assets, and derive their income predominantly from farming.

2.6.    Most of the poor in Uganda live in rural areas. Nearly 84 percent of the population and
90 percent of the poor lived in rural areas in 2013. One in four rural Ugandans lives in poverty
compared to just one in ten urban Ugandans. These statistics reveal that poverty is more prevalent
in rural than in urban areas (22.8 percent in rural areas vs. 9.3 percent in urban areas in 2013)
because income opportunities are lower in villages than in cities and access to social and
infrastructure services are far more limited in rural areas. Therefore, any strategy to reduce poverty
in Uganda will have to account for the large fraction of the population living in rural areas. Hence,
poverty reduction will need to entail productivity gains in agriculture together with better access
to markets, further diversification in the source of income of rural households, and migration
toward urban centers.

2.7.    There are large and increasing regional variations in poverty with most of the poor
concentrated in the north and the east. In 2006, approximately 60 percent of the poor lived
in the northern and eastern parts of the country. Seven years later, this proportion increased
to 84 percent (figure 2.6).10 Progress, as captured by consumption levels, has been much faster in
the western and southern regions, which benefited from the economic boom in Kampala and the
surge in regional trade with Kenya and the global markets. Therefore, a focus on the northern and

eastern regions will be needed for Uganda to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity as
well as to reduce social and political tensions that can emerge from stark differences across regions
(box 2.1).

    Box 2.1. Spatial Dimensions of Poverty
    Households in Uganda’s northern, eastern, and western regions have much lower levels of human capital, fewer
    assets, and more limited access to infrastructure than households in the central region. The northern region is the
    worst, largely because the conflict took lives, damaged communities, destroyed assets, and had lasting effects on
    the aspirations of many individuals. Households in the north are larger and more likely to be headed by a woman
    and are also more likely to have a household head with no education (table 2.2). Most households own land but
    they are less likely to own other assets and have lower access to infrastructure services. The eastern region also
    lags behind the central and western region in nearly all of these measures.

         Note: Health issues are discussed in detail in chapter 4.
    Households in the northern region also have more limited access to markets and services. For households in these
    regions, distances to schools and health services are much larger as are distances to markets. The provision of
    agricultural extension and veterinary services is much lower and this is of concern given the reliance of these
    households on agriculture and livestock income. Rural financial institutions are almost entirely absent in the north.
    These constraints have limited the accumulation of human capital and the extent to which households can use their
    assets to earn a return in these regions.
    Household income among the bottom 40 percent is low in the eastern and northern regions and heavily reliant on
    food crops and livestock farming. Livestock income comprises 39 percent of the agricultural income of the bottom
    40 percent that live in the north. In addition, rainfall is lower and more volatile in the north increasing the
    vulnerability of households in this region, while households in the east are particularly vulnerable to the collapse
    of maize prices (annex 1).

2.8.    Those in the bottom 40 percent live in larger families and have more dependents than
the top 60 percent. Households in the bottom 40 percent have six members on average compared
to 4.6 in the top 60 percent. As a result, the dependency ratio is 13 percentage points higher for
those living in the bottom 40 percent. This gap between the bottom 40 percent and top 60 percent
has remained constant between 2006 and 2013 (table 2.3). In addition, the proportion of
households headed by women has increased slightly during this period but this has happened for
households across all income groups.

 2.9.    Ugandan households have a higher level of education than in the past, but it remains
 low, particularly among poorer households. Uganda has been able to increase its stock of human
 capital faster than the average in SSA since 2000. However, it mostly represents a catch up from
 a low initial level. Indeed, many working-age adults still have low levels of education—only 23.8
 percent of household heads had higher than primary education. Within the bottom 40 percent of
 the population, this is only 11 percent.

 2.10.   Access to infrastructure services, particularly for the poor, remains low even by
 regional standards. By 2013, more households owned land, mobile phones, and motorcycles, and
 also accessed electricity and piped water, compared with 2006 (figure 2.8). However, these levels
 of access remain relatively low by international and even regional standards, with only 12.4
 percent and 6.8 percent of households having access to electricity and piped water, respectively,
 in 2013. In addition, there are large variations in asset ownership and access to infrastructure
 services between the rich and the poor. Mobile phone ownership is only 37 percent among the
 bottom 40 percent compared with 70 percent among the top 60. Almost no households in the
 bottom 40 percent have access to electricity or piped water, compared with 20 percent and 10
 percent, respectively, in the top 60 (table 2.4). Interestingly, more poor households report to own
 land reflecting the predominance of farming as their prime occupation.

2.11.   Poorer households are more likely to report farming as their primary occupation.
More than half of the households in the bottom 40 percent (53 percent) depend on agricultural
production as their main source of income compared with 39 percent of those in the top 60. Wage
employment and ownership of a nonfarm business is higher among the top 60 percent than among
the bottom 40 percent (table 2.4). In addition, although crop income is becoming less important
over time it is still the main source of income for most households at the bottom of the consumption
distribution, with richer households reporting higher levels of wage employment income and
income from nonfarm household enterprises (figure 2.9).

              C.   DETERMINANTS OF THE PERFORMANCE ON THE TWIN GOALS

Uganda’s performance on the twin goals is largely explained by the expansion of agriculture,
fluctuations in agricultural prices and weather, and, increasingly, nonfarm activities, which has
been the main source of job creation in recent years. Improvements in infrastructure, health, and
education also contributed to poverty alleviation.

2.12.   The sustained period of high growth in Uganda during 1987–2010, averaging 6.9
percent a year, reached the poor largely through increases in agricultural incomes and also
through increases in nonfarm incomes. Real agricultural incomes per capita grew by 4.7 percent
between 2006 and 2012, behind the growth of 6.3 percent in nonagricultural incomes. Agricultural
income increases were more strongly associated with increased consumption and reduced poverty,
but those who increased their nonagricultural income also increased their consumption and moved
out of poverty.

        Impact of Agriculture on the Twin Goals

2.13.  Although      limited    agricultural        Table 2.5. Agricultural GDP Growth Rates for

regional economies (table 2.5).

2.14.   Growth in agricultural incomes has resulted in increased welfare, particularly among
the poorest who derive more income from agriculture than other households. Kaminski and
Christiaensen (2014) calculate that agricultural income growth contributed to 18 percent of the
consumption growth from 2006 to 2010. Subsistence farming is the main source of income for
52.6 percent of the bottom 40 percent and for 51 percent of households living below the national
poverty line. The impact of agricultural growth on consumption is stronger for the poorest.
Analysis undertaken as part of the Uganda Poverty Assessment finds that the impact of crop
income growth is 1.5 times higher for households in the bottom 40 percent than for the average
household and the impact of livestock income growth is 1.2 times higher for households in the
bottom 40 percent.

2.15.   As a result, over half of the poverty reduction that Uganda experienced since 2006
occurred among households that were primarily active in agriculture. Poverty reduction
among households primarily engaged in agriculture accounted for 0.9 of the 1.7 annual percentage
point reduction in poverty from 2006 to 2010 and 1.3 of the 1.7 annual percentage point reduction

in poverty from 2010 to 2013 (figure 2.10).11 The relatively high elasticity of poverty to changes
in agricultural GDP is also consistent with findings from macro simulations using Uganda’s Social
Accounting Matrix (Dorosh and Thurlow, 2012; Government of Uganda, 2014).

2.16.   Agricultural income growth was driven by an increase in the area under cultivation,
good weather, and high prices. Improved access to markets in neighboring countries also
played a role. The increase in aggregate crop production came largely from the expansion of the
area under cultivation and marginally because of an increase in the use of modern production
technologies. In addition, the overall policy environment was also beneficial and was characterized
by macroeconomic stability, post-conflict rebound, and pro-market reforms. However, analysis
undertaken as part of the Uganda Poverty Assessment shows that key drivers of crop income
changes were favorable weather and high prices for agricultural commodities in domestic
(matooke) and regional (maize) markets (table 2.6) which in turn had an impact on consumption,
particularly for the bottom 40 percent. Improvements in access to markets and extension services
also seem to have helped.

savings (30 percent), to ask for help from family members (25 percent), reduce consumption
(11percent) or take nonfarm work (9 percent). Only 5 percent report receiving support from the
government (Nikoloski, Christiaensen, and Hill 2015). Floods have however had a limited impact
on poverty as they do not affect too many households.

        Other Determinants of the Twin Goals

2.18.   Growth in nonfarm self-employment and, to a lesser extent, wage employment, also
raised incomes of the bottom 40 percent. The bottom of the consumption distribution has largely
transitioned into self-employment to supplement their incomes while those who have transitioned
to wage employment have generally had higher levels of education. The distinguishing feature of
households in the bottom 40 percent that were able to transition into wage employment was their
level of education. In addition, own-savings has enabled self-employment income growth among
the bottom 40 percent. However, women, are generally in lower-earning self-employment
activities and are 8 percent less likely to experience self-employment income growth. During
2006–10, poverty reduction among those in wage employment and nonfarm self-employment
accounted for 30 percent of the poverty reduction in Uganda and contributed to 66 percent of
consumption growth experienced during this time (Christiaensen and Kaminski 2014).
These contributions are relatively high compared to other developing countries. In Rwanda, from
2003–11, increases in nonfarm income sources contributed to 15 percent of the poverty
reduction and in Cambodia from 2004 to 2011 increases in nonfarm income sources contributed
to 23 percent of the poverty reduction.

2.19.  Migration, within rural areas also brought about substantial growth in consumption.
Poverty reduction was twice as fast for those who moved out of their village between 2005 and
2009 than for those who stayed (4 percentage points rather than 2 percentage points) even though
migrants were just as likely to be poor as non-migrants before they moved. On average, those who
migrated saw a 7 percent increase in consumption (controlling for selection bias as much as
possible), but those who migrated from rural to urban areas saw a 37.5 percent increase in
consumption. However, despite the larger impact on consumption, the impact of rural to urban

                                                 15
 
migration on poverty was smaller as those who migrated from rural to urban areas were less poor
to begin with.

2.20.  Education, smaller household size and improved infrastructure access has aided
poverty reduction. Low levels of education and limited access to infrastructure are both
determinants and consequences of poverty. So, quantifying the impact of this improvement on
poverty reduction is difficult. However, a panel data analysis shows that improvements in access
to markets as a result of infrastructure investments, reductions in household size, and increased
education contributed to improving household income and consumption in Uganda, thereby
reducing poverty. A reduction in the distance to the nearest input market by 1 km increased crop
income by 1 percent while household heads with a completed primary education earned 10 percent
more than those with incomplete primary education.

2.21.   However, fiscal redistribution through social protection did not reduce poverty as
there is no comprehensive safety net program in Uganda. This is in stark contrast to some other
countries in the continent such as Botswana, South Africa, and Ethiopia. About 0.4 percent of GDP
(excluding contributory social security) is given in direct transfers in Uganda, one of the
lowest in the region. Only 5 percent of the working population are covered by a pension scheme
and only 4.5 percent of the total population receive any kind of direct income support, while the
coverage of social care and support services is still lower. Informal transfers are present, but do
not comprise a large share of income. As many as 47 percent of households reported taking a loan
from family and friends in 2013, one of the highest rates in the world. Informal transfers (including
remittances) and formal transfers together comprise a small share of the income of the poor. Those
living below the national poverty line receive only 6 percent of their income in transfers of any
kind. As a result, growth in incomes and changes in the shape of the income distribution are almost
entirely driven by the nature of growth and shocks experienced by Ugandan households.

                                                               D.   LOOKING AHEAD

Addressing regional inequality, generating productivity gains in agriculture to raise incomes of
farmers, facilitating the transition to nonfarm employment, and developing social protection
programs will be key to achieving the twin goals.

2.22.   Like most countries in the world, poverty reduction in Uganda will largely be driven
by the country’s capacity to grow at a faster rate in the medium term and to share that
growth with the population. If the GDP growth rate averages around 7 percent over the next
decade and assuming the same historical elasticity between GDP growth and poverty reduction,
by 2025, the level of poverty will reduce to approximately 6.6 percent based on the national
poverty line and 7.1 percent based on the international poverty line.12 However, this will require
the government to reach those sections of the population which have so far not benefited from the
growth process and might require targeted interventions. In other words, business as usual might
not result in the same poverty-growth elasticity and will therefore, require the authorities to find
new ways to address this challenge. There are two options: either the country could grow faster
than its historical rates, following the example of China or other East Asian countries; or it can

                                                                       16
 
attempt to increase the elasticity of poverty reduction to GDP growth. Of course, a combination of
these two options will be optimal.

2.23.   Given the preponderance of poor households in the north and the east, a regional
focus will be necessary to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of the bottom 40
percent. There are stark regional differences in poverty rates, asset levels, and access to
infrastructure services and markets, as well as in livelihoods (figure 2.6). Efforts at raising incomes
and consumption levels will need to be particularly focused on the northern and eastern parts of
the country. The current growth pattern, led by the urban services sector, is likely to widen
regional disparities making it hard for Uganda to boost shared prosperity and end extreme poverty.
Growth in the services sector is projected to be high and this will benefit few in the north
where only 31 percent of household income is derived from nonagricultural activities (compared
to 65 percent in the central region).

2.24.   Addressing vulnerability will require more sustained income growth which will need
concerted efforts to raise agricultural productivity and generate high quality nonfarm jobs
together with investment in human and physical capital. Poverty in Uganda is rural and
transformation of the employment structure will take time because urbanization is still in its
incipient stage with only 15 percent of the population living in cities. Hence, increasing
agricultural incomes will continue to be crucial. At the same time, creation of jobs in cities will be
important to absorb the large incoming labor force and to enable rural-urban migration. Past data
shows that education was a determining factor among those in the bottom 40 percent who managed
to successfully migrate out of farm income. Hence, accumulation and more effective use of assets
at the micro level will be important, which will require improvements in public services. Savings
have also helped households migrate and transition into new forms of self-employment.

2.25.   Managing fertility will also be crucial to reduce poverty. The high fertility rate has
resulted in high dependency ratios and has increased the resource requirements for households and
the government. There is a clear relationship between a large family size and high incidence of
poverty because lesser financial resources are available for each member of the family and there
is a lower possibility for them to save and invest in human capital. The fast growing and young
labor force has also put pressure on the job market and has reduced wages and made it more
difficult to secure a good and stable employment.

2.26.   Increasing social protection and improving financial inclusion will help build and
protect the assets of the poor and shield them from income shocks. Some of the poorest
households in Uganda are unable to participate in the growth process as a result of their limited
asset base which inhibits their income-generating capacity. Investment in the asset base of the poor
can potentially be achieved through a robust social protection system. Many of the poor households
face a variety of shocks but only 5 percent of households report receiving government assistance
in a time of need and many households in the bottom 40 percent also do not have access to credit
or family networks for support. This is a gap that a well-designed social protection system can fill.
Improving financial inclusion by improving access to savings and credit instruments can also help
the poorest to smooth consumption.

                       ASSESSING THE DRIVERS OF GROWTH IN UGANDA

                         A.     UGANDA’S GROWTH PERFORMANCE AND DRIVERS

Uganda’s growth performance during 1987–2010 was associated with rapid expansion of the
public sector; private consumption and private investment in services sectors as a result of
macroeconomic stability; post-conflict rebound; and pro-market reforms. Since 2010, the growth
rate has slowed down because of suboptimal fiscal management, slower pace of reforms, and a
series of exogenous shocks.

3.1.   Uganda’s growth story since 1987 can be divided into two periods. The period from
1987 to 2010 during which Uganda experienced its strongest economic growth and the period post
2010 (2011–14) which was characterized by a slowdown in growth. The period before 1987
(1970–86) was characterized by political instability and civil war.

3.2.     During 1987 to 2010, Uganda Figure 3.1. Uganda’s GDP Per Capita Growth

sequenced package of structural reform
policies and investments designed to free up markets and create price incentives, stimulate private
investment, and encourage competition. Marketing boards were abolished and the financial sector
was liberalized, together with an ambitious privatization program for banks and public enterprises,
including those in telecommunications and electricity. As a result, there were substantial aid
inflows which helped finance public expenditures, thereby, improving social and infrastructure
service delivery. Consumption increased, fueled by economic opportunities and the rebound in the
economy. Private investment increased from 8.1 percent of GDP in FY1993 to 18.3 percent in
FY2011. During the same period, exports grew from 5.7 percent of GDP to 15.4 percent. Per capita
GDP grew at a more modest pace of 3.6 percent per year during 1987–2010, essentially because
of the fast growing population escalated by the high fertility rate in Uganda.

3.3.    With the growth dividend from the first spurt of reforms waning and in the face of
domestic and external shocks, economic expansion in Uganda decelerated from an average
of 6.9 percent a year during FY1987–2010 to 5.5 percent from FY2011–14. Uganda’s recent
growth performance has been lower than the average of LICs, in sharp contrast to its relative

performance in the earlier periods (table 3.1).13 This recent decline is partly related to the more
volatile external environment and partly to domestic policy slippages. While the economy was
insulated from the direct effects of the 2008/09 global financial crisis, there were significant
secondary effects in subsequent years on Uganda’s exports and private capital inflows. The
recurrent political crisis in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo has also negatively
affected many Ugandan households, particularly, those living in districts such as Kitgum, Masindi,
Lira, Buliisa, Arua, and Gulu, which are close to the border of these countries. Also, the
performance of the agricultural sector suffered from inconsistent weather, in particular, the severe
drought in FY2011. In addition, the first (and arguably easier) round of policies has already been
implemented, but the momentum has been somewhat lost as reflected by the deterioration in the
Doing Business and governance indicators in recent years. As a result, the overall private
investment rate declined from 18.3 percent of GDP in 2010/11 to 16.5 percent in 2013/14.

percent in FY2013—the lowest rate achieved in
the last three decades—largely because of the required fiscal adjustment to restore macroeconomic
stability and as a result of the aid suspension. The economy rebounded in FY2014 to 4.5 percent
because of improved terms of trade and good climatic conditions.

3.5.    Monetary policy has become more complex in Uganda, with structural changes in the
domestic financial sector and the rapid expansion of mobile money. The Central Bank has
historically relied on targeting monetary aggregates to control inflation. While this served the
purpose well, the underlying relationship between base money, broader monetary aggregates, and
inflation had weakened and the money multiplier had become very unstable following the
structural transformation of the economy and developments in the financial sector over the past
two decades. For example, with the introduction of mobile banking in 2009/10, the demand for

   Uganda’s growth performance over 2011–13 remained, however, higher than the average of the least developed
countries in SSA.

   Several factors were used in the selection of peer comparators. These include the level of income, regional peers,
fertility management, agriculture development, resource endowment, and fragility.

   Public expenditure as a share of GDP increased from 16.7 percent in 2008/9 to an average of 19.7 percent over the
next two financial years (2009/10 and 2010/11).
16
   For instance, the government reduced public expenditures from 19.1 percent of GDP in 2010/11 to 15.6 percent in
2011/12. Meanwhile, the average lending rate increased to 24.8 percent in 2011/12 from 19.8 percent a year earlier
as a result of a tighter monetary policy.
17
   While the fiscal deficit increased from 3 percent of GDP to 4.1 percent between 2011/12 and 2013/14, the average
inflation rate declined from 24.6 percent in 2011/12 to 5.2 percent in 2013/14.

                                                               19
 
    money had increased by 74 percent by 2013/14 while the velocity of money doubled from 0.2 in
    2008/09 to 0.4 in 2013/14. In response to these changes, Uganda adopted an inflation-targeting-
    lite-monetary-policy framework in July 2011, moving to using short-term interest rates to signal
    the monetary policy stance. Since the huge inflationary pressures observed in 2011, the Central
    Bank has followed a somewhat restrictive policy stance, which together with declining food and
    energy prices, reduced inflation from 30.5 per cent in October 2011 to less than 5 percent in the
    first quarter of 2015. The Central Bank has influenced the bank lending rates only marginally,
    given that they are stickier than deposit rates. The persistent high margin between deposits and
    lending rates is partly due to limited competition among banks in the domestic market and high
    fixed costs associated with lending activities.

private investment and lately by public investment, and the gradual urbanization process. Some
growth in manufacturing, particularly agro-processing, has also contributed to industrial growth.
Finally, the contribution of the agricultural sector to GDP has declined over time as this sector has
grown at a slower rate than the overall economy (figure 3.2).

3.8.    The contribution of the external sector to GDP growth has been rather limited. Net
exports has been a drag on growth, primarily because of a narrow export base (partly because of
the country being landlocked) and the need to import a large proportion of inputs that are not
available in the country. In addition, a low domestic savings rate (12–13 percent of GDP) results
in high dependence on foreign savings which are typically associated with increased imports.
However, export diversification has increased over time with a decline in the share of the top 5
exported products from about 97 percent in the early 1980s to 55 percent in 2010–12. After nearly
three decades, coffee and cotton still account for 39 percent of Uganda’s export earnings.

the relentless constraints in the investment environment and the limited progress on
competitiveness. The decline in public investment also partly explains the lower overall returns on
investment since it complements private investment. A comparison of Uganda with its comparators
including Cambodia, Ethiopia, and Zambia suggests that Uganda needs to leverage its productivity
gain which explains most of the growth differential with its comparators (table 3.3 and figure 3.4).

                                          B.     JOBS AND PRODUCTIVITY

About 70 percent of the population is still engaged in agriculture while most of the new jobs have
been created by nonfarm businesses in the informal sector with low productivity.

3.10. While the unemployment rate in Uganda is low, the problem is more of
underemployment and employment in low-productivity jobs. With one of the youngest and
fastest growing populations, a million young people enter the Ugandan labor market every two
years. Due to limited job creation in the formal sector, most of them end up in informal
employment or become underemployed. The overall unemployment rate, at 4.2 percent, is low,
primarily because most Ugandans cannot afford not to work in the absence of an unemployment
policy and the prevalent poverty rates. Unemployment rates are relatively higher in urban areas
and among the youth and women (table 3.4) since, in rural areas, labor is absorbed into the
agricultural sector as a residual employer. The higher youth unemployment can largely be
explained by a lack of high productivity jobs, dearth of employable skills, limited access to land
and capital, and a negative attitude toward certain types of work.

men. Nearly 55 percent of the women 40

norms and perceptions about women are also responsible for the gender differences in the labor
force (figure 3.5).

3.12. Child labor is more common in poor households as nearly half of the children in the
age group of 5–17 years in Uganda were employed in some form of economic activity in 2010.
This is much higher than the SSA average of 28 percent. According to the Understanding Children
Work Report of Uganda, 43 percent of families which keep children out of school do so because
it is too expensive for the household to have the child in school. Children are also more likely to
be working, if the household has been affected by shocks such as natural disasters, epidemics,
social shocks, civil strife, or loss of family members. Labor inspections are not carried out in rural
areas. As a result, agricultural work accounts for almost all of children’s economic activity in rural
areas. In addition, child labor in the agriculture sector is one of the critical issues hindering
investors' commitment of more capital to the sector.

3.13. While Uganda has seen a structural transformation in its output structure, the jobs
transformation is yet to happen. Uganda’s job landscape can be divided into three main
categories: the agricultural sector, the nonagricultural informal sector, and the formal enterprise
sector, a large component of which includes the wage sector. The majority of the workforce is still
employed in the agricultural sector which includes crop farming, animal husbandry, and fishing
(figure 3.6). The nonagricultural informal sector employed 15 percent of the labor force in low-
end services and manufacturing. The formal nonagricultural sector employed 19 percent of the
labor force with about 300,000 public sector jobs. The service sector (retail and restaurant) has
been the major contributor to job creation in formal enterprises. The rapid strides that have been
made in the telecommunications sector have given a boost to the business and financial sector.

3.14. The main driver of job creation has been the nonfarm informal sector. UBOS
estimates that 79 percent of the firms in Uganda are informal. In 2013, only 63 percent of Ugandan
firms which started their business in the year were in the formal sector which is low compared
with 85 percent in LICs.18 In addition, nearly 95 percent of the 762 firms which were surveyed in
the World Bank’s 2013 Enterprise Survey, said that they faced competition against informal or
unregistered businesses and this was the second biggest constraint that they faced in doing business
in Uganda. Job creation by micro non-tradable enterprises (figure 3.7) dominated all other types
of job creation between 2001 and 2011 with 350,000 new jobs, mostly in the urban areas. Large
formal enterprises, mostly in the tradable sector, however saw a decline in jobs during this period.
Most of the poor and those in the bottom 40 percent are typically engaged in the informal sector
where they are underpaid, subject to hazardous working conditions, and unable to improve their
skill base. The majority of the informal enterprises are engaged in retail sales but a large number
of them are also in light manufacturing (brick making, charcoal manufacture, and beverages).
Nearly 31 percent of informal sector workers receive pay only in the form of food and lodging
rather than cash. Much of the reason for this informality lies with weaknesses in taxation,
regulation, and property rights. Formalizing the business will involve very high costs for these
small businesses.

3.15. Most of the jobs that have been created have been in sectors where productivity is
constrained by limited access to finance. Agriculture, commerce, household-based services, and
informal manufacturing are among the most common activities in Uganda, all of them being in the
low end of the productivity spectrum. While the jobs are in general more productive than in
subsistence agriculture, they require limited skills and so are not very productive. The average
monthly wage is estimated at UGX 85,000 in agriculture and UGX 188,000 for other services and
commerce, most of which are informal activities (figure 3.8). The main constraint to raising
productivity in the informal sector is low access to finance which constrains available capital.
Since these firms operate in the informal sector, they have very limited access to formal credit
facilities and most of the start-up capital comes from own savings or informal credit sources. In
addition, these firms also face a lack of technical and business skills and a lack of fixed locations
to conduct their business. Many of them operate in the streets without authorization.

    Box 3.1. The Behavioral Challenge
    There is a behavioral dimension to the productivity problem in Uganda which seems to pose an added challenge to
    the policy makers. Typically, employers use monetary incentives or a threat of dismissal to motivate employees.
    Similarly, governments make use of subsidies and extension services to increase the use of fertilizers and seeds in
    agriculture. However, these efforts may not always bring about the desired outcome.

    Examples from other countries suggest that the type of contract matters. In India, for example, data entry clerks in
    a firm, who were paid weekly for every accurate field they entered were not motivated to enter more number of
    fields. They typically increased their effort close to pay days and before festivals. Discussions with the employees
    indicated that they would prefer rules against being absent. So the company introduced another kind of contract in
    which they could set their own target for the week and if they met the target, they would be paid the usual amount,
    if not, they would be paid at a reduced rate. This kind of a commitment contract increased the workers’ productivity.

    In China, a company offered an ad hoc one-time bonus of 20 percent of the pay of employees which was not tied
    to performance. This bonus increased hourly productivity by 3–5 percent, long after the bonus was discontinued.
    Hence, productivity can be increased by exceeding expectations of workers.

    Public recognition can also be an inexpensive alternative to improve productivity. Female hairdressers in Zambia
    who sold condoms to their clients received either a monetary commission or a star for every packet of condoms
    sold which would be displayed in their salons. Those who received the stars sold twice as many condoms.

    Small entrepreneurs in Ghana who received support in the form of in-kind grants such as equipment, increased their
    profits by 24 percent while those who received it in cash, did not increase their profits. Bicycle taxi drivers in Kenya
    worked just enough to meet their daily cash needs. These failures to capitalize on potential opportunities can be
    tackled through training programs, but they need to be customized. In the Dominican Republic, an accounting
    training based on thumb rules such as maintaining two separate drawers for business and personal income and
    having a system of notes for any exchanges between the drawers was more successful than a formal accounting
    training.

    In 2011, farmers in SSA, on average used 13.2 kg of fertilizers compared with 118.3 kg in Organisation for
    Economic Co-operation and Development countries. An important factor among farmers in LICs is to translate
    their intentions into actions. Obstacles can be monetary or related to the lack of supply chains. Providing free
    delivery of fertilizers to farmers in rural Kenya right after the harvest (when they had cash), resulted in a significant
    increase in fertilizer use. Learning from peers and social networks is also crucial in the adoption of increased inputs.
    This was a key factor in the Green Revolution in India.

    Overall, there are several non-remunerative interventions which can increase productivity such as commitment
    contracts, public recognition, and social networks. However, people are heterogeneous and respond to incentives
    in different ways. Therefore, an experimental approach to these issues is needed. The low cost of these interventions
    and the inherently large payoffs to some of these intractable problems, however, justifies these experiments.

3.16. Productivity of labor in Uganda is low and declined during 2006–10, as labor shifted
into lower-value-added sectors. The number of jobs in high-productivity sectors has declined
while the number of jobs in low-productivity sectors has increased and this has been a drag on
transformational growth (figure 3.9). Even the 300,000–400,000 graduates from universities and
technical colleges every year find it difficult to get jobs which use their skills and they end up as
taxi drivers and in other similar occupations despite having technical degrees. Moreover, output

other informal services has declined between 2006 and 2010.19 The low level of productivity is
also explained by the attitude toward work, as incentives and motivation can pose major obstacles
in contexts such as Uganda. Behavioral economics offers a glimpse on how to tackle some of these
difficult problems and given that many of these interventions are low-cost options, they can be
added to the list of policy interventions in specific areas (box 3.1).

                                       C.        IDENTIFYING THE KEY CONSTRAINTS TO GROWTH

Infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly in the power and road sector, access to finance, low level
of skills, and the administrative burden of taxes are the key constraints to growth.

3.17. Several factors constrain growth in Uganda, but a series of analytical studies and
surveys have repeatedly emphasized electricity, roads, access to finance, skills, and specific
business regulations. Growth literature has emphasized that economic expansion is the result of
a combination of factors at the micro-enterprises level or at the macroeconomic- environment
level. They can range from the limited accumulation of labor and capital to the absence of
innovation, an inefficient business environment, taxes, underdeveloped infrastructure, low skills,
and inappropriate macroeconomic and fiscal policies. All these factors have been playing a role in
Uganda’s growth process, but a series of recent analytical studies have identified a few priorities
that are summarized in table 3.5.

3.18. Sales losses due to power outages and the high cost of electricity were key constraints
cited by firms but the commissioning of the Bujagali hydropower plant has helped
significantly. Power cuts were pronounced during 2012 and this reflected in the 2013 Enterprise
Survey (January 2013–July 2014) in which nearly 23.2 percent of the firms identified unreliable

electricity services as the main obstacle for conducting business in the country. This was
significantly higher than 10 percent of the firms perceiving this as a key constraint worldwide and
13.4 percent in SSA. The cost of electricity is relatively high and many enterprises complain about
the inflated cost of electricity during peak hours (between 6 p.m. and midnight). In addition, power
outages and load shedding is frequent in Uganda. With the commissioning of Bujagali in 2013,
the power supply situation in Uganda has significantly improved, pushing supply to almost match
demand. However, demand is growing fast and hence will quickly outstrip supply, if adequate
investments in power generation and grid network are not undertaken. The Power Sector
Investment Plan (2011), estimates that the investment requirement for power generation,
transmission, and distribution between 2010 and 2030 is US$8 billion, of which US$5.5 billion is
for power generation, US$2 billion for transmission, and US$0.6 billion for distribution. 20
Strengthening the transmission network and cross-border connectivity with neighbors will help
build the resilience of the system and allow Uganda to benefit from regional energy exchanges.21

3.19. Despite significant investments in the road sector, Uganda is still plagued by poor
transit and transport infrastructure which has raised the cost of doing business. Uganda is a
landlocked country but a transit for the other countries in the EAC and Great Lakes regions.
Currently, the national road network carries 90 percent of all land transport in the country. The
prevalence of overloading and inadequate road maintenance has resulted in the deterioration of
roads exacerbated by climatic shocks such as floods. In addition, the rail and inland water transport
infrastructure is underdeveloped. As a result, the cost of moving goods within and outside Uganda
is particularly high, making it less attractive to potential foreign investors. In addition to
maintenance, there is also a need to remove pinch points and increase investments in road
infrastructure along the key corridors, particularly the northern corridor. Border crossings need to
be improved by consolidating the number of agencies at the border and by removing multiple and
redundant non-tariff barriers.

3.20. Given the large infrastructure gaps, it will be important to leverage private resources
and prioritize infrastructure investments—one possible way to prioritize is to target
resources, for example, to connect producers to markets for emerging product champions
identified through the product space analysis. Public resources are limited and the infrastructure
requirements are astronomical. In such a scenario, it will be important to leverage private
resources, particularly through public-private partnerships. In addition, specific investments in
roads and electricity can be targeted to remove market failures for sectors identified to be on their
way to developing capabilities to move up along the value ladder. The product space analysis,22
for example, identifies some emerging product champions with potential—light manufacturing
(garments, leather, and wood products), agro-processing (cereals, dairy products, more types of
cooking oils, and new sugar products), and a few chemicals and metal products industries. Many
of these sectors were also identified by the agriculture market linkage analysis for Uganda.
Infrastructure investments can be targeted in areas which will be particularly beneficial for these
specific industries, although adequate attention needs to be given to inclusion as well (discussed

   The Second Rural Electrification Strategy and Plan estimates that an additional US$1 billion will be needed
between 2013 and 2022 for rural electrification.
21
   These efforts should be complemented by other interventions such as building in-country capacity, in-country
generation, use of renewable energy (wind, solar), and designing and implementing plans to incorporate climate
variability and change, which is particularly important for hydropower that depends on reliable water resources.

markets and the like.

financing is also very high in Uganda compared to other countries in the region and the world.
Countries in Africa generally have quite high interest rates and the high cost of financing creates
a significant obstacle to enterprise growth and operation, particularly for small and medium
enterprises.23 Commercial bank lending rate at about 22 percent in Uganda is high, compared with
9 percent in Vietnam and 12 percent in Zambia (figure 3.10). The high rates are largely because
of a lack of competition and high overheads explained by high salaries because of the scarcity of
qualified professionals, high costs of expansion, especially in rural areas, and high costs of due
diligence in an environment where information is very scarce and not sufficiently reliable. The
high rates also reflect the high risk premium.

3.22. The availability of long-term funding in Uganda is extremely limited because the main
source of funding for banks are short-term consumer deposits. Increasing the availability of
long-term funding will require capital market development and pension reforms while credit lines
from development institutions can also be useful. According to the World Economic Forum Global
Competitiveness Report 2014–15, Uganda ranks 121 (out of 144 countries) by affordability of
financial services, which shows deterioration in ranking compared to a year earlier (116). In
comparison, Kenya and Rwanda rank 64 and 56, respectively, on this indicator, and both countries
improved their ranking by several points compared to last year.

3.23. The limited availability of high quality collateral, in the form of properly registered
land, provides an explanation for the limited access to bank loans and their high cost. Only
20 percent of Uganda’s land is registered, most of which is mailo land that is unacceptable as
collateral because the banks cannot liquidate it, as the rights of the landowners overlap with those
of the tenants (legally recognized as lawful or bona fide occupants) who enjoy inheritable and

  High interest rates are the third most cited reason by firms in Africa for not applying for loans, according to the
research by Beck, Thorsten, and Cull (2014)

transferrable rights as landlords. The low rate of Uganda’s land registration compares unfavorably
with Rwanda’s (60 percent) and even more unfavorably with that of Western European countries
(95 percent). However, it compares favorably with the average SSA country. Measures to
accelerate land registration and develop the capacity of institutions responsible for resolving land
disputes need to be prioritized since land tenure insecurity imposes a bearing on economic growth.
It is estimated that land disputes in Uganda reduce annual agricultural production by 5–11 percent.

this stage, as evidenced by the
ranking of constraints faced by firms. In addition, the fact that even the university graduates remain
underemployed and do not find suitable jobs, partly reflects the lack of jobs that require their skills
and partly the irrelevance of the education curriculum. Also, while primary enrollment rates have
gone up, primary completion rates are still very low which show low ‘perceived’ gains from
education and also high poverty levels which act as a deterrent for households to send children to
schools. In Uganda, only 20 percent of the labor force has completed at least secondary education,

compared with 50 percent in Ghana (figure 3.11). Education and skills are discussed in detail in
chapter 4.

3.25. Firms cite taxation as a key obstacle, due to the huge administrative burden and
unfairness of the system. The administrative tax burden in Uganda is high. A complicated tax
administration system acts as a disincentive for entrepreneurs to operate in the formal sector.
Nearly 75 percent of the firms surveyed in the 2013 World Bank Enterprise Survey were inspected
by tax officials during the year with several of them hosting four visits by tax inspectors. With this
burden, formal firms spend comparatively much more time with tax officials than in other LICs.
With the high informality, efforts to raise overall tax revenue have also raised the burden for the
formal firms, who feel overtaxed. There are also complaints by firms about taxes and licensing at
the local level with businesses being viewed as ‘cash cows’ and being taxed onerously. Firms in
the agriculture sector complained about the increase in the taxes on inputs which dramatically
increased the cost of operations. Companies also disclosed rampant evasion of taxes through the
falsification of invoices.

3.26. While these constraints have been singled out, there are several other constraints that
businesses face while operating in Uganda. A lot of them are related to business regulations such
as starting a business, dealing with construction permits, and the prevalence of informal payments
to operate in the country. These governance and other challenges also increase the cost of doing
business in Uganda.

                               D.    OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH

Looking forward, the oil sector, regional integration, ICT development, and efficient urbanization
offer significant opportunities to raise growth in Uganda.

3.27. Uganda has been transforming rapidly in recent years and sectors which offer
significant potential include oil, regional integration, ICT, and urbanization. The discovery
of oil has the potential to be a game changer for the country. The prospect of further regional
integration, technological ICT innovation, and the rapid urbanization process also represent
opportunities for accelerating the development process in the coming years. Optimizing those
drivers will, to a large extent, determine Uganda’s capacity to make progress on the twin goals
over the next decade. These opportunities were identified by a diagnostic using past and ongoing
analytical work within the Bank (Uganda CEM, 2015 and various issues of the Uganda Economic
Update); and outside.

       Driver 1: Harnessing Extractives for Growth and Resilience

3.28. As of 2015, Uganda’s oil reserves are estimated by the government at 6.5 billion
barrels with only 1.1–1.4 billion barrels considered recoverable. The current official estimates
of oil reserves may underestimate the country’s potential in minerals by a wide margin since only
40 percent of the oil-rich Albertine Graben region has been explored so far. In addition, recent
surveys have identified numerous viable deposits of minerals, ranging from iron ores to uranium.

3.29. There is significant uncertainty on the start of oil production and the expectation is
that it could begin earliest by 2018 with the smallest oil reservoir, exploration area 3A
(EA3A) (box 3.3). At this stage, the investment plans are influenced by two important factors that
                                                 32
 
are not entirely under the control of Uganda’s government. The first is the construction of the
pipeline that will enable Uganda to export its oil through Kenya, as there is still disagreement on
the location of the pipeline. The second is the medium- to long-term price of oil on international
markets.

3.30. The economic viability of the three main oil areas will largely depend on the future
price of oil. At the current level of oil prices at around US$50 per barrel, the consortium of private
oil companies will find it difficult to recoup their investment costs. This is because of the terms of
the existing production sharing agreement between the government and the oil companies. As a
result, there is significant uncertainty on the start date of oil production. Whenever it starts, oil will
have a large impact on the Ugandan economy. If managed properly, it has the potential to
substantially raise government revenues, increase exports, and result in impressive growth rates.
A decline in energy prices and forward and backward linkages will also boost growth. However,
the oil sector will provide limited employment opportunities given the capital-intensive nature of
the hydrocarbon industry.

    Box 3.2. Basic Assumptions for the Projection of Future Oil Production
     Oil reserves of 6.5 billion barrels, of which 1.3 billion are recoverable (923 million in EA1, 231 million in EA2,
      and 134 million in EA3A).
     Oil production is expected to begin in 2018 as EA3A goes on stream, followed by EA1 and EA2 in 2020.
      Production will peak in 2025, decline gradually, thereafter, and end in 2044.
     Total downstream capacity will reach 230,000 barrels per day, including 30,000 barrels per day processed by
      the refinery (which will begin production in 2019) and 200,000 exported through the pipeline.
     Initial production of crude oil will be used primarily for power generation until the downstream capacity is in
      place.
     30,000 barrels per day will be reserved for the refinery. Surplus production will be exported through the
      pipeline.
     Total capital expenditures for the development of oil fields will reach US$7.6 billion. The construction of the
      refinery and the pipeline will cost US$4.5 and US$3 billion, respectively, including a government equity
      contribution of US$2 billion to the overall project (field development, refinery, and pipeline).
     The long-term price of oil will average US$90 per barrel, as projected by the World Bank Global Economic
      Prospects, with a 15 percent discount for Uganda’s oil due to high viscosity.
     The pipeline will charge US$10.18 for each barrel of oil piped to the Kenyan coastline. This includes a US$0.18
      transit fee.

3.31. Sound oil revenue management is a precondition for harnessing the significant
potential benefits of oil. Uganda’s performance in budgetary management is generally solid on
transparency and the new PFM Act has instilled expectations of a sustained improvement in budget
operations. However, as seen with other public management reforms the key will be
implementation. Andrews and Bategeka (2013) argue that Uganda has a poor history with ‘off-
the-shelf’ governance initiatives. The new PFM Act, which includes among others, clauses on
budget credibility and oil management, benefitted from extensive consultations to contextualize
the reform and therefore to improve the likelihood of its implementation as they recommended.
Some of the outstanding PFM challenges include weak budget credibility, controls, and
compliance. Overall, governance is a main point of concern, and an area of weakness in the

Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA).  

3.32. As will be discussed in chapter 5, natural-resource-rich countries have often faced
syndromes, collectively termed the resource curse, which pose the main obstacle to
capitalizing on oil. This manifests itself through (a) real appreciation of the local currency that
hampers the country’s export competitiveness and production; (b) economic volatility following
oscillating world market oil prices that affect investment and economic growth over time; (c) rent-
seeking behavior that leads to corruption and socially-inefficient spending; and (d) a false sense of
security that reduces human and social capital investments. The country therefore needs to sustain
the gains in PFM reform, while critically addressing the broad areas of governance including
property rights, fiscal management, quality of public administration and transparency,
accountability, and corruption to effectively leverage the benefits from oil. 

    Box 3.3. An Uncertain Date for the Start of Oil Production
    In spite of sizable proven reserves and favorable prospects, there is still considerable uncertainty about the
    magnitude and the timing of the expected investments. Negotiations between the government and the
    international investors began about four years ago, but are not yet finalized. The three major international oil
    companies operating in Uganda (Total, Tullow, and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC))
    plan to start production in 2018 (CNOOC) and 2019 (Total and Tullow). Total production will peak at 230,000
    barrels per day by 2025, but will decline thereafter and end around 2044. The plan is to process 30,000–60,000
    barrels per day in a local refinery for the domestic and the regional markets (Burundi, the Democratic Republic
    of Congo, South Sudan, and Rwanda), while the remainder will be exported through a pipeline from Uganda’s
    oil fields to Kenya’s coast line. Delays in the granting of production licenses to oil companies by the government
    has frustrated these companies, resulting in the downsizing of a large part of their expatriate staff in the country.
    Oil companies and the government of Uganda (GoU) are aiming to begin basin-wide development in early 2016
    which will imply first commercial-scale production, most likely by 2020. A production license has already been
    issued on the CNOOC-operated Kingfisher field and this can lead to some very limited early oil production sold
    into the domestic market before 2019. If this occurs, it will probably be widely trumpeted as ‘First Oil’ but will
    have little impact on government revenues. The export pipeline continues to be a source of uncertainty and delay.

    There now is apparently an agreement in principle on a combined Uganda/Kenya pipeline, consolidating
    Ugandan oil with oil from the Lukeino Basin in Kenya for export at a terminal near Lamu. However, the specific
    routing is still undecided and debate carries on within both the Ugandan and Kenyan governments about whether
    such a pipeline should be a public sector or private sector project. As a result, the technical, financing, and
    commercial arrangements governing the pipeline are not progressing as quickly as the upstream work. The GoU
    is in the final stages of selecting a strategic investor for the planned 60,000 barrels per day Hoima refinery. Even
    once the partner is selected, the process of finalizing technical and financial arrangements for the refinery will
    be lengthy. Peak government oil revenue is likely to be reached only by the mid-2020s. The government can use
    this interim period to improve transparency, tackle corruption, and raise capacity within the government.
    Moreover, a frank discussion with oil companies on pending issues such as production licenses and cost recovery
    will be needed.

become a source of growth for other businesses linked directly or indirectly to oil activities.
Although permanent jobs are expected to settle at around 3,000 when production begins, the
development of local capacity through training and linkages, notably in sectors like transportation
and logistics, will boost the economy. This can stimulate the creation of new and higher paying
jobs and benefit the overall Ugandan community. The growth projection can go even higher if
second-round effects, through linkages originated for the efficient use of oil revenue, are taken
into account.

3.34. The emergence and the development of Uganda’s oil industry and the capacity of the
government to increase public investment will have a major impact on GDP growth during
the next decade. Figure 3.13 illustrates Uganda’s growth path with and without oil. Assuming

that oil production comes on stream in 2017/18 (box 3.3) and that public investment continues to
accelerate during the next decade, real GDP growth is expected to average 8.8 percent annually
between 2015/16 and 2024/25, that is, 2.2 percentage points higher than in a scenario without oil
and a more limited investment surge. In per capita terms, the emergence of the oil sector and a
continued emphasis on public investment will allow Uganda to reach the US$1000 GDP per capita
mark by 2019/20 and lead to a 32 percent larger GDP per capita than in a situation without oil and
less public investment.

3.35. The largest share of total oil revenue will accrue to the government. On the basis of
production sharing agreements concluded by the government and the oil companies and assuming
a long-term price of oil of US$90 per barrel, 70 percent of the net present value of oil production
will go to the government. This is in line with agreements in other new oil producing countries. In
Ghana, the government’s share of the net cash flow of offshore oil fields is about 69 percent.26 Oil
production in Uganda is expected to generate US$57 billion in government revenue between
2017/18 and 2044/45, through the government share of oil profits, royalties, income taxes,
dividends, and interest on the 15 percent government equity in oil fields (figure 3.14). Additional
government revenue will average US$2.1 billion per year (two-third of the domestic revenue in
FY2013/14) and will reach US$4 billion in peak production years.

3.36. A big contribution of Uganda’s petroleum sector will be in the form of additional
public investment in key sectors such as infrastructure, health, and education but this
contribution will not be automatic. Oil revenues will offer a great opportunity to meet some of
the most important public spending needs and to ease some of the country’s key economic
constraints. However, this will require efficient management of resources and mismanagement is
a strong possibility in a weak governance context. Pitfalls associated with the extractives are
discussed under chapter 5.

              Driver 2: Expanding Trade and Investment and Deepening Regional Integration

3.37. Uganda is a member of several regional agreements, including the EAC and
COMESA. These regional agreements have led to a surge in trade.27 Uganda’s exports to the four
EAC partners nearly doubled from 15 percent of total exports in FY2007 to nearly 25 percent in
FY2011. This opening has allowed the diversification of the export base to manufacturing products
such as iron sheets, cement, and plastics, which have also gradually substituted imports in the
domestic market (figure 3.15). Regional integration can bring further benefits if the remaining
trade barriers are removed, including high transport costs and non-tariff barriers. There is also a
need to promote financial integration and to facilitate the regional movement of people and capital.
At the same time, the development of new regional markets remains affected by ongoing regional
insecurity.

3.38. To fully capture the benefits from regional integration, Uganda will need to improve
its competitiveness. This will require reducing transport costs through more efficient modes of
transport and improved logistical services. The focus on improving roads in the trade corridors
must be complemented with regional coordination with neighbors to maintain these roads,
development of more efficient and cheaper modes of transport such as railways, and improvement
of ports. Transport costs will come down by improving both infrastructure and transport logistics,
including improvements to the trucking, freight, and storage industries. For agricultural exports,
the challenge is to ensure enough quantities (to realize economies of scale along the value chain),
of sufficiently high quality and at competitive prices. Overall, while Uganda needs to sustain its
efforts to deepen regional integration as a means of facilitating greater trade and investment
opportunities, this will have to go together with an increase in the competitiveness of the sectors
that have the highest potential for regional expansion, particularly in agriculture (maize, beans),
light manufacturing (cements, plastics), and some services like tourism.

       Driver 3: Accessing New Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)

3.39. Ugandan firms lag in the use of ICT compared with peers. According to the World
Bank 2013 Enterprise Survey, only 40 percent of the firms were using email to communicate with
clients and suppliers, compared to 73 percent in Kenya and 53 percent in Zambia. Website use is
even less prevalent with 19 percent of firms having their own website compared to 47 percent in
Kenya. While the use of cell phones in operations is relatively widespread at 84 percent, it is lower
than in Bangladesh (almost 100 percent) and Kenya (92 percent). However, Ugandan firms appear
to be ahead of other SSA countries in the use of mobile money. The most important reason for the
use of mobile money by Ugandan firms is that it reduces the time and cost of financial transactions.
More generally, Uganda is ranked 104 out of 144 countries worldwide on innovation and business
sophistication and 119 on technology readiness in the Global Competitiveness Index (2014–15).

3.40. The government has made efforts to strengthen the policy and institutional
environment in the ICT sector. It completed the implementation of Phases I and II of the National
Backbone Infrastructure (NBI) funded by a bilateral credit from China including over 1,500 km of
fiber optic cables. The NBI was commercialized following open access principles and it is

                                                                                                                            37
 
managed and marketed by a competitively selected private company (Soliton, Kenya) under a
management contract. The third phase of the NBI is under implementation. During this phase, the
government intends to improve the reliability of the NBI by constructing additional fiber optic
links through additional major towns in the northern and southwestern regions of Uganda and
connecting to existing and future regional infrastructure.

3.41. Despite these efforts, access to broadband networks remains low, with poor quality
and high prices primarily because of inadequate infrastructure and high energy costs. Entry
level mobile broadband service (500 MB per month) costs about 19 percent of the average
Ugandan’s monthly income,28 compared to the United Nations (UN) Broadband Commission’s
target of 5 percent. Broadband internet connections, available in Kampala, provide faster
connections but the service is prohibitive for many small businesses, costing up to US$500 a
month. The high costs are reflected in low broadband penetration rates of just 1.4 percent (1 percent
mobile and 0.4 percent fixed), compared with a regional average of 4.3 percent. The high costs
and low penetration result from a number of factors, including Uganda’s position as a landlocked
country requiring overland access to submarine cables landing in neighboring countries, previous
technical problems of the national backbone network, and perceived limited market opportunity
by private operators given the high rates of poverty and illiteracy in most rural areas. A more stable
and lower-cost energy supply will be important for developing the potential of the ICT sector
(energy represents up to 25 percent of the operating expense of the telecommunications industry).

3.42. The efficient development of the ICT sector has the potential to increase the
availability of jobs, improve public service delivery, and thereby, spur growth. The prospects
of using more and better ICT can improve firms’ competitiveness by reducing their information
costs as well as by facilitating access to formal credit over time. These gains will promote private
sector expansion and help create jobs for the fast growing Ugandan labor force. In addition, ICT
has the potential to be a source of employment for Uganda’s English speaking population and the
increasingly unemployed university graduates. There is significant potential to improve public
service delivery using ICT but it is also the hardest to achieve in a developing country context. E-
government services remain highly underdeveloped in Uganda. The 2014 UN e-Government
Development Index ranked Uganda at 156 out of 193 countries for e-government development, in
the middle of the range for African countries. The impact of ICT in development can be far
reaching as summarized in the examples in table 3.7.

              Driver 4: Accelerating Urbanization

3.43. Uganda’s urbanization rate remains relatively low at about 15 percent in 2013. This
was significantly lower than that of its EAC counterparts (Kenya stands at 25 percent and Tanzania
at 31 percent) and below that of the average LICs and SSA countries and other high growth
countries (figure 3.16 and 3.17).29 However, the pace of urbanization is increasing in Uganda and

                                                            
29
  While the UN definition of urbanization focuses on the national definition of urban and rural areas, another measure
of urbanization is the agglomeration index which uses three indicators (population density, population size of large
urban centers, and proximity [travel time] to the nearest such urban center) to estimate the level of urban concentration
in a country or region. According to this measure Uganda’s urbanization rate is estimated at 25 percent compared to
Kenya (28 percent) and Tanzania (24 percent) in 2010. Uganda’s level of agglomeration is estimated to have increased
further over the past four years, to reach 34 percent in 2014.

                                                               39
 
it is estimated that the population in Kampala and other urban areas will be close to 10 million by
2030.

3.44. International experience shows that urbanization, through agglomeration effects, can
boost growth. No country has ever reached high-income levels with low urbanization. There is a
strong correlation between urbanization and levels of income for the following reasons. First, as
more people interact, there is more scope for innovation. Second, larger groups of population living
in close proximity allow for economies of scale. Firms can produce goods in larger quantities at
lower marginal costs and deliver them more cheaply, serving a larger number of customers. Urban
centers play a dual role as a producer and consumer. As a producer, the urban sector, if well-
enabled, produces more jobs, revenue, houses, skills, value addition, and knowledge. As
consumers, the urban sector provides ready markets for goods and services to meet the needs of
the urban dwellers, who have higher disposable incomes. Third, the transformation of the rural
economy, particularly agriculture, will benefit strongly from the development of the urban
economy.

3.45. The initial gains from urbanization are already evident in Uganda. More
than 70 percent of manufacturing activities are conducted in urban areas while 65 percent of the
new jobs over the past decade were created in cities and urban centers. In addition, employment
opportunities in the formal sector are concentrated in urban areas. Urban areas also have lower
poverty levels and higher consumption levels (figure 3.18).

3.46. However, the economic gains associated with urbanization are not automatic. The
rapid urbanization process in Uganda is putting pressure on the delivery of social and infrastructure
services in urban areas. Housing has become a challenge and it is estimated that slums and informal
settlements provide accommodation to more than 60 percent of the Ugandan urban dwellers. Such
settlements are characterized by a lack of basic services, over crowdedness, homelessness,
makeshift dwelling units, crime, and poor sanitation. It is estimated that the urban areas have a
total housing stock of 700,000 housing units with a backlog of 153,000 housing units. Most of the
urban development in Uganda is currently happening without planning and lacks infrastructure,
particularly transport infrastructure.

3.47. The key constraints to urbanization in Uganda include the policy and legislative
framework, the land tenure system, markets, and housing, among others. The policy30 and
legal 31 framework for Uganda’s urban sector is too diffused and sometimes conflicting and
therefore does not take care of the current challenges and realities of the urban sector. Under the
umbrella of the National Urban Policy which is in an advanced stage of preparation, existing
policies such as the National Land Use Policy and the Decentralization Policy need to be reviewed
and harmonized. About 70 percent of the land in Kampala is under mailo tenure in which the rights
of landowners overlap with those of tenants (legally recognized as lawful or bona fide occupants)
who enjoy inheritable and transferrable rights similar to landlords, thereby making it very difficult
to sell such land or use it for long-term investments. In addition, due to the absence of a land tax,
a considerable amount of urban land has been accumulated and left idle by speculative buyers.
Both the land tenure system and lack of a land tax and enabling site and construction standards
have led to inefficient horizontal expansion, rather than more efficient vertical expansion achieved
through the construction of high-rise multipurpose buildings. There is therefore a need for urban

   Policies relating to urban development include the National Land Use Policy, Decentralization Policy, Health
Policy, National Environment Management Policy, National Land Policy, and Water Policy, among others.

   The legal framework regulating the urban sector includes the Local Government Act, Cap 243; the Public Health
Act, Cap 281; the National Environment Act, Cap 153; Access to Road Act, Cap 350; the Land Act, Cap 227; the
Condominium Property Act, 2001; the Physical Planning Act, 2010; the Water Act, Cap 152; and the Market Act, Cap
94, among other laws.

including promotion of satellite towns. A public-private partnership framework to promote low-
cost housing schemes for the low- and middle-income people will help address the urban housing
concerns. In addition, the urbanization process also suffers from inadequate financing and the lack
of institutional development.

4.1.     The objective of every country is to improve the standard of living of its citizens and
enhance human welfare which not only requires higher economic growth but also progress
on various other dimensions. These dimensions include the ability “to lead long and healthy
lives, to be knowledgeable, to have access to the resources needed for a decent standard of living,
and to be able to participate in the life of a community”.32 Hence, notions of welfare and standards
of living go beyond the narrow dimension of material welfare and include social, political, and
environmental factors. These factors also determine the accumulation and use of assets by
individuals and households to earn returns. The income-generating capacity of individuals depends
on crucial assets like human, physical, natural, financial, and social capital and the ability to
effectively use this capital.

4.2.    So far, Uganda has underinvested in the asset base of its citizens and this has had a
significant impact on their income-generation capacity. For Ugandan citizens in general and
more so for the poor and those in the bottom 40 percent, access to social and infrastructure services
is severely limited. Not only is the access limited, there are also concerns on quality. And this is
coupled with the near absence of a formal social assistance program. These factors have
constrained development outcomes in Uganda and the country remains one of the poorest in the
world despite two decades of sustained high growth.

4.3.   This chapter discusses the factors which affect the capacity of individuals and
households to accumulate assets and use these assets effectively to earn incomes. These factors
include health, education, and skills, access to land and infrastructure services, access to finance,
voice and participation, and social protection.

                                                               A.   HEALTH

With a high disease burden and low public spending on health, out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses on
health care are large and potentially impoverishing.

4.4.    Health outcomes have improved in Uganda but still remain far from international
standards. With regard to the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Uganda
will achieve MDG1 (child nutrition) and MDG4 (child mortality), partly achieve MDG6
(communicable disease control), and will not meet MDG5 (maternal mortality). Uganda is making
progress to reduce infant and under-five mortality, but the rates remain high (but comparable with
countries with a similar GNI per capita) at 90 and 54 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively
(figure 4.1). Despite several initiatives to promote safe delivery services including antenatal and
postnatal care, the maternal mortality rate has stagnated at 438 deaths per 100,000 live births and
is comparable with countries with a similar GNI per capita (figure 4.2).

4.5.  Ugandan youth are particularly afflicted by adverse health and demographic
developments. Teenagers bear a disproportionate burden of maternal morbidity and mortality

owing to the high rate of teenage pregnancies, with 24 percent giving birth to their first child before
turning 19 years of age. In addition, despite the provision of antiretroviral drugs for HIV patients,
there has been an increase in HIV prevalence rates in the 15–24 age group. This is partly because
the improved treatment has resulted in greater longevity for those with HIV and there is growing
complacency among the general population.

4.6.     The high disease burden is being compounded by noncommunicable diseases (NCDs)
and emerging challenges to public health. Malaria, maternal and neonatal disorders, HIV/AIDS,
respiratory tract infections, and diarrheal diseases are the main health concerns. Morbidity is high
(figure 4.3). About 40 percent of the population report to have suffered from an illness or accident
over the previous 30 days. Morbidity rates are apparently lower for the bottom 40 percent.
However, it is well known that the poor tend to underreport episodes of sickness. The main
symptom cited in episodes of illness is fever which is usually diagnosed as malaria. As a result,
malaria accounts for 32.9 percent of the episodes of illness (figure 4.4). The bottom 40 percent are
more likely to report symptoms of malaria. Next are symptoms of respiratory tract infections,
headache, fever, and abdominal pain, which account for 44 percent of the episodes. The country
still has one of the highest fertility rates in the world and lower life expectancy at birth compared
to LICs (figures 4.5 and 4.6). The burden of NCDs is so large and growing that it accounted for
over 27 percent of all deaths by 2010. Uganda has one of the highest alcohol consumption per
capita (16.8 pure liters of alcohol per capita) in the world, contributing to an increased incidence
of NCDs. Women (particularly those from poorer households) are likely to bear a larger share of
the NCD burden, as they are at increased risk of obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(due to increased exposure to indoor pollution) and intimate partner violence. Nearly half of the
Ugandan women have experienced intimate partner violence and those whose partners drink
frequently have a sixfold higher risk than those whose partners abstain from alcohol. Alcohol use,
household air pollution from solid fuels, and being underweight during childhood contribute to the
heavy disease burden in Uganda.

4.7.   HIV/AIDS and malaria remain the leading causes of mortality, even though Uganda
has made some progress on disease management. Although deaths from HIV/AIDS have
declined by 53.5 percent since the peak of the epidemic in 2005, mortality remains high. In 2010,
deaths from HIV/AIDS represented 17.2 percent of all deaths in Uganda and 3.5 percent of all
global deaths from the disease. In Africa, Uganda ranks third in the number of deaths attributable
to malaria and has some of the highest recorded malaria transmission rates. In other diseases,
Uganda has been able to achieve progress similar to its peers and for tuberculosis Uganda’s
performance has been better than other countries with a similar GNI per capita (figure 4.7 and 4.8).
The improvement has been driven mainly by improved case detection and treatment.

4.8.    There are also large disparities in health outcomes based on a household’s income
level and geographical location. Typically, the health outcomes of those living in the western
and central part of the country, those living in urban areas, and those belonging to wealthier
households are much better than the others. The infant and under-five mortality rates in rural areas
in 2011 were 66 and 111 deaths per 1,000 live births compared to 54 and 77 deaths per 1,000 live
births, respectively, in urban areas. Similarly, in 2011, infant mortality rates ranged from a low
of 47 deaths per 1,000 live births in Kampala to 87 and 88 deaths per 1,000 live births in Karamoja

                                                                                                          45
 
and West Nile, respectively. Childhood mortality rates were also highest among children in the
lowest or second lowest wealth quintile and lowest among those in the wealthiest quintile. For
example, in 2011 under-five mortality ranged from 72 deaths per 1,000 live births among the
richest children to 125 deaths per 1,000 live births among children in the second lowest quintile
(UBOS 2011).

4.9.    Although access to health services has improved for the country as a whole, there is
inequity in access and concerns on quality of care provided, particularly to the poor. The
bottom 40 percent still have limited access beyond basic health care. For them, the main reasons
for not seeking care are costs, physical access to a health center, and availability of drugs. Among
the poorest 20 percent of the population, almost 32 percent did not seek health care because of
financial reasons while 14 percent did not seek care because the health facility was too far (Wodon
and Tsimpo 2015). Although there are several private health service providers, most of the poor
depend on public facilities. The LGs are responsible for these public health centers but they are
severely underfunded and often understaffed. These limitations, along with other governance
challenges, particularly those stemming from decentralization have resulted in the poor quality of
service provided, disproportionately affecting the poor who depend more on public care. The lack
of incentives, mismanagement, a difficult working environment (particularly in the north and the
east), and inadequate inputs (drugs and infrastructure) have resulted in low-skilled health care
professionals and high rates of absenteeism (figures 4.9 and 4.10). Results from the World Bank’s
Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) survey show that close to half the health workers (49 percent)
in public facilities could not accurately diagnose and follow clinical guidelines in five tracer
conditions and less than half (47.9 percent) the public health facilities had adequate infrastructure.

4.10. Uganda’s population is not financially protected against illness. Although publicly
provided health services are meant to be free, OOP spending on health by Ugandans is high and
potentially impoverishing because overall public expenditure on health is low. Total health
expenditure per capita in Uganda is comparable with other countries in the region as well as with
those with similar levels of GDP per capita. However, public sector spending on health is low—
in 2013, health accounted for only 24 percent of total public spending, compared to the average
spent in the LICs of 37 percent and the SSA countries of 44 percent. As a result, OOP payments
are generally higher in Uganda than those in other countries (figures 4.11 and 4.12). According to
the WHO, a country is considered to offer financial protection against the cost of illness if OOP
expenditure does not exceed 15–20 percent of the total health expenditure. However, in Uganda,
it stands at almost 50 percent and can be impoverishing. The share of private health insurance is
negligible in Uganda and although Uganda has over 15 community-based health insurance
schemes, households pay premiums which are too low to make them sustainable and viable
(Fenenger and de Jager, 2007).

The Ugandan population, 25 years and above, has an average of 4.7 years of schooling while
women have only 3.8 years of schooling.33 In addition, there are big concerns on the relevance
and efficiency of the education system which has resulted in a low-skilled workforce.

4.11. Primary school enrollment increased for both boys and girls, but secondary and
tertiary enrollments are still low, more so for the bottom 40 percent. With the introduction of
universal primary education in 1997 and universal lower secondary education in 2007, the number
of students enrolled in primary and secondary education increased significantly. The primary
school net enrollment ratio was 82 percent in 2013, up from 67 percent in 1995. In 2013, access to
primary school was quite good (figure 4.13). However, enrollment in secondary and tertiary
education remains very low, particularly for those in the bottom 40 percent (figure 4.14). The main
constraints facing the poor include costs (including opportunity cost) and low perceived returns
from education. Disability and shocks are also important factors preventing some children from
attending school. Uganda’s secondary education gross enrollment rate was 26 percent in 2010,
which compares unfavorably with 40 percent in SSA and 80 percent in the East Asia and Pacific
region. Promoting transition from primary to secondary, and subsequently to tertiary education
will be important for poverty reduction, as returns to education more than double for secondary,
compared with primary education (figures 4.15 and 4.16). Currently, there are almost no students
belonging to the bottom 40 percent who are enrolled in tertiary education. In addition, while there
is gender parity at the primary level, the percent of girls in total enrollment declines to 47 percent
in secondary education, and 44 percent in tertiary education. Only 40 percent of those enrolled in
vocational training in 2013 were women. Moreover, the still low access to early childhood
education (gross enrollment rate of 12 percent according to the Systems Approach for Better
Education Results (SABER, 2012)), provided mostly by the private sector, constrains access
among poor and rural households.

4.12. A high primary dropout rate and still low secondary enrollment have resulted in
large-scale functional illiteracy. When compared with other countries with a similar GNI per
capita, the primary completion rate and progression to secondary education rate are much lower in
Uganda (figure 4.17 and 4.18). According to the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES), the
primary completion rate in 2012/13 was 59 percent (figure 4.19).34 In addition, the repetition rate
for primary education remains high at over 10 percent. The high dropout rate coupled with a still
relatively low enrollment in secondary schools, result in a large number of individuals who leave
school too early without having developed generic skills essential for life and work. In 2012, less
than half of the grade 6 students tested by the National Assessment of Progress in Education were
proficient in literacy (40.8 percent) and numeracy (45.2 percent).35

4.13. Education outcomes have been worsening. There was a significant decline in the
proportion of Secondary 2 (second year of secondary school) students displaying proficiency in
biology, mathematics, and English language in 2012. In 2012, only 17.7 percent of sampled
Secondary 2 students were proficient in biology compared with 36.7 percent in 2008. For
mathematics, the 2012 figure was 43.3 percent compared with 69.4 percent in 2008 while in
English language it was 48.3 percent compared with 81.9 percent five years earlier. In Business,
Technical, and Vocational Education and Training (BTVET) as well as tertiary education, the
employability of graduates is low, largely as a result of the mismatch between the skills imparted
through educational institutes and the skills demanded by the economy.

Examinations each year, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the projected population at the official primary
graduation age of 12 years.

4.14. Poor educational outcomes are related to poverty, inadequate availability of teaching
material, poor teacher quality, and lack of accountability. There is a lack of inputs such as
scholastic materials which is coupled with a high teacher-to-pupil ratio and crowding of
classrooms (figure 4.20). The SDI study of 2013 found that less than 1 in 5 (19 percent) public
school teachers showed mastery of the curriculum they taught. In addition, there was both student
and teacher absenteeism. About 27 percent of teachers in public schools were not at work. Of those
who were in school, about 30 percent were not teaching. The result is 40 percent of public school
classrooms with no teacher teaching and the incidence of teacher absenteeism was much higher in
the poorer regions of the north and the east (figure 4.21). Absenteeism, together with time use
within classrooms, suggests that out of the official teaching day of 7 hours 20 minutes, the average
Primary 4 (fourth year of primary school) student experiences only 3 hours 17 minutes of teaching
and learning time with the teacher. The lack of inputs and teacher absenteeism is more pronounced
in public schools and free private schools, where most of the poor go. There are no performance-

based financing systems at any level of the education system and little incentive for the system to
perform better. Taking the BTVET subsector as an example, neither institutional managers nor
instructors are held accountable for training results. Poor pass rates do not result in sanctions; good
pass rates do not result in recognition and rewards. In fact, pass rates are not even published by
programs and institutions. Private educational institutions enroll nearly 30 percent of all students
(figure 4.23). At the primary level, private schools perform significantly better than the public ones
but there is no significant difference in proficiency rates between government and privately-owned
secondary and tertiary schools.

4.15. The government is also focusing its efforts on vocational education to enhance skills.
Given the inadequacies of the education system in Uganda, graduate students are finding it difficult
to leverage their assets into productive, income-earning employment. Therefore, the government
recently approved a BTVET Strategic Plan which envisages a substantial growth in student
enrollment in BTVET over the next decade. This will help provide opportunities to people outside
of the formal education system. However, only 1.5 percent of the 15–24 year olds in Uganda were

enrolled in vocational training in 2009 which is lower than the SSA average of 2.1 percent. Nearly
35 percent of firms offered formal training programs for their full-time employees but very few
employees have full-time status.

4.16. The amount of financing allocated to education as a share of GDP (figure 4.22) and
as a share of the government’s overall budget has been declining. The share of education in
total government expenditures declined from 17 percent in FY2007 to 15 percent in FY2013. Over
the same period, the share of education as a percent of GDP fell from 3.4 percent to 2.9 percent.
This compares unfavorably with peers like Tanzania, Burundi, Kenya, and Vietnam. Combined
with the lack of education resources, demographic pressure is a major challenge to the achievement
of education objectives. The school-aged population (6 to 18 years) is growing at a very high rate.
In 2010, it stood at 10.9 million and by 2025, it is expected to reach 20.6 million. This means the
education system will have to double its current intake capacity to achieve universal primary
education enrollment and universal secondary education and post-primary education and training
objectives by 2025.

Water and sanitation: Nearly 72 percent of the Ugandan population has access to improved
drinking water but only 35 percent have access to safe sanitation facilities and there is inequity in
access.

4.17. About 35 percent of the Ugandan population does not have access to safe water which
includes over 10 million people in rural areas and 1.7 million people in urban areas. The
principal inequality lies in service delivery to rural versus urban households primarily because of
infrastructure related costs of providing water in remote and rural areas.

water resource. Uganda has an abundance of fresh water resources and can be considered water
rich at the national level. However, the distribution of water resources is uneven with over half of
all the districts being water stressed. Estimates show that within the next 20 years, water stress will
spread to the majority of districts due to population growth, economic development, and increasing
demands. Interestingly, the poorer northern and eastern regions have better access to improved
drinking water sources compared to the better off central and western region (table 4.1 and figure
4.24).

4.19. Only 1 in 3 Ugandans has access to improved sanitation which offers health benefits
and there is inequity in access. Although 75 percent of the rural population and 84 percent of the
urban population has access to improved sanitation facilities, this number includes shared toilets
and does not reflect the quality of the sanitation facilities. Adjusting for these limitations results in
sanitation coverage of 35 percent for the population. In large urban areas, sewerage coverage is
only 3–6 percent while in small urban areas, it is virtually nonexistent (figure 4.25). Most urban
areas rely on on-site sanitation and have limited fecal sludge management systems, with obvious
implications for water quality and health problems. The poor, in general, have lower access to
sanitation facilities compared with the rich and there are regional variations as well. For those
living in Karamoja, the poorest region, the coverage of improved sanitation is only 12.9 percent.
Moreover, according to government estimates, Uganda loses about US$177 million per year (that
is, US$5.5 per capita per year or 1.1 percent of GDP) due to poor sanitation. The social costs
extend beyond these factors and are felt not only at the individual level but also at the community
level. Women and children are disproportionately affected.

4.20. Uganda has met its MDG target for improved water access but not for sanitation. The
MDG national targets for improved water and sanitation access in Uganda are 72 percent
and 70 percent, respectively. The latest Joint Monitoring Program estimates for Uganda for 2012
indicate that Uganda has already met the MDG for improved water access but is far behind the
sanitation access target. Moreover, although Uganda has met its MDG target for improved access
to water, the level of service is still very low with only 19 percent of the population having access
to piped water.

Electricity: Access to electricity in Uganda is one of the lowest in the world.

4.21. Access to electricity in Uganda, estimated at 14 percent nationally and 7 percent in
rural areas, is very low. Within this low overall access, there is a large regional variation in
electricity access and usage (figure 4.26). About 72 percent of the total grid-based electricity is
consumed by only 12 percent of the domestic population within the major load centers of Kampala,
Jinja, and Entebbe. As a consequence, Uganda has a very low per capita electricity consumption,
which, at 80 kWh per year, is far below its peers—Kenya at 155 kWh per year and Ghana at 300

kWh per year; and not comparable to industrialized economies such as South Africa at 4,694 kWh
per year or South Korea at 8,502 kWh per year. A majority of households mention affordability as
a key constraint for access to electricity (box 4.1). Coverage rates are much higher among
households in the top 60 percent of the distribution than among those in the bottom 40 percent. In
fact, connections are virtually nonexistent for the bottom 40 percent of the population (figure 4.27).

    Box 4.1. Reasons for Low Connection Rates: Case of Zombo
    “To get connected, one needs to acquire one or more electric poles depending on the distance from the grid line.
    One pole costs about UGX 800,000 and this is a deterrent for households who are otherwise interested in getting
    electricity connections. In addition, the installation and maintenance costs of electricity are very high. Having a
    grass thatched house also hinders one from having electricity.” (A focus group participant)
    Source: MoFPED “Energy for Rural Transformation (ERT): Impact Assessment”, 2011.

Transport: Uganda’s district and rural roads are in poor condition leading to poor connectivity
to markets and other services, especially for the poor. In addition, air and rail transport is
underdeveloped.

4.22. Uganda’s national road network is in fairly good condition with high density and
heavy traffic. The national road network has a density of 32.2 km per km2 which is four times the
density of an average low-income African country (Ranganathan and Foster 2012). The paved
roads carry as much traffic as Africa’s middle-income countries (Ranganathan and Foster 2012).
Around 87 percent of Ugandan national roads are in good or fair condition compared to only 72
percent in a typical African LIC. However, in addition to maintenance and overloading challenges,
a rising issue with national roads has been that of capacity, since many of them are single
carriageway roads which accommodate the current traffic with difficulty.

4.23. However, nearly 54 percent of the district roads and 60 percent of rural roads are in
poor condition. This particularly affects the poor and those in the bottom 40 percent as most of
the poor live in rural areas and they lack good connectivity to markets, health clinics, schools, and
other public amenities. This restrains improvements in agricultural productivity and poverty

                                                           54
 
reduction. In addition, the share of population living within 2 km of an all-season road is not higher
than in other low-income African countries (Ranganathan and Foster 2012) while the road fatality
rate at 81 per 100,000, is double the African average (World Bank 2009).

4.24. Urban congestion is also concerning. The lack of an efficient and affordable public
transportation system may increasingly become a barrier to inclusion, as the poor and vulnerable
may be excluded from employment opportunities and social services given that their only means
of transport is by foot. Given its size, Kampala presents particular challenges. With a rapidly
increasing population (an estimated 4.5 percent per annum) and an even faster increase of
motorization, the Kampala Metropolitan Area is rapidly moving towards total gridlock.

4.25. Uganda still has very low usage of air and rail transport infrastructure compared to
its peers. Airline departures per capita and rail lines (length per square kilometer) are much lower
than other countries with comparable GNI per capita (figures 4.28 and 4.29). Moreover, inland
waterways transport remains underdeveloped.

ICT: Access to mobile telephony has increased substantially but use of the Internet is still
limited.

4.26. Mobile telephony increased from less than 1 percent in 2000 to 53 percent in June
2014 in response to major policy reforms in the ICT sector. The government established an
independent regulatory body, the Uganda Communications Commission, fully liberalized the
telecommunications market, and implemented a technology-neutral converged licensing
framework. The government has also completed the implementation of Phases I and II of the NBI.
As a result, nearly 14 million Ugandans used mobile money platforms in 2013 with the value of
transactions up 40 percent year-on-year (figure 4.30). Government agencies, development
partners, and the private sector in Uganda are already experimenting with a wide variety of mobile-
based technologies to improve public service delivery. For example, the United Nations Children’s
Fund’s ICT4D (ICT for development) tools include mTrac (a nationwide mobile disease
surveillance and malaria tracking tool), EduTrack (a platform for tracking school performance
data) and a few others. The Grameen Foundation is leveraging mobile technology to provide
targeted agricultural extension services to farmers.

4.27. However, there is low broadband adoption and limited access to mobile broadband
services in rural areas. The number of Internet users has increased but broadband is currently
available only in some (mostly urban) areas of Uganda and the current level of broadband prices
is not low enough to be truly inclusive (figure 4.31). Hence, there is a risk that the
bottom 40 percent of population in Uganda will remain excluded from the information revolution
that is shaping the modern world. Increasing access and lowering costs will require increased
investment in the backbone infrastructure.

Land: Land disputes, lack of planning for land use, and lack of appropriate property valuation are
the key constraints affecting the functioning of land markets in Uganda.

4.28. Rights to land remain mainly insecure and land markets are underdeveloped. While
land registration in Uganda is advanced relative to SSA, it remains significantly below Western
Europe standards. Rehabilitation and modernization of land administration is at an advanced level
for cadastral surveying and registration but is still in the early stages for topographic surveying
and mapping, land use planning, and property valuation. While as much as 20 percent of Uganda’s
land is registered, compared to only about 10 percent in Africa as a whole but much lower than
the 95 percent in Western Europe, Uganda has relatively high land tenure insecurity characterized
by unclear property rights and land disputes. The reengineering, computerization, and
decentralization of cadastral and registration services has reduced the time needed to register
property from 227 days in 2007 to 43 days in 2014. However, persistent land disputes and
prevalence of micro farms have constrained the incomes of the poor and those in the bottom 40
percent and limited the prospects for commercialization of agriculture. Land dispute resolution
services are understaffed and underfunded. Underdeveloped property valuation and high land-
compensation costs have resulted in difficulties in acquiring land for public use. In addition,
customary practices in Uganda prevent women from owning or inheriting land. Rectifying this
situation will require changes to the legislative framework, sensitization and public awareness
campaigns, and implementation.

4.29. Inefficient functioning of land markets have, in part, resulted in disorderly
urbanization and proliferation of informal settlements and slums. More efficient operation of

                                                56
 
land markets will help efficient urbanization and will permit households to rent their land so as to
become mobile between rural and urban areas. In addition, government handling of urban land has
lacked transparency and undermined land markets.

                                                               D.   ACCESS TO FINANCE

Although financial inclusion of Ugandan households stood at 85 percent in 2013, formal bank
inclusion was only 20 percent. In addition, 65 percent of the population lacked access to credit,
limiting their ability to smooth consumption in the face of shocks.

4.30. In 2013, 85 percent of the adult population aged 16 years and above were financially
included, an improvement from 70 percent in 2009. Formal inclusion was 54 percent in 2013,
compared to 28 percent in 2009.36 This improvement in financial inclusion was largely driven by
mobile money financial services. The increase occurred from half a million subscribers in 2009 to
14.2 million in December 2013, representing over 80 percent of the adult population with access
to money financial services. Overall, 76 percent of Ugandans in urban areas use financial services
at bank and non-bank formal institutions, while this number is only 49 percent for residents of
rural areas (figure 4.32). There are however no differences in financial inclusion based on gender.

     Source: Financial Sector Review (World Bank 2015e).

4.31. However, formal bank inclusion did not increase over the years and there are large
disparities in this area among the rich and the poor. Formal bank inclusion was 20 percent in
2013 compared to 21 percent in 2009. Given the high costs of expansion to rural areas for formal
bank institutions in Uganda, formal bank inclusion was 36 percent for urban areas compared to

                                                            
36
   There are four major categories of financial service usage: (a) formal financial institutions regulated by the Bank of
Uganda (BoU) - Tier I–III; (b) non-bank formal financial institutions (for example, savings and credit cooperatives
[SACCOs], non-regulated microfinance institutions, insurance, mobile money services); (c) informal institutions (for
example, money lenders, savings clubs); and (d) the financially excluded, that is, persons who do not use either the
formal banks or non-bank formal or informal institutions.

                                                                         57
 
only 17 percent for rural areas. Less than 14 percent of the adult population in the bottom 40
percent has access to a formal financial institution (compared to an average of 37 percent in the
top 60). The gap by education level is even wider, with about 40 percent of those with secondary
or higher education banked versus just 20 percent for those with primary education or lower.
Gender differences exist and are quite important as well, with a 10 percentage point difference
(figure 4.33).

4.32. In terms of borrowing, the majority of adults in Uganda are unserved and the
percentage of adults who used credit declined from 2009. A slightly higher percentage of adults
used formal sources of borrowing (5 percent in 2009 compared to 12 percent in 2013), while the
share of adults who used informal methods declined and the majority of them became unserved.
Lack of access to the formal financial market makes it difficult for households to cope with short-
terms shocks such as illness, loss of employment, drought/irregular rains, and landslides (figure
4.34). It may also be a significant barrier to their ability to invest in building human and other
physical assets or to start and operate a small business. Estimations from the UNHS 2012/13
suggest that the majority of the population rely on friends/relatives and SACCOs when they need
financial assistance. The predominance of SACCOs is more pronounced in the northern and
western regions whereas in the central region, it is more common for people to seek a loan from
friends/relatives. As mentioned before, the lack of access to formal sources of borrowing is also
explained by the land tenure system which is dominated by mailo land tenure that is unsuitable as
collateral by banks.

4.33. The fear of debt is the single largest reason why people do not borrow. The Finscope
survey shows that the high cost of loans is the second biggest factor for not taking loans. On the
other hand, a lot of the people do not qualify for loans because of the high collateral requirements
(87 percent), mostly immovable, such as titled land, and most of the land in Uganda is not titled
(80 percent). Financial illiteracy also plays a role—when in dire need, people end up borrowing
from loan sharks and do not have the capacity to shop around (figure 4.35).

Social spending in Uganda is low, has very limited coverage, and is largely financed by donors.
This has limited investments in human capital, has impacted income and consumption, and led to
intergenerational transmission of poverty.

4.34. Total social spending in Figure 4.36. Government and Donor Spending on Social
Uganda was 1.2 percent of GDP in Safety Nets as a Percentage of GDP
2013 which is relatively low. Nearly       5.0

shocks. Spending on social security        1.5

amounted to 92 percent of all social       1.0

countries in Africa spend around 2.8
percent of GDP on social security.37 Uganda’s total spending on direct income support amounted
to US$88 million in 2013 or 0.40 percent of GDP (figure 4.36) compared with the 1.1 percent
spent in other LICs in Africa and 1–2 percent of GDP, globally. Only 4.5 percent of the total
population received any kind of direct income support.

4.35. Donors constituted the largest source of financing for social protection in 2013. Nearly
42 percent of funding for social protection in Uganda comes from donor agencies, 35 percent from
the government, and 23 percent from individuals. Notably, donor funding is allocated to direct
income support and social care services, while government funding is almost entirely allocated to
the private service providers (with a small allocation to social care and support services).
Individual contributions are made to the National Social Security Fund.

4.36. Uganda’s heavy reliance on donors to finance direct income support and social care
and support services is resulting in a stop-start approach to programming and contributing
to the high cost of implementation. Most programs are less than five years old, have recently
incurred or are in the process of incurring start-up costs, and, because they are new, have limited
institutional knowledge. Furthermore, most programs are either implemented directly by external
agencies or with substantial contract assistance. Not only do these agencies cost more than using
preexisting government systems to implement a program but also they often invest in creating
temporary institutions just for the lifetime of the programs rather than in building long-term core
systems.

4.37. Only 5 percent of the working population are part of a pension scheme. Contributory
social security coverage is currently largely limited to a small proportion of those in the formal
sector. The pension sector is confined to those in government employment or those employed by
organizations with more than five employees. As a result, only 29 percent of wage earners
contribute to or are part of a pension scheme. In comparison, the proportion of the labor force
covered by a contributory pension in other countries ranges from a high of 51.6 percent in
Mauritius to a low of 1.5 percent in the Central African Republic. Insurance coverage in the health
sector is even smaller with less than 1 percent of the population covered by health insurance or
prepayment schemes. These schemes are largely private except for the community-based health
insurance schemes that exist in 17 districts in the central and southwestern regions.

                              F.   OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCLUSION

The single largest opportunity to improve inclusion is by enhancing the performance of the
agricultural sector which supports most of the poor.

4.38. A significant increase in public social spending is needed to enhance education and
health outcomes and provision of infrastructure services and social protection. Such an
increase in unlikely in the short to medium term because of fiscal constraints and competing
demands for the limited fiscal revenues. Uganda’s tax collections are relatively low and large
increases in revenues are unlikely. Oil revenues certainly hold promise, but they are not expected
over the next 10 years or so. Hence, fiscal constraints will be binding in terms of provision of
public services.

4.39. Even if the government had the resources to spend, building human capital takes
time. Typically, improved outcomes on health and education are visible after a long lag but quick
improvements can be achieved in the provision of infrastructure services, if resources are available
and spent wisely. Nevertheless, long-term and sustainable development requires significant
investment in human capital.

4.40. While the GoU balances priorities in the social and infrastructure sectors, focused
interventions are needed in agriculture. These interventions will help boost the incomes of the
poor and those in the bottom 40 percent. The poor, and particularly those in the north and east of
the country, derive most of their income from agriculture and an increase in farm incomes can
have a far-reaching impact on their well-being. Agriculture as an opportunity was identified based
on team discussions and past and ongoing analytical work, particularly, ‘Promoting Inclusive
Growth in Uganda’, 2012.

              Agriculture

To boost farm incomes of the poor and those in the bottom 40 percent, investments need to be
concentrated in rural roads, sustainable land and water management (including irrigation), and
extension services as well as land tenure security and rental markets, particularly in the north and
the east.

4.41. The majority of the poor report farm income as their main source of income. Despite
the modest performance of the sector (box 4.2), household survey data shows substantial growth
in real per capita agricultural incomes and their contribution toward poverty reduction.38 The key
drivers of crop income changes were favorable weather conditions and high prices for agricultural
commodities, in addition to an increase in the land area under cultivation. Improvements in access
to markets and extension services also seem to have helped.

4.42. With the exception of the communally owned lands in the north, there are limitations
to further increases in land under cultivation and an increase in productivity is needed to
increase agricultural production and support commercialization. Uganda faces low land and
labor productivity in agriculture. TFP in agriculture has steadily fallen in Uganda and is now minus
0.4 percent whereas other countries in East Africa and overall for SSA showed increases. In
particular, labor productivity in Uganda declined and land productivity improved marginally (table
4.2). The yield potentials in Uganda are much higher than actuals and the poor performance is
attributable to very low use of modern inputs, poor agricultural infrastructure, limited value
addition, weak market linkages with very high associated costs, and low levels of human capital
in the sector. Ugandan farms can double production of some important commodities and quadruple
production of others merely through the adoption of yield-enhancing technologies that are already
available. The share of agriculture in GDP has halved from 50 percent in 1990 to 25 percent today.
However, the share of population dependent on agriculture has remained constant at 70 percent.
As a result, agricultural output per worker has declined.




                                                            
38
  The data from the national accounts often contradict the data from the household surveys. For example, according
to the UNHS, maize and bean yields increased between 1999/00 and 2004/05, but according to the national accounts,
they decreased. These conflicting data highlight the weaknesses of the official statistics in Uganda and indicate the
need to improve the collection of agricultural statistics.

                                                               61
 
    Box 4.2. The Agricultural Sector in Uganda
    On average, the performance of the agricultural sector in Uganda has been rather modest and the sector has been
    characterized by low yields and weak value chains and market linkages. There are about 500,000 smallholder farmers.
    Nearly 90 percent of the farms average between 0.5 and 2.5 ha. Owners of these micro farms lack access to the capital
    necessary to buy tools, fertilizer, or machinery. Most of the farming is at the subsistence level. Recent trends and
    experiences in other developing countries suggest that farmers can increase their earnings through commercialization and
    crop and market diversification. Commercialization in Uganda will require farmers to move away from subsistence
    farming through improvements in productivity with the use of modern equipment, sustainable land and water
    management, and improved quality inputs (fertilizers and seeds) as well as better skills and access to finance. However,
    progress within the farm will not be sufficient as linkages with markets also need to be strengthened through better
    transport and storage (post-harvest loss is estimated at 40 percent) infrastructure, transparent and competitive value
    chains, and consistent government policies (including taxation). Public expenditure on agriculture remains low at 4–5
    percent of total government expenditure. Crop and market diversification is also important as it will help farmers to hedge
    their risks. A shift toward high-value vegetables or fruits can also bring additional jobs and foreign exchange.
    Improvement in agricultural productivity will need to be combined with sustainable use of water and land to address
    environmental issues.
    There are differences in regional agricultural production (figure 4.37). The best performing region is the west, which is
                                                                                    well-equipped not only with good natural

4.43. Input use has been limited because of poor quality and availability, cost
considerations, and output price unpredictability. Maintenance of many rural roads has been
inadequate, keeping the costs of inputs (such as fertilizers, seed, and chemicals) high and farm
prices low. There is also a problem of poor quality of many agricultural inputs, including

                                                                       62
 
counterfeits. The low availability of quality inputs and their high input prices, which require
significant cash advances, is therefore too risky for many smallholders and even large farms
because of volatile weather and output price unpredictability. As a result, the use of modern
technologies remains modest. In addition, extension services can play a significant role in
removing information asymmetries and ignorance on input use. Also, improved access to finance
in agriculture can help but a majority of the farmers will not be creditworthy given the
predominance of subsistence agriculture. These investment and policy measures need to be
underpinned by strengthening of land tenure security, rental markets, and institutions for land
administration. In the north and, to a lesser extent, in the east, local group owners of communal
land need to be formalized and their land registered. This will protect the land rights of local
communities while also encouraging access to communal land by non-community members
through rental arrangements, including long-term leases for investors.

4.44. Further investments in access to markets and extension services are also needed. The
transaction costs of moving commodities internally and across the border must be lowered and
reliable linkages between Ugandan producers and prospective purchasers in the domestic, EAC,
and COMESA markets established. There is also a need to provide effective extension services to
supply farmers with the necessary knowledge and information on effective use of the inputs. The
existing extension program, which was supported by the World Bank, gradually lost effectiveness
and credibility (because of corruption and mismanagement) over the past five years. It was
formally dismantled last year (from its institutional home at the semiautonomous institution of the
agriculture ministry called the National Agricultural Advisory Service) with the plan to rebuild
extension services from scratch within the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industries, and
Fisheries     and     the     district government. This      process    is    ongoing—for     now
extension is still essentially absent—but a new program will be put into place (over the course of
the next 1–2 years). So lack of extension is at present an important constraint.

4.45. Weather and agricultural prices are given risks and these risks can be hedged by crop
diversification or formal, but costlier, insurance. Crop and market diversification are useful
tools for the poor to hedge risks arising from weather- and price-related risks. The availability of
weather-related insurance products are, however, limited and deter investments in agriculture.
Exposure to natural hazards such as droughts and floods is a key risk for the agricultural sector in
Uganda and the irrigation infrastructure is underdeveloped. Index insurance is a relatively new but
innovative financial product for insurance provision that pays out benefits on the basis of a
predetermined index (for example, rainfall level, seismic activity, livestock mortality rates). The
benefits paid out depend on the loss of assets and investments, primarily working capital, resulting
from weather and catastrophic events, without requiring the traditional services of insurance claims
assessors. However, the cost of buying such insurance will largely be beyond the means of the
subsistence farmers.

4.46. Investment in irrigation facilities can also help reduce weather-related risks, to an
extent, and will support agricultural commercialization. Uganda, generally enjoys two rainy
seasons, March–May and October–December, leaving much of January–March and June–October
dry. Statistics indicate that only 1 percent of the ordinary farmers and 5 percent of the commercial
farmers use irrigation facilities. Uganda is a water-rich country and investment in irrigation
facilities can improve agricultural incomes significantly and will also contribute to strengthening
food security.

                                                63
 
4.47. The agro-processing industry also holds potential for the poor and vulnerable
population. Uganda processes only 1 percent of its agricultural produce and meat processing is
also limited. The constraints faced by the agro-processing sector are similar to those faced by the
agricultural produce sector in terms of lack of access to markets, poor transport and storage
infrastructure, inadequate access to finance, and pests and diseases.

4.48. Lending to the agricultural sector has exhibited an upward trend since 2009 but its
share in the total credit to the private sector remains low. Total agricultural lending by
regulated institutions almost tripled from UGX 291 billion in 2009 to UGX 837 billion in 2013.
The majority of the lending was for short-term marketing activities through invoice and warehouse
receipt financing products. However, lending to the agricultural sector accounted for only 8 percent
of the total lending to the private sector in 2013. The low level of lending is primarily a reflection
of the agricultural sector in Uganda which is dominated by smallholder farmers with low and
irregular average incomes and few agro-processing/value addition firms. The establishment of the
agricultural credit facility with the aim of promoting agricultural commercialization was
instrumental in providing medium- and long-term financing on favorable terms (through banks)
for farming and agro-processing. The bulk of the loans financed through this facility went toward
investments in agro-processing machinery. However, lending to smallholder farmers remains
limited because of the high interest cost (30 percent) and associated fees and collateral and
guarantor requirements. Accelerating systematic land registration will increase the country’s
registration rate and expand the supply of collateral and access to collateral-based credit for many
smallholder farmers.

          PROGRESSING SUSTAINABLY ON THE TWIN GOALS IN UGANDA

5.1.    It is important to make the growth and inclusion process sustainable to avoid
reversals in the gains made in poverty reduction and shared prosperity, and also to make
further progress on them. Making growth sustainable will require accumulation of wealth and
effective management of resources. Addressing the large infrastructure gaps and poor social
service delivery will require improvements in public sector management, particularly fiscal
management, and governance. Similarly, an increase in per capita income will be aided by a
reduction in the fertility rate. These challenges, which need to be addressed to progress on making
the twin goals sustainable, are discussed in this chapter.

5.2.    Wealth accumulation is crucial for making growth sustainable. This is particularly so
in a natural-resource-abundant and dependent country like Uganda. This abundance and
dependence is likely to increase further with the advent of oil. Sustainable management of these
natural resources is required to effectively transform them into productive infrastructure and
human capital. This highlights the importance of natural resource management, fiscal
management, and public sector management for sustainable growth and progress on the twin goals.

5.3.    In the Ugandan context, social cohesion and effective management of fertility are also
crucial elements of sustainability. The significant differences in the standard of living of
residents in different parts of the country, the influx of refugees from nearby countries, and a
growing labor force with inadequate jobs, could result in social instability. Also, the high fertility
rate has stretched the limited resource base of households and the government and has lowered
asset accumulation of the citizens. A sustainable improvement in the standard of living of Ugandan
citizens is unlikely with the existing fertility rate.

                           A.       WEALTH ACCUMULATION IN UGANDA

Uganda has increased its wealth per capita by 30 percent during 2000–10.

5.4.    Wealth accounting measures the stock of assets a country uses to generate income.
The total wealth of a nation includes produced capital, natural capital, and intangible capital.
Produced capital essentially covers the infrastructure base of a country and includes machinery,
structures, equipment, and urban land. Natural capital includes agricultural land, protected areas,
forests, minerals, and energy. Intangible capital measures human, social, and institutional capital.
While produced capital and natural capital can be observed, intangible capital is derived as the
residual of the net present value of consumption (box 5.1). Compared to the GDP which measures
the flow of income accruing to a country within a year, wealth accounting measures the stock of
assets a country uses to generate its income.

    Box 5.1. Wealth Estimates - Methodological Note
    The idea of wealth can be conceptualized in the same way as GDP. However, some components are not observable
    and must be deducted. Total wealth is the present value of future consumption, and the sum of all the wealth
    components must equal this value. A basic decomposition of wealth may look like this:
                       Total Wealth = K + V + NFA + IC,
    where K is produced capital, including machinery, equipment, structures, and urban land; V measures natural
    capital (energy resources, minerals, timber, forest, crop land, pasture land, and protected areas); NFA stands for net
    foreign assets, and IC for intangible capital. The latter can be estimated as a combination of human capital and rule
    of law. In practice it is calculated as the residual of the above equation when total wealth is estimated as the present
    value of future consumption,
                                
                                                                 .
                                 C (t )  e
                                                 (st )
                                                            ds
                                t

    It is important to note that future consumption is not easy to measure. Therefore, in practice the estimate for present
    value of future consumption is calculated in a way to mimic a situation where the economy is on a sustainable path
    (that is, where savings offset capital depletion). In order to do this, researchers use 5-year averages centered on the
    year of interest (in order to smooth out any irregularities in consumption) and afterwards adjust the savings/
    consumption breakdown to reflect a sustainable consumption path. For a more detailed discussion on the
    methodology used to estimate wealth, please see Annex A in the World Bank publication: “The Changing Wealth
    of Nations.” 2011.

5.5.    Uganda’s total wealth per capita grew by over 30 percent between 2000 and 2010,
largely driven by an increase in produced capital and an expansion of pasture lands.
Produced capital grew by an average annual rate of 6.4 percent per capita. In addition, Uganda’s
natural capital grew due to a rising size and value of its crop and pasture lands which grew by an
average annual rate of 4.9 percent per capita since 2000. However, this was offset by significant
deforestation. Between 2000 and 2010 the overall value of Uganda's forests fell by 26 percent.
Intangible capital, which includes human capital among others, remained constant. Uganda’s total
wealth is low compared to other countries in SSA. In 2010, Uganda’s total wealth per capita
(excluding oil) amounted to US$7,190. In the absence of oil, Uganda’s total wealth per capita
(measured as the discounted per capita consumption expenditure over the next 25 years) would
have risen by only 12 percent in real terms from 2009/10 to 2014/15 compared to 26 percent in
real terms over the same period if the discovery of oil is taken into account. This is below most of
its peers in East Africa, and well below the largest economies in SSA. In addition, the share of
intangible and produced capital in total capital is relatively low. While this reflects the reliance on
agriculture, it also highlights the need to invest in physical and human capital that can deliver
higher and more sustainable income levels.39

5.6.   The discovery of oil will provide an opportunity to raise produced and intangible
capital in future years. Uganda’s GDP grew at an annual average of 7 percent since 2000, but
unlike most of the other SSA countries with similar growth patterns, Uganda’s economic growth
was not driven by the depletion of nonrenewable natural resources but by high rates of investments
in produced capital. Rents from nonrenewable natural resources over the last decade remained
almost negligible, amounting to less than 0.001 percent of GNI in 2012. The beginning of oil
production at the end of this decade will change the situation. Oil prospects boosted Uganda’s total
                                                            
39
  According to the ‘Changing Wealth of Nations’, 2010, the wealth per capita of Uganda increased by 39 percent
from 1995 to 2005. Uganda’s adjusted net savings was however, negative during this period but it is not fully
representative as it does not include agricultural land and some forms of intangible capital (which includes human,
social and institutional capital).

                                                                     66
 
wealth by 17 percent. To maintain this new level of wealth in the long run (that is, beyond the 25-
year horizon used to calculate total wealth), Uganda needs to build up other forms of capital as oil
reserves are gradually depleted. If the depletion of oil reserves is not matched with increased
investments in other forms of capital and leads to an increase in consumption, Uganda will
experience a decline in its overall wealth in the long run.

       B.    MANAGING NATURAL RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

Land degradation, deforestation, and threatened biodiversity are the key concerns on
environmental sustainability.

5.7.    With the majority of the poor and those in the bottom 40 percent dependent on
agriculture, sustainability of the natural environment is crucial in Uganda. With a lack of
access to electricity, the poor are also dependent on the forests for their energy needs. Natural
resources are important in the Ugandan context. The country has an abundance of water resources
which is crucial for hydropower generation and other uses, the discovery of oil is a potential game
changer, the rich biodiversity offers tourism opportunities, fisheries provide livelihoods, and there
are also other minerals which are being mined. However, the country is also vulnerable to droughts
and floods.

5.8.    On carbon-dioxide emissions which are critical on the climate change agenda, Uganda
is much lower than countries with a similar level of GNI per capita. According to the fourth
inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report, Uganda’s temperature is likely
to increase on average by up to 1.5°C in the next 20 years and up to 4.3°C by the 2080s. Based on
the climate change models, predictions indicate an increase in rainfall of 10–20 percent over most
of the country with a decrease expected over the semiarid cattle corridor. This could aggravate
existing vulnerabilities. However, Uganda’s level of CO2 emissions are low, much lower than that
for SSA, and could be attributable to the low level of industrialization, very limited access to
electricity and dependence on hydroelectric sources for electricity generation (figure 5.1).

5.9.    For electricity generation, Uganda’s use of fossil fuels is comparable to other
countries with a similar level of GNI per capita and is comparatively higher in the use of
hydro resources, which enables a less carbon-intensive energy mix. At the current rapid
growth, demand for electricity is expected to surpass the current available generation capacity by
2016 (figure 5.2). The generation capacity shortfall over the medium term is expected to remain
until the planned large hydropower plants of Karuma (600 MW) and Isimba (183 MW) are
commissioned around 2018. As an additional effort to avoid power shortages and reliance on
expensive rental power plants, the GoU is also promoting the development of small private power
producers that can be commissioned faster and could be developed simultaneously without
imposing financial and managerial burden on the GoU (figure 5.3).

5.10. Nearly 46 percent of the land in Uganda is severely degraded. Land is increasingly
being transformed because of agricultural expansion (conversion to croplands and pastures, and
so on), unsustainable agricultural practices, expansion of urban areas, and other pressures. Average
soil erosion is estimated to exceed 5 tons per ha per year, and the associated soil nutrient loss is
particularly pronounced because most of the nutrients in tropical agriculture are in the top 5 to 10
centimeters of the soil. This has significant implications for the agricultural sector.

5.11. Between 2005 and 2010, Uganda lost an estimated 88,000 ha of forest each year or 2.6
percent of forest cover per annum. It lost over 40 percent of its forest cover over the past two
decades largely due to fuel wood/charcoal consumption, clearing for agriculture and timber for
construction. Parts of Uganda are beginning to suffer a deficit of fuel wood. Fuel wood or charcoal
now needs to be transported from more distant areas. The women in many poor households now
have to walk over 1.5 km each day to gather fuel wood and often of lower quality. In addition,
when forest cover is removed, the loss of ground cover results in soil erosion and nutrient leaching
during rains, making reforestation and farming difficult.

5.12. Significant overharvesting has resulted in a 50 percent decline in the catch of the Nile
perch on Lake Victoria since the mid-2000 peak. Increasing fishing effort is exerting pressure
on capture fisheries, leading to a decline in fish stocks and catches prompting the use of destructive
fishing gears and technologies and employing extra-fishing power to chase few fish. This has

                                                             68
 
resulted in increased investment costs in fishing operations. This situation is fueled by the open
access fish management regime, climate change, water pollution, and invasive species. However,
there are opportunities for some of these pressures to be addressed through the development of
aquaculture.

5.13. At the national level, Uganda has an abundance of water resources but increasingly
suffers from localized water stress and pollution. Water resources are abundant in Uganda but
are not accessible because of poor infrastructure. Uganda’s total renewable water resources are
about 43 billion m3 out of which about 13 percent is sustainable groundwater and the balance is
surface water. With withdrawals at only 1 percent of renewable annual water resources, there is
scope to increase the use of water for agricultural and industrial purposes as well as to cater to
increased demand of water from urbanization. However, given that water resources are highly
variable in time and space, addressing these competing water uses will need to be managed
carefully. Water management is even more critical given the recent occurrence of floods and
droughts and reduced water availability due to climate change. The quality of surface and
groundwater in Uganda is generally good but it has been declining, particularly for Lake Victoria,
due to pollution from domestic and industrial waste, agricultural run-off and poorly constructed
sanitation facilities. In addition, wetlands in the country are being degraded at an alarming rate
reducing their ability to provide critical goods and services.

5.14. Wetlands around the Lake Victoria and Kyoga drainage basins are threatened. The
main causes are uncontrolled land reclamation for agricultural and industrial activities, and the
expansion of human settlements. This is exacerbated by weak enforcement of existing laws and
regulations. Degraded wetlands lose their ability to store/absorb water and prevent flooding, clean
water and support the provision of crops, fish, and plants. Loss of wetlands and near-shore
pollution in Lake Victoria threatens the productivity of its fisheries as well as its tourism potential.
Periodic infestations of water hyacinth, can have particularly severe impacts, blocking virtually all
economic uses of the Lake in severe cases, and contributing to further deterioration of water
quality. Wetland losses are not currently well-documented.

5.15. The country’s rich biodiversity is under threat because of poaching, land use changes,
mining and more recently from oil discovery. As the natural resources in non-protected areas
dwindle, protected areas are the remaining repositories of fuel wood and forage and are becoming
a focus for poaching, illegal grazing and other activities. Land use changes that degrade or destroy
habitats and cut off migratory routes through deforestation, overgrazing, pollution, expansion of
agricultural and urban areas, and unsustainable harvesting (for example, medicinal plants and non-
timber forest products), amongst others have affected the country’s biodiversity. Uganda’s oil
discoveries are in a prime area rich in biodiversity and ecotourism assets (Albertine Graben) and
pose an environmental concern.40

  The petroleum resources discovered in Uganda so far are mainly located within national parks and wildlife game
reserves such as the Murchison Falls National Park which is the second most visited tourist destination in Uganda and
the Queen Elisabeth National Park which is the largest National Park in Uganda.


                                                               69
 
                                  C.   FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY

Fiscal sustainability will hinge on: (a) increased domestic revenue generation to reduce
dependence on external aid in financing the budget; (b) improved allocative and financial
efficiency of the budget by implementing clear and transparent PFM rules and systems; and (c)
prudent management of oil revenue.

5.16. The fiscal deficit has averaged 3.3 percent of GDP during FY2011–14 while public
debt at 28.9 percent of GDP in FY2014 indicated low risk of debt distress. Grants, which
accounted for about 5.4 percent of GDP in FY2006 reduced to only 1 percent in FY2014. This
decline in aid is partly explained by the suspension of budget support by development partners in
response to the governance issues that emerged in 2013. This suspension has now been lifted.
Given low domestic revenue generation and a decline in grants, the fiscal deficit was contained by
reducing recurrent expenditures which declined from 12.7 percent of GDP in FY2011 to 9.8
percent in FY2014. The successful implementation of reforms undertaken in the context of the
highly indebted poor countries initiative and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative contributed to a
drastic decline in external debt, from an average of 63.5 percent of GDP in FY1999/2000–2005/06
to 12.6 percent in FY2006/07–2009/10. The most recent debt sustainability analysis for Uganda
indicates that the country faces low risk of debt distress.

5.17. At 11.9 percent of GDP in FY2014, total domestic revenue collection in Uganda is one
of the lowest in the region. The poor tax mobilization performance is attributable to an inefficient
tax policy and administration (figure 5.4) and the presence of a large informal sector. Uganda faces
a large shortfall in value added tax revenues because of statutory exemptions and poor
administration and enforcement of tax laws (IMF 2013). Some progress has been made on
removing tax exemptions and increasing excise on some products but there is a need to bolster tax
administration through improvements in audit coverage, audit risk criteria and better compliance
management by focusing on sectors with the highest revenue potential. Improved tax
administration becomes even more crucial to better manage the oil windfall.

     lead to higher GDP growth
     rates. That is, higher growth would be achieved using fewer resources. PIM systems need to improve, with regard
     to strategic guidance for public projects (alignment to the NDP priorities and adoption of minimum technical
     and financial standards), project selection, budgeting and implementation (integration into the budget cycle and
     medium-term expenditure frameworks), project audit, and evaluation. Improving the efficiency of PIM, with
     regard to project appraisal, selection, implementation and evaluation, would increase the fiscal space available
     to developing countries, like Uganda, to invest in vital infrastructure projects much needed for growth and
     development.

     The GoU has already taken steps to address the shortcomings in the area of PIM. The restructuring of the Ministry
     of Finance to create a department in charge of projects analysis and PPP is already a positive step forward. The
     World Bank is providing technical assistance for strengthening PIM to the GoU through a Department for
     International Development trust fund. The aim of this technical assistance is threefold: (a) develop public
     investment guidelines and manuals; (b) Capacity building; and (c) establish an institutional organization,
     framework and arrangements to improve PIM system. The following activities are being prioritized in the context
     of the technical assistance: (i) Simplified Manual for Public Investment Appraisal; (ii) PIM Framework with
     recommendations on how the government can improve the public management process to select better projects;
     (iii) Training activities in Log Frame Approach, Cost Benefit Analysis and Cost Effectiveness for public
     officials; (iv) Action Plan with recommendations to establish an institutional organization, framework and
     arrangements to improve PIM System.

5.19. Given the low level of revenues, the government has alternated between prioritizing
social spending and infrastructure expenditures. The period 1987–96 was characterized by
adjustment programs (fiscal restraint, tight monetary policy, and institutional reforms) aimed at
maintaining macroeconomic stability. It was followed by the prioritization of social expenditures
during 1997–2010 and then a move to infrastructure spending from 2011 to date. Since 2012, fiscal
policy has also been used to stimulate aggregate demand with an increase in development
expenditures from 6.1 percent of GDP in 2011 to 7.2 percent of GDP in 2014. However, with the
decline in grants over the years without a corresponding increase in domestic revenue, total
government spending (expenditure + net lending) declined from 18.6 percent of GDP in FY2007
to 16.7 percent in FY2014. However, Uganda needs to develop both physical and human capital
stocks to accelerate its socioeconomic transformation. Oil is therefore an opportunity to provide
additional government revenue to address some of the binding constraints to growth including
infrastructure, social capital, and skills.



                                                           71
 
5.20. While Uganda is eager to maximize the direct benefits derived from extractives, it
also needs to avoid the mistakes that other resource-rich countries have made. In fact, whilst
the opportunities are large, the pitfalls often associated with natural-resource-driven economies
can be equally challenging (see box 5.3). These pitfalls generally can manifest themselves in
different ways and have been termed as the natural resource curse: (a) real appreciation of the local
currency that undermines the competitiveness of other export industries and of import-competing
industries by encouraging imports; (b) increase in volatility due to oscillating oil prices in world
markets that harm investment and economic growth over time; (c) relative price increase in non-
tradable sectors compared to tradable sectors that causes a shift of resources from the tradable
sector to the non-tradable sector, starving the tradable sector of labor and capital; (d) increase in
rent seeking that results in socially inefficient spending and allocation of resources preventing
widespread sharing of resource rents; and (e) false sense of security driven by oil revenue inflows
that leads to a reduction in necessary human and social capital investments.

5.21. Given the risks associated with oil, diversified development - in the sense of a more
balanced contribution from institutions, assets, and natural resources, is the best way to
sustainably achieve the twin goals for Uganda. Achieving this contribution requires a strategy
articulated around 4 building blocks: (a) ensuring that oil revenues are able to ease the financing
constraints on critical social and infrastructure investments which currently face a difficult choice
between them; (b) strengthening of results orientation in the public sector to realize the benefits of
existing institutional reforms; (c) a reconfigured relationship with the private sector more focused
on the enabling environment with regard to regulatory institutions, market functioning, and
infrastructure; and (d) spatial policies which can calibrate a policy mix matched to the distinctive
needs of rural and urban areas and the foundational market institutions for each, especially
regarding land.

5.22. Sound oil revenue management stands on the two pillars of good governance and
strong PFM. Governance is particularly important because resource rents create perverse
incentives for the elites to appropriate them. Strong PFM is important for every country but it
assumes a more crucial role in resource-rich countries because resource revenues accrue to the
government in the first instance and get transmitted to the economy through the level, timing, and
composition of public expenditure.

5.23. After an initial period of ramp up in infrastructure spending, the government plans
to follow the permanent income rule to manage oil revenues. The permanent income approach,
which, if followed literally, comes down to restricting spending out of oil wealth to a level that
can be maintained over a long period of time. It essentially entails saving in good years and
dissaving in bad years by calculating a stream of income that is equal in net present value to the
projected revenues from oil. Since permanent income is relatively unresponsive to current oil
prices and oil production, the rule would automatically insulate the fiscal balance from current
developments in the oil sector. As a result, the rule would have the effect of smoothing out
government expenditure over time. However, implementing this approach will require a
strengthening of institutional capacity, which is particularly weak in Uganda.

Box 5.3. Risks Associated with the Extractives Sector
The gains from natural resources rents are normally dependent on the country’s state of governance as well as the
macroeconomic management capacity. If not well managed, like other natural resource booms, the discovery, and
extraction of oil may be synonymous with the ‘resource curse’ or ‘mixed blessing’. The Dutch disease is a
manifestation of the resource curse, which turns poorly managed natural resource wealth into a mixed blessing through
reduced long-term growth.
The resource curse works through different mechanisms, including (a) an overvaluation of the currency and (b) the
volatility of key economic aggregates, including exchange rates, export earnings, and output. If poorly managed, the
Dutch disease could impact the agriculture and the tourism sectors through exchange rate movements. The increased
supply of foreign exchange through oil may increase the price of a shilling to a dollar hence the capacity to buy
imported foods rather than producing food locally. Agriculture will contract over time, with regard to manpower and
share of GDP, as farmers adopt modern methods that necessitate fewer working hands to feed the population. Tourism
may face declining profitability as a result of (a) a real term appreciation of the shilling, discouraging tourists into
Uganda and (b) price hikes for services triggered by expatriate workers in the oil sector that may affect the economy
alike. The overall earnings from the sector may therefore decline following the benefits from the oil sector.
Volatility of commodity prices produces fluctuations in exchange rates, export earnings, output, and employment, and
discourages investment and growth. Like other natural resource-rich countries, depending on oil for export makes the
country like Uganda dependent on international price movements. Export price volatility is another reason why
natural-resource-rich countries may be prone to sluggish investment and slow growth. Similarly, high and volatile
exchange rates slow down investment and growth.
The other channels through which natural resource wealth (including oil) may prove to be a mixed blessing have been
identified to include (a) reduced sense of priority for the need to build up human capital though education and training;
(b) reduction in productivity gains due to poor quality of investment; (c) deterioration of social capital (for example,
good governance, independence of the judiciary, freedom of press, public trust, equality, low corruption, and political
freedom); (d) rent-seeking behavior that diverts resources away from socially beneficial economic activity; (e)
crowding out non-resource revenue; and (f) increasing spending pressures and subsidies that promotes inefficiencies
and inequalities.

                        D.    GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT

Governance and effective public sector management are not only a sustainability concern but they
also impact growth and inclusiveness. The key issue in the public sector is the policy
implementation gap which is the result of a lack of enforcement of sanctions which in turn is driven
by political incentives. In the existing circumstances, efforts need to be focused on relieving
technical constraints and putting legislative frameworks, structures, and institutions in place to
improve the accountability framework.

5.24. Uganda’s performance in PFM is good on transparency but weak on budget
credibility, controls, and compliance, essentially highlighting implementation gaps. The new
PFM Act 2014 will, if implemented, support faster progress to address these issues. The key
aspects of a good PFM system include macro-fiscal control and stability (macroeconomic
management), budget planning and execution (including monitoring and evaluation), procurement,
cash and debt management, financial systems and accounting, internal controls, and external
oversight. As indicated in the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment
of 2012, Uganda’s performance is strong in the following areas: budget documents are
comprehensive; the general public has access to key fiscal information, tax payers’ obligations and
liabilities are transparent, good accounts are kept, reporting systems are adequate and external
audits are extensive and of high quality. Uganda is doing well with regard to budget transparency

(ranking 18th out of 100 countries) but its PFM systems are weak with regard to budget credibility,
budget execution controls (particularly payroll), procurement compliance and legislative scrutiny
of external audit reports. In most of these areas, Uganda’s performance is below its East African
neighbors. The Auditor General’s annual reports regularly identify weak compliance with PFM
regulations, resulting in avoidable or wasteful expenditure, build-up of arrears, inadequate
accountability and, in some cases, the risk of fraud or misappropriation. To address the various
shortcomings in PFM, the government passed the PFM Act in November 2014 and implementation
of the provisions of this bill will help strengthen Uganda’s PFM framework.

reconciliation and facilitate a shift from cash rationing to more active cash and debt management.
Under a TSA arrangement, comparing expenditures with budget allocations is done through the
Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS). With only 77 percent of expenditures going
through IFMS, there remains a substantial gap that can be exploited. Some of the most significant
risks of wastage, errors, delays, and fraudulent losses are found in payroll and pensions
management. The government is committed to rolling out the IPPS, introducing biometric payroll
records for civil servants and decentralization of the payroll to improve accountability. Around 70
percent of public expenditures go through procurement systems that are affected by poor practices.
There is evidence of payments for goods or services that were not delivered and only 21 percent
of contracts have complete procurement records. There has been a significant improvement in the
quality of audits produced by the OAG. However, there is a large backlog of audit reports that are
not debated in the Parliament and these reports are not published, creating a missing step in the
accountability cycle. Some of the PFM measures adopted by the government over the past few
years has resulted in some improvements (table 5.2 and annex 4).

5.26. In the last two decades, the government has actively pursued decentralization,
anticorruption, and civil service and PFM reforms. These issues are not only important from
the lens of sustainable improvements on the twin goals but they also have a far-reaching impact
on growth and inclusion as discussed in chapters 3 and 4. Uganda was an early adopter of
independent revenue agencies, medium-term expenditure frameworks, public expenditure tracking
surveys, and results-oriented management mechanisms. During the mid- to late-1990s, Uganda
implemented a host of initiatives aimed at streamlining civil service and formalizing PFM systems,

                                                  74
 
which laid the foundation for a series of interventions introducing decentralization and
emphasizing service delivery.41,42 The 2000s saw the enactment of a plethora of laws with a view
to further improving PFM and anticorruption. More recently, in 2013, the government amended
the public procurement and disposal of assets legislation to enhance enforcement, improve local
content, and strengthen mechanisms for redressal by aggrieved bidders. In November 2014, the
government passed the PFM Act, which will be a key pillar for strengthening the overall budget
process and improving governance. In addition, FINMAP and other instruments are financing the
adoption of the IFMS and the IPPS. Furthermore, the GoU has continued to bolster its formally
robust anticorruption legislation, in addition to introducing a performance management approach
anchored on results-oriented management and output-oriented budgeting mechanisms.43,44

5.27. Governance, according to the World Bank’s CPIA, includes the four broad areas of
property rights, fiscal management, quality of public administration and transparency,
accountability and corruption.45 Property rights include both the laws and regulations for secure
property rights and the quality of the judicial system as an enforcement agency. Fiscal management
includes the quality of budgetary and financial management as well as the efficiency of revenue
mobilization. Both these aspects were discussed in the previous section (5C). Public administration
includes policy implementation and coordination with the larger public sector. The fourth area
includes the accountability of the public officials, access of civil society to information, and state
capture by vested interests (annex 3).

5.28. Laws and regulations related to property rights in Uganda are available online and
not changed arbitrarily but there is room for improving the judicial system. The index of
economic freedom, which measures an individual’s right to control his or her labor and property,
ranked Uganda 9th out of 46 SSA countries in 2014. Uganda is making progress in registering
                                                            
41
   Decentralization is anchored in the 1995 Constitution, the Decentralization Statute No. 15 of 1995, and the Local
Government Act of 1997.
42
   After the launch of a Civil Service Reform Programme in the early 1990s, the government focused on civil service
reform again in the late 1990s by implementing the Public Service Reform Programme, a new commitment to pay
reform, and efforts to introduce performance management mechanisms.
43
   Criminal responsibility for bribing public officials, diversion of public funds, influence peddling, or nepotism is
provided for in both the Penal Code Act and the Anti-corruption Act of 2009; The Leadership Code Act (2002), the
Anti-Corruption Act (2009) and the Code of conduct and ethics of the Ugandan Public service regulate conflict of
interest; also, the President, Ministers, members of the Parliament, judges, and civil servants, and their spouses, must
comply with asset disclosure requirements, in accordance with the Leadership Code Act. Furthermore, the Whistle-
blowers Protection Act of 2010 provides for mechanisms encouraging individuals to blow the whistle on corruption
cases; the Access to Information Act of 2005 provides every citizen the right to access information; and the Anti-
Money Laundering Act of 2013 penalizes money-laundering activities. In December 2014, the government passed the
Leadership Code Amendment Bill, which will allow for the enforcement of the asset declaration clause.
44
   As part of the implementation of the results-oriented management/output-oriented budgeting framework, the
majority of ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) and more than half of LGs have been able to develop Client
Charters, which are a valuable means for communicating expected service standards as well as improving service
delivery.
45
   The CPIA of the World Bank provides an assessment of the conduciveness of a country’s policy and institutional
framework to poverty reduction, sustainable growth, and the effectiveness in the use of development assistance. Its
focus is on the key elements that are within the country’s control. Countries are rated on a set of 16 criteria grouped
in four clusters: (a) economic management; (b) structural policies; (c) policies for social inclusion and equity; and
(d) public sector management and institutions. For each of the 16 criteria, countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to
6 (high).

                                                               75
 
land and has increased the percent of land that is titled to 20 percent, well ahead of other SSA
countries. However, land tenure insecurity remains mainly due to overlapping rights in the Central
region and lack of effective institutions to manage communal landownership predominantly in the
Northern and Eastern regions of the country. Since the land market has large ramifications for
urbanization, access to finance, and agriculture, among others, the government is taking steps to
accelerate systematic registration of land and rehabilitate and modernize land administration
including computerization of land registration, property valuation and physical development
planning. In addition, the Industrial Property Act was passed in 2014 to promote inventive and
innovative activities and facilitate the acquisition of technology. Uganda ranked 80th out of 189
countries in enforcing contracts, above the SSA average, as per the 2015 Doing Business Report.
However, it still takes 490 days to enforce a contract and costs 31.3 percent of the claim value. In
addition, judges are appointed by the President following recommendations from the Judicial
Service Commission. However, the appointment process lacks transparency and some key
positions remain vacant for long durations, weakening the system.

5.29. On the quality of public administration, key dimensions of the governance
environment have been declining since 2003, especially Uganda’s capacity to control
corruption. According to the World Governance Indicators, Uganda’s government effectiveness
and regulatory quality are on a declining trend. Similarly, the voice and accountability
environment, which improved between 2003 and 2008, is steadily deteriorating (figure 5.5).
Uganda’s capacity to control corruption appears to have reached an all-time low and is only above
that of Kenya’s, East Africa’s worst performer. The high prevalence of bureaucratic corruption
negatively affects the poor and was deemed the most significant obstacle to doing business in
Uganda in the latest Africa Competitiveness Report. Transparency International’s Global
Corruption Barometer Survey (2013) found that 61 percent of Ugandans had paid a bribe to one
of the eight institutions ((judiciary, education, tax services and customs, permits/registries, medical
services, police, land services or utilities) in the last 12 months (figure 5.6). The average value of
small bribes paid was approximately 20 percent of citizen’s annual income (IG 2014). In addition,
the fact that public sector wages are low compared to their private sector equivalents and even by
African standards, creates obstacles for the acquisition of talent, encourages public servants to seek
supplementary sources of income to the detriment of performance, and incentivizes corruption.46




                                                            
46
   As a whole, the wage bill represents about 4 percent of GDP, compared to an average across Africa of about 6.5
percent for central government and 9.8 percent for all government.

5.30. The quality of the decentralization framework has worsened since 2005, negatively
impacting service delivery. Given that a significant portion of public services is delivered through
LGs, the country’s decentralization framework is a key determinant of service quality. Since 2005,
policy reversals have weakened LG’s discretionary powers and reduced financial and human
resources at the district level. These policy reversals have included the near-elimination of local
revenue base, reduction of transfers to LGs, increase in conditional grants, and the creation of new
districts, mostly for political patronage (World Bank, 2013e). 47 Uganda is also marked by
inequality across districts in terms of public spending per capita. For example, in 2010, public
spending on health differed by a factor of 11.5 across districts, and public spending on education
differed by a factor of 6.3. The increase in conditional grants has made the process of allocation
of money to districts ad hoc. Own revenues account for 10 percent of the total revenues of local
self-governments, another 10 percent are unconditional grants while the remaining 80 percent are
conditional grants. The low tax base has eroded bottom-up accountability to the citizens while the
                                                            
47
  The real per capita budgets of the districts fell about 10 percent over 2003/04–2011/12. Transfers to LGs declined
as a share of central government spending from 25 percent to 20 percent over 2003/04–2011/12. District own-source
revenues declined over 2003/04-2011/12 with the abolition of graduated tax and the suspension of taxation of owner-
occupied dwellings (World Bank 2014b).

                                                                         77
 
large share of conditional grants has made the system opaque and vulnerable to corruption. In
addition, LGs are characterized by weak management systems, blurred lines of accountability,
political interference, and a lack of compliance with PFM and procurement rules. This is worrying
as good governance at the local level in Uganda, including receiving unqualified audits at the
Auditor General’s Annual Report, is associated with more efficient education and health provision
(World Bank 2013e).

5.31. Uganda’s main public sector management challenge is to bridge the implementation
gap which is primarily the result of failure to impose sanctions. In practice, public institutions
in Uganda tend to perform poorly, the acquired capacity is underutilized, and laws are not fully
implemented. For instance, Uganda has one of the biggest implementation gaps when it comes to
anticorruption legislation in East Africa (Global Integrity 2011, figure 5.7). Further, the general
breakdown in accountability relationships and impunity for low-performing or corrupt civil
servants is one of the main factors contributing to poor service delivery in Uganda. Some
supervisory mechanisms do exist, such as the inspectorates in the public service, LG, judiciary,
and education sector, but these are often poorly resourced and overwhelmed by the magnitude of
the problems. There is often no follow-up to reports and Inspectors have little or no power to
enforce or act where they find poor performance. The persistence of very high absenteeism among
health and education workers, as well as the failure to sanction officers responsible for the lack of
compliance with PFM rules is a great illustration of this malaise.

5.32. The key obstacle to effective sanctioning is a lack of political incentives. The lack of
political incentives goes a long way towards explaining why the public service, decentralization,
anticorruption, and PFM reforms have not yielded the expected results.

5.33. Detection is the strongest link in the accountability chain in Uganda while sanctions
are the weakest link. The accountability chain has three fundamental stages: first, detection -
Office of the Auditor General, Public Accounts Committee, and Public Procurement and Disposal
of Public Assets Authority; second, investigations - Central Intelligence and Investigation
Department and Inspectorate of Government; and third, criminal and administrative sanctions -
Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court, IG, Department of Public Prosecutions, and Ministry
of Public Service. Detection is the strongest link in the chain in Uganda and investigations is
                                                            78
 
adequate, but the power and functioning of the sanctioning authorities needs to be ramped up
significantly and they need to be free from political interference.

5.34. Citizen engagement, CSOs, and the media have not had much impact in improving
accountability. Inspectorate of Government’s citizen reporting mechanisms, including the free,
mobile phone-based anticorruption hotline and the social accountability committees, showcase the
government’s efforts to support a critical mass of informed citizens to demand good governance.
This has increased the number of corruption complaints but not much has been done about it.
Similarly, the impact of ‘Demand for Good Governance’ interventions have depended on the
degree of information that the government has been willing to share and their alignment with the
political incentives faced by the Government. Stimulating citizens’ demand for good governance
without a commitment to closing the feedback loop can contribute to citizen apathy. Since 2006,
the freedom of media organizations to monitor corruption appears to be on a declining trend as
reflected by the Freedom of the Press which showed a decline in Uganda’s ranking from 104 to
110 from 2012 to 2013 (Freedom House 2014). The government also has a productive relationship
with CSOs working on budget transparency, procurement, and anticorruption issues.

5.35. The government is cognizant of the weaknesses in the accountability chain and is
taking measures to address some of them. In 2013, the government improved conditions for
imposing criminal and administrative sanctions by appointing a Director of Public Prosecution and
fully constituting the Inspector General of Government (IGG). In addition, the fact that the
government has shown its support for the Department for International Development’s
Strengthening Uganda’s Anti-Corruption and Accountability Regime program – which will,
among others, provide technical assistance to the institutions within the accountability chain –
further demonstrates its commitment to deter corruption. The key technical constraints in the
accountability framework, which the government is willing to work on, include (a) legal
constraints (amendment of the Anti-Corruption Act to facilitate the recovery of stolen funds and
assets); (b) inadequate case management systems to effectively deal with the caseload; (c) weak
technical skills (especially regarding investigations and prosecutions); (d) insufficient staffing
levels and resourcing; and (e) the need to strengthen mechanisms within OAG and the Public
Accounts Committee to clear the backlog of audit findings.

5.36. The country has not performed well on the four broad World Bank CPIA governance
indicators: property rights, fiscal management, quality of public administration and transparency,
accountability and corruption. Various interventions are needed to sustain the gains made on PFM
and to strengthen the governance systems. The country’s judicial system needs to be improved and
the capacity to control corruption should be strengthened. Public sector management should also
better address the growing implementation gap—partly resulting from failure to impose
sanctions—and civil society and media should be better equipped to enforce accountability. These
challenges need to be addressed together with progress in implementing governance reforms. This
will be particularly important in preparation for oil production to avoid any risk of the Dutch
disease and other negative consequences as experienced elsewhere.

5.37. Addressing the technical constraints will help but a perceptible change in governance
will result only if the incentive framework changes. The government is on the right track by
focusing its efforts on improving legislation and putting adequate structures and institutions in
place. These institutions will become more effective whenever conditions for change are more

conducive. Meanwhile, efforts to improve the PIM, PFM, and accountability framework,
introduction of performance-oriented approaches, and greater citizen demand for accountability
will certainly help.

The key to reducing fertility is to promote programs which combine education and vocational
training for women together with training on family planning and health. However, fertility
preferences are rooted in social and cultural values and will take time to reduce perceptibly.

5.38. Uganda has one of the youngest and most rapidly growing populations in the world,
resulting in a high youth dependency ratio. The total fertility rate is estimated at 6.2 children
per woman (figure 5.8). About half (48.5 percent) of Uganda’s population is younger than 15, well
above SSA’s average of 43 percent and the world average of 26 percent (box 5.3). Both the high
level of fertility and the youthfulness of the population results in a very high youth dependency
ratio which is 45 percent higher among the bottom 40 percent of the households compared to the
top 60. The country’s population growth rate, currently at 3.3 percent, has also been steadily above
Africa’s average, except during the period of peak prevalence in HIV/AIDS in the early 2000s.
Uganda’s population is expected to increase from about 38 million in 2014 to 60–70 million in
2030, depending on the fertility rate dynamics (figure 5.9) and its population density will increase
accordingly.48 While population density in the rural areas is not critically high right now, it might
become a problem in future.

5.39. The increasing population has taken a toll on household and government finances.
Households have found it difficult to save and have not been able to invest much on human capital
which has in turn limited their income-generating capacity. Given the scarcity of Uganda’s fiscal
resources, the government has found it difficult to invest in both infrastructure and social services
in adequate amounts. An increase in one of these categories of investment leads to gaps in the

  Life expectancy in all scenarios is assumed to increase from 57.9 to 66.9 years between 2010 and 2030; total fertility
rate is expected to decline from 6.2 in 2010 to 3.4 (low variant), 4.4 (medium variant), or 5.4 (high variant) in 2030.

                                                                          80
 
other. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the government focused its efforts on social services until it
became apparent that the country’s infrastructure required urgent attention.
 
    Box 5.4. Stylized Facts on Fertility in Uganda
       Uganda’s fertility rate at 6.2 children per woman is one of the highest in the world
       Fertility in urban areas—and especially in Kampala—is lower
       Education is a significant predictor of fertility and so is the increase in the age when the first sexual
        intercourse occurs
       Increasing contraceptive use made a significant impact on fertility
       Fertility is negatively correlated with access to electricity
       Women who earn some cash from their work have fewer children than those who do not and female labor
        participation increases the age at marriage and decision making by women in the home.

5.40. So far, Uganda has not been able to capitalize on its large and young labor force. The
25 years and above population in Uganda has an average of only 4.7 years of schooling. In addition,
there is a lack of productive jobs to employ the youth given the constraints to doing business and
the large informal sector. An increase in the working-age population has the potential to increase
GDP growth, boost savings, and enhance human capital.

5.41. Combined interventions which target improvements in labor market outcomes of
women along with increased use of contraceptives and family planning services have the
largest impact on fertility. A program (Empowerment and Livelihoods for Adolescents, for
women between the age of 13 and 21 years) designed to provide vocational training along with
awareness on life skills to build confidence, effectively manage time and finances, and improve
health found a 72 percent increase in employment, 26 percent lesser likelihood to have a child, and
a 43 percent drop in having sex against their will among program participants, in 2 years. In
addition, fertility decline also tends to be associated with a decline in infant and child mortality
rates because as the number of births per woman falls, maternal and child health outcomes
improve. Investment in girls’ education, laws promoting gender equality, large-scale use of
contraceptives, effective communication campaigns, and improvements in health services are
crucial to reduce fertility.

5.42. However, fertility choices are rooted in social and cultural norms and will take time
to change. Nevertheless, efforts at reducing fertility need to be accelerated because it is a big drain
on the limited resources of Uganda. Bangladesh managed to achieve a spectacular decline in
fertility rate from 6.3 births per woman in 1975 to 2.3 in 2011 (box 5.4).

    Box 5.5. Bangladesh’s Success in Reducing Fertility
    Bangladesh managed to achieve a spectacular decline in fertility rate from 6.3 births per woman in 1975 to 2.3 in
    2011. Fertility decline in Bangladesh was accompanied by sharp reductions in infant and child mortality and an
    increase in life expectancy.
    The key driver of fertility decline was an aggressive and supply-driven family planning program which provided
    doorstep delivery of contraceptives along with improved family planning service delivery. As a result, contraceptive
    prevalence in Bangladesh increased from 8 percent in 1975 to 61 percent in 2011.

                      F.   REGIONAL PEACE AND SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY

The main risks to social sustainability arise from the lower level of assets among households in
Northern Uganda, fewer opportunities for income generation, influx of refugees, and the large
youth population coupled with a limited number of jobs.

5.43. Systematic exclusion of certain groups from the growth process can exacerbate the
divide within the population. Although Northern Uganda has been enjoying relative peace and
stability after decades of conflict, there are elements of fragility that are rooted in the societal
dynamics and other drivers of conflict. Several communities are still in a state of latent conflict,
often driven by new and long-standing grievances, poverty, perception of marginalization,
competition over national resources, and societal fracture as a result of the legacies of the decades
of violent conflict. This violence created vulnerable groups (like orphaned children, widows, ex-
child soldiers, unemployed youth, internally displaced persons, returnees, and those born in
captivity in Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) hideouts who have limited access to public services
and limited assets.

5.44. The high levels of poverty and youth unemployment pose particular political, economic,
and social challenges to peacebuilding in Northern Uganda. A large percent of the population in
Northern Uganda is currently under 18 years of age, with limited or no education and skills
(International Alert 2008). Over 80 percent of youth in Northern Uganda have limited employment
opportunities in the formal sector due to low qualification levels. Traditional subsistence farming
is unfamiliar to many young people who have grown up in the camps. Others have mainly military
experience, having been either abducted by the LRA or recruited into local militias by the
government. Youth have very limited access to and control over key assets, including land and
physical and human capital (Advisory Consortium on Conflict Sensitivity (ACCS) 2013). In
addition, land disputes are pervasive in Northern Uganda, making up roughly 94 percent of the
cases before local courts. This aggravates the risk of future armed conﬂicts as young people are
unable to secure an income and become an easy target for recruitment into armed rebellion. The
inability of the youth to fully benefit from the economic opportunities in Northern Uganda
reinforces economic marginalization (International Alert 2008). In addition, the presence of
disenfranchised youth, many former combatants, with high illiteracy rates, and no hope for a
future, turning to crime and antisocial behavior drives conflict by increasing insecurity in
communities (Advisory Consortium on Conflict Sensitivity (ACCS) 2013).

5.45. Compared to the rest of the country, Karamoja still suffers disproportionately from
insecurity. For decades, it has suffered high levels of conflict and insecurity, alongside low levels
of development and serious challenges to individual well-being. Apart from being affected at
certain points by the conflict between the LRA and the GoU, groups living in Karamoja have also
been involved in cycles of cattle raiding and counter raiding. At various times, pastoralist or semi-
pastoralist groups living across the border in Kenya and South Sudan have also actively
participated in these attacks (Saferworld 2010).

5.46. A large influx of refugees, over the years, has led to conflicts between the host
communities and the refugees. As a result of ongoing conflicts and instability in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Somalia, and South Sudan, Uganda is currently hosting over 420,000 refugees
and asylum seekers making it the third largest refugee-hosting country in Africa. Of the total,

                                                 82
 
188,000 are Congolese mainly hosted in Southwest and Midwest Uganda, and 154,000 South
Sudanese mainly hosted in Adjumani, Arua, and Kiryandongo districts. Uganda has a generous
and progressive refugee policy framework. The 2006 Refugee Act and 2010 Refugee Regulations
entitle refugees to work, to move freely, and to access social services, including access to
documents such as government IDs, and birth, death, marriage, and education
certificates. Refugees in the southwestern part of Uganda reside in gazetted settlements and are
provided with a subsistence agriculture plot, albeit of diminishing size due to overcrowding. On
the other hand, most of the South Sudanese refugees in northern and northwestern Uganda are
accommodated in settlements on communally-owned land and are provided with a little more than
a small kitchen garden. Refugees can own property and enter into contracts including land leases.
However, refugee communities typically suffer from lower agricultural productivity and greater
environmental degradation due to poor climatic and soil conditions and/or overuse. Their access
to basic social and infrastructure services is also limited because of remoteness. The presence of a
large number of refugees has its own economic, social, and environmental impacts on the host
communities and has contributed to conflict between the refugees and host communities.

5.47. Uganda’s youth, who are on average better educated than their parents, can pose a
challenge to social stability if they are not productively employed, especially in urban areas
where inequalities are bigger and more visible. As described earlier, Uganda will see a rapid
increase in its workforce from 20 million to over 60 million between 2015 and 2060. With
universal primary education access and improvements in secondary and tertiary enrollments, this
young workforce is likely to be better educated than the previous generations and will therefore
demand better economic opportunities. If such expectations are not managed efficiently, they can
be a potential source of social instability.

                                  PRIORITY AREAS FOR ACTION

                             A.    SUMMARY OF KEY CHALLENGES

6.1.    Since returning to peace and stability in the mid-1980s, Uganda has made important
progress by adopting more market-oriented policies and implementing a range of
courageous reforms that have contributed to achieving and sustaining macroeconomic
stability. Uganda has dramatically reduced poverty and improved its human development
indicators over the last two decades.

6.2.    However, a large number of Ugandans are still living in extreme poverty—and what
is of even greater concern is the proportion of the population which is vulnerable. Still many
Ugandans are living on subsistence farming or dependent on small enterprises with very low
productivity that provide incomes that are dangerously close to the poverty line. Many vulnerable
groups are exposed to extreme shocks whose impact is exacerbated by a very weak social
protection system in the country.

6.3.    The growth and transformation challenge for Uganda is embodied in the fact that the
proportion of the population employed with formal small and medium enterprises and in
large enterprises is growing far too slowly to provide enough productive opportunities for
the fast-growing labor force. Moreover, the productivity performance of formal firms continues
to decline (it went down by 19 percent between 2001 and 2010). The vast majority of Ugandans
remain employed in low-productivity subsistence agriculture or in unskilled services that do not
provide sufficient income to climb the ladder of economic empowerment. Every year more than
300,000 Ugandans graduate from universities and technical colleges, only to end up in low-
productivity and low-paying jobs.

6.4.    Uganda’s economy needs to become more productive and more diversified. At the
same time, growth needs to be more inclusive if Uganda is to make progress on the twin goals.
The SCD’s diagnosis shows that Uganda will not move to the next level of the development ladder
without addressing constraints to (a) capitalizing on emerging and prospective drivers of growth,
notably oil, regional integration, ICT, and urbanization; (b) inclusion of all its citizens in the
development process—including in the lagging regions; and (c) ensuring sustainable management
of its human, financial, institutional, and natural resources. The growth model for most of the last
twenty years reliant on consumption underpinned by government spending, has reached its limits.
The economy needs to create more productive jobs and improve the business environment for a
more vibrant private sector to invest and create new businesses.

6.5.    The strategies prepared by the government and the plans to further reduce poverty
and accelerate inclusive growth have been generally sound. However, there is a widening
implementation gap that is leading to a deterioration of public services to the general population.
For example, the government has rightly placed infrastructure and education at the center of its
strategy but overall spending per primary school student remains below the average in LICs. This
may explain low completion rates and poor quality of services with a large proportion of children
unable to read or write correctly when they graduate from primary schools. Shortcomings in PIM
impede delivery of infrastructure, which is central to the government’s strategy.

sustainability are summarized in table 6.1. These challenges have been identified in the
preceding chapters and come from the existing evidence base and analytical work on Uganda. The
challenges listed represent a streamlining of the pervasive constraints discussed in the preceding
chapters.

                                 B.    PRIORITIZING AMONG CONSTRAINTS

6.7.     There are several binding constraints facing a poor, infrastructure-deficit, and
landlocked country with low educational attainment, a high disease burden, and weak
institutions. These constraints coupled with a limited resource base make it imperative for the
government to prioritize its interventions. The prioritization of constraints in this SCD is primarily
based on the impact of the constraints on the twin goals of reducing poverty and boosting shared
prosperity. This is, however, not a recommendation to the government to abandon ongoing or new
efforts in the non-priority areas.

6.8.    The prioritization process included a review of the evidence, consultations with
stakeholders in Uganda, and team discussions. The starting point for the prioritization process
was the evidence and analysis presented in the report. This was used to identify the key challenges
in the growth, inclusion, and sustainability domains. A first round of consultations was held with
the government, academia, CSOs, and the private sector on the main constraints and opportunities
facing Uganda (annex 2). The team then used informed judgment to prioritize the constraints. A
second round of consultations was also held with the stakeholders during which most of the
identified constraints were reinforced. The priorities reflected in the SCD represent the collective
judgment of the team which has significant institutional memory on Uganda and the process is
more an art than a science. These priorities are also reinforced by the existing evidence base and
analytical studies (annex 6).

6.9.     The prioritization process resulted in the identification of eight priority areas which
are summarized in table 6.2. The proposed priorities are mainly based on their linkages with the
poverty story and the need to ensure continued progress on the twin goals in the future. These
priorities are in the area of (a)  macro-fiscal stability, (b) agricultural productivity and
commercialization, (c) consumption smoothing, (d) public service delivery, (e) urbanization, (f)
fertility reduction, (g) private sector competitiveness and diversification, and (h) public sector
effectiveness. Under each of these priority areas a set of actions was also proposed.

                                         C.        CONCLUDING REMARKS AND KNOWLEDGE GAPS

6.7.   The proposed eight areas of priority pathways are derived from the analysis
presented in this report and the significant amount of knowledge on Uganda accumulated
over the years. It is also important that these priorities are flexible enough so they can be adapted
as new knowledge emerges during implementation.49

6.8.   Mentioned below are some of the knowledge gaps that emerged during the SCD
process. These gaps can be filled through future advisory services and analytics work.

              (a) Informality in Uganda. Most of the poor and those in the bottom 40 percent work in
                  the informal sector. However, very little is known about the informal sector in Uganda
                  beyond anecdotal evidence.

              (b) Malnutrition and income levels. While Uganda has made some progress, malnutrition
                  is higher in the richer regions of central and western Uganda. The issue needs to be
                  analyzed further and appropriate programs may need to be developed.

              (c) Attitudes. It will be useful to understand better the disincentives to work that poor
                  people face and what can be done about it. 

              (d) Agricultural statistics. The agricultural sector is crucial to achieve progress on the
                  twin goals and there is considerable room to improve agricultural statistics.

 Flexibility and adaptability can be built on the approach sketched out by Matt Andrews, Lant Pritchett, and
Michael Woolcock, “Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation”, Kennedy School, Harvard.

    (e) Value chain analysis for specific sectors. This can include growth sectors (identified,
        for example, by a product space analysis or similar studies) to help address market and
        coordination failures and to prioritize investments.

    (f) Climate variability and change. The current and future climate represent risks (and
        opportunities) for planning, designing, and implementation. There is a need to identify
        and incorporate appropriate methodologies for addressing these risks.

Annex 2: Summary of Consultations with Stakeholders

Introduction

Uganda’s economic and socioeconomic progress over the last three decades represent a mixed bag
of positives and negatives. While growth has averaged 6 percent over the last two decades and
poverty has more than halved from 56.4 percent in 1992 to 19.7 percent in 2013, the level of
vulnerability at 43.3 percent in 2013 was still high. Besides, between 2005 and 2006, more than
60 percent of the people who had moved out of poverty fell back. Furthermore, poverty by
international standards of US$1.25 a day is relatively high at 30 percent. On the social and human
capital development aspects, while enrollment rates increased from 65 percent in 1995 to 86
percent in 2013 and the percentage of underweight children below the age of five reduced from
25.5 percent to 13.8 percent, overall service delivery remains a daunting challenge. Absenteeism
of staff in public facilities (education and health) remains high as the facilities themselves lack
basic ingredients like drugs, water, and electricity.

Realities like those described above, point to non-inclusive growth and hence is difficult to sustain
as it is bound to not only lack local momentum but also lead to social and political tensions related
to lack of shared prosperity. The benefiting class will want to capture more of the national assets
and opportunities such as land, education, and employment/business to keep the momentum. The
changing ownership of the basics of economic production pose a threat of accelerating inequality,
which, in Uganda, has increased over the last two decades as shown by the deterioration of the
Gini coefficient from 0.36 in 1993 to 0.40 in 2013.

Objectives of the Consultation

Resolution of the current state and realization of the twin goals of ending extreme poverty by 2030
and increasing shared prosperity called for fulfilment of the following two objectives.

       (a) Obtain a detailed diagnosis and hence explain the dilemma of a mixed bag of good and bad
           results.
       (b) Adopt a new thinking that will help prescribe reforms for a better future.

Approach of the Consultation

To meet the two objectives, a two-pronged strategy was adopted. First, there was a need to analyze
available data as well as compile evidence from existing reports to get a clear description of the
current state of development outcomes. This process provided an initial SCD report that set a basis
for the stakeholder consultation. The consultation formed the second part of the strategy.

The Bank engaged in consultations with a large and diverse group of stakeholders during March
and April 2015. 50 The consultation too, had two main related objectives: (a) to obtain an
explanation of what people thought was responsible for the observed outcomes, and (b) what will
be the drivers of shared and inclusive growth going forward.

                                                            
50
  The stakeholders included government officials (both political and technical) at the central government and LG
levels, private sector, civil society, communities at the grassroots, and donors.

                                                               95
 
To get candid objective opinions, the stakeholders were engaged in separate meetings, whenever
possible, in a manner that allowed for progressive appreciation of the development aspects. For
example, engagement began with the political and technical teams involved in the planning and
design of programs for certain specific objectives. This was followed by donors and CSOs who
monitor results from an independent view and finally the communities which are the direct
beneficiaries of the outcomes.

The selection of LGs was informed by the need to address the social, cultural, and development
diversities in the country. For example, Buliisa and Kotido are in hard-to-reach areas with poor
infrastructure, limited development, and yet with great opportunities and potential for the future.
The two districts also reflect the effect of cultural orientations on development as most of the
people are inclined to a non-diversified source of livelihood.

In northern Uganda, Gulu District and Municipality and Kotido District in the northwest were
selected to represent a post-conflict situation. In this region, the recovery and reconstruction efforts
may have contributed to the mixed results. Significant financial injections have been made through
Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF) I&II, Northern Uganda Reconstruction
Programme (NURP), and now Peace Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP). Based on the
interviews and physical observations, it is inferred that though poverty has declined, both welfare
and vulnerability have not improved..

Two other areas of Bushenyi (in the west) and Mbale (in the east), represented areas, which have
had peace over the last three decades, are highly accessible in terms of infrastructure, and have
relatively high levels of education and social amenities. However, these districts also portray a
need for new approaches to the development process given the numerous socioeconomic problems
identified during the consultations.

Findings

To ease the reading, the findings have been analyzed in selected thematic areas under the following
two broad categories: explanation for the observed development outcome and possible drivers of
future growth. The themes range from strong government and governance through cultural
attitudes and individual mindset.

Explanations of Past Performance
Participants were asked to share their views on what they considered to be the most outstanding
three/four things that have been responsible for past progress in the country. This subsection
presents a synthesized summary of the responses.

The Positives
    (a) Improved transport infrastructure especially trunk and feeders roads. Most areas of
        the country have become accessible albeit with considerable difficulty in a few places. The
        road network has improved greatly over the last three decades rendering rural agricultural
        places fairly accessible to traders of both outputs and inputs.



                                                  96
 
    (b) Commercialization of agricultural products that were traditionally meant for local
        food consumption. In addition to commercialization of crops such as maize and beans and
        revival of the livestock sector, there has been an introduction of new high-value crops like
        oil seeds and upland rice; poultry; and piggery among others. The increase in urbanization
        and the opening up of regional food and livestock markets in South Sudan, Rwanda, and
        Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have facilitated the growth trend.

    (c) The peace dividend across the country and more recently in northern Uganda has a
        lot to explain about the growth. The relatively high level of peace and security compared
        to the period before 1986, and 2006 in the case of northern Uganda, has enabled households
        and communities to focus on long-term asset-building and development activities. These
        include: education, adoption of new farming technologies, improvements in housing, and
        other productive investments in transport and communication sectors. The massive private
        sector investments in education, health, trade, and housing have increased the scope of
        opportunities for the general public to tap into the development process.

    (d) The large financial resources including donor support contributed to general service
        infrastructure that increased access to basic social services. Access to education, health,
        and water facilities has increased despite the lingering challenges of quality and
        consistency. Decentralization contributed toward distribution of resources to rural and
        previously remote areas but was largely unable to deliver the required levels and quality of
        public services. The weak governance and associated corruption were reported as great
        contributors to unequal distribution of quality services and impact.

The Negatives
    (a) There was a general lack of adequate focus on development challenges in rural areas.
        It would appear that most of the development rhetoric and planning was based on high-
        level ideas such as macroeconomic stability; big infrastructure projects such as roads,
        irrigation, and rural electrification; and privatization and liberalization of markets. Yet,
        local-level development is hampered by big knowledge gaps, limited access to critical
        finance, intense poverty levels, limited relevant skills, and ineffective markets.
        Participants argued that the policy framework neglects specific regional and cultural
        characteristics of land tenure and related conflicts, inadequate local personnel required for
        service delivery, chronic poverty, and limited diversification of economic opportunities.
        For example, in Buliisa and Kotido, communities had spent decades depending on fishing
        and nomadic pastoralism, respectively. Furthermore, high-level quality education and
        health services are constrained differently and hence require various efforts across the
        country.

    (b) Weak government and governance systems at both the national and local levels have
        undermined the development objectives. Effective decentralization is an essential
        aspect of a rural development strategy that is capable of facilitating poverty reduction. A
        strong government, especially at the local level is necessary to fine-tune policies and
        invoke necessary bylaws to anchor the development process.




                                                97
 
    (c) Vulnerability among some groups or in certain areas needed special strategic
        interventions. A number of households/communities needed strategic support to leverage
        the broad-level investments in infrastructure. Despite special programs for northern
        Uganda such as Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF), Northern Uganda
        Reconstruction Programme (NURP), and Peace, Recovery and Development Plan for
        Northern Uganda (PRDP), many households failed and continue to fail to link up to the
        big government programs, in sectors like roads, markets, education, and health facilities.

    (d) The poor still have limited resources and are voiceless in the light of weak and
        ineffective local institutional structures. The years of civil strife and now continued
        politicization of the local development processes have undermined community leadership,
        sharing of opinions, and provision of guidance and insight, among others. Therefore,
        many local areas lack the civil and intellectual capacity required to implement
        development programs.

    (e) Difficulties in establishing a homogenous and cohesive national and local sense of
        nationalism and unity. Participants underscored that conflicts surrounding questions of
        cultural and tribal identity, nationality, and internal immigration existed. These had
        created divisions in society, partly based on a feeling of exclusion and marginalization,
        and had adversely affected social stability. Better governance, in particular, more
        equitable access to justice was essential to instilling a sense of homogeneity and cohesion
        in society.

    (f) A difficult business environment related to inadequate infrastructure, poor access to
        financial services, and weak business management skills. The difficult business
        environment across the country continues to undermine the birth and sustainable growth
        of both big industries and micro small and medium enterprises. While constraints exist
        across a number of areas, the most problematic areas concern the insecurity of land tenure
        and relations between the government and the private sector that have raised a lot of
        mistrust, access to finance, logistics, and lack of technically skilled labor. The
        development of micro small and medium enterprises—many with limited managerial and
        technical capacity—and the shortcomings in agricultural input chains have prevented
        progress in many rural areas.

    (g) General apathy and resignation by communities has undermined innovation and
        instead fueled alcoholism and gambling/betting practices. Many youth and older
        persons have resorted to non-development practices like selling of productive assets
        hoping for quick wins in urban areas—land for petty trade or motorcycle transport. While
        some have succeeded, many have fallen by the wayside indicating an increase in risky
        behavior and practices.

Recommendations of Drivers of Future Growth

    (a) Reconstruction of the social, cultural, and psychological structures will be critical for
        leveraging the physical infrastructure. The population needs to appreciate the logic of
        development as not only being the hardware in terms of physical infrastructure but also the
        individual personal drive toward success.

                                                98
 
    (b) Service delivery in the social sectors of education and health needs to improve by
        resolving ‘small’ but critical binding constraints. These include remuneration and
        motivation of health workers, supervision of staff to eliminate absenteeism, and increasing
        the supply of basic services. Revival of health and school inspectors can go a long way to
        impart the necessary skills and focus on grassroots delivery of basic services by both the
        government and communities.

    (c) Reviving effective governance across all levels of government will be critical for future
        development to deliver sustainable inclusive growth. Local-level public institutions
        require realignment that is more focused toward actual and not hypothesized service
        delivery. The focus should be on better facilitation of service facilities such as schools and
        hospitals rather than on high-level meso-institutions such as district offices, which are
        supposed to supervise the delivery of social services.

    (d) Provision of infrastructure remains critical but should be tailored and harmonized
        toward local conditions and solutions. Provision of solar energy for lighting, feeder
        roads, and rain-water-harvesting facilities was seen as being more reliable, sustainable, and
        appropriate for most areas, the immediate needs of which included lighting, charging
        phones, news, and entertainment. The districts with power did not seem to have any
        significant difference in terms of development, despite power being available for many
        years. Over the medium term, the government should focus on the provision of basic
        infrastructure required to trigger sustainable and inclusive growth for the bottom 40
        percent.

    (e) Resolution of land tenure and management of proceeds from natural resources,
        mainly extractives, is key for inclusive growth. Most of the population still lack skills
        and assets required to tap into the service sector and hence have to rely on primary growth
        from natural resources. The ownership of and access to land and sharing of associated
        wealth from natural resources, requires redress to strengthen both transparency and
        involvement of local communities in the receipt of benefits.

    (f) Access to finance by the local communities is key and requires building of sustainable
        local financial institutions that are well-integrated into the national-level financial
        infrastructure. The government and other stakeholders need to enhance systematic
        capacity building to enable growth and where possible, graduation of local financial
        institutions such as Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) and SACCOs to
        more effective and well-managed institutions. While the VSLAs and SACCOs are low cost
        in operation, they have limited ability to trigger greater traction needed to propel poor
        households into inclusive sustainable development.

Annex 3: CPIA Assessment

The CPIA of the Bank provides an assessment of the conduciveness of a country’s policy and
institutional framework, to poverty reduction, sustainable growth, and effectiveness in the use of
development assistance. Its focus is on the key elements that are within the country’s control.
Countries are rated on a set of 16 criteria grouped into four clusters: (a) economic management;
(b) structural policies; (c) policies for social inclusion and equity; and (d) public sector
management and institutions. For each of the 16 criteria, countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low)
to 6 (high).

Following a decline from its 2012 score of 3.8, Uganda’s CPIA rating in 2014 remained steady at
3.7, the same as its 2013 score. The main difference between 2014 and 2013 was the improvements
on the public sector management and institutions cluster, which increased from 3.0 to 3.1, mainly
explained by improvements in the quality of budgetary and financial management (that is, from
3.0 to 3.5). However, this is not reflected in the overall score. Its highest score among the clusters
is with regard to economic management and structural policies where it scores 4.2 and 4.0,
respectively. Its relative policy weaknesses are in the areas of public sector management and
institutions and policies for social inclusion/equity where it scores 3.1 and 3.7, respectively.
Among the 16 specific criteria, Uganda scores the lowest on transparency, accountability, and
corruption in the public sector (2.0) and the quality of public administration (3.0).

Annex 4: Public Financial Management

Uganda’s PFM system is anchored in the recently enacted PFM Act, which includes among
others, provisions on commitment controls, management of natural resource rents, and
improvement in the budget preparation calendar. Effective PFM is also essential for the efficiency
of service delivery and implementation of public projects, which will facilitate the proper planning,
execution, and monitoring of the activities needed to bring about diversification and achieve the
economic objectives of government. It also creates further fiscal space by reducing wasted
resources and enabling better targeting of funds to where it is needed most and improving the value
for money. Key aspects of a good PFM system include macrofiscal control and stability
(macroeconomic management), budget planning and execution (including monitoring and
evaluation), procurement, cash and debt management, financial systems and accounting, internal
controls, and external oversight. Underpinning all PFM functions is required for an effective legal
and regulatory framework and its implementation through individuals and their application of rules
required for the systems to work effectively.

Uganda’s performance in PFM is strong on transparency and weakest on budget credibility,
controls, and compliance. As indicated by the PEFA assessment in 2012, performance is
strongest in a comprehensive and open budget, public access to key fiscal information,
transparency of tax payers’ obligations and liabilities, maintaining a good accounting, recording,
and reporting system, and the high quality and scope of external audits. Moreover, the Bank’s
CPIA assessment revealed that Uganda scores the lowest on transparency, accountability, and
corruption in the public sector (2.0), quality of budget and financial management (3.0), and quality
of public administration (3.0). Internationally, Uganda performs well in budget transparency,
ranking 18 out of the 100 countries assessed across the world. PFM systems are the weakest
however, in budget credibility, budget execution controls (particularly payroll), procurement
compliance, and legislative scrutiny of external audit reports. On most of these aspects, Uganda
performs below its East African neighbors. Indeed, the auditor general’s annual reports of the
government regularly identify weak compliance with PFM regulations, resulting in avoidable or
wasteful expenditure, buildup of arrears, inadequate accountability, and, in some cases, the risk
(or actual identification) of fraud or misappropriation. These challenges and the opportunities to
address them are further outlined below.

Budget Planning, Execution, and Monitoring

Improving the quality and credibility of budget planning will help deliver national economic
objectives and support effective service delivery and development projects. At the highest
level of planning, the budget should be able to deliver national economic development objectives.
Nonetheless, there is still significant divergence between the NDP and the sector allocations in the
budgets, where in practice, security, public administration, justice, law and order, and interest
payments tend to exceed those planned, at the expense of priority growth and social sectors.
Furthermore, the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) is, in principle, prepared on the
basis of 5-year NDP priorities, including medium-term forecasts of revenue, grants, expenditure
by sector, and financing. In practice, however, the MTEF is still revised at least annually, adjusting
to changing economic conditions, uncertain forecasts, and under or over-execution of budgets.



                                                 101
 
The recently enacted PFM Act introduces a Contingencies Fund providing only for
unforeseen, unavoidable, and urgent requirements without destabilizing other budgets.
Nonetheless, part of the unpredictability of the annual budget is currently due to lack of internal
controls (discussed below) and dependence on the approval of supplementary budget requests,
resulting from weak controls and poor planning for expenditures such as utilities, taxes, and other
recurrent costs. While the government’s output-based planning system yields a lot of information
on outputs linked to expenditure items, further monitoring and feedback is required to review the
realism of cost estimates, take action to tackle arrears, establish unit costs, and develop a
methodology for planning of recurrent cost implications of investment expenditures.
Strengthening the linkage between immediate outputs and the required results (outcomes) at the
sector level is needed to be able to assess the effectiveness as well as the efficiency of the budget.
This should help make a stronger logical link between inputs, outputs, and actual results for growth
and diversification, such as how to design activities and outputs that will contribute to improving
agriculture productivity, education, and health performance and so on.

Cash and Debt Management

The introduction of the TSA arrangement should help promote greater transparency and regular
accounts reconciliation and reduce the risk of misuse (for example, of dormant accounts), which
have been a challenge in recent years. The TSA should also help facilitate a shift away from a cash
rationing system to more active cash and debt management. Cash rationing has been a further
cause (and result) of unpredictability in the budget, partly due to weak internal controls, but also
from inaccuracy of expenditure and revenue forecasts, requiring budget cuts (through issuing cash
limits) to pay for arising spending pressures through the fiscal year.

Attempts to break the cycle of excess recurrent spending and inadequate budget planning are
improving timely releases and resisting supplementary requests. Releases in FY2013/14 and
FY2014/15 have improved in timeliness and levels compared to planned and further improvements
to cash management have been achieved through quarterly cash flow forecasts and issuance of
quarterly ceilings to MDAs. Approved supplementary requests reduced to below 4 percent of the
originally approved budget in FY2013/14. The capacity of the new Cash and Debt Management
Directorate of MoFPED will need to be strengthened to develop better cash flow forecasts to
realize the full benefits of the TSA framework.

Strengthening Control and Compliance in Fiduciary Systems

Oil revenues, drawn from the Oil Fund into the Consolidated Fund will, among other
sources, finance the budget through the TSA arrangement. Under a TSA arrangement, the
control of expenditures against budget allocations is primarily through the IFMS. While unspent
balances are swept back into the main account for managing cash flows through the year, spending
agencies can only spend up to their budget ceilings and on the items appropriated by the parliament
and entered into the IFMS. To track expenditure and monitor budget execution, the IFMS needs
to be able to generate customized reports to demonstrate that funds were spent for the purposes
intended, even from funding sources that have specific conditions attached, for example, donor
projects.



                                                 102
 
Furthermore, not all entities are yet operating through the IFMS and therefore not under
the TSA. Excess expenditure can still be incurred through transactions undertaken outside the
system and/or spending nontax revenues without authority. With only about 77 percent of
expenditure going through the IFMS, there remains a gap in controls that can be exploited. Even
within the IFMS, the recent Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) case highlighted a number of
security issues that can lead to further fiduciary risks. Furthermore, there is evidence that some
MDAs regularly mischarge expenditures to the wrong codes to spend outside the budgeted
allocations without formal transfers. As noted in the auditor general’s special investigation report
on the OPM, more still needs to be done to address the existing lack of integration between the
accounting and budgeting systems, which leads to weaknesses in control over the release of funds
due to numerous manual interventions and lack of proper reconciliation. Payroll and pensions
management pose some of the most significant risks of wastage, errors, delays, and even fraudulent
financial losses, which are slowly being addressed, but with major delays. The government is
committed to rolling out the IPPS, interfacing the IPPS with the IFMS, introducing biometric
payroll records for civil servants as well as decentralization of the payroll to improve
accountability.

The government, through the PFM reform program (FINMAP) and the Bank, is also
committed to completing the rollout of the IFMS to all entities over the next 3–4 years. The
information technology audit is also being stepped up to tackle system weaknesses, such as use of
passwords, assignment of responsibilities, defense against cyberattacks, and so on. These issues
are expected to be further addressed through the strengthened role of internal audit, which has been
granted a directorate status in the new PFM Act and greater independence through direct reporting
to the secretary to the Treasury. Along with this, there is a need to ensure that the rollouts of these
fiduciary systems are being properly understood and implemented, through increased audit,
monitoring, and review. This also requires stepping up change management training, sensitization,
and communications to ensure responsibilities are understood, as well as more regular monitoring
of their use and effective incentives and sanctions to improve compliance.

Public Procurement

Procurement in Uganda accounts for around 70 percent of all public expenditure and is
critical to effective service delivery, but continues to suffer from poor practices. Unpredictable
and late release of funds can lead to underspending or rushed spending at year-end, making
procurement less competitive and more costly. This has been identified as one of the key
constraints to the efficient absorption of available funds and the credibility of the budget.
Furthermore, there is evidence of wastage within these contracts, including payment for goods or
services not delivered. The quality of contract management is weak, there are regular breaches of
procedure and unauthorized variations and only 21 percent of contracts have complete
procurement records.

There is some evidence of improvement in the performance of contracts audited by PPDA,
which rated 46 percent of contracts as satisfactory in FY2013 compared to 27 percent in
2011. Reforms to improve budget predictability and planning, as outlined above, should facilitate
improved procurement practices, appear to be making progress. Nonetheless, these efforts need to
be considerably strengthened and enforced more widely across the government to improve the
overall effectiveness of procurement. There is a need to balance efficiency and simplicity of

                                                 103
 
processes with effective controls and transparency. The government is committed to enforcing
bulk purchases and standardized unit costs to realize economies of scale, as well as enhancing
institutional capacity for project-cycle management and is assessing the potential feasibility and
benefits of introducing e-Procurement to enhance reporting and transparency. As with the effective
integration of other fiduciary systems, to ensure proper implementation and compliance, an e-
Procurement system should be interfaced or integrated with other systems, such as the IFMS and
accompanied by appropriate change management to reap efficiency and compliance benefits.

Quality and Independence of Oversight

Reforms to enhance the independence of external audits appear to have been successful in
improving the quality of audits produced by the OAG. The OAG was awarded the Swedish
National Audit Office Prize for the Best Performance Audit Report 2011 and in 2013. Audit
findings appear to be discussed more regularly in the press and other forums, including the
parliament. However, the parliament still has a significant backlog of audit reports that do not
receive adequate debate in the parliament and reports are not issued, creating a missing step in the
accountability cycle that prevents the appropriate follow up with the executive taking place.
Parliamentary processes need to be reviewed and streamlined for more efficient handling of audit
reports through the parliament and the inter-institutional linkages between the OAG and its
partners, such as investigation bodies and other regulators/auditors, for example, PPDA, need to
be strengthened to improve coordination and the focus of reporting toward risk and impact.

Complementary Public Sector Management

In addition to developing the systems for PFM, it is also critical to ensure that individuals
who operate systems and follow the rules and procedures understand their responsibilities
and are able to carry out their functions effectively. There is therefore a need to invest in the
capacity of public servants working in PFM functions for the effective administration of public
finances, generally. Basic accounting, audit, cash management, procurement, monitoring,
reporting, management, and supervision, among other skills, are needed to perform essential
ongoing PFM functions and to be able to implement new reforms.

Furthermore, incentives and performance management frameworks, such as pay reform and
performance appraisal need further consideration. While a number of public service reforms were
implemented in the 1990s and the technical system investments in the IPPS will improve efficiency
of financial management, public sector wages appear to have stagnated and are now low, compared
to private sector equivalents and even by African standards. As a whole, the wage bill represents
about 4 percent of GDP, compared to an average across Africa of about 6.5 percent for the central
government and 9.8 percent for all governments. Furthermore, the PFM Act, provides for
accounting officers to enter into an annual budget performance contract with the secretary to the
Treasury, which should be binding on delivery of activities in the work plan of the vote for any
financial year. If this is introduced, the government needs to ensure that this arrangement is
effectively enforced.

Annex 7: Evidence Supporting the Priority Areas and Proposed Actions

Roads:

        Estache et al. (2012). Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) simulations indicate that a
         1 percent increase in road investment funded by reduction of other public spending, leads
         to a GDP increase of 0.21 percent and household welfare increase of 0.16 percent.

        Uganda Poverty Assessment 2015. Reductions in the distance to the nearest input market
         by 1 km increased crop income for the bottom 40 percent by 1 percent.

        Gollin and Rogerson (Static General Equilibrium Model). The effect of a 10 percent
         reduction in transportation costs has half the impact on welfare as a 10 percent increase in
         agricultural TFP. At any given moment in time, the price that spreads across markets for a
         given commodity are substantial and high transport costs drive this. The gap between the
         second highest price and the second lowest price averaged 10 percent of the minimum price
         in the United States, compared with 27 percent of the minimum price for Uganda, despite
         the distances being much larger in the United States. Unit transport costs in Uganda are
         estimated to be 4–7 times the unit transport costs in the United States.

        CEM 2007. Identified the poor road network as one of the key constraints to growth.

        Global Competitiveness Report of 2015. Ranks inadequate infrastructure as the fourth
         leading constraint.

        Uganda 5th Economic Update. The special section on urbanization also notes the
         importance of urban public transportation to provide connectivity to the poor.

        Tsimpo and Wodon (2014) argue that the bottom 40 percent households rank district and
         rural roads among social and infrastructure services of poor quality.

Urbanization:

        Uganda’s urbanization at 15 percent is below that of the average LICs and SSA countries.

        Uganda 5th Economic Update. Provides evidence of the importance of accelerated
         urbanization for Uganda’s socioeconomic transformation.

        Dorosh and Thurlow. Investing in southern urban centers to harness agglomeration
         effects accelerate national growth, but has little effect on other regions’ welfare because of
         weak growth linkages and small migration effects.

        Uganda Poverty Assessment 2015. Until now, migration has had a limited impact on
         poverty reduction, despite the substantial consumption growth that accompanies migration
         when it occurs. Stronger migration linkages are needed. Those that migrate from rural areas
         to urban areas see a 37.5 percent increase in consumption. This is very similar to the
         increase in consumption found for rural to urban migration in Tanzania by Beegle et al.

                                                  107
 
          (2011) using a similar method. However, the impact on poverty of rural to urban migration
          is smaller as those that migrate from rural to urban areas are less poor to begin with
          (O’Sullivan and Mensah for the Uganda Poverty Assessment).

Fiscal:

         Matovu et al. (2014) and Agenor et al. (2014) find that improved efficiency in public
          sector spending leads to higher GDP growth. Improving public expenditure efficiency by
          a yearly average of 10.5 percent will result in an average 0.25 percentage point
          improvement in GDP growth rates.

         Dabla et al. (2012) reported that Uganda ranks 46th out of 71 countries in the IMF’s PIMI,
          with relatively poor scores in project implementation and evaluation.

         The 2013 Business Enterprise Survey and the 2015 Global Competitiveness Report
          identified tax rates among the top 3 constraints.

         The fiscal slippages in the recent past which resulted in a significant decline in aid from
          donors was the result of weak PFM.

Health:

         The incidence of Malaria and HIV/AIDS in Uganda is higher than other countries with a
          similar GNI per capita.

         Alderman et al. (2008). Improvement of child health and nutrition of poor children has
          been regarded as an efficient way of improving school attendance.

         Dillon et al. (2014). According to them, malaria testing and treatment increases earnings
          of poor households by 10 percent following a mobile clinic visit in Nigeria.

         Among the countries in East Africa, Uganda has the second-lowest life expectancy at birth,
          second-highest total fertility, and highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS.

Education:

         Hanushek and Woessmann (2008). An increase of one standard deviation in student
          scores on international assessments of literacy and mathematics is associated with a 2
          percent increase in annual GDP per capita growth.

         Uganda Poverty Assessment 2015. Completing primary education increases agricultural
          earnings by 10 percent. Younger, more educated households are more likely to increase
          their income from nonagricultural sources. Education is more strongly correlated with
          increases in wage income than with increases in self-employment income. Individuals with
          higher levels of education are more likely to be employed and receive higher returns when
          they are employed. This is particularly true among the poorest. The distinguishing feature



                                                 108
 
        of households in the bottom 40 percent that are able to transition into wage employment is
        their higher levels of education.

       Barr et al. (2012). Participatory community monitoring interventions increased schooling
        quality in Uganda. It reduced pupil and teacher absenteeism by 8.9 and 13.2 percent,
        respectively. As a result, pupils’ test scores increased by 0.19 standard deviations.

       Gakidou et al. (2010). It is estimated that of the 8.2 million fewer deaths of children
        younger than 5 years between 1970 and 2009, one-half can be attributed to more education
        among women of reproductive age.

       The Ugandan population, 25 years and above, has an average of 4.7 years of schooling
        while women have only 3.8 years of schooling.

Fertility:

       At 6.2 children per woman, Uganda has one of the highest fertility rates in the world.

       Bangladesh Poverty Assessment 2012. Bangladesh managed to achieve a spectacular
        decline in fertility rate from 6.3 births per woman in 1975 to 2.3 in 2011. The key driver
        of fertility decline was an aggressive and supply-driven family planning program which
        provided doorstep delivery of contraceptives along with improved family planning service
        delivery.

       Contraceptive use is slowly picking up, but unmet need for family planning still stands at
        34.4 percent.

Agriculture:

       Dorosh and Thurlow (2012), and Government of Uganda (2014). Simulations using
        Uganda’s Social Accounting Matrix show that agricultural growth has a larger impact on
        poverty reduction than an equal amount of growth in other sectors.

       Uganda Poverty Assessment. Agricultural income growth contributed more to poverty
        reduction than growth in other sources of income. The elasticity of poverty reduction with
        respect to agricultural growth is stronger than the elasticity with respect to other sources of
        growth. Of the 1.7 annual percentage point reduction in poverty from 2010 to 2013, 1.3
        took place among agricultural households.

       Gollin and Rogerson. A 10 percent increase in agricultural productivity led to a welfare
        increase of more than 30 percent. When combined with a 10 percent reduction in the cost
        of transporting goods (as a result of investments in roads) welfare increased by 77 percent.

       Agricultural growth rate in Uganda was less than 2 percent per year over the past five years
        which is well below the 4 percent agricultural growth rate achieved by the continent as a
        whole.



                                                 109
 
       The output per agricultural worker is only 13 percent of that of workers in the rest of the
        economy.

Accountability:

       World Governance Indicators 2014. On the control of corruption, Uganda is in the 14th
        percentile; on political stability and absence of violence, it is in the 20th percentile; and in
        voice and accountability, it is in the 31st percentile.

       Transparency International’s Global Corruption Barometer Survey (2013). This
        survey found that 61 percent of Ugandans had paid a bribe to one of the eight institutions
        (judiciary, education, tax services and customs, permits/registries, medical services, police,
        land services, or utilities) in the last 12 months.

       Global Integrity 2011. Uganda has one of the biggest implementation gaps when it comes
        to anticorruption legislation in East Africa.

       Freedom House 2014. Uganda’s ranking in freedom of the press showed a decline from
        104 to 110 from 2012 to 2013.

       Public Expenditure Review 2013. According to the review, improving service delivery
        at the local level will require changes in intergovernmental fiscal transfers as well as own-
        source revenues of LGs.




                                                 110
