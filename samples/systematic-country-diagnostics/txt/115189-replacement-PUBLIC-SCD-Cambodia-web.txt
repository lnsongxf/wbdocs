	   Executive Summary	12

	   1. Introduction	22



	   2. Context: Cambodia’s development trajectory	28
	   Cambodia, from conflict to success as a highly open export-oriented economy…	            28
	   … with persistent governance challenges…	                                                30
	   … and a large rural population that still depends on agriculture and remains vulnerable	 31



	 3. What have been the drivers of stellar growth and poverty reduction performance
	 in Cambodia?	36
	 3.1.	 Success in poverty reduction thanks to job creation and a windfall from higher
	 agricultural commodity prices	                                                             36
	 Cambodia has been one of the leading countries in poverty reduction and shared prosperity	 36
	 The drivers of poverty reduction have been low-skilled urban job creation and agricultural
	expansion	                                                                                  40
	 3.2.	 Cambodia’s main engines of growth to date: export-led growth linked to basic human
	 and natural resources	                                                                     43
	 Cambodia has enjoyed blistering growth in labor-intensive exports of goods and services	   43
	 Workforce expansion has been driving economic growth in Cambodia, while labor
	 productivity gains have been more modest than in other fast-growing countries	             45
	 The levels of capital accumulation and savings have been lower than in other economies
	 experiencing sustained fast growth	                                                        47



	   4. What are the challenges Cambodia faces in sustaining strong growth
	   and improving equity outcomes over the next decade?	52
	   Going forward, increased human and physical capital are needed for Cambodia to reap
	   the demographic dividend and reach upper middle-income status	                              52
	   4.1.	 Challenges to economic diversification	                                               54
	   Declining external competitiveness and erosion in preferential treatment challenge exports	 56
	   Informal competition and fees challenge the creation of a vibrant private sector	           62
	   The available skills are unlikely to meet the upcoming needs of firms	                     68
	   4.2.	 Constraints to household economic mobility	                                          72
	   Beyond extreme poverty, socioeconomic mobility has been limited	                           72
	   Limited access to education and land inhibits socioeconomic mobility	                      73
	   Persistent malnutrition affects learning outcomes and human capital formation	             75
	   Exposure to health and environmental shocks compounds challenges to achieving
	   socioeconomic mobility	                                                                    78

	   5. Is the current development model sustainable?	86
	   5.1.	 Risks to the sustainability of macroeconomics and public finances	                   86
	   Although public finances remain sustainable, maintaining public investment levels
	   will become more challenging	                                                              86

	   Although a large number of women joined the workforce over the past two decades,
	   significant gender gaps still exist	                                                       94
	   Some groups in Cambodia still experience exclusion and discrimination, heightening
	   their vulnerability	                                                                       97
	   While progress has been made, land disputes and displacement remain an issue in Cambodia	  99
	   5.3.	 Risks and opportunities for environmentally sustainable and resilient development	  100
	   Unsustainable economic activities are associated with a degradation of natural capital,
	   increasingly endangering their contribution to the economy and poverty reduction	         100
	   Climate and disaster risks compound environmental sustainability challenges	              102
	   Poorly planned urban development heightens risks and may constrain growth	                104
	   Sustainable growth is faced with tradeoffs for competing demands on natural capital	      106

	       contributions from agriculture (including fisheries) and construction	                          44
12. 	   Cambodia has experienced blistering growth in garment and tourism exports	                      45
13. 	   Cambodia’s growth has relied on capital and workforce expansion, while labor productivity
	       gains have been lower than in comparators	                                                      46
14. 	   The labor productivity gap between the modern and traditional sectors has narrowed,

20. 	   Cambodia’s garment exports have been concentrated mainly on the EU and U.S. markets	            56
21. 	   Stagnation in garment labor productivity may be the result of firms specializing

Box 1: MDG attainment and LDC graduation criteria
Overall, Cambodia has made significant progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
The country has more than halved extreme poverty (from 33 percent in 2004 to 10 percent in 2011),
more than halved maternal mortality (from 1,020 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 161 in 2015), reduced
child mortality (from 117 per 1,000 in 1990 to 28 in 2015), increased the primary education enrollment
rate (from 92.1 percent in 2000 to near-universal enrollment of 94.7 percent in 2014), made significant
progress in combating HIV/AIDS (with the incidence rate declining from 0.08 per 100 people in 2001 to
0.01 in 2013), nearly achieved gender parity in primary and secondary education, and improved access
to safe water and sanitation (see Annex 1 for more details). Cambodia mainstreamed the MDGs into its
national strategic development plans, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are expected to
enjoy the same level of ownership by the government.

However, achievements are mixed for a number of MDGs, including tuberculosis (TB), environmental
sustainability, demining, and gender equality. TB incidence and death rates remain high. Although the
pace of deforestation has slowed down slightly thanks to recent policy changes, it has remained high over
the past two decades. Similarly, although the percentage of contaminated land cleared of unexploded
ordinances has increased to 45 percent, it still falls far short of the target of 100 percent. Cambodia also
needs to improve the roles of women in employment and political participation.

Moreover, Cambodia’s gains in poverty reduction remain highly precarious, as most households that
escaped poverty did so by only a small margin. In 2012, it was estimated that a small negative shock of
USD 0.30 per day would cause the national poverty rate to increase to 40 percent, or approximately six
million people (World Bank, 2015).

In terms of development status, Cambodia has become a lower middle-income economy according
to the World Bank classification system but remains a least developed country (LDC) according to the
United Nations (UN). At the 2015 review, Cambodia was found ineligible for graduation from LDC status.
While the threshold has been met for the Human Assets Index, economic vulnerability remains high, and
income per capita is still below the threshold (Table 3).

Cambodia aims to become eligible for LDC graduation by 2024. LDC graduation is expected to imply the

criteria in two consecutive triennial reviews, the European Union (EU) will initiate a three-year process for
phasing out its Everything-but-Arms Agreement with Cambodia.

   Box 2: Proposed peer selection criteria

   This SCD benchmarks Cambodia vis-à-vis countries with the same lower middle-income classification, a
   set of structurally similar countries (“structural peers”), as well as other ASEAN economies (Thailand) for
   aspirational purposes.

   Structural peers are countries anywhere in the world that meet five criteria that also define Cambodia:

   •	 Lower middle-income countries;
   •	 Economies not highly dependent on exports of natural resources (identified by excluding economies
      for which “natural resource as a share of exports in 2006-12” does not exceed 20 percent);
   •	 High exposure to natural disasters (top quintile);
   •	 Countries in which the rural population is at least 40 percent of total population; and
   •	 Countries that are not classified as islands, small countries, or landlocked.




                                                                                                                           CAMBODIA: Sustaining strong growth for the benefit of all
   Using these criteria, the structural peers for Cambodia, which recently joined the lower middle-income
   group (USD 1,070 GNI per capita in 2015 according to the Atlas Method), are: Bangladesh (USD 1,190),
   Guatemala (USD 3,590), Philippines (USD 3,540), Nicaragua (USD 1,940 per capita), and Vietnam (USD
   1,980 per capita). Due to varying data availability, not all the peers are included in all the comparisons.
   Most of these economies currently have a strong garment industry and relatively low complexity in their
   exports (Hausman and Hidalgo, 2009), with the exception of the Philippines. Nicaragua and Cambodia
   also have in common a recent past marked by tragic civil conflict that affected human and economic
   development.
