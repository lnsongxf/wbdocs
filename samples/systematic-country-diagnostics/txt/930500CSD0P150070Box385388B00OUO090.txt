   7.	 The low level of development can be traced to
       Myanmar’s long history of isolation, conflict, and
       military control of political and economic life. (Box
       1)   For most of its post-independence period, Myan-
       mar has been under military dictatorship and has been
       ravaged by conflict in the ethnic minority border areas.
       State controls and economic isolation resulted in sup-
       pressed entrepreneurship and a diminished role of the
       private sector, stagnating infrastructure and technology,

           ing paper suggests that Myanmar had been trading at
           only 15 percent of its potential through 2010.11 Figure
           4 shows that exports in 2012, as a share of GDP, were
           far higher in neighboring countries than in Myanmar.12
           For example, Vietnam and Thailand both exported
           the equivalent of 70 percent of GDP in 2012. Larger
           countries typically need to export less, given their large
           internal markets. Thus, India exported 20 percent of
           GDP while China exported 27 percent of GDP. Figure
           4 also shows that the exports from Myanmar’s neigh-

     14.	 Labor productivity in Myanmar, defined as val-
          ue-added per worker, is low in all sectors and is
          much lower than in most other countries in the re-
          gion. Most comparator countries in East Asia, except
          Cambodia and Vietnam, have substantially higher labor
          productivity in agriculture than Myanmar (see Table
          2).  Myanmar’s productivity is the lowest among these
          comparator countries in services, and is also the lowest
          except for Cambodia in industry.

     15.	 Structural transformation has proceeded slowly
          to date. Myanmar is still largely dependent on agri-
          culture where labor productivity is very low.   Figure
          5 shows that the agricultural share of GDP has fallen
          significantly from a peak of 61 percent in 1986 to 36
          percent in 2011, while the share of industry increased
          from less than 10 percent to 26 percent over the period.  
          This coincides with the agricultural reform of 1987 and                    16.	 Myanmar has a large informal sector with the major-

  Box 4: The Myanmar SCD consultations process

Preparation of the Myanmar SCD benefited significant-

tations were undertaken over a period of February to
June 2014. In total, 15 consultation events were held
across the country in six locations: Yangon, Nay Pyi
Taw, Pathein, Mandalay, Taungyi, and Hpa An. Apart
from the meetings, inputs were also received through
the World Bank’s website and via email submissions.

Stakeholders consulted included central Government
officials; state and regional Government officials, par-
liamentarians at central and state/regional level; civil
society representatives including from NGOs, INGOs,
CBOs, political parties; private sector representatives;
researchers and think tanks; and development partners.

Invitations and materials for consultations were sent
out at least two weeks in advance for most of the events,
both in English and Myanmar language. Consultation
meetings were announced on the World Bank website,
Facebook page, and local newspapers. Translation was
available at each event, and participants completed
feedback forms to help improve the format of future
consultation events.

          or steps back in the transition. Under the baseline
          scenario (see Table 4), growth is expected to increase
          slightly further, averaging 8.4 percent over the next few
          years. The key underlying assumptions are continued
          strong performance in the productive sectors, includ-
          ing construction and manufacturing in special export
          zones, and robust performance in the service sectors.  
          The nominal and real effective exchange rates have
          been depreciating and are projected to continue doing
          so in the medium term.30  Inflation is forecast to reach
          6.6 percent in 2014/15, fueled by electricity price in-
          creases and demand pressures, but should moderate in
          following years. The external current account deficit is
          projected to be around 4.9 percent of GDP, but is ex-
          pected to be more than offset by rising FDI-related in-
          flows while the fiscal deficit is projected to rise to 4.5
          percent of GDP in 2014/15 mainly due to significant
          increases in transfers to state and regional governments
          and an increase in civil servants salaries. In spite of a
          general positive outlook, the economy faces significant
          downside risks. Basic macroeconomic management
          tools are still being built and the authorities’ capacity to
          develop and implement policies and absorb technical
          assistance is already stretched. Given Myanmar’s de-
          pendence on gas, strong capacity will be needed to deal
          with the challenging reforms that can foster inclusive
          growth, including growth of the non-resource sectors
          which will be needed to diversify the economy. The

pattern observed in other fast growing countries in East Asia where the real
exchange rate has been appreciating. While further study might be needed,
this difference in outcome could be explained by the limited capacity of the
economy to absorb foreign investment, the unattractive real interest rate
which discourages hot money inflows and limited gains in productivity.

    98.	 In spite of recent improvements, a major weakness
         in Myanmar’s quality of expenditure remains the
         low level of resources allocated to health and ed-
         ucation. Public expenditure on health increased from
         0.2 percent of GDP in 2011/12 to 1.5 percent of GDP in
         2012/13 while that of education increased from 0.8 per-
         cent of GDP to 1.6 during the same period. In spite of
         these large increases, Myanmar’s expenditure on health
         and education remains low by international standards
         (see Figures 21 and 22).   In addition, while the Gov-
         ernment has increased its own financial allocation to
         the sectors, operational costs for institutions delivering
         services at the front line remain underfunded. Most of
         the additional resources have gone towards capital ex-
         penditures and salaries.

    99.	 More generally, weaknesses along various stages of
         the budget cycle undermine the quality of expen-
         diture in Myanmar, and hence, reduce prospects
         for achieving the Government’s poverty reduction
         policy objectives. First, the budget preparation frame-
         work and process are not appropriately designed to en-
         sure that resources are allocated to policy priorities. At
         present, most of the Budget Department’s manpower
         is absorbed in performing cumbersome routine tasks
         of budget compilation and reporting. A Fiscal Policy
         and Strategy Division in the Budget Department has
         just been established and is yet to become operation-
         al. Therefore, key budgetary decisions have been made
         without being informed by rigorous analytical founda-
         tions. Proposed budgets submitted by line ministries to
         MOF and thereafter to Parliament are simply a collec-
         tion of line items without narratives and therefore not
         easy to analyze the budget-policy linkages. Second,
         when it comes to implementation, a key weakness of
         the expenditure framework is the lack of centrally de-
         fined standards in areas such as payroll management
         and procurement. Currently, these functions are highly
         delegated to ministries and spending units at differ-
         ent levels within them. This situation has allowed line
         agencies to develop rules and regulations in isolation of    Source: World Bank, Public Expenditure Review (forthcoming)
         central guidance. As a result, spending agencies have
         not been subjected to minimum standards and controls             100.	Since the reforms started, opportunities abound
         to ensure value for money in spending. This has created               but there are risks too. There is high level political
         loopholes that have been exploited by some function-                  and technical buy-in to modernize the PFM backbone
         aries. In addition, the official requirement to purchase              to support service delivery. The Parliament, Office of
         from state-owned suppliers and producers has limited                  the President, and key economic ministries, are keen
         the public sector’s ability to benefit from private sector            to modernize and reform the system to improve service
         efficiencies and innovations. Finally, a key weakness                 delivery, foster greater transparency, and link polices
         in Myanmar’s public expenditure framework has been                    to fiscal outlays. The entering into the market of two
         lack of focus on results and outcomes. For example,                   mobile phone companies will significantly improve
         within education, there is no national assessment of                  telecommunication services and hence provide a plat-
         learning outcomes at the lower levels of basic educa-                 form for a more automated and interconnected PFM
         tion. Therefore, no one knows if increased expenditure                system. At the same time, increasing pressure from
         to education is achieving the desired results.                        executive and scrutiny from legislative branch could
                                                                               result in rushed and uncoordinated reform efforts, to

        an opportunity for improving the quality of expenditure

2. Promoting universal access to basic services and em-
powerment for inclusive growth, particularly in rural areas

    101.	As most poor people in Myanmar live in rural
         areas and have limited access to critical services,
         promoting universal access and extending services
         to the rural poor and other disadvantaged groups,
         will have a high impact. Access to rural infrastruc-
         ture (rural electrification, roads, telephone services)
         will empower the rural poor by facilitating access to
         basic social services, and by enhancing opportunities
         for and raising incomes from productive activities.  In
         turn, improved access to basic social services (health,
         education, water and sanitation) will help deal with the
         non-income dimension of poverty, and investments
         in human capital are crucial in preparing people for
         productive work and empowering them to pursue op-
         portunities in the labor market.  In appropriate circum-
         stances, social protection interventions may support the
         empowerment agenda through facilitating human cap-
         ital acquisition (e.g., by increasing the demand for and
         usage of education and health services through condi-
         tional cash transfers), providing income smoothing for
         the poor (e.g. seasonal public works to provide mean-
         ingful temporary employment during the lean season),
         or providing last resort support for those without work
         ability (e.g. disabled elderly) where resources permit.

    102.	The health status of the people of Myanmar is
         low and does not compare favorably with other
         countries in the region. Among ASEAN countries,

    arate production blocks and locate them across borders                over which results on poverty reduction can be expected.       
    so that they can exploit the non-integrated elements of
    location advantages such as wage differences. Due to
    sanctions, poor policies, infrastructure and connectivity,
    Myanmar has been the missing link in the region.

125.	Jobs created through growth in non-agriculture
     sectors will be especially critical in tackling ur-
     ban poverty, particularly through the creation of
     Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) alongside
     large firms. As shown from the poverty profile, urban
     poverty in Myanmar is much higher than originally
     reported. Therefore, creating employment opportuni-
     ties in and around towns and cities will be critical to
     ending urban poverty. Evidence from India shows that
     urban growth (particularly in small towns to which
     rural areas tend to be more closely linked) have been
     a critical driver in reducing rural poverty as well. As
     policy initiatives are put in place to stimulate invest-
     ments by large foreign and domestic firms, it will be
     important to create a conducive environment for the
     urban poor to set up their own businesses, in the form
     of SMEs. Policy initiatives will need to recognize po-
     tential synergies between large firms and SMEs that
     can be critical to driving growth and creating jobs –
     SMEs can be major players in the supply chain of the
     larger firms as suppliers, consumers, or intermediaries.

126.	For Myanmar to create more jobs in the non-gas
     and non-agricultural sectors, continuing with cur-
     rent efforts to open up the space for foreign and
     domestic investors will need to be a priority, com-
     plemented by facilitation of access to domestic,
     regional, and international markets. In particular,
     the country needs to remove the remaining policy and
     institutional impediments that are still hampering entry
     by new domestic and foreign private sector investors
     into the economic space, and expansion of operations
     by existing investors.   In addition, there is also need
     to remove policy and institutional barriers to domes-
     tic, regional, and international market access. Some of
     the required policy and institutional changes may take
     time to be carried out or may be politically sensitive but
     many can be implemented in the short to medium term.

127.	In addition to opening up the economic space, at-
     tention will also need to focus on removing key con-
     straints related to actual factors of production that
     are critical to business start-up and increased pro-
     ductivity – such as electricity, finance, land, labor,
     transport connectivity, and ICT. From the 2014 ICA           Source: World Bank, Investment Climate Assessment–Enterprise

    129.	Beyond SEEs, military involvement in businesses
         also casts a heavy cloud on private sector space.
         The Ministry of Defense owns two holding companies
         with vast business interests: The Union of Myanmar
         Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL) which was es-
         tablished to focus on light industries, trading, and ser-
         vices, and the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC)
         which was established to focus on heavy industries. Al-
         though the military owned companies are not regarded
         as SEEs, they enjoy certain privileges which make the
         playing field for the private sector uneven. For exam-
         ple, in the past they were exempted from commercial
         and profit taxes and have had exclusive access to secure
         preferential contracts with foreign firms.

    130.	In order to create more jobs through increased
         private foreign investment, the Myanmar econo-

         Economic Community (AEC) in 2015 significantly ex-
         pands Myanmar’s market opportunities abroad which
         could make trade a major driver of growth and hence,
         job creation.  The range of tariff rates, the average tar-
         iff, and average effective rates have been declining
         since Myanmar became a member of the ASEAN in
         1997. However, the country still has many non-tariff
         measures (NTMs) that significantly hamper integration
         with regional and global markets although efforts are
         now underway to streamline them. Similarly, with few
         exceptions, customs procedures for the processing of
         import and export declarations are cumbersome. The
         Customs Department lacks essential equipment and re-
         quires a laboratory facility, possibly shared with other
         government departments, that has the capacity to test
         and quickly return a multiplicity of import and export
         samples. In general, Myanmar performs poorly on the
         Logistics Performance Index (See Figure 25) compared
         to most countries in the region.

    131.	Poor transport connectivity is a key constraint to
         Myanmar’s full integration with markets. Cur-
         rently, Myanmar’s transport infrastructure lags behind
         most of its peers in the region. For example, according
         to an ADB report (2014), the total road network as of        37	          The LSCI measures how well countries are connected to global ship-

(b).	 Increasing agricultural productivity

  132.	With the slow creation of non-farm jobs, agricul-
       ture will continue to employ many people in Myan-
       mar for years to come and therefore play a critical
       role in reducing poverty in the country. Increasing
       agricultural profitability and returns to labor will be
       central  for effective poverty reduction. Higher profit-
       ability, due to increasing yields, shifting or diversify-
       ing cropping or livestock holding patterns, and more
       efficient use of inputs (including labor), is a necessary
       condition to increase farm welfare. There is likely to be
       some substitution of capital for labor, although incre-
       mental farm mechanization will enable increased utili-
       zation of spare land in some areas and generate demand
       for off-farm service provisioning. A more productive
       agriculture would also encourage job creation through
       agro-processing and food distribution activities and
       earn foreign exchange through exports.

    142.	Low supply of skilled labor is another key con-
         straint mentioned by most investors in Myanmar.
         Since the country is emerging from a long period of
         isolation, there is a significant gap between locally
         available skills and the skills demanded by employers,
         particularly foreign companies just coming in. Apart
         from sector specific technical skills, many people who
         have graduated from schools within Myanmar also lack
         basic proficiency in the English language. In addition,
         most institutions offering vocational and technical edu-
         cation schools were converted into formal universities
         under military rule.   Given the current wide gap, in-
         creasing the supply of skilled labor force would there-
         fore have a high impact on poverty reduction.
