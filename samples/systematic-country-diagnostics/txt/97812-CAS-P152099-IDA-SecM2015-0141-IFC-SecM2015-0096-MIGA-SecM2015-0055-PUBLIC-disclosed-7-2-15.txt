Introduction

1.     Lesotho is one of the poorest and most unequal countries in the world. It is a small,
mostly mountainous, and largely rural country of about 2 million people, completely
surrounded by South Africa. Preliminary estimates based on the FY2010/11 household survey
show a national headcount poverty rate of 57.1 percent, virtually unchanged from the FY2002/03
survey.1 At the same time, inequality increased from a Gini coefficient of 0.51 to 0.53. The
bottom 40 percent of the population’s per capita consumption contracted 0.4 percent annually
over the past five years. By comparison, annual growth was 0.9 percent for the remaining 60
percent and 1.1 percent for the top 20 percent. Poverty is not only high but also deep—and the
depth has increased over time. A poverty gap of about 30 percent indicates that substantial
growth would be needed to lift a majority of the poor out of poverty. Human development
outcomes are below the norms for a country of Lesotho’s income level.

2.      The persistence of poverty and rising inequality are striking for an economy that
grew at annual rates of 4 percent per capita over the past decade. This raises questions about
the growth model’s lack of inclusiveness. Over this period, Lesotho underwent an important
change in the drivers of growth, shifting from an economy dependent on net exports to one
driven primarily by government spending. Public spending is large, inefficient, and is not helping
the government achieve its development objectives. The current government-driven growth
model is not conducive to achieving the twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity.
From a sustainability point of view, it faces serious macroeconomic and social risks. The main
macroeconomic risk comes from the threat to the sustainability of the exchange-rate peg. The
social risk arises from further increases in income inequality that may fuel social discontent and
increase socio-political instability.

3.      Redefining the role of the state will be critical for meeting the twin goals through
boosting inclusive growth and avoiding macroeconomic and social risks. Reducing the large
footprint of the government will be needed to promote broad based growth and support
macroeconomic stability. This would require a series of measures to improve competitiveness.
Greater effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of public spending will be critical for making the
state more effective. This will require a modernization of the public sector. More effective use of
Southern African Customs Union (SACU) receipts will boost private sector-led, jobs-intensive
growth.

4.     In this context, this Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is intended to assess
development challenges and identify priorities for rapid progress in achieving the
objectives of: (i) eliminating extreme poverty on a sustainable basis and (ii) ensuring
shared prosperity by improving the welfare of Lesotho’s poorer citizens. The report analyzes
the opportunities and challenges in meeting these objectives, focusing on growth, inclusiveness,
and sustainability. The SCD concludes by prioritizing the key challenges.

   Using the US$1.25 per day international poverty line leads to nearly similar results (55 percent), confirming the
severity of poverty in Lesotho.

Slow job creation seems to be keeping poverty and inequality high

5.      Poverty rates have remained high in rural areas, remote communities, and
household headed by females and among the unemployed and those with low levels of
education. Most notably, together, children (up to 14 years of age) and the elderly (60+) account
for about 44 percent of the poor, with important implications for inclusion and inter-generational
transmission of poverty. A large number of Basotho are still just above the poverty line and at
risk of falling back to poverty. This is important risk for smallholder households in rural areas.

6.     Poverty and location are both correlated with worse health, nutritional, and
educational outcomes. Access to health facilities is still a challenge for the poor. Educational
outcomes have not changed that much in rural areas, and access to post-primary education
remains a challenge for the poor. Despite huge investments in the social sectors, poverty
stagnated and social outcomes have not improved. It maybe that Lesotho is in a poverty trap,
which will require rethinking the way the country fights poverty.

7.       Lesotho’s poverty stagnation could be attributed to a decline in remittances and a
still large dependence on subsistence farming among many households. The proportion of
households relying on wages and salaries from work in the private and public sectors has
increased, particularly among the poor. The role of social protection has increased, but the
proportion of households mainly relying on these benefits remains rather small. Improvements in
labor-market outcomes flowed to the richer segments of Lesotho’s population, adversely
impacting the consumption distribution.

8.     Although having a household head with a job reduces the probability of being poor,
employment does not seem to be enough to lift people out of poverty. Among households
depending primarily on public-sector wages, 78 percent are in the two highest income groups,
compared with 32 percent of the population as a whole. Lack of high-paying jobs outside the
well-paid public sector could be one possible explanation of why even wage-paying jobs do not
guarantee a way out of poverty. 2

9.      Both economic growth and policies to lower inequality will be required for faster
poverty reduction (Figure 1 and Figure 2). It will require a broad set of integrated measures,
including the deepening of inclusive growth and improving the targeting and efficiency of the
social safety net. Inclusiveness will require broad-based job creation, greater productivity, and a
different the structure of growth. This will require a structural shift in Lesotho’s growth model
from one dependent on the public sector to one driven by a strong and competitive private sector.

Growth: current model is unsustainable; jobs-intensive, export-oriented, private-sector driven
model needed

10.    The state plays an important role in development, particularly through fiscal and
regulatory channels. In Lesotho, three key fiscal and regulatory issues hinder broad-based
growth:

       High levels of public spending. Public spending cannot drive the economy forever.
        Fueled by volatile SACU receipts, public spending grew from 45 percent of GDP in
        FY2004/05 to 63.1 percent in FY2014/15, one of the highest ratios in the world. The
        large SACU inflows were absorbed mostly by government consumption, particularly
        employee compensation. Over this period, the government’s wage bill increased more
        than 45 percent in real terms, reaching 22.7 percent of GDP. The government became the
        formal economy’s largest employer,3 and most of these employees are paid well enough
        to make the top quintiles of the income distribution. As spending grew, the government’s
        budget became more rigid, and now it cannot afford to add more public employees.
        Finally, maintaining a high level of public spending after the global crisis seems to have
        eroded the private sector’s competitiveness, with the spending of SACU receipts leading
        to a rise of the relative price of non-tradables to tradables (Figure 3). As a result, the
        private sector’s share of total investment has declined (Figure 4). In sum, the
        government’s role as “preferred” employer seems to be crowding out the ability of the
        private sector to create jobs, and this situation cannot continue over the medium run
        because it threatens macroeconomic stability.

  The high unemployment rates, estimated at 25.3 percent for the 15-49 age group and 15.5 percent for youth, drove
the government to take on the role of main employer and led to the establishment of the Graduate Placement Unit in
the Public Service Department.

      Poor efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of public spending. Lesotho spends almost half
       of its budget in the social sectors. This is very high compared to peers. However, social
       outcomes in terms of mortality rates, life expectancy, educational achievements and
       poverty levels are not commensurate with these spending levels. This suggests deep
       inefficiencies in social spending. The incremental capital-output ratio (ICOR) was a
       relatively high 6.3 in 2004-10. Lesotho’s ICOR trailed other developing countries.
       Government processes for project selection, appraisal, and monitoring are relatively weak
       and need to be strengthened. The high ICOR explains why, despite a relatively high level
       of public investment of about 14 percent of GDP, the growth impact is muted.
      High number of business regulations. The NSDP acknowledges an “uncompetitive
       business environment” as one of the most binding constraints on the growth of private
       enterprises, adversely affecting both FDI and local SMEs. All quantitative measures—
       including Global Trade Reports, Doing Business Indicators, and Enterprise Surveys—
       suggest that business regulations are a serious constraint on growth. In Ease of Doing
       Business, for example, Lesotho ranked 128th among 185 countries in 2014. Lesotho has
       made important reforms, notably in streamlining the processes for starting businesses and
       registering property. Nevertheless, a number of factors that hinder private-sector growth
       remain at almost every stage of business—from accessing land to obtaining construction
       permits, engaging in cross-border trade with South Africa, and accessing finance. For
       example, it may take more than a year for foreigners to establish firms in Lesotho,
       compared with less than a year in peer countries.

11.    Improving the prospects for high levels of sustained and broad-based growth will
require greater productivity and investment. With investment of 30 percent of GDP and labor
force growth of 1.1 percent a year, achieving the NSDP target economic growth of 7 percent a
year will require annual total factor productivity (TFP) increases of 4.9 percent. Over a sustained
period of time, such a TFP growth rate is high by international standards. In fact, Lesotho’s
productivity growth has slowed substantially in recent years, with TFP only contributing 0.7
percent. The marginal productivity of labor is relatively low and negatively affected by
HIV/AIDS. Weak TFP also appears to reflect inefficient inter-sectoral allocations, with labor
concentrated in the economy’s least-productive sectors.




                                                 xiv
12.     In recent years, mining has become one of the economy’s fastest growing sectors,
but it is not a solution for sustainable poverty reduction because of its limited job-creation
potential. What is needed instead is development of a more competitive, outward-oriented
private sector, particularly in employment-intensive services sectors where Lesotho can exploit
global or regional comparative advantages. With a small domestic economy, successful private
sector development will depend crucially on export markets. This requires improving the
integration of Lesotho’s firms into regional value chains, which depends in turn on addressing
the trade-policy and trade-facilitation barriers that hamper regional trade and investment.

13.     For Lesotho, transitioning to a new growth model will require the private sector to
take the lead in developing competitive, outward-oriented firms. Encouraging entrepreneurs
to invest in export-oriented activities will require reforming the existing inward-looking
investment environment, which raises the relative rewards of focusing on domestic non-tradables
and government contracts. It will also require addressing the high cost of operating in Lesotho.
Progress is being made on many aspects of the Doing Business agenda, but firms remain only
weakly competitive. Investing in workforce development (skills and training), addressing health
barriers (HIV/AIDS), and adopting technology will be critical to improving productivity and
fostering more competitive firms. In addition, developing key infrastructure is critical to
lowering costs and increasing competitiveness. This includes the trade-facilitation environment
(promoting value-chain integration), road connectivity that is sustainable and safe, and the
quality and cost of ICT infrastructure.

Inclusion: despite high investment in the social sectors, barriers still remain

14.     Experience from around the globe has shown that growth alone is not sufficient for
poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Human development is essential to individual well-
being and contributes significantly to ensuring the sustainability of economic gains. The
government has invested substantial resources— over 30 percent of GDP—in the social sectors,
but it has achieved poor outcomes

15.     The effectiveness and efficiency of public spending in the health sector is an issue.
Over the past decade, Lesotho has seen worsening health outcomes. The country’s health
systems have been overwhelmed by HIV/AIDS, with the adult prevalence rate the world’s third
highest at 23.6 percent. In addition, the country faces a high burden of tuberculosis (TB).
Maternal mortality in Lesotho is among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, and infant mortality
has also increased in recent years, highlighting serious shortcomings in the health-care system.
The government responded to worsening health outcomes by doubling the Ministry of Health’s
budgetary allocations to almost 9 percent of GDP (around 15 percent of the overall budget), but
the ministry’s ability to absorb the budget worsened. As a result, increases in available resources
to the sector have not translated into improvements in key health outcomes. In the health sector,
system-wide problems contribute to Lesotho’s worsening outcomes. The first is low utilization
of health facilities due to the poor quality of services, perceived and actual. Service quality is
undermined by a lack of equipment, unavailability of essential commodities (approximately 60
percent of women cite “no drug availability” as their concern for accessing care), a poor referral
system between health centers and hospitals, and an inadequate number of skilled healthcare



                                                xv
workers. However, tertiary health services have improved recently with the opening of the
Queen Mamohato Hospital.

16.     Despite huge public spending in the education sector, poor educational outcomes
persist amid concerns about equitable access. Education received around 20 percent of the
overall budget (about 13.5 percent of GDP) in recent years. This level of spending is
exceptionally high for a country with Lesotho’s income level. At the primary level, enrollment
rates have improved, but quality remains an issue. Lack of post- primary education is a major
constraint to successful employment. However, secondary education is a privilege to the rich.
Low enrollment among students from low-income families stems from: poor rates of completion
and learning in primary schools, the secondary-level fee policies that restrict demand for
education; the still-widespread lack of secondary-education supply, especially in rural areas; and
the scale of absolute poverty. The vocational system is poorly aligned with labor market needs.
About 85 percent of tertiary students come from families in the upper two income quintiles.
Upon graduation, as many as a third of NUL students seek jobs abroad, mainly in South Africa,
where they are attracted by higher salaries, better career prospects, and more favorable living
conditions. Most graduates that remain in the country seek jobs in the public sector. The
curricula in the universities have weak linkages to private sector employers’ needs. Poor
Basotho, especially in rural areas, have limited access to financial services, which heightens
vulnerability and hinders their capacity to invest in sustainable livelihoods, such as improving
farm productivity or household enterprises.

17.     Access to basic services suffers from major rural-urban gaps. For instance, an
estimated 25 percent of the population has access to electricity, but only 5 percent live in rural
areas. Road quality and access to transport services in remote rural areas is low. Sanitation in
rural areas is much worse than in urban areas.

18.    Lesotho spends substantial resources on social transfers, but coverage of the very
poor is very low. Lesotho spends a large amount on transfer programs—about US$197
million a year, or 9 percent of GDP (around 15 percent of the overall budget). Most of the
money goes to the universal Old Age Pension, school feeding, and tertiary bursaries. These
programs yield some positive outcomes and enjoy strong popular and political support. However,
they are for the most part not designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability or promote

                                                  xvi
investment and employment. The majority of the transfers go to people who are not among the
poor or extreme poor. In sum, the current transfers and policies do not adequately support
resilience, equity, and opportunity. The government has recently started addressing such
weaknesses in the social protection system.

19.    Social inclusion and voice in Lesotho do not seem to be negatives for poverty
reduction and shared prosperity. In terms of gender, the 2006 Legal Capacity of Married
Persons (LCMP) Act, which gives women the right to engage in economic transactions in the
absence of their husbands, has not been fully implemented.

20.      Political instability is still an issue. In the past, political stability helped reduced
volatility and led to higher growth. More recently, due in great part to political uncertainties,
GDP growth dipped to a projected 2.8 percent in FY2014/15, down from 4.6 percent in
FY2013/14.

Sustainability: the need for reform and modernization of the public sector

21.     Sustaining the exchange rate peg, achieving fiscal sustainability, and rebuilding
buffers will depend on reducing ongoing fiscal liabilities. Fiscal consolidation efforts are
challenging when the government plays a critical role in employment and growth. Savings will
depend on greater efficiency and effectiveness of public spending. In other words, fiscal
consolidation can be achieved by downsizing, consolidating, or eliminating programs and
projects and by reviewing the wage policy and addressing recurrent irregularities in the public
finance and human resources management. In the end, fiscal consolidation will eventually
involve debating the size of public administration following an institutional and functional
review of the government.

22.     Above all, improving outcomes in Lesotho will require a significant reform and
modernization of the public sector, which is increasingly seen as a source of weakness
rather than strength. Poor outcomes in public investment have been most visible, but the
problems appear to run across the board. Reforms will require improvements in planning,
procurement, and management processes. They will also require far greater attention to
monitoring and evaluation. But more than anything, they will require a new approach to
government—a mindset that focuses on efficiency and accountability. This will in turn require
improvements in capacity (human capital) as well as adoption of modern techniques and, more
important, strengthening of the management culture through establishment of a Performance
Management System. Support for a more effective public service and more informed
policymaking will require substantial upgrading of statistical capacity to ensure access to more
regular, consistent, and comprehensive data. Finally, important environmental issues need to be
addressed, such as land degradation.

Priorities for eradicating extreme poverty and boosting share prosperity

23.    Lesotho faces a broad range of constraints in achieving the transition to this new
growth model, and subsequently in making continued, rapid progress toward eliminating
extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The SCD identifies 26 main challenges,
organized across three pathways of: (i) redefining the role of the state; (ii) promoting private
                                              xvii
sector-led, jobs-intensive growth; and (iii) strengthening individual and group assets. A
combination of desk assessment and consultation were used to identify the highest priority
challenges. The most important criteria was the impact that addressing these challenges would
have on eradicating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. This process resulted in
identifying five broad priority areas for intervention:

24.    None of the priority interventions outlined below will deliver rapid and sustainable
progress on the twin goals without addressing the fundamental challenge—the need to redefine
the role of the state:

      Fiscal consolidation: The sheer size of the state, coupled with misaligned expenditures,
       including a high wage bill, is one of the fundamental obstacles to the sustainability of
       inclusive growth, more diversified growth itself, and building assets among the poor.
       Fiscal consolidation can be achieved through downsizing or eliminating programs and
       projects and through headcount reductions, while at the same time improving outcomes.
       In addition, strengthening management of SACU receipts will be essential for
       macroeconomic stability. Other countries dealing with similar revenue fluctuations have
       successfully aligned public spending through credible estimates of long-term government
       revenue. Strengthening domestic revenue could be an alternative that would reduce
       dependency on SACU revenues. With other revenue sources in place, SACU windfalls
       could be used to restore buffers and to invest in key infrastructure to boost private-sector
       development.

      Public-sector modernization for effectiveness and efficiency: Fundamental to addressing
       the challenges are: regularizing human resource management and establishing a
       Performance Management System; improving the effectiveness and efficiency of public
       spending; adopting systems and processes to improve public investment management,
       project management, procurement, and program delivery; and putting in place systematic
       and meaningful processes for monitoring and accountability. Finally, a skilled and
       effective civil service is needed.

25.     The SCD argues for a fundamental shift to a new growth model, one that inclusion
place a central role and one that it creates sufficient, broad-based employment. This will
require developing a competitive and export-oriented private sector:

      Establishing incentives to support an outward-oriented private sector, including trade,
       competition, and business-regulation policies that ensure access to competitively priced
       inputs and skills and incentives to compete in tradable sectors. This will require
       redefining the role of the state in moving away from areas that should be undertaken by
       the private sector (for example, provisioning factory shells), cutting red tape in business
       regulation processes, and abandoning policies to promote national champions.

      Developing key infrastructure: To increase market access and lower costs, it will be
       necessary to close infrastructure gaps. This will require a focus on improving: (i) trade
       facilitation, (ii) access to electricity, (iii) sustainable and safe road connectivity, and (iv)
       the speed, quality, and cost effectiveness of ICT infrastructure.

                                                xviii
26.     Developing a competitive private sector capable of generating broad-based
employment will take time. During this time, a large share of the population, particularly those
in rural areas, will still rely on farming. Many of the poor and “near poor” that fall outside the
formal labor market will continue to face the risk of falling back into poverty. For this reason,
the country needs to focus on increasing the opportunities and returns to self-employment by
raising productivity of smallholders and microenterprises. Improving productivity and
increasing agricultural incomes is key to developing a more vibrant rural economy, which will in
turn create non-farm employment opportunities. The agenda for raising smallholder productivity
will focus on establishing the right incentives for adopting more appropriate technologies and
production methods to improve yields and mitigate risks. This will require strengthening the
extension system. In addition, seeking new opportunities, such as developing horticulture for
regional markets, will be important. Outside agriculture, interventions will promote a more
dynamic microenterprise sector, both in rural and urban areas, with a focus not only on entry into
self-employment and the SMME sector but also on improving productivity within the sector
through capacity-building and access to services.

27.    Developing a new growth model will also require major increases in productivity at
Lesotho’s firms, which will depend on substantial improvements in human capital:

      Human capital for employment, productivity, and human development: Lesotho’s private
       sector requires a workforce with better and more appropriate skills; this will be key to
       improving firm-level productivity and driving competitiveness in diversified sectors. But
       it also requires a much-improved health environment to ensure that all individuals have
       the capacity to contribute to productivity and enjoy adequate human development
       outcomes. This will require a specific focus on elements of both education and health.

      Education: Raising the quality of education, with a specific focus on aligning skills with
       labor market needs, will equip Basotho, especially the youth, to participate productively
       in the economy, whether through formal employment or microenterprises. The focus will
       be on improving the relevance of skills, primary education quality, primary completion
       rates, vocational training, and access to post-primary education for the poor.

      Health: Improving health care will focus on: (i) the health barriers to skills acquisition
       and labor-market participation, particularly infant and child malnutrition and the impact
       of disease (especially HIV) on female participation in income-earning activities and (ii)
       efforts to improve access to reproductive health services. Intensifying efforts to improve
       outcomes in HIV prevention is likely to be critical over the medium term. Life
       expectancy and incidence of disease are critical elements for Lesotho’s future.

28.     Achieving this transformation will take time. In the short term, it will be necessary to
strengthen the social-protection system. A social-protection reform is needed because of the
magnitude and depth of poverty in Lesotho, stagnation in the labor market, and the urgency to
arrest the rise of inequality in the short run. The priorities include improving targeting and
coordination, harmonizing fragmented programs, and moving toward a more effective system.

Conclusion

29.     Lesotho has an opportunity to eradicate extreme poverty and boost shared
prosperity in coming years. It will require shifting to a growth model led by an export-oriented
private sector, fortified by higher skilled, more productive, and more entrepreneurial individuals,
households, and firms. Lesotho cannot realize this new growth model without redefining the role
of the state. For this new model to develop, strong political consensus is necessary to push the
difficult reforms needed.

      1. SETTING THE SCENE
1.1     HIGH ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT NOT SHARED AMONG ALL THE BASOTHO

1.     Lesotho is a lower middle-income country with per capita gross national income of
US$1,500.4 It is a small, mostly mountainous, and largely rural country of about 2 million
people, completely surrounded by South Africa. It is one of the poorest countries in Southern
Africa, and one of the most unequal in the world (Figure 7). Lesotho has an open economy,
traditionally centered on trade. Its main exports are textiles, water, and diamonds. Lesotho’s
main trading partners are the United States and South Africa. As a member of the Common
Monetary Area (CMA), its currency is pegged to the South African rand.

2.     Economic growth has not been inclusive, resulting in persistent high levels of poverty
and inequality. The economy grew at an annual rate of 4 percent per capita over the past decade
(Figure 9), comparable to the rest of the SACU region, the African continent, and small states.
Lesotho underwent an important change in the drivers of growth, shifting from an economy
dependent on net exports to one driven primarily by government spending. Public spending rose
from 44.4 percent of GDP in FY2004/05 to about 63.1 percent in FY2014/15, one of the highest
such ratios in the world. This high level of public spending is unsustainable and can no longer be
relied upon to drive growth. Preliminary estimates based on the FY2010/11 household survey
show a national headcount poverty rate of 57.1 percent, virtually unchanged from the FY2002/03
survey.5 At the same time, inequality increased from a Gini coefficient of 0.51 to 0.53. Per capita
consumption of the bottom 40 percent of Lesotho’s population contracted by 0.4 percent
annually over the past five years, one of the world’s slowest rates. In other words, the rich got
richer and the poor got poorer. From a social point of view, the current growth performance is
not sustainable as it may lead to more political instability.

3.      Macroeconomic stability is a necessary condition for growth. The current growth
model is not sustainable and may lead to macroeconomic instability. The government has been
maintaining public spending above 60 percent of GDP over the past four years, and it is
projected to remain at the same level over the medium term. SACU receipts are projected to
decline over the next three years. As a result, it is expected that government deposits at the
Central Bank will decline, sapping international reserves. It is projected that reserves will fall
below four months of import coverage over the medium term. In the event of a shock,
international reserves will be used and may threaten the sustainability of the exchange rate peg.
Fiscal consolidation will be needed to rebuild the buffers and to help restore macroeconomic
stability.

4.     Political stability and strong political consensus are essential to achieving the twin
goals. In the past, political stability has helped reduced volatility and has led to higher growth.
Pre-1998 GDP per capita growth had a coefficient of variation of 0.73, compared to a post-1998

  Using the US$1.25 per day international poverty line leads to nearly similar results (55 percent), confirming the
severity of poverty in Lesotho.

                                                        1
coefficient of variation of 0.69 (Figure 11). In addition, GDP per capita almost doubled during
the period of relative political stability. More recently, due in great part to political uncertainties,
GDP growth dipped to a projected 2.8 percent in FY2014/15, down from 4.6 percent in
FY2013/14. Over this period, three major US wholesale retailers canceled their textile purchase
orders due to the political instability. Strong political consensus is necessary to make difficult
reforms needed for broad-based growth, and these policies may arouse vested interests.

5.     The government recognizes the need for inclusive growth. The National Vision 2020
document states these broad goals: “By the year 2020, Lesotho shall be a stable democracy, a
united and prosperous nation at peace with itself and its neighbors. It shall have a healthy and
well-developed human resource base. Its economy will be strong, its environment well managed,
and its technology well established.” To achieve these ends, the National Strategic Development
Plan (NSDP) seeks to: (i) pursue high, shared, and employment-creating economic growth [led
by the private sector]; (ii) develop key infrastructure; (iii) enhance the country’s skills base,
technology adoption, and foundations for innovation; (iv) improve health, combat HIV/AIDS,
and reduce (social) vulnerability; (v) reverse environmental degradation and adapt to climate
change; and (vi) promote peace and democratic governance and build effective institutions.
STATE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DEVELOPMENT

6.      Government is the formal sector’s largest employer. Its wage bill is among the
world’s highest at 21 percent of GDP. Most of these employees are on the top quintiles of the
income distribution (Figure 12). Among households depending primarily on public-sector wages,
78 percent are in the two highest income groups, compared with 32 percent of the population as a
whole. Very few households supported by public-sector employment are in the lowest income
groups. Government institutions show a weak capacity to plan and implement programs,
resulting in poor social outcomes and poor service delivery.

7.      Public spending is large, regressive, and inefficient and has poor effectiveness.
Government spending could have led to a rise of the relative price of non-tradables to tradables,
leading to a decline in the private sector’s share of total investment. At least 20 percent of public
spending is regressive. Finally, Lesotho spends close to 32 percent of GDP, or more than half the
government’s budget, in three social sectors: education, health, and social protection. Deep-
rooted inefficiencies in social spending have reduced the expenditures’ effectiveness.

8.      A number of factors hinder Lesotho’s private-sector growth. The NSDP
acknowledges an “uncompetitive business environment” as one of the most binding constraints
on the growth of private enterprises, adversely affecting both FDI and local SMEs. All
quantitative measures—including Global Trade Reports, Doing Business Indicators, and
Enterprise Surveys—suggest that business regulations are a serious constraint on growth. In Ease
of Doing Business, for example, Lesotho ranked No. 128 out of 185 countries in 2014 (Table 2).
Lesotho has made important reforms, notably in streamlining the processes for starting
businesses and registering property. Nevertheless, a number of factors that hinder private-sector
growth remain at almost every stage of business—from accessing land to obtaining construction
permits, engaging in cross-border trade with South Africa, and accessing finance. For example, it
may take more than a year for foreigners to establish firms in Lesotho, compared with less than a
year in South Africa, Rwanda, and Vietnam. According to the Lesotho data in Doing Business
2015, it takes 29 days to get a business registered, 179 days to obtain a construction permit, and
31 days to export. In addition, gaining access to land could take up to a year. Domestic investors
are further constrained by the relatively high cost of capital, despite a well-capitalized banking
system. Entrepreneurship is nascent in the country, with the domestic private sector still seen as
reliant on the state and concentrated in non-tradable sectors.

9.      Redefining the role of the state will be critical for development. Improving the overall
business environment by cutting the red tape in government processes and complementing it
with trade facilitation will be essential to attracting new FDI, promoting domestic private-sector
growth, and creating new jobs. Focusing on these sources of competitiveness is all the more
important because some key policies for improving competitiveness are not under the
government’s direct control. They include: (i) exchange rate policy, determined by the maloti’s
peg to the rand; and (ii) trade policy, decided at the SACU level. A pickup in private-sector
competitiveness and job creation would create the necessary space for public-sector fiscal
consolidation, a prerequisite in restoring macroeconomic stability. Fiscal consolidation could
weigh on future growth, especially if not matched by enhanced effectiveness of spending and

extremely difficult when the private sector is not generating jobs.

1.2       PREPARING FOR A CHALLENGING FUTURE

10.      An export-led model driven by the private sector is essential to Lesotho’s prospects.
As the country seeks to shift to high, shared, and employment-creating economic growth, it
needs to be more effective in building assets from its existing endowments, while overcoming
critical asset gaps. A brief summary of these main endowments follows:

         Natural resources:
              Minerals: Mining has become an important source of export revenues. The sector
                 includes two diamond mines in commercial production; a third is shutdown but
                 Lesotho is studying the feasibility of re-opening it on a larger scale. Three other
                 diamond deposits are being sampled and tested, although one is mired in legal
                 disputes. Lesotho also produces sandstone, and it is also believed to have reserves
                 of uranium, coal, gas, and copper.
              Water: The combination of high altitude, abundant water, and geographic
                 proximity to major demand centers means that Lesotho is strategically situated as
                 a water tower of Southern Africa. Lesotho currently generates on average about 3
                 percent of GDP a year in royalties from the LHWP.
              Biodiversity: Lesotho’s biodiversity resources in the Drakensberg and Highland
                 areas have great potential for tourism.

         Human capital: In 2010, 31.5 percent of the Basotho population lived abroad. However,
          migration as a percentage of population has been declining along with remittances. Over
          the past two decades, emigration has shifted from young adults and teenagers to mostly
          older adults (Figure 13). The migration decline among teenagers and young adults has
          been tantamount to a considerable increase in the labor supply, creating pressures on the
          government to absorb a larger share of workers coming into the labor market because the
          private sector is unable to create enough jobs. Currently, people between the ages of 13 to
          25 years are the largest population cohort. As these youth move into working age, they
          could generate a demographic dividend if (i) they have labor-market relevant education
          and skills and (ii) the private sector has the capacity to absorb them. Improvements in
          health and education could further boost to this dividend. However, key skills remain in
          short supply and entrepreneurialism is still nascent.

         Location: Lesotho’s location has been one of its comparative advantages; being within
          South Africa provides access to markets and advanced infrastructure that creates links
          with the rest of the world.



7
  Lesotho’s 2014 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score was 3.5, slightly above the average for
IDA borrowing countries (Figure 12). However, it lags the IDA’s top performers. In particular, the country trails the
IDA average in fiscal policy, equity of public resource use, building human resources, and quality of budgetary and
financial management.

                               Knowledge Gap: Remittances, Migration and Brain Drain
There is very limited information on income on the household survey. Also, there is no information on migrants. A
comprehensive household survey, which has an income and consumption module as well as social and economic
characteristics of migrants is needed. This will allow seeing whether remittances may have created Dutch-disease
type effects in the country or other effects on human capital formation. For instance, a large migrant population may
also affect school decisions and the behaviour of children left behind. Also, there is only dated and anecdotal
evidence on the brain drain. Further research on this issue is needed.

11.     To eradicate extreme poverty, Lesotho must build a larger and resilient middle
class. Achieving this will require an export-led model driven by the private sector. Lesotho’s
current model, where government spending drives the economy, is not sustainable and cannot be
relied upon to create new jobs. The role of the state must be redefined. Government spending
needs to be more effective and efficient. Achieving this structural change will require a more
effective building of assets, especially human capital and institutions. A critical part of this asset-
building strategy will be developing a larger, more dynamic, and more competitive private
sector. Achieving this transformation will take time. In the short term, it will be necessary to
strengthen the social protection system and to increase the productivity of smallholders.
Maintaining political stability as well as macroeconomic stability will be critical, and in
particular, fiscal sustainability will be necessary because of the currency peg.

12.     Reform of the public sector is fundamental. From the fiscal perspective, it is key to
sustainability. More important, it is critical to all aspects of the transformation and modernization
of the country, including delivering on key infrastructure investments, supporting the
development of the private sector, raising the level of health and educational outcomes, and
improving the effectiveness of social safety nets.

1.3     OBJECTIVES AND STRUCTURE OF THIS REPORT

13.    The World Bank and the Government of Lesotho are engaged in defining the new
Country Partnership Framework (CPF). In-depth consultation began in the third quarter of
FY15, with the CPF targeted for approval by the World Bank’s Board in the first quarter of
FY16. This Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) note is expected to play a central role in these
consultations.


                                                         6
14.    The SCD’s objective is to address the question: What are the most critical
constraints and opportunities facing a country in accelerating progress toward the goals of
ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner? The
emphasis is on identifying priorities over the next five to seven years (the timeframe of the CPF),
while recognizing some critical interventions will only bear fruit over the longer term.

15.    The SCD is expected to be a relatively brief report, based on a comprehensive
analysis of the available evidence8 and developed in consultation with national authorities
and other stakeholders as well as all parts of the World Bank Group.

16.       The remainder of this SCD is structured as follows:
         Chapter 2: Understanding poverty in Lesotho: profiles and progress: presents an analysis
          of recent trends in poverty, inequality, and the welfare of the bottom 40 percent of the
          population; it includes profiles of the poor by demographic and geographic perspectives
          as well as a review of the main determinants of poverty.
         Chapter 3: Assessing the drivers of growth in Lesotho: presents a survey of past growth
          patterns and recent trends, including an analysis of the main sectors, trade and
          investment, and private sector development, along with implications for labor markets.
         Chapter 4: Inclusion: building assets at the micro-level: assesses the degree to which
          individuals and groups are in a position to build and leverage assets to contribute to and
          benefit from growth; this includes analysis of education, skills, health, and other key
          assets along dimensions of gender, location, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity.
         Chapter 5: Is the growth model sustainable?: assesses the sustainability of the current
          growth model.

      2. UNDERSTANDING POVERTY IN LESOTHO
Identifying the challenges to eliminating poverty and promoting poverty reduction requires an
understanding of the scope and nature of poverty in Lesotho today. This chapter will show that poverty
has stagnated over the past decade. Poverty remains high and concentrated among certain groups. Most
important, inequality has increased and it is relatively high, acting as a barrier to both growth and
poverty reduction.

2.1      OVERVIEW: POVERTY, SHARED PROSPERITY, AND INEQUALITY

17.     Low quality and a lack of comparability in Lesotho’s survey data hinder conclusive
analysis on poverty trends. This chapter uses the early adopted imputation method to partly
restore the estimations’ comparability. The main finding is that the national poverty rate in
FY2010/11 was almost the same as it was in FY2002/03. The analysis below presents the main
emerging results on poverty and inequality trends and validates the emerging results of poverty
stagnation by using non-income dimensions of poverty and labor analysis. Box 1 discusses how
the problem of survey incomparability and issues of consumption data quality was resolved.

Box 1: Calculating consumption aggregate using non-comparable surveys
 
The Lesotho Bureau of Statistics collected three rounds of the Household Budget Survey (HBS) over the past 20
years. They have serious comparability issues due to changes in the survey design, survey instruments, and data
quality.

The FY1994/95 HBS and FY2002/03 HBS differ on questions aimed at capturing household consumption. Both
surveys, for example, used a four-week diary module to collect consumption data. However, the FY1994/95 round
has no separate recording for farming and other household businesses, only a joint recording. The 2002/03 HBS has
separate questions for the two types of household activities (for a full list of data quality and comparability details,
see World Bank, 2008). Previous studies have argued against drawing any conclusions about the evolution of
poverty in Lesotho based on the FY1994/95 and FY2002/03 surveys.

The FY2010/11 household survey is a different type. Launched by the Bureau of Statistics in May 2009, it is known
as Continuous Multipurpose Survey (CMS), with the aim of addressing a need for timely data. CMS is quarterly,
with a core questionnaire and add-on modules, and each household is supposed to be revisited four times before
being replaced. However, analysis of available datasets shows that the CMS failed to revisit the same households for
four consecutive quarters. The attrition rate is substantial at the household level—only 35 percent of the original
households could be re-interviewed in the following three quarters.

In addition to changes in survey design, there are significant changes in consumption data collection. The
FY2010/11 CMS collected expenditure data via a diary over one-week period (versus four weeks in the FY2002/03
HBS), recording what households paid in total for food, drinks, hygienic products, and other consumables. The diary
was supplemented by a recall of all purchases of food, non-food, and rent paid over a specified time period. The two
surveys use different consumption items and, according to Allwine et al. (2013), almost half of the households in the
first quarter sample do not report consumption of staple foods like cereals, bread, or potatoes over the prior week.
This did not occur in the FY2002/03 HBS.

To overcome such discrepancies and provide comparable consumption aggregates, a survey-to survey imputation
technique has been applied to the FY2010/11 CMS (Allwine et al., 2013). The approach consists of estimating the
consumption model using expenditure data from the FY2002/03 survey and a set of household characteristics. It
then applies the estimated parameters to FY2010/11 data to predict per capita consumption in that period. The
predictions are reliable if the model is stable—i.e., the consumption patterns and the error structure do not change

                                                           8
over time; non-monetary correlates are good predictors of consumption and are comparable over time.
Different model specifications using various combinations of the FY2010/11 survey data from different quarters
provided four different poverty numbers, ranging between 50.7 percent and 57.1 percent. The poverty headcount
number endorsed by the authors is 57.1 percent, based on the first quarter of FY2010/11 CMS. It was estimated
using a set of covariates, including a dummy for each district, a dummy for urban areas, a second degree polynomial
in household size, the share of household members completing primary and higher education, a set of dummies to
capture the employment status of household’s head, and a dummy for whether households have access to electricity.
The proposed method of estimating poverty in Lesotho has been adopted by Lesotho Bureau of Statistics and used in
its official publications.

18.    Lesotho’s national and extreme poverty are high. In FY2010-11, an estimated 57.1
percent of the population lived below the national poverty line, and 34.0 percent were below the
food (or extreme) poverty line, with expenditures below minimum food requirements (Table 3).
National poverty has been stagnant, with a mild increase from FY2002/03 to FY2010/11, while
extreme poverty increased 1.1 percentage points during the period. The national poverty
estimates were almost identical to the international poverty estimated based on the US$1.25 per
day standard (Table 3).

Note: National poverty rate calculated at national poverty line as defined by BoS; extreme poverty rate calculated
based on food portion of the national poverty line as defined by BoS; US$1.25 per day is the internationally
comparable measure of extreme poverty, which measures the share of the population with consumption per capita
less than US$1.25 PPP a day, expressed in 2005 prices.

19.     International comparison suggests that Lesotho is one of the most unequal and, at
the same time, one of the poorest countries in the world, and the grim situation has
deteriorated over the past decade. Lesotho is one of the 10 most unequal countries in the
world, with inequality in FY2010/11 at 53.8, measured by the Gini coefficient. Inequality has
increased from 51.7 in FY2002/03. Striking disparities remain across socioeconomic groups in
income, wealth, and living conditions. Consumption is 14 times higher among the top 10 percent
of the population than the bottom 10 percent. Figure 14 places low- and middle-income countries
with available survey data in four quadrants, based on their levels of poverty and inequality circa
2010. Lesotho is among a small group of countries in the quadrant with extremely high poverty
rates (measured by US$1.25 per day) and very high inequality. Only eight countries had higher
poverty levels and only 10 had higher inequality. The situation has deteriorated over time—only
seven other countries show inequality increases higher than Lesotho’s. Poverty in Lesotho was
stagnant between FY2002/03 and FY2010/11, while the majority of countries experienced
reductions in poverty over the same period (Figure 15).

20.    Lesotho’s poverty is not only high, but it is also deep, and the depth has increased
over time. The headcount poverty rate does not distinguish between those with consumption just
below the poverty line and those deeper in poverty. Policies designed to improve the well-being
of those at the bottom of the consumption distribution will result in poverty reduction only if

benefits are sufficient to cross the poverty line. The poverty gap measures9 “the depth of poverty,
or how far the poor are from the poverty line.” The poverty gap in Lesotho was reported at 29.5
in FY2010/11, an increase of 0.6 percentage point from FY2002/03. Among the 30 poorest
countries, Lesotho’s poverty gap ranked ninth (Figure 16).

21.    Lesotho was Africa’s third-worst performer in terms of shared prosperity over the
past decade. Shared prosperity is measured by the annual growth in consumption per capita
among the bottom 40 percent of the population. In Lesotho, this indicator was negative between
FY2002/03 and FY2010/11 (Figure 17). In Africa, only Zambia and the Central African
9
 Poverty gap is the mean shortfall from the poverty line (counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall), expressed
as a percentage of the poverty line. This measure reflects the depth of poverty as well as its incidence.

                                                                                                 10
Republic had worse performances than Lesotho in terms of this shared prosperity indicator. To
better illustrate the meaning of the shared prosperity indicator, the consumption growth by
percentiles is presented in the Growth Incidence Curve analysis (GIC, Figure 18). The GIC
shows that the bottom 40 percent of Lesotho’s population experienced a 0.4 percent per year
consumption decline in real terms between FY2002/03 and FY2010/11, compared to annual
growth of 0.9 percent for the remaining 60 percent and 1.1 percent for the top 20 percent.

22.     The high level of inequality is one of the main factors behind Lesotho’s continuing
economic stagnation, and the increase in inequality is attributed to the recent stagnation in
poverty. Changes in poverty can be decomposed into growth and redistribution (inequality-
related) effects. Assuming the imputation provides a good proxy of the actual unobserved
consumption aggregated in FY201/11 in Lesotho, the inequality increase had an adverse effect
on the poor. The analysis shows that poverty would have dropped by about 1.95 percentage
points if not for the increase in inequality; it has actually increased 0.5 percentage points (Figure
19).

2.2     WHO ARE THE POOR AND THE BOTTOM 40 PERCENT IN LESOTHO?

Spatial dimension of poverty

23.     Lesotho is marked by large geographical differentials in poverty and inequality.
Like the majority of poor African countries, people who live in poverty tend to be clustered in
certain regions and rural areas rather than being spread evenly across the country. Almost 80
percent of Lesotho’s population resides in the rural areas. About 61 percent of the rural
population is considered poor, while only 39 percent of the poor live in urban areas. The spatial
rural/urban distribution of the poverty does not show significant changes over time (Table 3). As
of FY2010/11, approximately 87 percent of the poor lived in the rural areas. The substantial
differences across districts found in FY2002/03 still persist in FY2010/11. Poverty ranges


                                                    11
between 43.5 percent in Quthing and 66.5 percent in Butha-Buthe. In general, poverty is higher
in the north and northwest and relatively lower in the central and southeast areas (Figure 20).

24.      Some indications point to a convergence in poverty and inequality across districts.
Figure 21 shows initial levels of district poverty and inequality and changes in the two indicators.
Districts with higher poverty rates in FY2002/03 experienced declines in poverty—for example,
Quthing district stands out with a reduction of about 11 percentage points. At the same time,
districts with lower poverty rates in FY2002/03 had increases in poverty headcounts. In Thaba
Tseka district, for instance, the poverty rate increased more than 6 percentage points to 45.8
percent in FY2010/11. Similarly, there was a convergence in inequality across districts between
FY2002/03 and FY2010/11. Given the overall increase in inequality, the convergence occurred
because districts with high inequality in FY2002/03, such as Maseru, experienced small
reductions in inequality, and districts with low initial inequality saw increases of the Gini index
of about 8 percentage points, as in the case of Qacha’s Nek.

Poverty profile

25.    For many people in Lesotho, poverty is associated with the inability to overcome
hunger, very high illiteracy rates, illness, and large families. As previously mentioned, the
FY2010/2011 survey data show that almost 30 percent of Lesotho’s population lived below the
extreme (or food) poverty line and hardly had enough food for survival. About half of the adult
population had completed less than primary education, and 61 percent of this group was poor.

26.    Poor households tend to have more children, and poverty rates increase with age,
the highest (65 percent) being among the elderly over 64 years old. The age-gender pyramid
has a broad base that clearly characterizes a poor country, with a large proportion of children in
poverty and a high childhood dependency ratio (Figure 22). Together, children (up to 14 years of
age) and the elderly (60+) account for approximately 44 percent of the poor. Similarly, extreme
poverty is concentrated among the elderly (the highest rate of 38.8 percent is among those aged
60 to 64), followed by children aged 6 to 14 (36.8 percent) and by those between 55 and 59 years
of age (37 percent). The poverty age profile shows a typical U-shaped pattern, with poverty
higher among youth and the elderly and lower among the working-age population (Figure 23).
Changes occurred between FY2002/03 and FY2010/11, with poverty increasing among youth
and elderly, and it led to higher poverty rates among the elderly, compared to the youngest
generations.

27.     The age pattern of poverty is partly a reflection of the household composition;
larger households, and particularly households with a larger number of elderly, are more
likely to be poor. Poverty rates increase monotonically with the number of household members.
In FY2010/11, they were as low as 30 percent among households with just one member. Among
households with seven or more members, it rises to 66 percent, or 9 percentage points above the
national average. The average size of poor households was 6.5 persons in FY2010/11, compared
to 5.8 persons for non-poor families. Poverty rates increase with the number of elderly (above 60
years of age) in the household—from 54 percent in households with no elderly to 62 percent in
households with one or two elderly and 72 percent among households with three elderly
members (Figure 23).


                                                                                                       13
28.     Household structure and gender impact poverty, with females disadvantaged. In
comparison to two- parent families (57.8 percent poor), female headed households are slightly
more likely to be poor (58.1 percent) and single-father families are substantially less likely to be
poor (48.5 percent). However, the poverty rate for two-parent families increased by 3 percentage
points over the past seven years, while it went down for single-parent families, particularly for
single-father families, with a decline of 10.7 percentage points (Figure 24).

29.     Education is an important factor in poverty levels, with higher educational
attainments corresponding to lower poverty rates. Some 27 percent of individuals who
completed less than primary education fall into the lowest quartile of the consumption
distribution, compared with 23 percent among those completing primary education and less than
9 percent among those completing tertiary or higher education (Figure 25). Households headed
by the uneducated (61 percent) had poverty rates twice as high as households headed by
someone with higher education (30 percent) (Figure 26). Poverty and location are correlated with
worse educational outcomes.

levels. The labor market is characterized by a low employment-to-working-age population ratio,
a high level of unemployment, a high proportion of employment outside of the country, and a
well-paid public sector.10 As suggested in the IMF Article IV publication (2012), a relatively
high proportion of Lesotho’s labor force is employed outside of the country, and South Africa’s
shift toward the use of local labor significantly reduced the demand for workers from Lesotho,
leading to a systematic decline in international remittances.11 The broad unemployment rate,
which includes discouraged workers, is estimated at 28 percent, and it is as high as 43.2 percent
among youths aged 15 to 24.

31.     Employment generally plays an important role in poverty reduction, but low
earnings among subsistence farmers has adverse impact on the rural poverty. Data from
FY2002/03 and FY2010/11 allow us to combine employment and poverty outcomes. An
estimated 53 percent of the employed were poor in FY2010/11, compared with 61.4 percent
among the unemployed and 58 percent among the inactive. The large differential in headcount
poverty between urban and rural areas and the relatively small difference in poverty rates among
working and non-working individuals are likely attributable to a larger share of the rural
population being employed in subsistence agriculture and/or in agricultural jobs that do not pay
high wages. On the contrary, urban areas are characterized by a larger share of the employed
population in wage-earning jobs outside agriculture, including the well-paid public sector, where
workers earn an average monthly salary about seven times higher than the minimum monthly
wage of a skilled worker in the textile sector. Figure 28 illustrates that households headed by an
employed person are less likely to be poor, compared to households headed by someone who is
unemployed or, even worse, someone who is inactive or not participating in the labor market. It
suggests that a substantial increase in productivity of the employed population will be needed to
get out of poverty because poverty rates between the employed and unemployed don’t differ that
much.

    Public sector is well-paid locally but not necessarily if compared with neighboring countries.

   A large share of remittances flows through informal channels due to high cost. As specified in FSDS there is a
need to make formal channels more efficient, accessible and affordable so that more funds can flow through formal
financial system.

 Main correlations and drivers of poverty in Lesotho

 What has deteriorated?
 32.     Farm earnings (including subsistence farming) remains the main source of income
 in Lesotho, but its importance and possibly magnitude has been reduced. The share of
 households reporting farming as the main source of income fell from 40 percent in FY2002/03 to
 35.6 percent in FY2010/2011. The largest decline has occurred in the poorest quintile, the group
 mostly relying on subsistence agriculture. In other words, fewer poor households derived most of
 their income from farming.




                                                       16
33.     Remittances went down for everybody. A 40 percent reduction has occurred in the
share of households reporting remittances as the main source of income. The pattern is constant
across all quintiles of the consumption distribution.
What has improved?
34.     The growth of the salaries from the public sector as main source of household income
was very strong for the bottom quintiles of the consumption distribution, yet the increase did not
lead to a re-ranking of the main sources of income. The average increase was rather small—from
8.2 percent to 8.8 percent. Middle-income groups are relatively better off and rely more on
public-sector wages, whereas the richest households rely less on wages from the public sector.
35.     Salaries from the private sector gained importance in relative terms. The role of
private sector wages doubled for the bottom quintile and increased by about 10 percentage points
among all the consumption groups.
What has remained constant?
36.     Non-farm self-employment remained largely constant, with some variation across
quintiles of the consumption distribution.
37.    The role of pensions and social assistance increased, but the proportion of households
relying mainly on social protection incomes remains small. Slightly more households report
pensions and social assistance as the main sources of income (Figure 30).
38.     Regions show large differences in terms of the relative importance of sources of
income (Figure 31). Earnings from the public sector are the main income source for a larger
share of households in urban areas, both in Maseru and in other cities. Compared to rural areas,
more households in the urban areas report the private sector as the main source of income;
however, the gap across regions is much smaller than the difference for public-sector earnings.
The proportion of households relying on farming in rural areas is still driven by proximity to
Maseru and its job opportunities, rather than by the quality of the main agricultural resource
(land). In the rural lowland region, which has the best agricultural land, less than 30 percent of
households report farming as the main source of income, compared to 54 percent in the rural
mountain region.

 39.     Some improvements in labor-market outcomes occurred between FY2002/03 and
 FY2010/11. The share of individuals aged 15+ who were employed increased from 42 percent to
 47 percent. The unemployed dropped from 12 percent to 8.5 percent; the inactives declined from
 46 percent to 44.5 percent (Figure 32). Improvements in the share of individuals aged 15+ who
 are employed and unemployed were proportionally larger among the poorest segment of the
 population. Even so, the richest segment of those aged 15+ still accounted for the largest share of
 the employed—51 percent, compared with 43.3 percent among individuals in the bottom
 quintile. Figure 33 illustrates how the share of vulnerable employment—i.e., unpaid family
 workers and the self-employed (both inside and outside agriculture)—declined over time, with
 workers in wage-paying jobs increasing from 51.3 percent to 62.1 percent of the employed
 population aged 15+. The share of wage-earning workers increased along the consumption
 distribution, whereas the proportion of subsistence farmers and unpaid family workers declined
 among better-off households. The self-employed were more evenly distributed across
 consumption quintiles, indicating a significant amount of heterogeneity in the type and success
 of non-farm enterprises. Similar evidence was found for employers in FY2002/03, but seven
 years later employers were more likely to be in the top of the distribution.

 40.    The proportion of wage-earning workers increased more rapidly among poor
 households than among non-poor households, indicating that getting a wage-paying job
 might be instrumental in moving up the consumption ladder but may not always be enough
 to rise out of poverty. This stresses the need to increase labor productivity. The level of
 education emerges as a crucial factor, correlated with the type of employment. Farming does not
 require any formal education, and individuals completing less than primary education had the
 highest probability of working in this sector.

                          Knowledge Gap: Limited understanding of the growth-poverty link
 There are important discrepancies between the income from national accounts and consumption from the household
 survey. Due to the poor quality of data, a deeper analysis cannot be made on the growth-poverty link. There is a
 need to strengthen the household survey methodology.

 2.3         LOOKING AHEAD: ADDRESSING INEQUALITY IS THE KEY TO POVERTY ELIMINATION

 41.    Micro simulations indicate that,12 assuming 5 percent annual GDP growth, poverty
 in Lesotho will decline from 56.9 percent in FY2010/11 to approximately 50 percent in 2016
 and close to 44 percent in 2020 (Figure 34). The reduction is primarily driven by the
 cumulative growth in per capita consumption that corresponds to 5 percent GDP growth. Our
 estimates suggest, however, that the range of poverty reduction could be quite wide, depending
 on the assumption for consumption elasticity. In 2016, the estimated range of poverty rates is
 between 47.6 percent and 51.6 percent; by 2020, the range is even wider, between 41.1 percent
 and 47.7 percent.

 42.     Our projections foresee further increases in inequality. The baseline scenario points
 to an increase in Gini-measured inequality from 53.8 in FY2010/11 to 55.8 in 2020. The
 disparities in poverty between urban and rural areas are also expected to increase. The main
 driver of the expected increase in the income inequality is the higher disparity in consumption
 between sectors and the continued relative deterioration of agriculture. Another factor
 contributing to higher inequality is the projected increase in educational disparities between
 urban and rural areas. The projected increase in inequality will have adverse effects on the pace
 of poverty reduction. To reverse the trend, policies to reduce income inequality will be required.

43.     Both economic growth and policy-driven inequality reduction are required for
faster poverty reduction. The scenarios suggest a relatively slow pace of poverty reduction and
a significant increase in inequality. Even under very plausible assumptions on growth (5 percent
a year), the socio-economic situation in Lesotho improves slowly. A slowdown in economic
growth following internal or external shocks could hamper poverty reduction. The next figures
explore the simulations’ sensitivity to GDP growth and inequality changes. Figure 35 presents
the so-called poverty trace curve, showing how poverty would fall under assumed changes in
consumption growth and inequality. By 2020, it suggests, various combinations of poverty and
inequality changes would produce a range of poverty changes in Lesotho. Just assuming GDP 5
percent growth could lead to an approximately 40 percent increase in consumption. However,
poverty could range between 35 percent and 50 percent depending on the inequality level.
Similarly, the consumption growth rate by itself has significant impact on poverty. Figure 36
shows a significant range of poverty based on different growth rates. It is estimated that
increases in agricultural productivity equal to agricultural and services growth would lead to an
additional poverty reduction of 3 percentage points, keeping average growth constant.

Social protection can play a major role in eliminating extreme poverty

44.     Because of the magnitude and depth of poverty in Lesotho, and stagnation in the
labor market, a social protection reform is needed. Lesotho spends about 4.6 percent of GDP
on social protection transfers, but most of them do not target the poor. According to World Bank
(2013), Lesotho spends about US$197 million annually in social transfers, or roughly US$104
per person. If this amount were targeted to the poorest 25 percent of the population, it would
provide a transfer of about US$319 per person, an amount almost equal to poverty-line income.13
In other words, the total amount Lesotho spends annually on social assistance would be more
than enough to completely close the consumption gap and eradicate poverty. If all social safety
net programs were targeted through a proxy-means testing method, the incidence of the social
assistance would improve dramatically (Figure 37). Depending on the selection criterion, we
would have up to two-thirds of individuals in the first two quintiles of the income distribution
receiving benefits—a sharp improvement from the 5 percent to 6 percent currently receiving
benefits.

Job creation and skills are the key for poverty reduction

45.      While social protection plays an important role in reducing poverty and inequality,
it will not be sufficient and will not be sustainable. Based on the poverty analysis, broad-based
job creation is needed. However, a job will not be a sufficient condition to lift people out of
poverty. It will also require higher labor productivity, which puts the focus on improving the
skills of the labor force. At the heart of the problem is the need of new growth model capable of
creating the employment opportunities necessary to ensure the sustainability of poverty
elimination and shared prosperity. Chapters 3 and 4 explore the potential for greater employment
generation in more detail, assessing the macro environment for sustainable inclusive growth and
the micro environment for individuals and groups to take advantage of growth to create
productive employment opportunities and improve human development outcomes.

      3. ASSESSING THE DRIVERS OF GROWTH IN LESOTHO
Eradicating extreme poverty and ensuring shared prosperity in a sustainable way requires strong broad-
based growth. But as this chapter will show, the nature of growth will need to change from a model
driven by the public sector to one that is private sector-driven, export-oriented, and job creating.
3.1      AN OVERVIEW OF LESOTHO’S GROWTH MODEL AND ITS CHALLENGES

46.     Lesotho has undergone changes over the past three decades, adjusting to new
realities and shocks. The economy has grown at an annual rate of 2.5 percent per capita—
modest for its income level but comparable to the rest of the SACU region, the African
continent, and small states.14 The economy has adapted to new realities and taken advantage of
new growth opportunities. The changes have involved shifts from subsistence agriculture and
remittances toward mining, water exports, manufacturing exports, and services.

47.     Over the past decade, the economy’s drivers shifted from net exports to
consumption and investment, led by government (Figure 38). Exports were the most dynamic
component of aggregate demand in 2001-06, with annual average growth of 16.6 percent. During
this period, economic growth benefited from expanding world trade; however, global export
demand declined during the international financial crisis, and public spending and private
consumption became Lesotho’s main growth engines in 2008. The expansion of government
spending on the back of volatile SACU revenues during these years partly offset the export
slowdown—until government spending also fell victim to the international crisis. The crisis first
had a negative impact on South African imports and later on SACU transfers to Lesotho. In
response to the important decline in SACU receipts in 2010, the government cut its budget by 10
percentage points of GDP. The following year, however, the government continued its
expansionary fiscal stance. Since 2012, government spending has been the main engine growth,
driven primarily by higher government wages and investment. Over this shift in the drivers of
growth, poverty has stagnated and inequality has increased.
48.     From the supply side, the economic structure changed from manufacturing and
agriculture, the largest employers, to mining, construction and government services
(Figure 39). Over the past two years, growth has been driven largely by the construction sector,
led by the ongoing Metolong Dam project and other government building and construction
activities.15

Public spending cannot drive the economy forever

49.     GDP growth since the crisis has been robust, averaging 5 percent between 2008 and
2013—almost twice the global average. The existing growth model’s main problems center on
sustainability and inclusiveness. Public spending cannot remain at its current level without
posing a threat to macroeconomic stability. This issue will be discussed in more detail in Chapter
5. In this chapter, the focus will be on the current growth model’s inability to generate the
necessary jobs to eradicate extreme poverty and improve shared prosperity. Government is
already the formal economy’s largest employer, with a payroll of more than 50,000 persons.
Mining is one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy, but it is a capital intensive sector
that provides only about 2,000 jobs. To understand where growth will come from, we need to
examine what happened to net exports over the past decade.

Why did net exports decline?

50.    Over the past decade, net exports declined significantly. From a peak of 62 percent of
GDP in FY2002/03, exports have fallen below 50 percent since FY2009/10 (Figure 40). Imports
show a similar pattern, declining from a peak of 108 percent of GDP in FY2002/03 to 84 percent
of GDP in FY2013/14.

51.    During 2000-10, textile exports drove the decline in exports. They dropped from a
peak of 49.6 percent of GDP in FY2002/03 to 16 percent of GDP in FY2013/14. Water exports
remained at about 2.8 percent of GDP over this period and agriculture products at about 0.6
percent of GDP. Diamonds exports increased from 3.3 percent of GDP in FY2004/05 to 14
percent of GDP in FY2013/2014. Other manufacturing exports fluctuated between 6 percent and
10 percent of GDP over this period.

52.     Textile and clothing exports have been decreasing steadily. Exports, employment, and
the number of firms in the apparel sector reached their highest levels in 2004. After that, the
phase-out of the Multifiber Arrangement (MFA) resulted in a major decline in US apparel
imports from the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, including Lesotho (Kaplinsky and Morris, 2008).
The decline was aggravated by other factors, including lack of clarity over the extension of the
third country fabric (TCF) derogation16 under AGOA in 2004 and the rapid appreciation of the
rand17 (Morris and Sedowski 2006, Figure 42). Figure 43 shows that the real exchange rate
moved back to parity after 2004, and textile exports continued their downward trend, suggesting
that other factors were instrumental in the industry’s deterioration. According to Lall (2005),
Lesotho’s labor productivity is low, ranging from 30 percent to 70 percent of East Asia’s.
According to the World Bank (2012), internal factors such as relatively low productivity in
Lesotho’s firms and infrastructural challenges, particularly related to water supply and treatment,
transport, logistics and customs, played a role in the sector’s decline after 2004.

   The TCF under AGOA allows selected countries to source fabric from anywhere in the world and still maintain
the AGOA trade preference. In the absence of TCF, countries are required to source fabric from within the region in
order to qualify for the AGOA preference.

   Between mid-2003 and 2006, the rand strengthened from R12 per US$1 to R6 to US$1. The maloti is pegged 1:1
against the rand.

53.     Lesotho managed to avoid a collapse of exports, partly through external events,
including extension of AGOA TCF derogation through 2015 and the Duty Credit
Certificate Scheme (DCCS) in the context of SACU,18 and partly through government
initiatives, including a reduction in the corporate tax rates (from 15 percent to 0 percent
for export firms outside SACU and 10 percent for firms producing for the SACU market)
and several multi-stakeholder lobbying efforts in the US. But exports to the US dropped off
considerably once again after 2008 as a result of the ending of the China safeguards and, more
important, the global economic crisis (Figure 41). Exports to the US decreased by 11 percent in
2008 and 18 percent in 2009. While textile and clothing employment had stabilized in the range
of 45,000 to 47,000 workers in the late 2000s, it fell to 38,880 in the third quarter of 2011, still
accounting for 86.5 percent of total employment in the manufacturing sector (Figure 44).

54.     According to the World Bank (2012), a key factor preventing further decline in the
apparel sector has been significant growth in investment and exports targeting the South
African market. This has occurred through the relocation of South African manufacturing
activities to Lesotho, mainly to take advantage of cheaper labor. Between 2006 and 2010,
apparel exports from Lesotho to South Africa increased 20-fold to US$46 million. Exports to
South Africa now represent close to 15 percent of Lesotho’s total textile exports (Figure 45),
highlighting the significant scope for Lesotho’s sales to South Africa to continue growing
considerably. Notwithstanding these positive developments, Lesotho’s apparel export industry
remains vulnerable in the context of increased competitive pressures—most notably from
Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Vietnam—in both the US and the South African markets. Lesotho
has deficiencies with regard to productivity and skills at the firm level. The sustainability of the
apparel sector seems to be at risk, creating a need to diversify the export basket. The textile
industry’s backward linkages to the local economy were limited.

Why haven’t exports picked up since the global crisis?

55.     The policy of maintaining a high level of public spending seems to be negatively
affecting the private sector’s competitiveness. Over the past few years, the large inflows from
volatile SACU receipts were absorbed mostly by government consumption, particularly

18
     Many firms indicated in firm-level interviews that the DCCS was crucial for their survival after the MFA ended.

compensation of public employees (Figure 46). The maloti is pegged to movements in the South
African currency, and real effective exchange rates are largely driven by rand, which has caused
nominal effective rates to depreciate in recent years (Figure 47). For Lesotho, the spending of
these inflows by the government has led to a rise of the relative price of non-tradables to
tradables (Figure 48). As a result, the private sector’s share of total investment has declined
(Figure 49).

56.      Changing the existing growth model will require a strong political consensus within
the system. From a political economy point of view, the winners of the existing growth model
are public employees, politicians, and domestic businesses focused on local non-tradables and
government contracts. Changing the model requires redefining the role of the state. This process
not only entails reducing the size of the public sector but also changing the composition of public
spending and its interventions with the private sector (discussed in the subsequent sections of the
report).

   Producer Price Index data is not available. The largest formal employer of the non-tradable sector is the
government and the largest employer of the trabable sector is the textile industry. Wages are used as proxy for the
price of output of both the tradable and non-tradable sectors.

Lesotho can grow faster by improving total factor productivity

57.     Improving the prospects for high levels of sustained and broad-based growth in
Lesotho will require greater productivity and investment. Using a Cobb-Douglas production
function, growth can be decomposed into capital accumulation, labor force growth, and TFP
increases.20 TFP averaged 1.1 percent during 2001-10, but then it declined to 0.7 percent in
2011-13 (Figure 50). Over the past decade, Lesotho’s public and private investment have been
relatively high by international standards, averaging 28 percent of GDP. Keeping labor force
growth at the historical rate of 1.1 percent a year, Table 4 shows a number of scenarios of how
investment and TFP generate given GDP growth rates. With investment of 30 percent of GDP
and a labor force growth of 1.1 percent a year, achieving economic growth at the NSDP target of
7 percent a year will require annual TFP increases of 4.9 percent. Over a sustained period, such a
TFP growth rate is high by international standards.

58.    Historically, investment productivity has been low, but it has been increasing
recently. The incremental capital-output ratio (ICOR) was a relatively high 13.3 for 1980-
2010.21 It was 7.9 in 2001-10 and 6.3 in 2004-10, suggesting productivity improvement was
picking up speed toward the end of the decade. Most of public capital investment was largely
donor-financed and administered. However, Lesotho’s ICOR still trailed other small states and
developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Government processes for project selection,
appraisal, and monitoring are relatively weak.
59.     Education and HIV/AIDS are important factors shaping the marginal productivity
of labor and thus economic growth. Figure 51 shows how education has been positively
contributing to the marginal productivity of labor over the past five decades. At the same time,
HIV/AIDS has been a negative. It will be important to improve the skills of the labor force and
reduce the high HIV/AIDS prevalence rates. Weak TFP appears to reflect inefficient inter-
sectoral allocations, with labor concentrated in the economy’s lowest productivity sectors (Table
5).

3.2        IDENTIFYING THE CONSTRAINTS FOR BROAD BASED GROWTH

60.    By using the Inclusive Growth Diagnostic Framework, we identified that the main
factors limiting returns to labor and jobs in Lesotho: a lack of skills, high burden of disease
(discussed in chapter 4), poor investment climate, and a lack of key infrastructure. Cross-
country evidence has shown that these factors usually impact economic performance (World
Bank (2014)).

Low skills

61.     Low skills levels seem to be a constraint on existing industry and on investing in new
areas. According to the Investing for Changing Economy: Skill Development with Equity in
Lesotho Report (World Bank 2013), a survey conducted in 2010-11 found that employers can
easily recruit plant and machine operators, craft and trade workers, skilled agricultural, forestry,

                                                           28
and fishery workers, service and sales workers, and clerical workers. However, managers,
professionals, and technicians are difficult to find. Once hired, employees still required
substantial on-the-job training. Low skills have also led to low levels of technology adoption.
Lesotho ranks very poorly on global measures of technological readiness and innovation. At the
heart of this issue are low levels of technological use and overall business sophistication.
Globally, economic growth is becoming increasingly knowledge and technology driven;
upgraded skills will be necessary over the medium term for Lesotho to adjust to these changes,
absorb new technologies, and better integrate into the world economy.

                              Knowledge Gap: Skills premium/New labor force survey
A better measure of skill shortage is the skills premium employers are will to offer in specific industries. To do such
a analysis a strong labor force survey is needed. The last labor force survey in Lesotho was done in 2008. A new
comprehensive labor force survey is needed to do a more profound analysis of the labor market.

Weak overall business environment

62.   A number of constraints arise at each step of the process of establishing and
running a business. They include:

63.    The process of obtaining a construction permit is cumbersome (Box 2). According to
the World Bank’s Doing Business for 2015, constructions permits in Lesotho require 10
procedures and take 179 days. These hurdles have been lowered in recent years, but they remain
well above sub-Saharan Africa averages. Of the 179 days, it takes 65 days to obtain a building
permit from the Maseru City Council (MCC). A series of bottlenecks starts from obtaining the
environmental assessment and continues through getting an occupancy permit. The two most
important bottlenecks are getting an environmental assessment for construction of more than 550
square meters and getting consent from the utility companies to issue a building permit. The
government is working to address these issues, with support from the World Bank.

64.     The process of starting a business in Lesotho can be further streamlined. According
to the 2015 Doing Business, starting a business requires seven procedures, takes 29 days, and
costs 9.4 percent of per capita income. Over the past few years, the government has taken
important steps to reduce the number of days to start a business; however, it is still high

                                                         29
compared to other countries. Enactment of the Companies Act was a step forward in reducing the
number of procedures to register a new firm. However, its implementation needs to be fully
rolled out in the districts. The Trading Enterprises Regulations (1999) were amended in
December 2011 to make it easier to obtain a trade license by establishing a One-Stop Business
Facilitation Center (OBFC) and replacing pre-inspection with post inspection for businesses with
low health and environmental risks. In 2014, Parliament approved the Industrial Licensing Act of
2014. Its purpose is to facilitate and promote industrial development and micro, small, and
medium enterprises (MSMEs) through a new regulatory regime that is simple, short, and cost
effective. The act reduces the time it takes to obtain a license from five days to one day. This
reform and others are not yet reflected in the Doing Business 2015 indicators; next year the data
will be revised. Subsequently, the Ministry of Trade and Industry will submit to Parliament a bill
to improve registration of sole proprietorships and partnerships. This measure will reduce the
time to issue traders licenses from 15 days to one day. A reduction in the number of procedures
required to start a business is typically associated with an increase in the creation of new firms.
Entry reforms also have a direct positive effect on employment and productivity because
increased competition from new firms encourages incumbents to become more efficient (see next
sub-section).

Box 2: Process of obtaining a construction permit

To get a construction permit in Lesotho, an investor had to (i) acquire a land lease; (ii) undertake an Environment
Impact Assessment (which can take up to 30 days); and (iii) submit architectural drawings with the environmental
statement to the Maseru City Council (MCC). The MCC reviews the documents and, if things are in order, submits
the drawings to the Lesotho Electric Company (LEC), Water and Sewerage Company (WASCO), the Road
Directory, and the Lesotho Land Survey and Physical Planning office for site inspection and approval. In some
cases, the site also had to be inspected by the Health Department within the MCC. These agencies take about a
month to provide their clearances. They undertake site inspection at no charge, while the MCC charges a nominal
fee of 0.001 percent of the structure’s cost.

The main bottlenecks identified were:
     Manual delivery of hard copies of documents and drawings to LEC, WASCO, and the Physical Planning
        office, delaying in the process;
     Absence of GPS coordinates (geo-referencing) for the utilities, making it difficult for these agencies to
        locate connections and power/pipelines;
     The utility companies undertake inspections for free, so they have no incentive to speed up the process.

Once the utility companies and Physical Planning office have approved the drawings, the documents went an
internal review process in the MCC.

       First, a non-technical Internal Committee within MCC, which met once a month, approved the construction
        permit applications.
       Then, the MCC Planning Unit issued a planning permit.
       The application was then sent to the MCC’s Building Control Unit—the biggest bottleneck. In this unit, a
        single person handled the process, and it could take months to review an application package. Increased
        staffing of this unit is needed to reduce the number of days to obtain a construction permit.



65.    Trading across borders has improved, but further reforms outside the customs area
are needed. Time to import has been reduced from 49 days in 2007 to 33 days in 2013, and the
number of procedures has been cut from eight in 2007 to seven in 2012. Meanwhile, costs to


                                                        30
import a standard shipping container rose from US$1,210 in 2007 to US$2,045 in 2014.22 Time
to export has been reduced from 44 days in 2007 to 31 days in 2013. Despite the improvements,
Basotho producers and consumers still pay high trade transactions costs. To improve cross-
border trading, the government has drafted a Customs Modernization Strategy. It provides a
longer-term framework for coordinating and aligning customs-related activities, including the
introduction of an integrated border management approach to align numerous border agencies.
However, some export and import delays are not in the custom process; rather, they arise in the
preparation of documents, ports and document handling, and inland transportation. Finally,
cargo-handling is an issue.

66.     Weak contract enforcement and corruption impede the effective protection of
investor rights. Lesotho’s contract enforcement system is inefficient and unreliable. Doing
Business (2014) ranks Lesotho 115th out of 189 countries on contract enforcement. According to
the report, it took an average of 615 days and cost 31.3 percent of a claim’s value to enforce a
commercial contract.23 Evidence from around the world suggests that better contract enforcement
shapes the business climate in two key ways. First, it is important for attracting investors.
Second, it makes it easier for businesses to effectively operate and expand their networks and
markets by engaging new customers and borrowers. Lesotho has made some reforms in this area,
launching a specialized commercial court in 2011. Corruption is also a big issue. According to
the 2009 Enterprise Survey, corruption is the second biggest obstacle to business in Lesotho. In
addition, according to the survey, 72 percent of the large manufacturers reported that they were
expected to give gifts to public officials “to get things done.” Corruption was most commonly
reported when trying to obtain construction permits; it was less common in securing government
services, such as getting operating licenses or import licenses, or when dealing with tax
authorities.24

67.     Access to finance is limited. Credit use is increasing, but it is still low compared to other
countries. The ratio of private-sector credit to GDP—a key indicator of financial sector
performance—has grown from 12.3 percent at the end of FY2010/11 to 17.3 percent at the end
of FY 2012/13, with private sector credit growing 42.2 percent in nominal terms. However, this
level remains significantly below the sub-Saharan Africa average of 58 percent of GDP. The
financial system is characterized by excess liquidity. Instead of lending domestically, banks
invest this excess liquidity in government securities or export it to South Africa. Credit is split
almost evenly between households and businesses. The corporate sector has adequate credit to
fund their investment needs. Lending is limited not by supply but by demand because many of
Lesotho’s corporations can fund investment projects through retained earnings. Many

   To make the data comparable across economies, Doing Business indicators use several assumptions about
business and traded goods. The business: (i) is of medium size and employs 60 people; (ii) is located in the
periurban area of the economy‘s largest business city; and (iii) is a private, limited liability company, domestically
owned, formally registered, and operating under commercial laws and regulations of the economy. The traded
goods: (i) are not hazardous and do not include military items; (ii) do not require refrigeration or any other special
environment; (iii) do not require any special phytosanitary or environmental safety standards other than accepted
international standards; (iv) are one of the economy‘s leading export or import products; and (v) are transported in a
full 20-foot dry-cargo container load.

corporations are part of international firms, with access to South African and international
financial markets.

68.     SMEs’ access to finance has been poor, but it is now improving because of
important changes in the lending environment that reduce risk for banks. Ongoing land
administration reform has greatly increased the availability of leasehold titles and streamlined the
process of registering mortgage securities, leading to rapid growth in mortgage lending. Civil
law reform, including establishment of commercial courts and streamlined small-claims
procedures, have improved the climate for both SME and household lending. These reforms have
been bolstered by moral suasion to encourage banks to invest more of Lesotho’s savings
domestically. At the same time, continued low interest rates have encouraged banks to seek
higher returns by growing their loan portfolios. All these factors have contributed to a sharp
increase in the banking system’s domestic loan-to-deposit ratio and a corresponding decrease in
the portion of bank assets invested abroad, primarily in South Africa. The government adopted a
Financial Sector Development Strategy in 2013.

Infrastructure gaps

69.    High-quality infrastructure is a pre-requisite to attracting investment and thus
necessary for growth and job creation. In 2014, Lesotho ranked No. 133 on the logistics
performance index. In particular, Lesotho scored 2.35 out of 5 in terms of infrastructure.
According to the 2011 Lesotho review, inland transportation costs five times more than
transportation by sea. High transport costs seem to derive from poor domestic road infrastructure
and high fuel costs.

70.      A poor-quality and unevenly distributed domestic road network is a constraint on
growth. Most of Lesotho’s road network is concentrated in the lowlands, which constitute only
25 percent of the country’s total area. Arterial roads connect all districts in Lesotho, but
relatively fewer rural roads connect villages and towns within mountain districts of Thaba Tseka,
Mokhotlong, Qacha’s Nek, and Quthing that include the remaining 75 percent of Lesotho’s land
area and about a quarter of its population. The network connects to the South African road
system through a total of 14 border posts along the Lesotho-South African border, with border
posts at Caledonspoort, Ficksburg, and Maseru open 24 hours a day. Only 22 percent of
Lesotho’s whole road network is paved, and the rest is gravel and earth roads. Of the paved
roads about 50 percent are in good condition, while about 99.5 percent of the gravel roads are in
fair or poor condition. The mining and tourism sectors in the Mokhotlong district offer Lesotho’s
best economic potential, but are constrained by the very poor condition of district’s road
infrastructure, although a few bridges have been built recently. The poor condition of roads
leading to the district capitals of Mokhotlong and Thaba-Tseka also constrains the access to
urban markets. As a result, the 25 percent of Lesotho’s population living in the mountain districts
are isolated with poor access to basic services and commodities as well as market and business
opportunities. Limited access through the mountain zones also prevents communication within
the country, notwithstanding continuous access to ports beyond the country’s surrounding
borders with South Africa.

71.    Limited air and railroad transportation hinder growth potential of tourism and
trade. The country has scheduled international air transport service between Maseru and
                                                32
Johannesburg, but no scheduled domestic air service Air transport infrastructure consists of the
Moshoeshoe I International Airport, and 29 regional aerodromes and airstrips, which are
sometimes used by the private aircrafts. Maintenance of the airstrips has been a challenge due to
heavy rains and as a result they have deteriorated and are in urgent need of resurfacing. The only
rail service available on a regular basis is a freight line from the Maseru Railway station to
Bloemfontein, a railhead for the country’s 2.5 kilometers of narrow-gauge rail line. Two freight
trains run every day, carrying mainly cement, maize, fuel, and freight containers, making up
about one-third of Lesotho’s international trade in bulk goods. There has been no regular
passenger service since 1989. The Maseru Container Terminal (Mascon) is a large-scale freight
hub connected to Lesotho network of main roads via Moshoeshoe Road in the industrial area of
Maseru. Providing a customs clearing facility for goods, the terminal has significantly improved
the cost efficiency of imports and exports.

72.     Electricity is a constraint on growth. About 44.3 percent of Lesotho’s firms in the 2009
Enterprise Survey identified electricity as a major constraint, compared to 49.3 percent in sub-
Saharan Africa. However, the number of reported outages was small in Lesotho. According to
the World Bank’s Doing Business 2014, it takes 125 days to get electricity in Lesotho and costs
1,991.9 percent of per capita income. In OECD countries, it takes 89 days and costs 79.1 percent
of per capita income. The Lesotho Electricity Company (LEC) is presently the country’s
monopoly transmitter, distributor, and supplier of electricity. The Lesotho Highlands
Development Authority (LHDA) is the main electricity generator through its Muela Hydropower
Station. Muela generates 72 megawatts (MW), and Lesotho requires about 140 MW (winter,
2011). As a result, Lesotho has to import about 68 MW—40 MW from Mozambique and 28 MW
from South Africa. In the mining sector, only Letseng has access to electricity from LEC, while
other mines use fuel power plants. The power line supplying electricity to the mining area has a
capacity of 88 KVA (1,000 volt amps), while supplying the other mines would need more than
130 KVA. The electricity supplied in this area is imported mostly from South Africa, which at
the moment doesn’t have the capacity to export more. Fuel prices have increased by almost 50
percent in the past three years. As a result, some mining companies are struggling to stay open,
and others have already closed down. In addition, the mining sector is located in the highlands
area district of Mokhotlong, where winter access is a challenge due to snow and poor road
conditions. Winter fuel storage is also challenging in the highlands. As a result of poor road
conditions and weather, it is sometimes unreliable to generate electricity using fuel. For the
textile sector in particular, power surges (not outages) are often very problematic, and dips in
electricity can entail enormous costs and sometimes damage equipment, resulting in productivity
losses. If no indication is provided regarding when electricity will be restored, workers are sent
home, causing firms sometimes to miss deadlines. These power surges have damaged equipment
in some footwear manufacturing firms as well.

73.     Lesotho has multiple options to develop its renewable energy resources, including
hydro, wind, and solar. Though the relative costs of these energy sources are likely to be higher
than the current default supply (imports from South Africa) over the next five years, other factors
will need to be considered in the longer term: (i) supply security; (ii) long-term tariff
predictability; (iii) employment and income generation; (iv) income sources from countries
willing to promote renewable energy in Lesotho; (v) the mutual commitment made by all SADC
member-states to explore potential sources of domestic generation; and (vi) environmental

                                                33
considerations. So far, Lesotho has struggled to exploit its renewable energy resources due to a
number of policy and legal framework gaps. They include the lack of: (i) an adequate policy that
guides the electricity industry in relation to choices between supply security and cost; (ii) an
institution that has a clear responsibility for ensuring supply security and determining a supply
security target; (iii) an established tender process for the purchase of electricity; and (iv) a least-
cost generation integrated resource plan.

                                                 Knowledge Gap: Energy
Lesotho has a good understanding of its power needs but relatively limited information at the moment on how to
address this issue. Currently, a feasibility study is being conducted on a power generation plant linked to the Lesotho
Highlands Water Project Phase 2. However, there are no feasibility studies on solar generation plants.

74.     According to World Bank (2012), lack of availability of factory shells and serviced
industrial sites is a major constraint to investors. Foreigners can rent factory shells from the
Lesotho National Development Corporation (LNDC). However, LNDC has a shortage of
serviced factory shells, and building new factory shells requires additional resources to invest in
key infrastructure, such as roads, water, sewage, and electricity. In addition, adding to the supply
of factory shells/production space for investors is exceptionally slow, with delays sometimes
exceeding one year. Subleasing from the private sector is now possible under the Land Act of
2010. However, current subsidized LNDC factory rental rates don’t give private developers a
chance to earn an economic return on their investments. According to the World Bank 2012,
current rents for LNDC industrial tenants run between M7 and M10 per square meter; however,
an economic return to cover the initial capital costs and ongoing maintenance is estimated at
M30 to M35 per square meter. While the reason for this low rent policy stems from wanting to
remain competitive vis-à-vis Botswana, Swaziland and other rival destinations in the region , it
will be necessary to revise it to encourage the private sector to play a larger role in supplying
factory shells.

3.3      SECTORAL OVERVIEWS

75.   In the preceding section, we discussed the four binding constraints for broad-based
growth. In this section, we will focus on sector-specific constraints.

Agriculture
76.     Agriculture is a relatively small part of Lesotho’s economy. More than 70 percent of
the population lives in rural areas, where three out of every four people are engaged in farming,
herding, or both. Because labor is much less productive in agriculture than in other sectors, the
economic contribution of agriculture is small, despite the large number of agricultural workers.
An International Food Policy and Research Institute (IFPRI) study found that Lesotho was one of
only seven African countries in which TFP in agriculture has actually declined. Agriculture’s
contribution to GDP has declined significantly over the past three decades—from 21.4 percent in
1982 to 7.5 percent in 2013. The sector is losing competitiveness, and the value of agricultural
exports has declined over the past four decades. Over the same period, a large structural food
deficit has emerged, with domestic cereal production now covering only about 30 percent of
annual consumption requirements of an estimated 360,000 tons. As a result, Lesotho is heavily
reliant on food imports, which has led the government to focus on production of food staples to


                                                         34
address its concerns regarding food security.25 This in turn is one factor behind heavy public
spending on input subsidies at the expense of other potentially more productive expenditures. In
fact, Lesotho has as SADC neighbors some globally competitive cereal producers, and reducing
trade barriers and costs is likely to be a more effective than trying to expand local production of
staples as a way to improve food security. Production also has relatively low correlation across
the SADC countries, implying a lot of potential for regional trade to stabilize local prices if
markets are well integrated.

77.     Lesotho’s resource endowments and agro-climatic conditions limit many areas’
production potential. One basic constraint is the scarcity of high-quality land. Almost 70
percent of the country’s land area is classified as agricultural, but only about 10 percent is
suitable for crop cultivation. The rest is low-quality land suitable only for extensive livestock
grazing. A second constraint is weather. Many parts of the country are subject to extreme
temperature fluctuations and highly variable rainfall, making rainfed crop cultivation and even
livestock production extremely risky. Ironically, given Lesotho’s position as a major exporter of
water, irrigation potential in the country seems to be under-exploited.

78.     Sectoral policies comprise a second set of constraints that has contributed to the
poor performance of Lesotho’s agricultural sector. Lesotho’s “agriculture policy costs”
ranking in the global competiveness index has improved a bit from 131st of 134 countries in 2009
to 100th of 148 countries in 2012, but it is worse than all but eight African countries. Traditional
land tenure systems do not ensure long-term security of access and, therefore, discourage
investment in land improvements; e.g., irrigation infrastructure, soil and water conservation
measures, and tree planting. As a consequence, many farmers and herders have engaged in
unsustainable land-management practices that have led to declining soil fertility and severe soil
erosion. Because the institutions charged with agricultural research and extension have been
ineffective, very few farmers have adopted improved production technologies, so productivity
remains low. There also needs to be a rethink of the appropriate role of the state in supporting
agriculture. As a consequence of all these constraints, high risk and a lack of resources at the
farm level limit investments and make many potential farmers decide not to cultivate, leading to
a high ratio of fallow land. According to the Crop Forecasting Surveys, the share of fallow land
was 29 percent in FY2009/10 and 30 percent in FY2010/11.

79.     Public expenditure in agriculture is both low and of low quality. Lesotho is far behind
most countries in aligning its policies with the Comprehensive African Agricultural
Development Program (CAADP), including the CAADP goals on public expenditure (PE). 26
Agriculture’s share of the government’s budget is less than half its GDP share. Per capita
agricultural PE fell from US$40 to US$15 between 1995 and 2008; PE as a share of agricultural

25
    A major problem faced by poor households is limited food availability, particularly in rural areas. At the same
time, the urban poor are faced with limited purchasing power due to lack of employment and high food prices.
Stunting is an indicator of long-term malnutrition that is sensitive to long-term food insecurity or poverty; it has
increased from 33 percent in 1992 to about 39 percent in 2009. In addition, the country is confronted with high
prevalence of anemia—at 47 percent among children 6 to 59 months, with mountain districts showing prevalence
above the national average. Chronic malnutrition, including iron-deficiency anemia, is caused by a number of
factors, such as poor feeding practices for the very young.
26
   The CAADP goal, according to the Maputo Declaration, is to raise agricultural spending to 10 percent of total
public expenditure.

                                                        35
GDP fell from 37 percent to 25 percent in the same period, and the share of agriculture in total
PE fell from 12 percent to 3 percent. Development partners have likewise been reluctant to
support agricultural development, with the sector receiving only about 2 percent of official
development assistance, half the level of the SADC as a whole and sub-Saharan Africa overall.
Furthermore, a very large part of the budget goes to subsidies and staff salaries and benefits. The
main beneficiaries of current subsidies and incentives are capital-intensive, high-input farmers.
PE reforms should aim for down-sized, better targeted, and “smarter” agricultural support
programs, with more focus on providing public goods (rural roads, research, extension, effective
land administration) and less on subsidies.

80.     These constraints notwithstanding, Lesotho’s agriculture sector can play a role in
poverty reduction. It has the potential to raise incomes but has limited potential for job creation.
Global evidence indicates that agricultural growth is much more effective than growth in other
sectors in reducing poverty. The challenge facing the government is to find the right combination
of policy reforms, institutional changes, and supporting investments to overcome these
constraints.

                                             Knowledge Gap: Agriculture
At the heart of agriculture’s inability to make a strong contribution to poverty reduction and shared prosperity is the
very low rate of productivity growth in the sector, one of the lowest in Africa. It is clear that this is due to many
factors, including low uptake of modern production technologies (embodied in inputs), low labor productivity, low
irrigation use, land degradation, and others. But what is lacking is good analysis of what conditions and policies
underlie these factors, and clear recommendations on how these could be addressed. One tool for helping to fill this
gap would be an agricultural public expenditure review, which would identify whether current spending patterns
correspond to the major problems. While most of these problems will ultimately need to be addressed by on-farm
private investment, smart public spending is needed to create the enabling environment. Another important
knowledge gap is what are the real opportunity costs (e.g., in terms of loss of net foreign exchange) of the strong
policy focus on encouraging production of staple food crops at the expense of other products in which Lesotho may
have a comparative advantage. This gap could be filled by a good analytical study of domestic resource costs of
production of different products. Both of these kinds of studies would produce information that would be key to
deciding on spending and policy priorities.

Manufacturing

81.     The manufacturing sector’s relative contribution to GDP declined from 20.1 percent
in 2004 to 10.8 percent in 2013. The decline resulted from stagnation in the textile and apparel
sector due to the global economic crisis, competition from low-cost Asian producers, rising labor
costs, and the rapid growth in other sectors, notably mining.27 The apparel sector still dominates
the country’s exports, accounting for about 40 percent of the total. It is also one of the
economy’s largest employers, providing more than 48,000 jobs in 2014. It has been particularly
important in creating job opportunities for women. While the sector is by no means collapsing, it
has been stagnant in recent years. Sustainability remains a major concern because the AGOA
will be phased out, and major buyers are consolidating their global supply chains. A major factor
preventing the collapse of the sector has been the relocation of South African manufacturing
activities to Lesotho to take advantage of cheaper labor. FDI from South Africa increased from
US$269 million in 2007 to US$757 million in 2010. Despite this positive development,

                                                         36
Lesotho’s apparel export industry remains vulnerable to increased competitive pressures from
Cambodia, Bangladesh, Vietnam and other suppliers in both the US and South African markets.

82.     The manufacturing sector has the potential to raise incomes and generate jobs, but
it must overcome some important constraints. We have already covered some of them, such
as the weak investment climate, lack of infrastructure, high burden of disease, and lack of skills.
The World Bank (2012) identified these additional constraints:

           Uncertainties regarding labor regulations: Several investors cited concerns over unclear
            policies regarding work permits. For instance, there was no guideline available to
            investors that specified the ratio of domestic to foreign workers required in a firm in a
            given sector—and, in fact, firms in the same sector were quoted different ratios. This
            created significant uncertainty over hiring and work-permit renewals for expatriate labor.

           Insufficient aftercare of factory shells: Concerns were raised over the lack of aftercare of
            factory shells (in Maseru, Maputsoe, and even Thetsane) and the lack of adequate fire and
            emergency exits. LNDC was cited as being very helpful during the initial setting up of
            factories. However, the feedback from firms suggests that LNDC undertakes regular
            surveys, but follow up was lacking in terms of maintenance and upkeep.

Mining
83.     Since industrial mining of diamonds resumed in 2004, the mining sector has
emerged as the economy’s fastest growing sector. Diamond production is becoming an
important source of growth in Lesotho, accounting for nearly 7 percent of GDP in FY2010/11,
up from 0.5 percent in the early 2000s.28 The sector contributes significantly to tax revenues and
export earnings. However, the industry is very capital intensive, and its 2,000 workers do not
contribute significantly to total employment. Mining operations have some backward linkages to
the rest of the economy through demand for goods and services and the use of utilities. Forward
linkages are weak because diamonds are exported (by air) to foreign cutting and polishing

centers. However, construction minerals are mainly used in Lesotho for brick-making, road
construction, or processing into building materials.
84.    A number of constraints hinder Lesotho’s development as a mineral producer.
These include (i) the general operating environment in which mineral operations take place, with
notable infrastructure deficiencies, such as roads and power and (ii) regulatory and institutional
arrangements that are severely stretched in terms of capacity, which can pose direct risks both to
investments and to the mining sector’s beneficial impacts on Lesotho’s development.
Water
85.    Water is one of Lesotho’s most important renewable assets.29 The combination of
high altitude, abundance of water, and geographic proximity to major demand centers in
southern Africa makes water central to long-term economic growth. Within this context, the
water sector contributes roughly 4 percent to overall GDP, a large portion of it derived from
revenues associated with the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP), one of the world’s most
ambitious water-transfer projects. The LHWP has brought significant development gains to
Lesotho, allowing the country to transform water resources into export revenues for poverty
reduction and economic stabilization. In addition, it helps South Africa develop the lowest cost
water supply for the dry Gauteng region. This is achieved through the transfer water from the
water-rich Lesotho highlands to the Gauteng region through a series of dams, transfer tunnels,
and associated infrastructure. In addition, the project includes development of hydropower
resources to supply electricity in Lesotho.

86.     LHWP revenues contribute about 3 percent of GDP to the government through
royalties, water transfers, and electricity sales. The benefits are likely to increase over the
medium term. From 1994 to 2006, LHWP Phase 1 expenditures and revenues totaled M12.785
billion, or about three times Lesotho’s total GDP of M4.175 billion in 2002. LHWP benefits are
split between Lesotho (56 percent) and South Africa (44 percent), with South Africa saving on
the project’s lower cost compared to domestic alternatives and Lesotho benefitting from
royalties, ancillary developments, and hydropower. Royalties are based on a fixed portion paid
over 50 years, reflecting the lower capital cost compared to the alternative Orange-Vaal Transfer
Scheme for full delivery of 70 cubic meters per second. In addition, a variable portion reflects
the lower operating, maintenance, and electricity costs based on the volume of water delivered.
Currently, water transfers are 18 cubic meters per second under Phase 1A and 12 cubic meters
per second under Phase 1B. Since November 1996, total revenues from water sales amounted to
more than US$400 million, with an additional US$90 million in electricity sales to the Lesotho
Electricity Company and another US$1 million in sales to Eskom. This will increase with
development of LHWP’s Phase 2, which will involve construction of the Polihali Dam,
associated water transfer infrastructure, and the Kobong Pump Storage Scheme.

87.     Construction of LHWP2 is expected to see investment of around M3.2 billion (2010
prices) through FY2016/17 and subsequently another M3.9 billion. The Agreement on
LHWP2 was signed on August 12, 2011, and it was ratified by Lesotho in 2013. The project was
officially launched on March 27, 2014. The agreement includes provisions for: (i) augmenting

  Given the key role of water in Lesotho and dependency on hydropower, there is a need to strengthen availability
of meteorological and hydrological data and to implement early warning systems.

                                                       38
water transfer to South Africa through construction of a new dam and transfer tunnel and (ii) the
development of hydropower resources to generate electricity to benefit of Lesotho. The water
transfer assets are physically located in Lesotho but financed through a South African special
purpose financing vehicle (TCTA). Lesotho will finance the pump storage scheme, principally
through the export price differential between peak and lower-cost off-peak energy sources. In
addition, Botswana has confirmed an interest in the possibility of transferring water from the
Lesotho Highlands to the arid southern parts of its country. Together, these projects will
contribute approximately 11,000 jobs annually as main construction takes place through 2020.
Approximately half of these jobs will be in construction, with the rest in such indirect activities
as agriculture, transport, and services. However, the majority of these jobs will be temporary,
and the challenge will be to transfer skills and leverage income for sustainable employment once
major civil works are completed. Delays in implementing the LHWP could also risk
undermining the economic benefits of the project and limiting the development benefits that
accrue to Lesotho.
Transport
88.      The rugged highland areas covering three-quarters of Lesotho’s land area continue
to challenge the expansion of road infrastructure and the maintenance of the existing
network. The domestic road infrastructure has improved markedly since independence (1966),
when horseback was the primary mode of transport between villages over a network of gravel
roads and bridle paths. Over the past 10 years, considerable investments have been made to
improve the quality of roads, expand the urban and rural road networks, and rehabilitating
existing roads. According to latest statistics from the Roads Directorate (RD), an arm of the
Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MoPWT), Lesotho’s road network totals 7,542
kilometers—1,629 kilometers of paved roads, 3,508 kilometers of gravel roads, 2,273 kilometers
of earth roads, and 132 kilometers of other roads. Maintenance of the road network, including
both routine and periodic work, is financed from the government budget’s Road Fund.
According to the Lesotho Road Management System (LRMS), the budget includes a rolling
three-year priority investment program for the core road network to eliminate the backlog of
deferred periodic maintenance, avoid further deterioration of poor roads, and preserve existing
road assets. Despite increased user charges in 2005, current resources are considerably less than
needs. The majority of Lesotho’s unpaved road network remains in poor condition, and the road
sub-sector continues to experience constraints due to inadequate funding for maintenance and
institutional capacity limits.

89.    Transport service provision is dominated by private taxi and bus operators;
however, the isolated areas depend on inland water transport at river crossings. Transport
services in Lesotho are dominated by road transport, operated mostly by the private sector. Other
modes are ferry services at river crossings, animal transport, and pedestrian travel, especially in
the less developed and sparsely populated mountainous areas. Road passenger services are
predominantly provided by private operators of taxis and buses. The Lesotho Freight and Bus
Services Corporation is the only state-owned company, which operates a small percentage of
road passenger transport services, mainly in areas where volumes are low and the private sector
is unable to provide profitable service. Air transport is provided on a charter basis within the
country; the only scheduled international flight is provided by South African Airways. Rail
transport is limited to a short stretch from South Africa to Maseru, carrying freight with no

                                                39
passenger service. The ferry services for river crossings play an indispensable role in remote
mountain areas with no road connections and no bridges across the river. The highland areas
have a total of 39 inland river crossings. At present, inland water transport services are mainly
provided through publicly and privately owned aluminum row-boat river ferries, with an average
capacity of eight people. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport owns and operates 44
ferries.

90.     Lesotho’s geographic terrain presents a challenge in road safety. Due to winding
roads and particularly challenging driving conditions in the mountainous terrain, the country has
a high incidence of road accidents. The National Road Safety Council (NRSC) has prioritized
safety issues, including driver training, use of seat belts, and enhanced emergency and rescue
services. Since road safety is not prioritized by the police and is not yet in schools curriculums,
the current enforcement of traffic laws is inadequate. The development and improvement of road
infrastructure must be accompanied by proper road-safety measures to mitigate any potential
road accident risks due to increased traffic and/or speeds. These include better road-safety
infrastructure, such as road signs, improved regulations, and enforcement of speed limits and
driving under the influence.

Services
91.     Services have been the biggest contributor to GDP and employment growth in
recent years. Services represent close to 60 percent of GDP and employ about one-third of the
economically active Basotho. Government services represents close to one-third of the services
sector. Government services and construction have recently become the drivers of the economy
and employment.

92.    Tourism has the potential to drive inclusive growth because of its labor-intensive
nature and capacity to generate income in rural areas. According to the WTTC’s 2013
Travel & Tourism Economic Impact Report, Lesotho’s travel and tourism accounted for 4.6
percent of GDP and employed 20,500 workers in 2012.30 Lesotho has the potential to develop a
viable and strong tourism industry. However, growth is limited by serious weaknesses in
competitiveness. Lesotho ranks at 135th out of 140 countries in the World Economic Forum’s
Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI), well behind its peers (Figure 54). Among
the main issues are:

        Skills: The TTCI ranks Lesotho 140th among 140 countries. While this is partly driven by
         HIV-related issues, it also reflects lack of specialized tourism training (rank 134) and
         barriers to hiring foreign labor (rank 108).
        Infrastructure: No direct, long-haul connections are available, and regional connections
         are costly (rank 140). According to the NSDP, the existing accommodation facilities and
         attractions are not linked, and basic infrastructure is lacking on sites that have been
         identified for tourism investment. The road network and its quality are poor (rank 125).
         ICT infrastructure is limited (rank 129).

30
   This reflects economic activity generated by such industries as hotels, travel agents, airlines, and other passenger
transportation services (excluding commuter services) as well as the activities of the restaurant and leisure industries
directly supported by tourists.

                                                          40
         Cultural resources: The TTCI ranks Lesotho 137th among 140 countries. According to
          the NSDP, protection of the rich cultural heritage from destruction is limited, especially
          the physical assets, which threatens their existence for future generations. Disparate
          efforts in packaging cultural resources (museum, craft centers and theatres) also limit
          their use for tourism exploitation.
         Environmental sustainability: The TTCI ranks Lesotho 120th among 140 countries.
          According to the NSDP, the main causes of environmental degradation include ploughing
          on steep slopes and/or marginal lands by crop farmers (54 percent of croplands are
          exposed to sheet erosion), overgrazing of rangelands (an estimated 50 percent over-
          stocking of livestock), cutting of trees for fuel and other uses, and unregulated
          encroachment of human settlements onto prime agricultural lands. Multiple policies and
          plans address the key environmental and climate change challenges. However, delivery
          has been weak because of institutional fragmentation, duplication of efforts, insufficient
          cross-sectoral coordination within the government and non-governmental sectors, and
          weak implementation and enforcement of policies and legislation.

93.     Other Services (outside government) have the potential to raise incomes and create
jobs. India’s growth pattern suggests that a shift into high-productivity services, bypassing
manufacturing, represents another path to sustainable growth (Ghani, Goswami, and Kharas
2012). According to Africa Pulse (2014), services growth in Africa has been more effective for
reducing poverty than growth in industry. Modern services, such as software development, call
centers, and outsourced business processes, represent high value-added activities (similar to
manufactured products) that can be important drivers of growth for innovative and technology-
savvy countries. Skills, good health, infrastructure, and a good investment climate will be
essential to unleash this potential.

3.4       EXPANDING TRADE AND INVESTMENT AND DEEPENING REGIONAL INTEGRATION

94.     Given the small size of Lesotho’s domestic market, the private sector must look to
export markets, particularly within the region, to achieve the scale required for
productivity and growth. Current policies protect local industry instead of supporting its
integration with global markets. Examples of these policies include requiring government-owned
food-processing industries to buy inputs from local farmers and procurement policies that favor

                                                  41
the goods and services of the local private sector. These efforts may have contributed negatively
to the productivity, efficiency, and quality of goods and services. Lesotho needs to put greater
emphasis on integrating with global markets—this is what made the country’s traditional exports
of textiles, water, and diamonds successful. The starting point is greater emphasis on regional
trade and integration.

Regional value chain integration unexploited

95.      To exploit the potential of regional trade, Lesotho should address important
challenges. Despite operating within the world’s oldest custom union (SACU), both tariff and
non-tariff barriers increasingly restrict competitiveness and trade potential in the region. Member
states, including Lesotho, use the infant-industry protection clause to block imports. Lesotho’s
producers face similar restrictions in trying to sell into regional markets.

Box 3. Implications of being part of SACU

SACU membership has far-reaching consequences for Lesotho’s fiscal policy, macroeconomic stability, and
integration into the world economy—as well as for the country’s trade policy.

Fiscal Policy: Like all customs unions, goods imported from outside SACU into any member country face a
common external tariff, and intra-SACU trade is free of duties, with some exceptions allowed for infant-industry
protection for the smaller members. Unlike most customs unions, however, SACU members pool the customs duties
and excise taxes they collect and redistribute the funds among the five member states. The revenue-sharing allocates
revenue according to each member’s share of intra-SACU trade, its share in total SACU GDP, and its per capita
GDP relative to the SACU average. By virtue of its larger economy and seaports, South Africa collects almost all
SACU revenue on its imports and its production of excisable goods (e.g., alcohol and tobacco products).31 South
Africa typically retains 45 percent to 53 percent of the common revenue pool and distributes the balance to the
BLNS. This is the result of the revenue-sharing formula agreed upon in 2002, which allocates customs revenue
according to each country’s share of intra-SACU imports. South Africa imports little from other SACU members.
There is also a development component, allocated according to the countries’ GDP per capita, to assist the less-
developed SACU members. SACU receipts could be considered as aid transfers from South Africa to Lesotho.
Lesotho usually receives around 7 percent to 9 percent of the pool.

These transfers are large relative to Lesotho’s economy. In recent years, Lesotho’s receipts have averaged around 30
percent of GDP—and they have exceeded 40 percent in some years. They presently finance almost half of
government spending, but it has at times been three-quarters of total expenditures. These large transfers have
enabled the government to undertake spending well beyond levels consistent with domestic revenue potential, and
Lesotho’s public spending relative to GDP ranks among the highest in the world. Measured as a share of GDP, the
capital budget is larger in Lesotho than in most other countries and, as highlighted in Chapter IV, Lesotho provides
substantial social transfers to the elderly and vulnerable children. On the other hand, Lesotho’s public-sector wage
bill as a share of GDP is the highest in Africa and one of the highest in the world.

In addition to being large on average, SACU receipts vary considerably from year to year. Since the new formula
took effect in 2004, the average annual fluctuation has been 7 percentage points of GDP. In FY2006/07, receipts
increased by 16 percentage points of GDP; in FY2010/11, they fell by 25 percentage points (from 41 percent to 16
percent of GDP). SACU revenue volatility can translate into fiscal volatility in the absence of fiscal rules or similar
measures. When receipts dropped precipitously in FY2010/11, so did government spending, which fell by 9
percentage points of GDP (11 percent in constant maloti). Real spending on grants, transfers, and subsidies—which

   According to Rob Davies, South Africa’s Minister of Trade and Industry, South Africa currently pays about R48
billion to the customs union annually—around 98 percent of the common pool of customs and excise duties shared
among SACU members.

includes social protection programs—fell by 20 percent that year.

Trade Policy: The 2002 SACU agreement provided for common policy-making institutions for trade. However, the
BLNS have not yet established their national tariff boards, so the structure of common external tariffs continues to
reflect the political and economic preferences of South Africa. Duties tend to restrict imports that compete with
South African producers. A consequence is that Lesotho’s producers must pay high prices for some imported inputs,
making their products less competitive in world markets.

The SACU agreement allows infant-industry protection. This arguably helps politically connected firms in BLNS at
the expense of consumers, and it is an expensive way to preserve or create jobs.

Value Chain Integration: SACU provides Lesotho with duty- and quota-free access to the large South African
market, but commercial opportunities have not been exploited outside garment production. For firms in Lesotho to
win buyers in South Africa or to integrate into regional production and distribution networks, improvements in
Lesotho’s business environment and the skills of its workforce are needed (discussed in Section III). SACU
members’ intention to develop a regional industrial policy may also offer local firms new opportunities.


Limited FDI

96.      Despite being landlocked, Lesotho once did well in attracting FDI to support its
economic growth. From the 1980s to 2009, investments were driven largely by construction of
the Lesotho Highlands Water Project and by large inflows into the textile and apparel sector,
initially from Taiwan, China and more recently from South Africa. Over this period, Lesotho
was able to maintain FDI as a share of GDP comparable to other landlocked African countries
(Figure 55). Since 2010, FDI has plummeted to less than one percent of GDP, one of lowest
figures in the world. This decline can be explained by a large decline of FDI into the textile and
apparel sector from East Asia countries. The drop would have been bigger if the country had not
received the inflows from South African firms.

97.     In the past, some important advantages allowed Lesotho to attract significant FDI
inflows in the textiles and apparel sector. These factors included low labor costs, preferential
market access (to SADC, SACU, and US markets), relatively low transport costs, and, critically,
less hostile labor relations than in neighboring South Africa, reflected in fewer strikes (Figure
56). Through this FDI, Lesotho became the region’s largest exporter of clothing, taking
advantage of trade preferences granted in the US market under the Africa Growth and
Opportunity Act (AGOA). Looking ahead, a crucial determinant of Lesotho’s ability to realize
new growth opportunities will be its capacity to attract and sustain foreign investments—not
only from new sources such as South Africa but also in new sectors. In addition, it will be
important to promote greater backward linkages to the local economy through increased spin-
offs and subcontracting activities from FDI. To date, these linkages have been limited.

3.5         GROWTH: BRIEF SUMMARY OF MAIN MESSAGES AND KEY CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED.

98.    This chapter argues that Lesotho needs to shift its growth model from a reliance on
the public sector toward a model that can deliver broad-based employment growth that
will be needed to eradicate extreme poverty and improve shared prosperity. Such a model
should be built around development of strong, diversified and competitive private sector,
oriented toward export markets and focused on activities where Lesotho has or can develop
strong comparative advantage. In the short-to-medium term, this should be supported by a more
dynamic and productive informal sector that can absorb the labor force.

99.    Building a strong, competitive, and outward-oriented private sector requires
improving the absolute and relative returns to investing in such activities. This requires: (i)
reforming the role of the state and (ii) increasing returns to investment by improving the
competitiveness of firms and the environment in which they operate. This chapter identified a
number of issues that currently constraint the realization of this new growth model. Table 7
summarizes these issues and identifies the channels through which they impact the twin goals.
This will be analyzed further in Chapter 6.

       4. INCLUSION: BUILDING ASSETS AT THE MICRO LEVEL
Experience from around the globe has shown that growth alone is not sufficient for poverty reduction and
shared prosperity. Human development is essential. Individual well-being and contributes significantly to
ensuring the sustainability of economic gains. This chapter focuses on the Basotho capacity to access and
build assets and to leverage those assets to contribute to growth. The government has invested substantial
resources into the social sectors but has achieved poor outcomes. Lesotho could do much better within its
existing budget.


4.1        HEALTH AND NUTRITION

100. Good health and access to nutrients required to remain healthy are necessary
conditions for individuals to take advantage of opportunities afforded by growth and
contribute to society. Over the past decade, Lesotho has seen worsening health outcomes.
HIV/AIDS prevalence is among the highest in the world, coupled with a high incidence of
tuberculosis (approximately 913 cases per 100,000 people) and a 74 percent HIV/TB co-
infection rate. The country’s HIV/TB co-epidemic is significant in that TB continues to be the
first cause of death among people living with HIV/AIDS. Lesotho’s Human Development Index
(HDI) has worsened since 1990, dragged down a decline of more than 20 years over the past
decade in average life expectancy at birth. Other indicators that are less directly affected by
HIV/AIDS have also worsened and are surprisingly high for a lower middle-income country. For
example, Lesotho’s maternal mortality ranks in the 80th–90th percentile globally, and the
country has one of the region’s largest rich-poor gap in nutritional status. The government
responded by allocating more resources to the sector, raising spending to more than 8 percent of
GDP. However, poor budget execution has prevented full utilization of available resources.
Tertiary health service has improved as a result of the establishment of the Queen Mamohato
Hospital.

HIV/AIDS

101. HIV/AIDS is an impediment to growth and inclusion. Lesotho has the world’s third-
highest HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate (23.1 percent) and a life expectancy of 49 years.
Prevalence rates have remained at this level over the past decade; however, they have increased
for the 40- to 49-year age cohort and decreased in the 15- to 29-year age cohort. The high
HIV/AIDS rate hinders growth by undermining the stock of available labor, lowering
productivity, and limiting incentives for investments in future consumption. In addition,
shortened life spans resulting from HIV/AIDS may reduce demand for secondary education
among poor families, who discount the value of future earnings relative to present income. In
2012, 360,000 Basotho were living with HIV (UNAIDS). According to the Economic
Diversification and the Role of FDI (World Bank 2012), firms stated that absenteeism and high
levels of sick leave are problematic and that workers are dying of AIDS-related illnesses every
month. In the garment factories, HIV prevalence was estimated at approximately 33 percent in
2007. 32 Without an HIV treatment program for workers, approximately 1,500 Lesotho apparel

industry employees could die from HIV-related causes each year.33 According to the UN Global
AIDS Response Country Progress Report (2012), the past seven years have not seen substantial
changes in behavior. New infections have been increasing, particularly among women (Figure
57). This suggests behavioral modification programs have not been effective. However, coverage
of HIV prevention, treatment, and care programs has expanded over the past five years, and
improvements in community-related HIV prevention and control have become more visible and
tangible. Finally, implementation of the current National HIV/AIDS Strategic plan has been
negatively affected by an uncoordinated HIV response given the absence of a National AIDS
Commission to lead and coordinate HIV prevention, treatment and mitigation efforts.

102. As in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, women in Lesotho are more vulnerable
to HIV/AIDS than males. The female-to-male HIV prevalence ratio of 1.4, similar to rates in
Swaziland and South Africa (1.5). Of greater concern, the gender disparity in prevalence is larger
among the young: the ratio for the 15-24 year age cohort is 1.8, similar to the ratio for Swaziland
(1.7) but considerably lower than that for South Africa (3.3).

103. Women’s greater vulnerability to HIV appears to be related to a variety of cultural
and economic factors, related to the unequal power between men and women. Despite
women’s relatively comprehensive knowledge of HIV prevention, only 49 percent of the poorest
women (and 52 percent of all women aged 15-49) believe that a woman is justified in refusing to
have sex with her husband if she knows he has had sex with other women. This suggests that
even with improved knowledge, women may still be in a vulnerable position unless deep-rooted
social attitudes are challenged. Basotho women, especially the young, also have less access to
various economic assets and are more likely to engage in transactional sex. Recent research
suggests a link between these two facts: de Walque et al (2014) show that, over a four month
study, non-sex worker women who experienced a negative shock to their households’ food
security were 36 percent more likely to test positive for a sexually transmitted infection (STI)
than women who did not experience such a shock. The impact was even greater for women with
the lowest social status, who have fewer alternative sources of economic support. This evidence

                                                    47
points to the importance of ensuring that women are sufficiently empowered to act as
independent economic agents—for example, through the effective implementation of the legal
rights provided in the Legal Capacity of Married Persons Act. This is especially important in a
country where women are often separated from their husbands due to migration. In addition, a
body of recent research points to the effectiveness of a range of economic incentives that target
risky sexual behavior, which could be especially relevant for poor and vulnerable women (Box
4). Finally, women are not only more greatly affected by HIV in terms of higher prevalence
rates, but they also because they are more likely to take on the role of primary care provider for
the sick (Newman et al, 2011). Therefore, HIV exacerbates the relative time poverty that women
already suffer as a result of their greater burden of domestic chores, further reducing the time
they have available for market activities.

104. Increasing ART coverage combined with strengthened HIV prevention efforts will
be critical for growth. According to the WHO, a potent ART regimen, particularly in early
stages of the disease, results in huge reductions in rates of HIV death and suffering. Expanded
ART access can also reduce HIV transmission, impact orphanhood, and preserve families. In
addition, treatment reduces the risk of acquiring TB by 70 percent. Furthermore, reducing new
infections is most effective, particularly when combined with other approaches, such as behavior
change efforts, male circumcision, condom usage, prevention of mother to child transmission
(PMTCT), and the new WHO ART regimen. Compared to Lesotho, according to the 2013
UNAIDS Progress Report on the Global Plan, “Botswana has been making strides towards
eliminating new HIV infections among children (320 infections in 2012) as it maintains high
levels of coverage of antiretroviral medicines (95 percent of eligible children 0-14 years old
receiving ART). If progress continues, it will become one of the first countries in sub-Saharan
Africa to meet this historical milestone by 2015.” Lesotho had 3,700 new HIV infections among
children in 2012, and three of four children are not receiving HIV treatment. In addition, ART
coverage for adults stood at 66 percent. Four of 10 pregnant women living with HIV did not
receive ART treatment to prevent PMTCT, and eight of 10 women or their infants did not
receive ART medicines during breastfeeding to prevent PMTCT. In the medium run, eliminating
new HIV infections will be critical to increasing the stock of available labor and spurring growth.
Increasing ART coverage should be a government priority. Perhaps Lesotho could learn from the
experiences of Botswana.34 It has an adult prevalence rate similar to Lesotho’s, but increases in
ART coverage (95 percent of those eligible for treatment) raised the life expectancy of people
living with the virus from 45 years in 2000 to 65 years in 2010.

Box 4. Evidence on economic incentives to reduce risky sexual behavior among women and adolescent girls

There is a growing body of evidence that points to the effectiveness of interventions that reduce risky sexual
behavior among adolescent girls and women by increasing their financial independence and ability to withstand
negative economic shocks.

The RESPECT program in Tanzania provided cash rewards for participants who tested negative for a range of STIs.
Program participants were randomly selected to receive no reward (the control group), a small reward (US$10), or a
large reward (US$20) each time they tested negative for STIs. Participants were also provided with training in
sexual health and relationship skills. An impact evaluation by de Walque et al (2012) showed that after one year

34
  In Botswana, a key factor in expanding ART coverage was a social mobilization campaign that raised awareness
of the availability and effectiveness of ART, which helped to reduce stigma and discrimination.

                                                       48
those receiving the large reward were 27 percent less likely to test positive for STIs. The authors infer that the
program worked by increasing the cost of risky sex and bringing the rewards of safe sex closer to the present.

In Lesotho, the same research team is testing the impact of a pilot intervention that uses a lottery system to select a
smaller number of participants to receive larger cash rewards (US$50 and US$100) for testing negative for HIV
(Björkman-Nyqvist et al, 2013). Preliminary results show that HIV prevalence dropped by 22 percent across the
small and large lottery groups, with a larger impact on women and those who in the larger-reward lottery. The
authors suggest that the lottery model may be particularly effective at targeting the most high-risk people, making
such lotteries more attractive to risk takers.

For adolescent girls, cash transfers conditional on school attendance may be an effective tool. An evaluation of a
conditional cash transfer program in Malawi found that the transfers not only increased school attendance but also
reduced HIV incidence (Baird et al, 2012). At follow-up, HIV prevalence was found to be 60 percent lower for
those who had received the CCT than those who did not. The impact of the greater financial independence that the
CCTs gave to girls is also demonstrated in results that show that CCT recipients had younger partners.

Combined vocational and life skills training programs have also shown some success in reducing risky sexual
behavior among adolescent girls. In Uganda the Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program,
implemented by the NGO BRAC, uses girls-only clubs to deliver vocational training (with a focus on self-
employment) and life-skills training. An impact evaluation showed that the ELA not only increased girls’ business
skills and income generation but also reduced risky sexual behavior, with participants 44 percent less likely to have
had sex against their will over the past 12 months and 25 percent more likely to report always using a condom
during sexual intercourse (Bandiera et al, 2014). Moreover, the program is highly scalable; it is based on a similar
intervention in Bangladesh that was successfully expanded to reach 1 million girls.


Poor efficiency and effectiveness of public spending

105. Poor budget execution has prevented full utilization of available resources. The rapid
increase in allocations since 2005 has tested the MoH’s implementation ability, producing low
budget execution rates. In 2007-10, the average absorptive capacity was 86 percent for the
recurrent budget and 69 percent for the capital budget (GoL 2010).35 The major obstacles to
improving execution rates involve deployment of human resources and procurement issues. A
related issue is the perennial problem of poor coordination of capital and recurrent budget
planning. Other challenges include a lack of in-year financial reporting to monitor expenditures,
imperfect coordination with donors, and delayed fund releases. Steps to better absorption rates
include improved management efforts, institutional development, and improved Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) utilization to monitor execution rates.
Despite these challenges, this seems to be improving with 92 percent budget execution for the
MoH in the 2011/12 budget.

106. Despite setbacks, access to health services has improved. For example, LDHS 2009
shows gains in indicators related to maternal care. Women delivering with assistance of a health-
care professional (nurse or doctor) increased from 55.4 percent in 2004 to 61.5 percent in 2009.
Women who delivered in a health facility rose from 52.4 percent in 2004 to 58.7 percent in 2009.
Women who received antenatal care from a health-care professional showed slight improvement
from 90.4 percent in 2004 to 91.8 percent 2009. The TB Case Detection Rate (CDR) was above
80 percent in 2008, and the Treatment Success (TS) improved from 52 percent in 2004 to 74

percent in 2008. On the HIV/AIDS front, Lesotho showed considerable progress in expanding
PMTCT. PMTCT coverage (considering mothers only) ramped up sharply from 3.1 percent in
2004 to 71 percent in 2009. The number of eligible people living with HIV/AIDS and on ART
increased to 60 percent in 2010.

107. In many areas, health-care access remains an issue for the poor. LDHS 2009 showed
that access to maternal care is strongly dependent on household wealth. For antenatal care,
women in the lowest quintile are least likely to have seen a doctor and most likely to have seen
no one. Only 35 percent of women in the poorest households took iron tablets or syrup during
pregnancy, compared with 61 percent in the richest quintile. Delivering in public hospitals varied
by household wealth—38.2 percent in the bottom two quintiles, compared with 75.2 in the upper
two quintiles. Similarly, a large gap between rich and poor persists for measles vaccinations,
ranging from 52 percent for children in the lowest quintile to 72 percent for children in the
highest quintile. The percentage of children who were given vitamin A supplements to counter
micronutrient deficiency in the past six months ranged from 24 percent in the lowest quintile to
44 percent in the highest quintile.

108. Low access to quality health care is reflected in a high maternal mortality rate of
490 deaths per 100,000 live births. This is an improvement from 540 in 2010. However,
relative to a range of similar countries, Lesotho’s performance is towards the poorer end of the
spectrum (Figure 58).36 Looking at the trend over the past 15 years, we can see that progress has
not been even and that the country actually has a higher rate of maternal mortality today than it
did in 1990 (Figure 59). It is clear from this trend that Lesotho will not even get close to its
MDG target of 90 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2015.

   It should be noted that that these figures are modelled estimates from the UN and World Bank. The latest DHS
figures (2009) estimate a far higher rate of 1,200 deaths per 100,000 live births. However, this represents an
unusually high increase from the estimate of 762 in the 2004 DHS, leading to concern about its accuracy.

109. Low utilization of health facilities has reduced expenditures effectiveness. Data from
the MoH’s routine Health Management Information System (HMIS) showed 0.7 outpatient visits
per capita in 2009; i.e., use of health-care facilities for a typical Basotho was less than one visit
per year. This is well below the World Health Organization (WHO) norm of 3.5 visits per capita
and South Africa’s average of 2.3 visits per capita. Similarly, the average bed occupancy rate in
2009 was 38 percent for public hospitals and 42 percent for CHAL hospitals, compared to an
optimal range of 80 percent to 85 percent (MoH AJR 2009). Low demand is hard to reconcile
with the magnitude of the HIV pandemic and other pressing health-care needs. If correct,
addressing the factors constraining utilization is critical to increasing the effectiveness of public-
health expenditures.37

110. Non-availability of drugs and overall perceptions of poor quality care have emerged
as significant barriers to accessing health care. LDHS 2004 had identified cost of treatment as
a significant barrier to accessing health services. To address this issue, the MoH removed user
charges in public and CHAL health centers and hospitals, starting in 2008. Data from the health
management system, however, shows that this policy change had only limited effect on demand.
LDHS 2009 also shows that “getting money for treatment” remains a serious problem in
accessing health care for 33 percent of women, suggesting that costs other than user fees may be
an issue. One such cost could be distance and transport, seen as access barriers in 2009 by
around a third of women. Another factor could be the opportunity cost of long waiting times,
reportedly one to eight hours at most facilities. According to LDHS 2009, the availability of
drugs was the biggest concern in accessing health care for 58.5 percent of women (Figure 60).
The response may be a proxy for a wider range of issues, reflecting service quality. This is
supported by the MoH’s facility-level client satisfaction surveys. The most frequently mentioned
reasons for dissatisfaction were provider problems, such as lack of medicines and supplies,
absent and disrespectful doctors, and long waits at facilities (GoL 2010).




37
     Reliability of administrative data may, however, be an issue, particularly on outpatient doctor’s visits.

                                                              51

111. Data shortcomings prevent a deeper assessment of allocative efficiency in the health
sector, but the limited data that exist suggest potential for improvement. For example, no
data have been collected on expenditures by outcome—for example, child health, maternal
health, family planning, etc.—to see how this matches with the burdens of disease in these areas.
HIV/AIDS is the only disease for which systematic data collection and analysis have been done.
Over the FY2005/06–FY2007/08 period, an average of 42 percent of AIDS spending went to
treatment and care, with 24.3 percent on impact mitigation and 21.7 percent on management
coordination and support. It is particularly troubling that only 11.7 percent of AIDS spending
over this period was on prevention, and for FY2007/08 the prevention share was 9.0 percent.38 In
fact, actual spending for treatment and impact mitigation tended to exceed planned expenditure
by a wide margin, while allocations for prevention were usually underspent. Equally important is
the high expenditure on program support, management, and coordination. A comparison of seven
Southern African countries that have conducted HIV/AIDS spending assessments shows that
Lesotho’s expenditures on this category are among the highest. This suggests the possibility of
efficiency gains through improving intra-sectoral allocations.

112. Better information quality is necessary for understanding how to improve
efficiency. Health-facility surveys that are sample-based, nationally representative, and
standardized will be an important improvement over current surveys that have limited
standardization and multi-year comparability. There are also data limitations on the demand side,
and household surveys on a fixed cycle are becoming the international best practice. The donor
community has an important role to play in this regard, although leadership from the MoH and
MoF is essential.

                                    Knowledge Gap: Childhood Malnutrition

Childhood malnutrition is an important issue in Lesotho. Despite several government interventions, it still remains a
lingering issue. Given the potential importance on long-term outcomes, further research is needed on the continuum
of care approach to addressing nutrition for infants, children, adolescents as well as pregnant women. 




38
  It is, however, important to note that external donors fund a large amount of activity in this area, and the limited
government budget allocation does not represent the total funding for prevention.

4.2         EDUCATION AND SKILLS

113. Access to quality education is a critical factor in inclusion because it is central to
building capabilities and access to higher-paying jobs. Education is a priority in Lesotho,
receiving around 20 percent of the overall budget (about 13.5 percent of GDP) in recent years.
This level of spending is exceptionally high for a country with Lesotho’s income level (Figure
61). Seven years of primary education are free and compulsory in Lesotho. As Lesotho’s
economy goes through a structural transformation, education and training can contribute to the
preparation of a literate, numerate, and skilled workforce that can respond to the challenges of
wage employment and self-employment. Around 70 percent of Basotho aged 25 and 34 are
already employed in the formal sector, compared with 10 percent working on farms and 20
percent in the household or informal sector. If Lesotho’s education and training systems are to
fully contribute to human development, they still have to address fundamental challenges of
quality, efficiency, and expansion of affordable and labor-market relevant post-basic education.

Barriers to inclusion

114. Improved quality, equity, and efficiency in primary education is needed as a basis
for secondary education and skills development. Rapid expansion of quality basic education
was critical in achieving shared growth in East Asian economies.39 In Lesotho, the Primary Net
Enrollment Rate (NER) has remained almost stagnant at 83 percent since 2000, and the Primary
Completion Rate was only 62 percent. In addition, attendance for the poorest income quintile is
considerably lower than for the richest income quintile; e.g., 66 percent for boys in the poorest
quintile compared to 88 percent in the richest quintile. These inequalities at the basic level
continue and are amplified at subsequent levels of schooling. Table 8 shows that Lesotho, at 16.8
percent of per capita GDP, has the highest per-pupil recurrent spending in primary education
among southern African peer countries. The average recurrent per student spending for the
similar countries is estimated at 11.3 percent of per capita GDP; this indicates that the unit cost
of primary education in Lesotho is about 50 percent above the average of comparable countries.
Although quality at primary level has improved slightly and quality reforms are under way,
Lesotho’s schools are still below the average quality for the sub-region (Table 9). Among 10
SACMEQ countries, Lesotho has the third lowest sixth-grade survival rate for students who can
read, and it scored higher than only Zambia and Malawi in SACMEQ 2007 reading scores
(Figure 63). Repeating grades often leads to students’ dropping out. In Lesotho, the dropout rate
has decreased but remained high at 19 percent in 2012, which indicates substantial system
inefficiencies.

115. Lack of education beyond the primary level is a major constraint to successful
employment. Post-primary education matters in where the Basotho work. Many post-primary
graduates fill the highest-wage jobs in key sectors of the economy (Figure 65). However, post-
primary education remains low for the poor (Table 10). About 85 percent of tertiary students
come from families in the upper two income quintiles. According to the World Bank (2010), 81
percent of heads of households in the Rural Mountain region have no education. Therefore, the
poor, especially those from rural areas, may have limited opportunities to find wage-paying jobs.

116. Several factors combine reduce demand for secondary education among the poorest
families. Their low enrollment stems from: poor rates of completion and learning in primary
schools, the secondary-level fee policies that restrict demand for education, the still-widespread
lack of supply of secondary education, especially in rural areas, and the scale of absolute
poverty. The poor have the lowest participation and completion rates in primary education. The

                                                            55
non-participation reflects the level of poverty, the distance to schools, and the condition of
schools. Boys tend to drop out to engage in herding. The average household’s share of education
costs is the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. Lesotho’s households contribute up to 49 percent of
total expenditures for lower secondary education and 44 percent for upper secondary education,
compared with 30 percent for primary and 22 percent for tertiary. According to the FY2010/11
household survey, secondary education costs parents between M2,600 (US$281) a year per child
and M4,200 (US$545) a year per child, roughly comparable to four months’ family income.
Comparatively few children receive scholarships—22 percent at lower secondary and 40 percent
at upper secondary, compared with 60 percent in higher education.

117. Higher education is expensive. The National University of Lesotho (NUL) is the
country’s flagship public institution, with more than 10,000 students enrolled. According to the
Investing for Changing Economy: Skill Development with Equity in Lesotho report (World Bank
2013), public spending per NUL student as a percentage of per capita GDP is three times higher
than comparable students in any other sub-Saharan Africa country. Moreover, Lesotho spends 25
times more on a university student than a secondary student, and 49 times more than on a
primary student. For three-quarters of tertiary students, bursaries finance both tuition and
accommodations, but repayment rates are a low 4 percent. About 85 percent of tertiary students
come from families in the upper two income quintiles. Upon graduation, as many as a third of
NUL students seek jobs abroad, mainly in South Africa, where they are attracted by higher
salaries, better career prospects, and more favorable living conditions. Most of those that remain
in the country seek jobs in the public sector. The curricula in the university have weak linkages
to employer’s needs. As the textile sector emerged over the past 25 years in Lesotho, for
example, no academic programs have been developed to support the industry.

118. Public Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) in Lesotho is small,
very costly, and ineffective. According to the Investing for Changing Economy: Skill
Development with Equity in Lesotho report (World Bank 2013), TVET enrolls about 2 percent of
the secondary-age cohort, costs six times more than a general secondary education, and only a
third of its graduates pass skills tests. In 2007, only 166 TVET students qualified for graduation.
TVET is delivered in eight institutes owned and managed by churches and civil society
institutions; the government pays all salaries. The curricula in these institutes are outdated and



                                                   56
have inadequate linkages to employers’ needs; for example, the crafts curriculum is based on
colonial British models. Many of the TVETs’ instructors have no real-world experience.

119. Lesotho has a long tradition of educating girls, reflected in near gender parity in
primary enrollment, where 50 percent of pupils were female in 2009. The girl-boy gap in
primary school completion was 16.4 in 2011, compared to -0.44 for the world. In secondary and
higher education, the majority of students are girls. In particular, the ratio of female to male
enrollment in secondary education was 139.8 in 2012, compared to 96.45 for the world. More
females than males are enrolled in secondary schools (58 percent) and at the NUL. Female adult
illiteracy is less than 2 percent in the 15-24 age group. While 13.3 percent of boys aged 6–14
have never been to school, only 7 percent of girls in the age group have never been to school
(2002).

120. While a larger share of women are educated, this advantage has not yet translated
into enhanced economic power. One in five women is engaged in agricultural occupations. For
women, the other common occupation is sales and service (21 percent). About 12 percent of
women are engaged in each of three occupations: skilled manual labor, unskilled manual labor,
and domestic service. By some measures, however, Lesotho’s women are doing better than their
counterparts in other countries. The ratio of female to male labor force participation was 0.81 in
2011, compared to 0.73 for the world. In addition, the ratio of the female to male unemployment
rates was 1.22 in 2008, compared to 1.43 for the world.

121. Vested with full legal capacity and liberated from male guardianship, adult Basotho
women are now, in theory, better equipped to play more productive and active roles as
economic and social agents. Lesotho’s Constitution provides for equality and justice to males
and females. It also mandates fair wages and equal remuneration for work of equal value. The
2006 Legal Capacity of Married Persons Act (LCMPA), along with other progressive legislation,
laid the groundwork for a gender-responsive legal framework that protects women’s rights and
provided for the repeal of all customary and civil laws giving husbands legal authority over
wives or their property. The ability that this law gives women to engage in economic transactions
in the absence of their husbands is particularly significant in a country in which husbands and
wives are often separated due to migration.



                                                 57
122. However, women are yet to experience the full potential benefits of the LCMPA
because of inadequate implementation, which has been complicated by the dual legal
system, slow-changing social attitudes, the financial costs associated with seeking redress
for violation of women’s new rights, and women’s lack of awareness of these rights. So far,
efforts to improve women’s awareness of their rights have included training and outreach events
provided by the Millennium Challenge Account-Lesotho (World Bank, 2010). Awareness of the
rights provided by the LCMPA needs to be built not only among women but also among men
who may still be impeding women by following the discriminatory business practices of the past.
For example, banks in Lesotho often still request a husband’s approval before granting credit to
businesswomen. Furthermore, while the LCMPA and the Land Act of 2010 brought reforms that
gave married and unmarried women equal inheritance rights to their male partners, these reforms
do not cover children, whose inheritance rights continue to be governed by customary law that
disadvantages daughters. Despite these challenges, some measures of women’s empowerment
appear to be better in Lesotho than in many neighboring countries. For example, a smaller
percentage of women in Lesotho report acceptance of wife beating or not being involved in key
decisions on their own health care or on major household purchases.

123. Balancing the allocation of resources between education levels has the potential to
generate savings and improve equity. For the past few years, more than one-third of the
education budget has been allocated to tertiary education, largely to support a bursary scheme
that has very limited rates of return. A similar amount of resources is spent in primary education.
Only 20 percent of the budget is spent in secondary education. This makes education
expenditures in Lesotho very regressive—the bulk of expenditures flow to the rich. Lesotho’s
allocation of resources among education sub-sectors is unusual. Comparable countries, with
roughly the same share of tertiary-age population, spend half what Lesotho does on tertiary
education. Lesotho’s spending pattern reflects the fact that both primary and tertiary education
are heavily subsidized by the government and almost free for students. The costs of secondary
education are borne largely by students and their families. If the resources spent on free tertiary
education for one student were redirected to secondary schooling, they could provide for 18
secondary students.

4.3     ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES

124. Lesotho’s geography is a challenge for the provision of basic services. Lesotho is the
only country in the world with all its territory above 1,000 meters. Four distinct agroecological
zones characterize the country, with 17 percent of the land in the lowlands, 15 percent in the
foothills, 59 percent in the mountains, and 9 percent in the Senqu River Valley. Lesotho has a
relative low population density, which makes the provision of services challenging and costly.
Despite these obstacles, the government has made significant improvements in providing basic
services.

Water and sanitation

125. By applying significant resources to providing services, Lesotho has made
impressive advances in access to safe drinking water. Between 1995 and 2005, Lesotho
ranked third among 24 African countries sampled in moving people from untreated surface water
to higher levels of service. Approximately 77 percent of Lesotho’s households have access to
                                                58
improved water sources (including 7.6 percent who rely on protected wells or springs), and 72
percent are less than 30 minutes from water. The government subsidizes water and structures
tariffs so that prices are kept low for the poor. Sanitation remains a challenge, but it has
improved significantly over the past three decades, with 25 percent of the population having
improved, non-shared facilities, 39 percent having non-improved, shared facilities, and 36
percent still without facilities. Poor access to sanitation has negative impacts of health outcomes,
especially among the poor.

Access to electricity

126. Access to electricity in Lesotho is very low. According to the NSDP, an estimated at 25
percent of households have access to electricity (2011); only 5 percent of them are in rural areas.
About 70 percent of Basotho use biomass as the main source of energy for cooking and space
heating. The cost of increasing access to a dispersed population is a significant barrier. However,
the use of solar panels is proliferating in the country and could help overcome this challenge.

Communications and road infrastructure

127. Access of remote rural population to safe all season roads and affordable
transportation services are a challenge for development. Large parts of Lesotho’s rural areas
are sparsely populated, with long distances between villages. Lesotho relies heavily on road
transport given its topography, geographical location, population densities and economic
activity; however, road quality and access to transport services are low. A large portion of the
road network suffered severe damages due to flood from heavy rains between January and April
2011. The resulting poor market access is a constraint on the farmers’ ability to sell their product
and access inputs needed for efficient production. Farmers from the highlands need to travel
more than 25 kilometers to Maseru to get agricultural inputs at subsidized prices. 25 percent of
the country’s population living in the remote mountain districts is isolated with poor access to
health, education, and other basic services due to lack or poor-quality of road infrastructure and
limited access to transport services. The last Public Expenditure Review (2013) reported that
around a third of women had listed distance and transport as the main access barriers to health
services in 2009. At present, there are more than 340 footbridges in the country and a demand for
more is high.

128. Telecommunications penetration has improved over the past decade, and it is
similar to the rest of the continent. Telecom and Internet services have been key drivers of
investment and productivity growth around the world, and they are vital to linking up with global
supply chains. According to the NSDP, about 75 percent of Lesotho’s population has mobile
phones; however, limited private ownership of computers restricts Internet use. According to the
2011 Lesotho Review, only 3.4 percent of the population has access to the Internet, with a little
over 2,000 Internet connections. There are six Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and more than
28 Internet cafés throughout the country. Internet access using smart phones and tablets could
improve the situation.

4.4      FINANCIAL ASSETS
129. Access to financial services is still challenging for many Basotho households.
According to Global Findex, only 18 percent of the adult population has a bank account; in rural
areas, it is just 14 percent (Figure 68). Only about 8 percent of the bottom 40 percent of the
population has a bank account, compared to about 25 percent of the top 60 percent. The rural-
urban divide is stark, with more than 36 percent of Lesotho’s urban residents having bank
accounts, compared with just over 20 percent in rural areas (Figure 69). Gender differences are
relatively small. Lack of a collateral for the poor Basotho is an issue.

130. Lesotho has limited banking infrastructure throughout the country. As of June 2013,
Lesotho had 44 bank branches (approximately one per 48,000 people) and 130 ATMs. Together,
they represented one bank-access facility per 12,000 people. The number of ATMs is steadily
increasing. So are the number of point-of-sale terminals, which have expanded 70 percent over
two years, exceeding 700 as of June 2013. Many bank branches and ATMs are in Maseru;
coverage elsewhere is thin. The number of physical facilities is not likely to increase much in
rural areas because of low population densities, small financial markets, and mountainous
terrain. Non-traditional delivery channels, such as mobile-phone banking and agency banking,
are key tools for increasing financial inclusion in these areas.40 In addition, developing the non-
banking sector including MFIs and SACCOs and promoting responsible finance through
consumer protection and financial literacy could also facilitate in increasing financial inclusion.




40
   The Finscope 2011 depicts serious geographical constraints to access to banking services, but a very high
financial inclusion level of 81 percent because of funeral insurance. Excluding funeral insurance, it is 66 percent—
and 38 percent have access to banking services. This is surprisingly high for a country with Lesotho’s geographical
constraints and poverty levels.

4.5      SOCIAL PROTECTION

131. Despite adequate fiscal space, the social protection system in Lesotho does not
significantly contribute to reducing poverty and inequality. The country spends substantial
resources on social transfers—about US$197 million a year, or 9 percent of GDP—but coverage
of the poor is very low. Most of the money goes to the universal Old Age Pension, school
feeding, and tertiary bursaries. These programs yield some positive outcomes and enjoy strong
popular and political support. However, the programs are for the most part not designed to
reduce poverty or vulnerability, nor promote investment and employment. The majority of the
transfers go to people who are not among the poor or extreme poor (Table 12). A well-developed
social protection system plays a critical role in alleviating poverty, though this is not currently
the case in Lesotho.

132. The Government recognizes such weaknesses in the social protection system, and
has begun addressing them. Most notable progress include the creation of a standalone
Ministry of Social Development (MSD), the approval of a National Social Protection Strategy
(NSPS), the introduction of a modern cash transfer program, (Child Grant Program-CGP) and
the establishment of a National Information System for Social Assistance (NISSA). The CGP is
a poverty targeted unconditional cash transfer program for children under 18 years of age
introduced in 2009. It currently covers 25,000 beneficiary households – roughly one eighth of the
population. A recent rigorous impact evaluation has found that it had significant positive effects
on expenditure on children and food security among poor households. The NISSA, launched in
tandem with the CGP, is a system that contains social-economic information of households and a
targeting tool for identifying poor households based on Proxy Means Targeting formula, and that
provides the basis for a unified registry of beneficiaries of all social protection programs.

133. Much ground still remains to be covered in terms of improving targeting,
administration and coordination for the social protection system to be an effective means
for poverty reduction. Like most countries, Lesotho cannot afford to waste money providing
transfers to people who do not need them. Some vulnerable groups, namely children and elderly
among which poverty is high, are targeted categorically. However, coverage is low and leakage
is high. Programs should move towards poverty targeting at the household level. More accurate
targeting mechanisms and/or scaling up programs that specifically target the poor could increase
the effectiveness of social protection for poverty reduction. With the exception of the CGP,

                                                       61
administrative processes of cash transfers are antiquate and prone to inefficiencies. These could
be improved through the adoption of reliable MIS systems, electronic payments and other
modern delivery mechanisms, which could be harmonized across the different programs to
reduce administrative costs. The NISSA could provide a basis for such harmonization, with
program linked through the National ID system, currently being rolled out by the Ministry of
Home Affairs.41

 The expansion of NISSA should be continuously monitored and evaluated to determine if it is in fact an effective
way to improve coordination and targeting. Also, its expansion should be done in a cost-effective way.

4.6       SOCIAL COHESION, VOICE, AND PARTICIPATION

134. Social inclusion and voice in Lesotho do not seem to be negatives for poverty
reduction and shared prosperity. A coalition of the All Basotho Convention (ABC), the
Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD), and the smaller Basotho National Party (BNP)
currently governs Lesotho. The country’s multiparty democracy enables members of minority
parties to criticize the executive and provides relatively effective checks and balances on the
incumbent. Government decisions undertaken by the prime minister are subject to public-sector
auditing, which has improved in recent years. In the 2012 WBI governance index, the voice and
accountability dimension was higher than the previous year but still trailed some other African
countries. Lesotho scores high on control of corruption, but it rates only fair on political stability
(Table 13). Freedom House’s 2013 Freedom of the Press Index deems Lesotho a country with a
partly free press (96th out of 196 countries). On Reporters Without Borders’ World Press
Freedom Index, Lesotho’s ranking fell from 61st in 2012 to 81st in 2013.

135. Political instability is an issue. Lesotho has a history of difficult political transitions. In
this context, the peaceful transfer of power to a coalition government following elections in May
2012 was an important milestone. However, disagreements within the coalition government have
made policymaking difficult. In March 2014, Parliament was suspended for about a month and
half following the opposition’s submission of a no-confidence motion against the prime minister
and the coalition government. In early June, 2014 the King suspended Parliament for the next
nine months after the minority coalition partner withdrew its support for the prime minister and
his political party. This led to political unrest. SADC intervened and reached a peaceful
resolution among the various leaders of the coalition government, bringing elections forward two
years. On October 17, 2014 Parliament reconvened to work on issues related to the budget and
the upcoming elections. Parliament was dissolved in early December, and elections were held on
February 28, 2015. A new coalition government took office on March 2018 led by Prime
Minister Pakalitha Mosisili.

4.7       INCLUSION: BRIEF SUMMARY OF MAIN MESSAGES AND KEY CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED

136. This chapter argues that Lesotho spends a considerable amount of resources in the
social sectors but has achieved poor outcomes. The core issue is the poor efficiency and
effectiveness of public spending. In addition, social expenditures are regressive. Post-primary
education is a privilege to the rich, and its skewed distribution is a major constraint to successful
employment. Curricula in the vocational training and tertiary level have weak linkages with
employers. Health-care access remains an issue for the poor. HIV/AIDS prevalence rates among

                                                          63
the adult population are high, hindering growth by undermining the stock of available labor,
lowering productivity, and limiting incentives for investments in future consumption. Lesotho’s
geography and its low population density make provision of basic services challenging and
costly. Access to financial services is still difficult for many Basotho households, particularly
those living in rural areas. Political stability remains an issue in Lesotho.

137. Improving human development outcomes and ensuring that individuals can more
effectively contribute to the growth and competitiveness of the economy will require
improving health outcomes, particularly in HIV/AIDS, maternal mortality, and child
malnutrition. Social progress will also require improving both broad quality and equity in
education and skills development as well as closing the gaps in access to key basic infrastructure.
In addition, improvement is needed in the financial sector to ensure greater inclusion. Table 14
summarizes these issues and identifies the channels through which they impact the twin goal.
This will be analyzed further in Chapter 6.

      5. IS THE GROWTH MODEL SUSTAINABLE?
Macroeconomic stability is a necessary condition for growth and poverty reduction. A growth model
driven by public spending is not sustainable. This chapter will argue that fiscal prudence will be critical
for sustainability, especially in the context of SACU revenue vulnerabilities. This will require fiscal
consolidation of spending—in particular, a reduced wage bill. It will also require building fiscal buffers.
A significant reform and modernization of the public sector will be fundamental to improving outcomes in
Lesotho. Reforms will require upgrades in planning, procurement, financial management, and
management processes. They will also require special attention to monitoring and evaluation. Efforts
should concentrate on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of public spending. In particular,
improving health and education could translate into an important yield from the demographic dividend.
More effective public service, as well more informed policymaking, requires substantial upgrading of
statistical capacity to ensure access to more regular, consistent, and comprehensive data. Finally,
important environmental and climate change issues require attention.


5.1     FISCAL MANAGEMENT

138. Fiscal and financial management is critical to all aspects of Lesotho’s
transformation and modernization, including delivering on key public infrastructure
investments, supporting the development of the private sector, raising the level of health
and educational outcomes, and improving the effectiveness of social safety nets. As
mentioned previously, Lesotho has a large public sector relative to the size of its economy—in
fact, one of the largest in the world at more than 60 percent of GDP, supported mostly by SACU
transfers that are highly volatile. The size of public spending seems to be crowding out private
investment and seems to have raised the relative price of non-tradables to tradables. Lesotho also
exhibits poor effectiveness and efficiency of public spending. Finally, at least 20 percent of
public spending is regressive. The current growth model is not inclusive and sustainable. From a
social point of view, it may lead to more inequality and further political instability. The solution
lies in strengthening fiscal and financial management.

Revenue and expenditure trends and fiscal balances

139. Government revenue rose from about 44.3 percent of GDP in FY2000/01 to about
71.7 percent of GDP in FY2009/2010, driven primarily by increases in SACU receipts. The
SACU transfers’ surge was driven largely by soaring imports into South Africa. The up-cycle in
SACU transfers coincided with a change in the SACU revenue-sharing formula that went into
effect in 2005. The new formula is the sum of three components: the customs component, the
excise component, and the development component. The first component is a function of custom
union duties, distributed according to each country’s share of total intra-SACU imports. The
second component is a function of excise-duty revenues collected within SACU—85 percent is
distributed according to each country’s share of SACU GDP and the remaining 15 percent, also
called the development component, is divided according to the inverse of per capita GDP. The
formula favors the less-developed members like Lesotho.


                                                    65
140. Initially, the rising SACU transfers were saved, resulting in annual fiscal surpluses
averaging about 7 percent of GDP between FY2003/04 and FY2008/09 (see Figure 70). The
mirror image of these savings was a buildup of Government deposits at the Central Bank, an
increase in international reserves (import coverage was raised from three to four months before
FY2005/06 to five to six months in FY2006/7-2009/10), and a fall of non-concessional debt
(mostly related to the first Lesotho Highlands Water Project). After 2009, these savings would be
critical to financing the fiscal deficit and preventing the buildup of debt.

141. After 2005, however, authorities gradually yielded and increased expenditures, even
though they recognized the vulnerability from an over-reliance on the volatile SACU
transfers. This vulnerability was noted repeatedly in government documents, including the
Interim National Development Framework (INDF) and the Background to the Budget
FY2009/10. By FY2009/10, public expenditures had fully absorbed the historically high
transfers Lesotho was receiving. The non-SACU fiscal deficit deteriorated from 17.1 percent of
GDP in FY2004/05 to 37.3 percent of GDP in FY2009/10 (Figure 72).

142. Expenditures would have risen even higher if budgets had been executed as
planned. From FY2004/05 to FY2013/14, the budget envisaged higher spending and running
deficits in all but two years. The surpluses the Government actually ran were a result of larger
than budgeted SACU transfers and an inability to spend quickly enough after FY2005/06,
especially on the capital side. Budgeting higher than implementation capacity may have helped
deflect political pressures to spend. Even so, these pressures could not be contained as actual
spending trends became known. The significant gap between planned and actual budgets also
weakened the budget as a tool for policy implementation.

143. Both non-financial assets and expenses increased substantially between FY2005/06
and FY2009/10 (Figure 71). Non-financial assets increased by about 9 percent of GDP, largely
driven by foreign grants. Most of the resources were allocated to construction of roads, the
Metolong dam, upgrading health facilities, and the construction of the Queen Mamohato
Hospital. Expenses increased by more than 11 percent of GDP during this period—and 4.5
percentage points of GDP went to increases in employee compensation. According to the World
Bank Public Expenditure Review (2012), the wage bill rose more than 45 percent in real terms.

                                               66
The increase was primarily the result of pay hikes that exceeded inflation between FY2007/08
and FY2009/10. By the end of FY2009/10, overall government expenses reached 55 percent of
GDP, making the budget extremely rigid.

Volatile SACU revenues

144. SACU transfers have proven volatile and difficult to manage. In the international
financial crisis, SACU revenues turned volatile, plummeting from 41.3 percent of GDP in
FY2009/10 to about 16 percent of GDP in FY2010/11. Despite a public-spending reduction of 10
percentage points of GDP, the overall fiscal balance fell into deficit. Since FY2011/12, public
spending has remained above 60 percent of GDP, up from about 56.4 percent of GDP in
FY2010/11. The country’s international reserves declined from 5.3 months of imports in
FY2009/10 to 3.6 months of imports in FY2010/11. During this period, international reserves
remained above the minimum thresholds on the traditional metrics (three months of import, 100
percent of short-term debt, and 20 percent of broad money).

145. SACU transfers increased considerably since 2010 and public spending rose to
absorb these increases, pointing to the need for more careful fiscal management and
increases in domestic revenues. Other countries dealing with similar revenue fluctuations have
successfully aligned public spending with credible estimates of long-term government revenue.
However, weaknesses in the tax administration expose important gaps between actual and
potential revenue generation. Closing them will require improvements in both policy and
administration to increase domestic tax revenue, creating a more stable supplement SACU
revenue. Despite some efforts to bolster tax management—such as approval of the new Tax
Modernization Program and a country-wide fiscal census in 2014—the tax regime remains old
and requires modernization. A strong need arises to strengthen tax collection and management,
particularly in the mining, telecommunication, construction, and financial services sectors. Tax
management also presents a number of opportunities for strengthening.

146. Over the past six years, Lesotho’s stock of public debt has been fluctuating to a
large extent on the back of exchange rate movements and increases in public spending.
Lesotho’s public sector debt declined from 37 percent of GDP in FY2009/10 to 34.4 percent at
the end of FY2010/11, driven mainly by significant appreciation of the maloti/dollar exchange

                                                    67
rate in 2009 and 2010. In FY2011/12, however, higher public spending led to an increase of
public debt to 37.6 percent of GDP. In FY2012/13, public debt kept rising to 39.6 percent of
GDP, largely because of increased financing for key infrastructure projects, such as the
Metolong Dam and health clinics throughout the country. Finally, debt reached 41.9 percent of
GDP as a result of higher public spending and a depreciation of the exchange rate. More than
three-quarters of total debt was owed to multilateral creditors, mainly the International
Development Association, the International Monetary Fund, and the African Development Fund.
At present, domestic debt is relatively small, composed of Treasury bills and bonds.

147. The macroeconomic framework faces a major shock. SACU revenues are projected to
decline from 30.7 percent of GDP in FY2014/15 to 16.5 percent of GDP in FY2016/17 and then
recover somewhat to 18.4 percent of GDP in FY2017/18. The Government envisions gradually
tightening the fiscal stance in response to the shock on SACU revenues. It aims to reduce the
non-SACU deficit from 30.3 percent of GDP in FY2014/15 to 23.1 percent of GDP in
FY2017/18, a level that still exceeds the World Bank’s estimate of a sustainable non-SACU
deficit of 19 percent of GDP (PER 2012).42 Adjustment relies primarily on cuts in capital
spending and use of goods and services, thus, composition of spending worsens. The wage bill is
projected to gradually increase from 22.7 percent of GDP in FY2014/15 to 23.8 percent of GDP
in FY2017/18. While capital expenditures and use of goods and services are projected to be cut
by about 6 percent of GDP. Measures that underpinned the cut have not been fully identified yet.
A tax reform bill that levies alcohol and tobacco is yet to be presented to Parliament, and it is
expected to yield about 1 percent of GDP.

148. Against this backdrop, Lesotho faces significant macroeconomic risks. Over the
medium term, gross international reserves are expected to decline to 3.9 months of imports,
down from about 6 months of imports in FY2014/15. This leaves Lesotho with inadequate
buffers under its exchange rate peg. If the forecast proves correct, Lesotho’s international
reserves will fall below the optimal 4.3 months of imports (IMF 2014). A shock similar to the
global crisis of 2008 would drop international reserves below the minimum threshold of three
months of imports.

149. According to the 2014 Joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis, Lesotho
remains at moderate risk of debt distress. In the baseline scenario, the present value of the
public debt to GDP ratio is projected to reach 56.3 percent in FY2023/24. The ratio is projected

42
     The IMF estimates the sustainable non-SACU balance at 15 percent of GDP.

                                                                         68
to decline thereafter because the primary balance remains positive over the medium term.
However, the risk of debt distress increases significantly in the event of adverse shocks to
economic growth, significant exchange rate depreciation, or a fiscal balance significantly worse
than expected. Results are sensitive to the assumptions concerning the financing of the
hydropower plant under the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project and
projections of Government’s annual financing needs.

Fiscal burdens and the need to reduce the size of government

150. Achieving exchange-rate sustainability, fiscal sustainability, and rebuilding buffers
will depend on reducing ongoing fiscal liabilities. Government expenditures remain above 60
percent of GDP. Fiscal consolidation efforts are challenging when the Government plays a
critical role in employment and growth. An important target for achieving fiscal sustainability is
reducing the Government’s wage bill.

151. The wage bill has been a lingering problem in Lesotho. The country has one of the
highest wage bills in Africa and the world. Over time, Government spending on salaries has been
driven upward by wage settlements that were higher than inflation and by increases in the
number of public servants. The Government justified past wage increases as necessary to bring
civil-service salaries up to “competitive” levels, stem attrition, and encourage greater efficiency
among public sector workers. Whether these objectives were achieved is questionable. First,
public sector employment offers job security and other differences to compensate for lower
wages. Second, Lesotho awards wage increases equally to all civil servants and across all tiers of
the public service, so the raises are a very blunt instrument for stemming attrition among
particular skills, such as front-line health professionals and information technology specialists.
Third, wage increases by themselves are unlikely to result in improved service delivery unless
accompanied by incentives to perform better and improve staff accountability.

152. In addition, a number of structural problems and irregularities are left in human-
resources management (HRM). Public servants constitute about 9.4 percent of the employed
population and a quarter of the people in formal wage employment. Lesotho’s wage bill reaches
about 21 percent of GDP, one of the highest in the world, presenting a significant challenge to
fiscal consolidation efforts. In particular, teacher’s salaries are among the highest in the region,
and other countries have achieved similar educational outcomes with fewer resources. Given the
insufficient private-sector job creation and high unemployment rates, the civil service has
become a de facto social safety net. The current civil service has a bottom-heavy structure, with a
high number of support staff but very few professionals or middle and senior managers.
Recurrent problems include high vacancy rates and irregularities, including ghost workers and
double dippers. In light of multiple structural problems and high wage bill, the civil service
requires strengthening of basic functions and system, such as human resource planning, merit-
based recruitment and career management, and internal control and monitoring. The current
remuneration regime does not have a way to reward high-performing employees, and previous
attempts to implement a Performance Management System have failed. Cleaning up and
regularizing current human resources records, establishing a solid and modern HRM system, and
strengthening controls will likely help reduce the wage bill. International experiences show that
such initiatives can create a great deal of fiscal space. Basic payroll and establishment controls

                                                69
are needed as well as a system for HRM. In addition, a greater performance orientation is needed
for the delivery of public services, starting with the introduction of the foundations for
performance monitoring and evaluation (M&E).

153. Savings will depend on greater effectiveness and efficiency in public spending. In
other words, fiscal consolidation can be achieved through downsizing or eliminating programs
and projects and reducing headcounts while at the same time improving outcomes. In addition,
improving the quality of public investment will be critical. A modernization of the public sector
is needed to achieve this.

5.2    PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT: AT THE HEART OF LESOTHO’S CHALLENGE

The failures in the public sector reforms

154. The Government embarked on the ambitious Public Sector Improvement and
Reform Program (PSIRP) in FY2002/03. The PSIRP was formulated in collaboration with
development partners in response to the need to strengthen good governance as a basis for
achieving accelerated growth and poverty reduction. The multidimensional PSIRP aimed at
improving the effectiveness and efficiency of public service delivery and public financial
management. Despite many attempts to launch the reform processes with support from donors,
very little success or progress has been seen over the past decade. The poor results raise an
important question: Why has the public sector reform been failed? It is critical to analyze the
following: (i) the role of leadership and the commitment of stakeholders; (ii) the appetite for
reforms as well as the incentives and drivers involved—in other words, who will be losers and
winners and their supporters and opponents; (iii) involvement of oversight institutions, such as
the Court of Account and the Parliament, and citizen engagement for checks and balance.

Weak public financial management and procurement

155. Strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending and the
accountability framework is at the core of fiscal consolidation. In March 2013, the MoF
approved a detailed PFM Reform Action Plan (PFMRAP) in close collaboration with
development partners. The plan seeks to develop more effective PFM systems, including
improvements in planning, budgeting, budget execution, procurement, accounting, reporting,
audit, and oversight. In addition, the Treasury regulations of the PFM Act of 2010 have been
issued. Over the medium term, sustained implementation will be critical for improved
governance in Lesotho.

156. The IFMIS does not yet support sound financial controls and the production of
timely and reliable quarterly budget execution reports and annual public accounts. With
financial support from DFID and the EU, the Government introduced IFMIS in 2009 at the
central government level. Due to a number of technical and adaptive challenges, the system does
not support daily operations effectively, and the timely production of reliable in-year and annual
financial information is not yet possible. Some of the core PFM functions (requisitions, orders,
commitment control, and payments) were initially not performed through the IFMIS. Budgets
were not loaded. Users were not properly trained. Frequent system unavailability continues (up
to two days a week) and results in bypassing of the IFMIS to maintain operations, with no
                                               70
controls to ensure timely capture of transactions conducted outside the IFMIS. Other PFM
functions (e.g., budget preparation and asset management) are still performed manually or
through parallel systems in line ministries and district sub-accountancies. Good-practice
accounting disciplines, such as month-end closures and bank reconciliations, are also not yet
fully functional. These deficiencies severely limit revenue and expenditure control, budget
execution, reliable and timely reporting, and ultimately financial accountability. A lack of
verified and accepted opening IMFIS balances as of 2009 also affects the reliability of IFMIS
data.
 
157. The MTEF process is still weak. Projects and programs are not always linked to NSDP
priorities. Policy discussion has taken place at the end of the preparation of the Budget
Framework Papers (BFPs). The MTEF’s outer-year spending plans are seldom used in preparing
subsequent years’ budgets, and the approach to budgeting remains largely incremental and line-
item based.

158. Although several reforms have been introduced, the public procurement system
remains weak, understaffed, and poorly regulated at the ministry and district levels. A new
public-procurement regulation took effect in 2007, and it has been under review since 2010 to
remove inconsistencies, provide greater clarity in its application, and introduce additional
procurement methods.43 Capacity building of procurement staff also began under the Irish Aid-
supported Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) program at the Lesotho Institute
of Development and Management (IDM). A Procurement Tribunal was established early in
2012, providing the private sector with the comfort of an independent complaint-handling
mechanism. Despite these positive developments, several challenges stand in the way of a
transparent, efficient, economic, and competitive public-procurement system that delivers value
for money and fosters development of local enterprises. The challenges include: (i) a
decentralized procurement system not fully staffed in almost all line ministries and districts; (ii)
staff with limited (and in some cases unacceptable) academic qualifications and little experience
in public procurement, coupled with a CIPS training program that appears ineffective in building
public-procurement skills; (iii) weak regulatory oversight and audit and ineffective capacity-
building by Procurement Policy and Advice Division (PPAD); (iv) procurement structures at
national, ministry, and district levels that do not offer competitive salaries and grades to attract
and retain skilled and experienced staff; (v) negative public perception of procurement as having
limited competition, inadequate information, and lengthy payment arrangements that leave the
process prone to corruption and betray the interests of the private sector (GoL, 2008c).

Poor public investment management

159. In recent years, the productivity of capital spending has been reduced by the lack of
complementary reforms. High capital spending has boosted short-run growth, especially in the
construction sector; ultimately, however, investment productivity has to be assessed in terms of
its effects on future growth. A large part of the increase in capital spending after 2005 was
directed toward recruiting new private-sector investment; so far, it is unclear whether these
public investments were effective in achieving their goals. While institutional weaknesses in

43
  The 2007 regulation created the Procurement Policy and Advice Division (PPAD) to spearhead procurement
reform and provide the needed regulatory function. The regulation also created procurement units in each entity.

                                                      71
project selection, management, and implementation may have contributed to the disappointing
results, the productivity of public investment may have been compromised by slow progress in
complementary reforms to improve the investment climate. For instance, the Government has
spent large amounts on maintaining and improving health facilities, yet their utilization remains
low because of a lack of complementary factors—most important, doctors and medicines (GoL,
2010).

160. The inefficiency of public investment is manifested in several other dimensions.
These include weak capacity for project implementation, project delays, and poor procurement
procedures—all contributing to Lesotho’s low absorption capacity. The country has struggled to
expend the funds budgeted for specific projects, leading to relatively low execution rates. For
example, the country spent just 56 percent of budgeted funds in FY2006/07 and 61 percent in
FY2007/08. In recent years, however, implementation of the capital budget has improved to
more than 80 percent. No central guidelines control project implementation. A general lack of
transparency affects implementation of projects and programs. On the procurement side, too,
tendering procedures are lax, adding to perceptions of a lack of transparency.

161. According to the World Bank’s Public Investment Management Efficiency Review
(2012), the implementation capacity of capital spending across the ministries varies
considerably. In September 2010, the MoF submitted A Comprehensive Review of All Ongoing
Capital Projects to the Cabinet. The report analyzes the implementation of Lesotho’s capital
budget and specific projects’ performance. Two key issues emerge. First, absorption rates vary
significantly across sectors. In FY2009/10, for example, the Ministry of Forestry and Land
Reclamation spent 100 percent of its allocated budget, while the Ministry of Natural Resources
managed about 40 percent. Second, absorption rates differ significantly for Government funds
and development partners’ funds. Gaps between amounts budgeted and actually spent have
ranged from 7 percent to 32 percent of the total budget. The data on allocations and spending
show a long-standing execution deficit. The pattern, however, is different when comparing
government-funded and donor-funded projects with spending across ministries.

162. Strengthening the PIM cycle is therefore critical to increasing average returns on
public investment projects. Before 2009, the Cabinet decided which projects were funded
through the capital budget. The projects selected were not always closely linked to national
priorities. Some progress was made following the PIM Efficiency Review (2012)—for example,
introduction of a new public investment project appraisal system and the restructuring the
Projects Approval Committee (PAS) as the Public Sector Investment Committee (PSIC). Despite
the positive signs, the PIM cycle from planning/designing to implementation and M&E remains
weak. Currently, project proposals are submitted to the project cycle management unit at the
MoDP and PSIC in an ad-hoc way as needs arise within sectoral ministries. Many projects, even
large-scale ones, still do not go through a rigorous appraisal process. Even when they do, limited
capacity for project appraisal hinders both MDP and line ministries. In practice, rigorous cost-
benefit analysis—indeed, any cost-effective analysis at all—is rarely done for any budget-funded
project or program. Not surprisingly, many projects are poorly designed and fail to deliver assets
at least worth the investment cost (GoL, 2009). In addition, a robust M&E program is greatly
needed to strengthen the capacity to produce and use information from assessments of public



                                               72
investment impacts. It is also not clear whether projects with the greatest potential impact make
it through the appraisal process.

163. Project proposals often do not set defined physical scopes and hard ceilings on
financial resources. Once a project’s financing is approved, it is important to budget and
manage against an estimate of total cost. Any substantial budget increases should be subject to
further approval. Such procedures are not well established in Lesotho. As a result, it is common
for projects to continue beyond their original completion dates and become a source of what is in
effect recurrent financing. Since almost 90 percent of the capital budget is allocated to ongoing
projects, strengthening procedures for monitoring project implementation and undertaking
periodic reviews should play a central role in Public Sector Improvement Reform Program
(PSIRP) management.

164. Weak capacity to implement projects and programs is a serious issue in Lesotho. In
the 2012 governance indicators, Lesotho ranked very low (42 percent) in terms of government
effectiveness. The Public Investment Management Review (2012) found important delays in
project and program implementation. At the same time, the report notes weaknesses in project
and program monitoring during the implementation phase. On the one hand, there seem to be
capacity constraints due to the lack of necessary skills. On the other hand, there seem to be
political economy issues. At the moment, no performance management system is in place, and
previous attempts to establish one have failed. A strong political consensus to reform the public
service will be necessary to address this issue.

Monitoring and evaluation and statistical capacity

165. The lack of an across-the-board M&E system and capacity handicaps policy and
programming planning and decision-making, making it difficult for the Government to
determine whether expenditures are meeting their objectives and, if not, why. There are
growing concerns about poor fiscal management and weak service-delivery outcomes. The key
issues are inefficiencies in strategic planning, budgeting, and M&E, a lack of coordination,
capacity challenges, statistical weaknesses and public investment management. In the context of
the NSDP, Lesotho seeks to develop a government-wide performance M&E system to enhance
the effectiveness, efficiency, transparency, and accountability of public-sector management and
develop a culture of evidence-based results management. This would help monitor and evaluate
the implementation of the NSDP and key government policies, programs, and projects, with a
view of enhancing capacity of managers to make informed and timely decisions.

166. Lesotho lags its regional and international peers in statistical capacity, hindering
evidence-based policymaking and undermining the potential to monitor the performance
and impact of government policies and programs (Figure 74). The country needs to
strengthen data development, analysis, and use to support effective planning, budgeting, and
M&E policies, programs and projects. The Lesotho Bureau of Statistics (BoS), an autonomous
agency, has made significant progress producing key economic and social statistics—NPI, CPI,
demographics, agricultural production, household budgets, employment, security and gender-
related subjects. The BoS has spearheaded publication of these data through the use of web-
based open formats. However, delays of up to three years are common on the availability on the

                                               73
national account and sector data. Data from household surveys, ministries, public service
delivery units, and public-sector spending reports are sporadic and vary in quality, imposing
constraints on the ability of decision-makers to assess alternative policies and make informed
decisions. As a result, decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources and options for
reforming and improving public services often lack sound analytical foundations, and program
evaluation is at best difficult. At both BoS and line ministries, the objective is clear—to
strengthen systems, tools, and capacities and to develop the necessary IT infrastructure and
software to support further statistical capacity-building throughout the government.

Transparency and accountability in the public resource management

167. Transparency and accountability are serious challenges in Lesotho, reaching
perceived levels of state capture in some cases. Important oversight challenges persist despite
the establishment of key oversight bodies, such as Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), the
Office of the Auditor General, the Directorate on Corruption and Economic Offences (DCEO),
the office of the Ombudsman, the Human Rights Commission, and the Police Complaints
Authority. The issues include unclear legal mandates and capacities and the lack of an effective
incentives framework and political consensus to make these bodies effective accountability
institutions.

168. Despite some efforts to promote think tanks and grass-roots organizations, civil
society appears to be fragmented and weak, with limited influence. Trust in government and
civil society are limited—at the same time. With regard to citizens’ access to government
information, a historical legacy of military rule and restrictions has inhibited popular demand for
good governance. The government generally respects freedom of speech and the press in
Lesotho. With recent efforts to tackle corruption, Lesotho ranks currently 55th among 174
countries in the 2014 Transparency international Corruption Perceptions Index. Greater citizen
engagement would enhance accountability. Steps in that direction could include (i) citizen
engagement tools to facilitate greater citizen engagement in policymaking; (ii) citizen-based
monitoring tools to support the M&E system, such as service-delivery satisfaction tools,
including the use of mobile technology, and service delivery oversight tools, such as
procurement watch; and (iii) support to media strengthening, such as grants for investigative
journalism on select topics.

5.3     NATURAL CAPITAL AND WEALTH CONVERSION

169. Wealth accumulation is fundamental to ensuring sustainable growth and
development. Wealth can take the form of natural capital, produced capital, human capital, and
social capital. Growth that simply runs down assets is less sustainable than growth associated
with maintaining and building assets. Because it is nonrenewable, natural capital is most critical
in the assessment.

170. Lesotho has experienced a positive change in wealth per capita since 2005. Gross
savings have been relatively high (Figure 75). In addition, education expenditures in Lesotho
(used as a proxy for investments in human capital) is high compared to most sub-Saharan Africa
countries, contributing positively to the change in wealth per capita. By contrast, natural capital
depletion, depreciation of fixed capital, and population adjustments contributed negatively to
wealth per capita. Compared to other developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Lesotho is in a
better position because of its positive balance in wealth per capita (Table 16). Lesotho’s natural
capital depletion can be explained by loss of forest resources. Compared to other African
countries and the average for other developing countries, depletion in natural capital per capita
has been relatively smaller in Lesotho (Table 17).

Other environmental issues

171. The country suffers from severe land degradation. Despite numerous attempts and
extensive but fragmented technical knowledge, barriers continue to obstruct efforts to develop or
implement effective sustainable land management (SLM) models. As a result, land degradation
continues to diminish local livelihoods and impose broader environmental costs on the region
beyond Lesotho’s borders (UNDP, 2008). The threats to Lesotho’s land can be classified along
two major production systems: cultivated lands and the range resource complex.

172. Cultivated lands are threatened because of inadequate adoption of soil and water
conservation (SWC) structures. The problems include water and wind erosion, declining soil
fertility, sediment deposits on and outside cultivated areas, increasingly variability in stream
flows, and lower water tables (UNEP, 2008). The root cause is inadequate adoption of SWC
structures because most land managers have little knowledge of appropriate methods and
insufficient incentives for maintaining the structures. SWC methods have been used in Lesotho
since colonial times, are widely known among researchers, and examples of successful adoption
exist; however, they are not appropriately reflected in extension services, and many land
managers in the highlands do not know about them.

173. Two-thirds of Lesotho’s land area is rangeland, and grazing is the principal land
use (WB, 2011). Lesotho’s rural economy depends predominantly on livestock herding’s
productivity for income and employment generation. Livestock are mainly cattle, goats, and
sheep, and they are herded on rangelands throughout most of the year. Large-scale wind and
water erosion have caused rangeland degradation, leading to shrinking grazing resources and
declines in grazing areas and their productivity.

174. The range complex is threatened by reduced ground cover due to overgrazing and
fuel collection; soil erosion by wind and water; declining soil fertility that affects pasture
productivity, woody biomass, and biodiversity; and hydrological instability leading to
variable stream flows and off-site sediment deposits within and beyond Lesotho (UNDP,
2008). Due to overgrazing, the shrub vegetation and grassland that should dominate the Foothill
and Mountain Regions is now very sparse. When combined with Lesotho’s characteristically
steep slopes and semi-arid climate, this loss of vegetation worsens the water and wind erosion
that plays a significant role in land degradation. Vegetative cover, soil fragility, and type and
duration of rainfall are among the most significant factors responsible for soil erosion—the most
serious form of land degradation in Lesotho (IFAD 2014). Fertility has been reduced over time
by “soil mining,” exacerbated by the fact that many farmers live (with their livestock) far from
their plots and have no cost-effective way to transport manure to the fields (PRS).

175. The root cause of the degradation of the range resource complex is poor governance,
rendering current management practices unsustainable. Effective governance is often
lacking, so that power struggles over resources are not controlled. The legal framework is not
clear enough and does not sufficiently clarify responsibilities and boundaries. Furthermore, the
institutions for management of rangelands (Community Councils) have legal authority but lack
resources to operate at the local level. In addition, the rangelands face increasing pressure to
meet the rising demand for wood fuel, driven by lack of affordable alternative fuels and
affordable, accessible, efficient heating and cooking technologies. Supplies are met from wood
                                               76
resources that are not effectively managed, and the invasion of alien species is causing
widespread rangeland degradation (UNDP, 2008). In South Africa and Lesotho together, alien
plants cover about 10 million hectares, or more than 8 percent of total land area, and they are
spreading at 5 percent a year (FAO, 2011). Incentives for investment in sustainable land-
management practices are lacking because of land-tenure insecurity, and knowledge is lacking
because information on these production technologies is not disseminated through research and
extension. Recently, the Land Act of 2010 and Land Administration Authority Act of 2010 have
overhauled the land administration system, with the objective of regularizing titles and
strengthening tenure security. However, this is aimed mainly at urban and peri-urban areas, and
a communal system remains in place in rural areas. The impact of the new system on
investments in sustainable land-management practices is, therefore, likely to be limited.

5.4      VULNERABILITY TO NATURAL DISASTERS AND CLIMATE CHANGE

176. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),
Lesotho is categorized as one of the countries highly vulnerable to the impact of climate
change. The country has a temperate climate with subalpine characteristics, including four
distinct seasons. Temperature and rainfall vary significantly from season to season, with Lesotho
experiencing hot summers and relatively cold winters (WB, 2014c).44 The country experiences
droughts, floods, frosts, heavy snowfalls, strong winds, hailstorms, and tornadoes. Frequent
droughts result in poor harvests and large livestock losses. Dry spells also create food shortages,
famine, disease epidemics, invasions by exotic plants and destructive insects, dust bowls, and
down-cutting by rivers.45 These adverse climatic conditions undermine the country’s economic
development and the well-being of the nation (UNEP, website report and ALM Lesotho profile).

177. Lesotho’s vulnerability to climate change and climate variability arises from several
factors: erratic rainfall, fragile soils, and worsening land degradation in the face of a
growing population. All are exacerbated by poor land-management practices, particularly in the
livestock sector. In addition, Lesotho is highly vulnerable to climate-related challenges due to
over-reliance on rain-fed agriculture for food production. Climate change forecasts point to
detrimental impacts on the agricultural and livestock sectors in a country already ravaged by
cycles of drought and intense rainfall that combine to create massive soil erosion and gully
formation, resulting in loss of Lesotho’s very limited agricultural land (IFAD, 2014).

178. Lesotho is expected to experience changes in temperature and precipitation
patterns, becoming drier and hotter. The mean annual temperature in Lesotho already
increased by 0.76° C between 1970 and 2001,46 and inter-seasonal (between seasons) and intra-


44
   Winter occurs during June-August, and mean temperatures vary from 0.1° C to 17.3° C. Significant amounts of
snowfall occur during this season in high-lying areas and every three years on average in the low-lying regions.
Summer lasts from December to February, with a mean temperature of around 25° C. Around 85 percent of rainfall
occurs during the summer months. The main rainy season begins in October and lasts through April, bringing
between 400-1,200 mm of rainfall per year. Lesotho’s northern region experiences the most rainfall (800-1,200 mm)
and the Senqu River Valley and southern lowland districts experience the least rainfall (400-600 mm) (GoL, 2013).
45
   The occurrence of dry spells has been found to be correlated to the El Niño phenomenon—an abnormal increase
in surface sea temperatures—while wet spells are related to La Niña conditions (ALM website).
46
   Projected mean annual temperature increases: 1.78-2.23° C by 2060 and 2.48-4.50° C by 2100 (GoL, 2013).

                                                       77
seasonal (within a season) precipitation has become more variable (GoL, 2013).47 In addition, the
intensity and frequency of floods, droughts, and other extreme weather events have increased,
especially in the western and northern lowlands. Droughts have become more frequent in recent
years,48 and recurrent droughts49 have resulted in a steep reduction in the production of cereals
and other staple crops (GOL, 2013). In the past 50 years, Lesotho has gone from a position of
virtual self-sufficiency in grain production to being highly dependent on imports.50 Foreigners
currently supply 50 percent to 60 percent of Lesotho’s annual grain requirements. The main
reason for the dramatic decline in grain production has been the extreme variability of Lesotho’s
rainfall, particularly the severity and length of drought periods (IFAD, 2014). In addition,
Lesotho is experiencing desertification in the southern lowlands and across the Senqu River
Valley (GoL, 2013). Increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme events and natural
disasters have also been observed in recent years (Table 18).

                                    Table 18. Natural disasters from 1980-2010

179. The impacts of climate change in Lesotho will vary from sector to sector. Water
resources will be affected negatively by reductions of precipitation and increases in temperature.
This will result in greater evaporation losses and decreases in runoff and groundwater recharge.
Rangeland conditions may deteriorate—and ultimately be destroyed—by climate changes,
leading to declines in the quality of livestock and livestock products. The present indigenous
forests may change into semi-arid types, while agricultural production will decline, resulting in
food shortages (ALM, website).

180. In terms of impacts on health, Lesotho has few recorded occurrences of tropical
vector-borne diseases, but it has been affected by meningococcal meningitis, which was one
of the top five causes for adult mortality in 2010. Meningitis is related to climate and
environmental factors, particularly drought, which may affect its spatial distribution, intensity,
and seasonality. In addition, falling agricultural output due to drought may lead to reduced
dietary diversity and lead to micronutrient deficiencies. Strategies that will reduce the risks posed
by climate change include: development of early warning systems that forecast health-related
weather events; strengthening institutional capacity; promotion and development of better
infrastructure; and integration of climate change into health policies (GoL, 2013).


47
   Mean annual precipitation is projected to increase slightly by middle (2046-2065) and late 21st century (2081-
2100) under low, medium, and high emissions scenarios (GoL, 2013).
48
   Between April 1991 and October 1995, Lesotho experienced the longest drought in almost 200 years (GoL, 2013).
49
   Devastating floods in December 2010 and February 2011 resulted in severe economic losses, equivalent to 3.2
percent of Lesotho’s GDP.
50
   Cereal yields in 2010 were 909 kilograms per hectare, compared with the sub-Saharan Africa average of 1,400
kilograms per hectare (WB climate change portal).

                                         Knowledge Gap: Climate change
Currently, Lesotho has no climate change strategy. Understanding of how climate change may affect vulnerable
rural communities is limited, along with the implications this may have on migration and urbanization.



5.5     SUSTAINABILITY: BRIEF SUMMARY OF MAIN MESSAGES AND KEY CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED

181. This chapter argues that Lesotho’s growth model is not sustainable. Lesotho’s
macro-fiscal situation threatens the sustainability of the exchange-rate peg. In addition, as
mentioned in Chapter 3, the current level of public spending could be crowding out private-
sector investment. Addressing this issue will require the Government to make hard choices on
fiscal consolidation and rebuild its buffers to manage fiscal and external risks. This is likely to
require a fundamental rethinking of the government’s scope and in the economy. It will also
require the Government to change its mindset and adopt more modern, efficiency-driven, and
accountable approaches to service delivery. Finally, important environmental issues, such as land
degradation, need to be addressed. Table 19 summarizes these issues and identifies the channels
through which they impact the twin goals. This is analyzed further in Chapter 6.

6. PRIORITIZING THE CHALLENGES

Lesotho faces many constraints to achieving the goals of eradicating extreme poverty and improving
shared prosperity, stimulating jobs-intensive and private sector-driven growth, and ensuring that all
Basotho can contribute to and share in the gains from growth. Prioritization these constraints is
challenging, but by assessing potential impact, complementarities, and sequencing, a set of five broadly
defined priorities are identified for implementation. They are: (i) reducing the size of the state, rebuilding
buffers, and improving service delivery by achieving fiscal consolidation and modernizing the public
sector; (ii) facilitating a competitive export-oriented private sector by aligning incentives and developing
key infrastructure; (iii) increasing the returns to self-employment by raising smallholders’ productivity;
(iv) improving health and education outcomes by reducing the disease burden and raising and aligning
skills; and (v) reforming social protection to reduce fragmentation and improve targeting, efficiency, and
effectiveness.


6.1      INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE CHALLENGES

182. For Lesotho, the analysis presented in this report shows an adequate level of growth
that has not been inclusive. Both poverty and inequality are among the highest in the world.
Fundamentally, this is because Lesotho’s growth has not been conducive to reducing poverty and
inequality. At the heart of the country’s challenge, therefore, is the need to develop a more
inclusive and sustainable growth model, one that ensures the drivers of growth and inclusion are
interrelated.

183. As Chapters 3-5 of this report have described in detail, Lesotho faces a broad range
of constraints to achieving the transition to this new growth model and subsequently to
making continued, rapid progress toward the twin goals. Table 20 summarizes the 26 broad
challenges identified in these report. They are organized along three pathways:
     Redefining the role of the state
     Promoting private sector-led jobs-intensive growth;
     Strengthening individual and group assets.

6.2     DESCRIPTION OF PRIORITIZATION PROCESS

184. Each of the challenges in Table 20 where assessed within a “theory of change”
framework, shown in Annex 3 (Table 24). The assessment identifies (i) the desired results that
would hopefully be achieved by removing these constraints and (ii) logical links that show how
removal of the constraints would ultimately impact the twin goals of eradicating extreme poverty
and improving shared prosperity via the three broad pathways. By mapping the pathway, this
approach helps highlight key complementarities across the challenges as well as the degree to
which addressing certain challenges may be pre-requisites to unlocking others.

185. To identify priorities, each challenge was then assessed against a set of criteria, as
outlined in Box 5. A quantitative score was given for each, with the assessment of the impact on
achieving the twin goals weighted heaviest. See Annex 3 for a detailed description of the
quantitative assessment process; results are shown in Table 24 of Annex 3.

Box 5: Criteria for prioritization

The criteria used in scoring as part of the prioritization exercise were:
     Impact on twin goals: To what degree would resolving the constraint (or exploiting the opportunity) have a
         direct impact on eradicating extreme poverty? To what degree would resolving the constraint (or exploiting
         the opportunity) have a direct impact on supporting sustainable incomes and livelihoods among those in the


                                                        81
         bottom 40 percent of the population? The emphasis is on job-creating growth.
        Time horizon of impacts: Over what timeframe will the impact be realized?
        Complementarities: To what degree does the issue have influence across different domains (growth,
         inequality, sustainability) and/or would magnify the positive impact of addressing other constraints?
        Evidence base: Given the quality of the evidence, how confident are we in identifying the issue as a
         priority? In many cases, Lesotho’s evidence base—through statistics, strategies, and reports—is relatively
         solid, despite the fact that data is often weak. However, much of the evidence in several cases remains
         anectotal. In these cases, issues were rated as having a less solid evidence base to support the assessment.
        Adequacy of existing interventions:51 The intention of the SCD is not to identify issues that have somehow
         been completely passed over by policymakers. This is unrealistic, and it would indeed be concerning if
         such issues were identified. In fact, the Government is addressing all of the challenges identified in this
         report to some extent. This criterion aims to identify areas where significant additional public intervention
         is warranted.52


186. Overall, the desk analysis resulted in identifying 14 of the 26 challenges as “highest”
and “high” priority (see Annex 3, Table 24 and Table 25). Other identified challenges did not
rank among the top 14 for a variety of reasons. Most common, it was either: (i) they had a long
pathway to eliminating poverty and increasing shared prosperity and/or (ii) there was already a
fairly effective intervention in place to address the challenge.

187. To complement and enrich the desk assessment, consultations were held with key
stakeholders. This included a workshop within the World Bank, which solicited input from
across the global technical practices, and five workshops in Lesotho with representatives of
government, the private sector, civil society, and development partners. Annex 4 presents details
on the consultations conducted throughout the SCD process. During the sessions, the analysis
from Chapters 3-5 was presented, along with the logic leading to the identification of challenges
and priorities. This was followed by discussion of the analysis and identification of priorities.
Overall, the consultations underlined broad support for the analysis and priorities identified, and
the consultations impacted the prioritization process in several ways:

        Recognizing the limitations of quantitative rankings: As expected, individuals and
         organizations with vested interests in certain sectoral and technical areas not identified as
         priorities often made forceful arguments to the contrary. Bolstered by strong technical
         expertise, these arguments were, of course, fairly effective. This underlined the
         contestability of quantitative ratings and the importance of leaving scope for flexibility in
         the CPF process by grouping some identified priorities into broader categories.

        Highlighting the critical role of improving efficiency and effectiveness of public
         spending: The consultations, particularly those in Lesotho, put strong emphasis on the
         priority of addressing issues related to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of
         public spending.


51
  Used as a criteria in the Botswana Systematic Country Diagnostic (2015).
   This criterion takes into consideration only those interventions that ongoing. For Bank-related projects, it was
52

based on the BTORs and Aide Memoires. In addition, key development partners informed us about the status of
existing information during the consultations. Based on this information, a score of 3 was given to weak adequacy of
existing interventions, while a score of 1 was given to strong adequacy of existing interventions.

                                                         82
         Highlighting the critical pre-condition of political consensus and stability. Sessions with
          government officials showed they are well-aware of the key challenges identified in the
          diagnostic, but the Government’s ability to implement major reforms/corrective actions
          has been impaired by the lack of political consensus and resistance from political and
          business special interests.

         Identifying linkages and complementarities: The sessions were particularly helpful in
          further identifying the linkages and complementarities across challenges, which again
          supports the idea of grouping some identified priorities into broader categories.

         Describing the status of ongoing interventions: The consultations were particularly
          helpful in providing additional details on the nature and status of existing interventions
          (by government, development partners, etc.) to address many of the challenges identified.

6.3       PRIORITIZATION: FINAL RESULTS

188. Pulling together the results from the prioritization exercise, Figure 76 provides an
overview of the challenges and priority interventions identified. These are shown with their
links to the three pathways highlighted in this note and, ultimately, to the twin goals. It is
important to note that prioritization of some challenges does not suggest ignoring others. All the
issues discussed in this report are important to ensuring sustainable, inclusive growth and
poverty reduction in Lesotho. And to some degree, the Government will need to put time and
resources into all of them. The purpose of the SCD prioritization is to identify those challenges
that are likely to have the greatest bearing on eliminating absolute poverty and on improving the
welfare of the less-well-off in the medium term. In short, we are proposing an emphasis rather
than a sole focus.

189.      The final priorities are discussed in further detail below:

190. None of the priority interventions outlined below will deliver rapid and sustainable
progress on the twin goals without addressing the fundamental challenge—the need to redefine
the role of the state:

         Fiscal consolidation. The sheer size of the state, coupled with misaligned expenditures,
          including a high wage bill, is one of the fundamental obstacles to the sustainability of
          inclusive growth, more diversified growth itself, and building assets among the poor.
          Fiscal consolidation can be achieved through downsizing or eliminating programs and
          projects and through headcount reductions, while at the same time improving outcomes.
          In addition, strengthening management of SACU receipts will be essential for
          macroeconomic stability. Other countries dealing with similar revenue fluctuations have
          successfully aligned public spending through credible estimates of long-term government
          revenue. Strengthening domestic revenue could be an alternative that would reduce
          dependency on SACU revenues. With other revenue sources in place, SACU windfalls
          could be used to restore buffers and to invest in key infrastructure to boost private-sector
          development.



                                                   83
        Public sector modernization for effectiveness and efficiency: Fundamental to addressing
         the challenges are: regularizing human resource management and establishing a
         Performance Management System; improving the effectiveness and efficiency of public
         spending; adopting systems and processes to improve public investment management,
         project management, procurement, and program delivery; and putting in place systematic
         and meaningful processes for monitoring and accountability. Finally, a skilled and
         effective civil service is needed.

191. As discussed throughout this report, eliminating poverty and improving the welfare
of the bottom 40 percent of the population will require a fundamental shift to a new growth
model, one that gives inclusion a central role and creates sufficient, broad-based
employment. This will require the development of a competitive and export-oriented private
sector:

            i.    Establishing incentives to support an outward-oriented private sector, including
                  trade, competition, and business-regulation policies that ensure access to
                  competitively priced inputs and skills and improve incentives to compete in
                  tradable sectors. Skilled and talented Basotho have long faced an environment in
                  which the most attractive career choices have been to join the public sector or to
                  migrate to South Africa. For those looking to become entrepreneurs, the easiest
                  and highest returns could be found by focusing on domestic non-tradables and
                  government contracts. With such a small domestic market, Lesotho needs build
                  competitive, productive export-oriented firms capable of generating significant
                  employment. It will require redefining the role of the state by moving away from
                  areas that should be undertaken by the private sector (for example, provisioning
                  factory shells), cutting the red tape in business regulation, and abandoning
                  policies to promote national champions.

           ii.    Developing key infrastructure: The returns to export-oriented activities in Lesotho
                  are relatively low due to a variety of factors--some structural, others policy-
                  related. While high input costs can be partly addressed through the incentive
                  framework discussed above and productivity addressed through improvements in
                  human capital discussed below, building key infrastructure is critical to
                  competitiveness. This will require a focus on improving: (i) trade facilitation, (ii)
                  access to electricity, (iii) sustainable and safe road connectivity, and (iv) the
                  speed, quality, and cost effectiveness of ICT infrastructure.

                                 Knowledge Gap: Analysis of the private sector

Identifying the incentives to develop the private sector will require a much deeper analysis. How big is it? How is it
structured (firm size, sectors, formal/informal)? How much is it dependent on government contracts? This analysis
will help identify specific opportunities that may be available given Lesotho’s location and endowments.

192. Developing a competitive private sector capable of generating broad-based
employment will take time. Such a structural change will require from 15 to 20 years. During
this time, a large share of the population, particularly those in rural areas, will still rely on
farming. Many of the poor and “near poor” that fall outside the formal labor market will continue
to face risks of falling back into poverty. For this reason, Lesotho needs to focus on increasing
the opportunities and returns to self-employment by raising productivity of smallholders and
microenterprises:

       Raising productivity of smallholder and microenterprises: Improving productivity and
        increasing agricultural incomes is key to developing a more vibrant rural economy, which
        will in turn create non-farm employment opportunities. The agenda for raising
        smallholder productivity will focus on establishing the right incentives for adopting more
        appropriate technologies and production methods to improve yields and mitigate risks.
        This will require strengthening the extension system. In addition, seeking new
        opportunities, such as developing horticulture for regional markets will be important.
        Outside agriculture, interventions will promote a more dynamic microenterprise sector,
        both in rural and urban areas, with a focus not only on entry into self-employment and the
        SMME sector but also on improving productivity within the sector through capacity-
        building and access to services. Given the sector’s existing limits, a starting point will be
        deepening the knowledge base to ensure that interventions are built on a strong evidence
        base.

                       Knowledge Gap: Gender constraints to agricultural productivity

Given the importance of improving smallholder productivity, it will be particularly critical to know whether there
are any gender-specific constraints that prevent female farmers from being as productive as their male counterparts.
The recent World Bank/One Foundation “Levelling the Field” (2014) report carried out analysis using LSMS-ISA
data and found that in many countries women suffer from lower agricultural productivity caused by restricted access
to various productive inputs and structural factors that reduce women’s returns on various inputs. Currently,
available data are not sufficient to undertake a similar study for Lesotho. The analysis would require gender
disaggregated data on farmers’ use of various productive inputs and on their agricultural yields. 


193. Developing a new growth model will also require large gains in firm-level productivity,
which will depend on substantial improvements in human capital:

       Human capital for employment, productivity, and human development: Lesotho’s private
        sector requires a workforce with better and more appropriate skills; this will be key to
        improving firm-level productivity and driving competitiveness in diversified sectors. But
        it also requires a much-improved health environment to ensure that all individuals have
        the capacity to contribute to productivity and enjoy adequate human development
        outcomes. This will require a specific focus on elements of both education and health:

           i.    Education: Raising the quality of education, with a specific focus on aligning
                 skills with labor market needs, will equip Basotho, especially the youth, to
                 participate productively in the economy, whether through formal employment or
                 microenterprises. The focus will be on improving the relevance of skills, primary


                                                        86
                 education quality, primary completion rates, vocational training, and access to
                 post-primary education for the poor.
           ii.   Health: Improving health care will focus on: (i) health barriers to skills
                 acquisition and labor-market participation, particularly infant and child
                 malnutrition and the impact of disease (especially HIV) on female participation in
                 income-earning activities and (ii) efforts to improve access to reproductive health
                 services. Intensifying efforts to improve outcomes in HIV prevention is likely to
                 be critical over the medium term. Life expectancy and incidence of disease are
                 critical elements for Lesotho’s future.

194. Achieving a transformation in the drivers of growth will take time. In the short term, it
will be necessary to strengthen the social-protection system:

         Reforming social protection: A social protection reform is needed because of the
          magnitude and depth of poverty in Lesotho, stagnation in the labor market, and the
          urgency to arrest the rise of inequality in the short run. The priorities for the reform
          include improving targeting accuracy and coverage of targeted programs, improving
          administration systems, and harmonizing fragmented programs.

6.4       IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRIORITY INTERVENTIONS

195. Most of the issues raised in the report have been identified by the National Strategic
Development Plan and previous poverty-reduction strategic papers. In addition, some
sectorial strategies and specific programs address these issues. But the fact that strategies,
policies, and programs have been in place to address what are still identified as priority
challenges suggests they have not been fully effective and raises some questions on
implementation potential. Despite the low capacity of public services, it is possible to implement
the package of priority interventions outlined in this report.

196. Figure 77 provides a broad assessment of implementation potential across the six
priority areas—it considers both capacity and political consensus. Overall, reforming social
protection and raising the productivity of smallholders have the best potential for implementation
in the short run. By contrast, public-sector modernization and interventions to support an export-
oriented private sector have the lowest implementation potential. This reflects capacity and
political consensus. In areas like human capital development, some political consensus exists to
support priority interventions, but achieving results can be difficult and some capacity limitations
will need to be overcome.

       ANNEX 1: NON-INCOME DIMENSIONS OF POVERTY IN
       LESOTHO—VALIDATION EXERCISE
197. Estimates suggest that poverty has been stagnant in Lesotho, and inequality has
increased. However, lack of comparable and reliable data on consumption and income creates a
need to verify these findings by examining non-income dimensions of poverty. This section
examines a number of non-monetary measures of well-being to look for corroborating evidence
of the poverty trends found in the observed consumption aggregate in FY2002/03 and the
imputed consumption aggregate in FY2010/11. Specifically, we analyzed household asset
ownership, access to education, and basic services.

Asset ownership
198. The data do not show gains in ownership of traditional assets across the population,
supporting the possible stagnation in poverty. Ownership of durable goods is often a proxy for
households’ welfare. We construct a simple indicator summarizing durables ownership by
adding up a number of dummy variables (27) for whether a household owns each comparable
item listed in the two surveys. Figure 78 illustrates a large improvement in asset ownership along
the entire distribution of the asset index. To a large extent, however, the durable goods that
showed the largest increase over time are expensive electronics—TVs, video players, satellite
dishes, electric stoves, solar systems, etc. Cheap durable goods—fans, bikes, irons, sewing
machines, etc.—remain the same or even show small declines. One important exception is
represented by cell phones: the share of households reporting owning at least one cell phone
increased fivefold from 12.8 percent to more than 71 percent. As Allwine et al. (2013) argue,
there was a substantial decline in cell phones charges because of a rapid expansion of cell phone
networks. If a cell phone was a luxury good in 2003, it certainly was not seven years later.
Breaking down the set of durable goods into sub-groups of “traditional” and “high-tech” assets,
the gains observed in the global index show up only in the “high-tech” index, not in the
“traditional” one. In other words, the welfare improvement suggested by the global index
appears to be mainly driven by access to expensive “high-tech” goods, mostly cell phones.
199. Along the same lines, Figure 79 shows the distribution of a farm assets indicator,
which includes ownership of livestock (cattle, poultry, horse, pigs) and farm implements
(tractor, plough, wheel barrow, scotch cart, etc.). Among households running a farm,53
ownership of farm assets deteriorated between FY2002/03 and FY2010/11, particularly among
households in the middle of the distribution—between the 20th and the 80th percentile.

 Access to Education
 200. Access to basic education has improved, but access to the higher education did not
 change. Measured by the literacy rate among the population aged 15 and over, access to basic
 education improved between FY2002/3 and FY 2010/11, and it did so along the entire
 distribution of consumption, especially among the poor and in rural areas (Figure 80). Due to the
 introduction of free primary education in 2000, the share of individuals aged 15 and over with no
 education decreased and those who completed primary education increased. However, those with
 a secondary education fell 2 percentage points, and the upper part of the education distribution
 showed no major changes (Figure 81).

 Access to services
 201. Access to electricity has somewhat improved, but overcrowding has deteriorated. A
 second set of indicators concerns access to services and the number of persons per occupied

                                                                        90
 room, a measure of overcrowding. In Lesotho, the percentage of households reporting access to
 electricity is still very low—but it did improve after FY2002/03 (Figure 82). In FY2010/11,
 about 14 percent of the households had access to electricity—about 50 percent in urban areas and
 20 percent among the non-poor. Although the major improvements were observed among the
 poor and in rural areas, these groups still lagged.
 202. The number of persons per occupied room can foster the spread of infectious
 diseases, produce negative psychological effects like frustration and anxiety, and lead to
 more violence due, for example, to increased physical contact and lack of sleep. On average,
 there were more than 2 persons per occupied room in 2003, and conditions deteriorated over the
 next seven years, reaching an average of 3.7 persons per room (Figure 83).

 203. Conclusion: Non-income analysis generally does not contradict the partly imputed
 income analysis. Assets ownership remained the same between FY2002/03 and FY2010/11, with
 an exception of the introduction of cell phones. Access has improved for basic education and
 electricity. However, access has not changed for secondary and higher education; rates of
 housing and overcrowding have increased. There were some improvements in labor market
 indicators, but lack of income data means we cannot validate improvements in productivity.
 204. We analyze the poverty and associated distributional changes using the economic
 growth projections in Table 21. The projections suggest further deterioration in manufacturing,
 contrasted with the boom in trade and other services.

reduced pace of expansion) the observed changes between FY2002/03 and FY2010/11 in
completed primary, lower, upper, and post-secondary education. We assume that the share
of the working-age population with no or only primary schooling falls by 8 percentage points,
with the share of individuals with upper and post-secondary education expanding accordingly
(Table 23).

207. During the 2000s, households’ consumption showed significantly lower growth rates
than GDP. In simulations, we assume the similar pattern will continue. However, the exact
elasticity between GDP and private consumption is unclear. We assume three very different
elasticities of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 to estimate the ranges for poverty changes in the baseline scenario.
Thus, changes in poverty are dependent on consumption growth rates.

      ANNEX 2: GENDER
I.     Legal Rights

208. Vested with full legal capacity and liberated from male guardianship, adult Basotho
women are now, in theory, better equipped to play more productive and active roles as
economic and social agents. Lesotho’s Constitution provides for equality and justice to
males and females. It also mandates fair wages and equal remuneration for work of equal
value—in particular; women are guaranteed conditions of work, including pension or
retirement benefits that are not inferior to those given to men. The current law on land matters is
gender neutral in its provisions. The 2006 Legal Capacity of Married Persons (LCMP) Act, along
with other progressive legislation, laid the groundwork for a gender-responsive legal framework
that protects women’s rights and provided for the repeal of all customary and civil laws giving a
husband legal authority over his wife or her property. The ability that this law gives women to
engage in economic transactions in the absence of their husbands is particularly significant in a
country where husbands and wives are often separated due to migration.

209. However, women have yet to experience the full potential LCMP benefits because of
inadequate implementation, which has been complicated by the dual legal system, slow-
changing social attitudes, the financial costs associated with seeking redress for violation of
women’s new rights, and women’s lack of awareness of these rights. So far, efforts to
improve women’s awareness of their rights have included training and outreach events provided
by the Millennium Challenge Account-Lesotho (World Bank, 2010). This effort has also worked
to create a federation of Lesotho women entrepreneurs, allowing women to come together and
share experiences. Awareness of the LCMP rights needs to be built not only amongst women
themselves but also amongst other actors who may still be impeding women by following the
discriminatory business practices of the past. For example, it is thought that Banks in Lesotho
often still request a husband’s approval before granting credit to businesswomen. The issue of
implementation is complicated by the fact that the LCMP Act resulted from a top-down
legislative process, which has taken place in a cultural environment still not entirely supportive
of women’s empowerment (World Bank, 2010). While this is true, it should be noted that some
measures of women’s empowerment appear to be better in Lesotho than in many neighboring
countries. For example, compared to most peer countries, a smaller percentage of women in
Lesotho report acceptance of wife beating or not being involved in key decisions on their own
health care or on major household purchases.

II.    HIV

Overview:
   Lesotho has the 2nd highest HIV prevalence in the world.
   One of the key channels of transmission of HIV in Lesotho is multiple and concurrent
      partnerships (MCPs), which are much more common in Lesotho than in sub-Saharan
      Africa as a whole.
   Women are more likely to be infected, but the gender gap is comparable to many similar
      countries in sub-Saharan Africa.


                                                94
        Women are more likely to take on caring responsibilities for HIV patients in their
         families.
        Women’s lower social status and access to economic opportunities may play a role in
         their greater vulnerability to HIV, giving them a less than equal say in sexual decision-
         making and making them economically dependent on men, including not only their
         husbands but also the non-spousal sexual partners that are common due to their own and
         their husbands’ migration.
        Condom use is low in MCPs, especially for women.

A closer look

210. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has been declared a national disaster by the Government
and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Lesotho (AFDB, 2005). In 2013,
Lesotho’s prevalence rate of 23 percent was the second highest in the world (after Swaziland). In
Lesotho as in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, women are more vulnerable than men to
HIV/AIDS (Figure 84). Of greater concern, the gender disparity in prevalence is even larger
among young people (Figure 85). However, the male to female prevalence ratios in Lesotho are
similar to those of many comparable countries. As in other countries, women’s greater
vulnerability to HIV appears to be related to a variety of cultural and economic factors,
underpinned by unequal power relations between men and women, with women (especially
young women) having less access to various economic assets and being more likely to engage in
transactional sex and to experience sexual violence.

211. The unequal status of women in Lesotho is illustrated by the fact that 37 percent of
women (and 55 percent of the poorest women) responded that a husband is justified in
beating his wife for at least one of five reasons listed in the 2009 DHS survey. However, this
is lower than for many similar countries (Figure 86) and represents a sharp reduction from 48
percent in 2004.54 In addition, only 49 percent of the poorest women (and 52 percent of all
women aged 15-49) believe that a woman is justified in refusing to have sex with her husband if
she knows he has sex with other women.

54
   The five reasons included in the DHS are: she burns the food; she argues with her husband; she goes out without
telling her husband; she neglects the children; or she refuses to have sexual intercourse with her husband.

212. The gaps in HIV knowledge appear to be much greater between rich and poor than
between women and men, but social attitudes clearly place women in a vulnerable position
in relationships and restrict the degree to which they can put their knowledge into practice.
Overall, 81 percent of women and 72 percent of men know that using condoms and limiting
sexual intercourse to one uninfected partner can prevent HIV. This moderate gender gap
disappears for younger age cohorts: 74 percent of women compared to 76 percent of men aged
15-19. There are larger differences among wealth quintiles, with only 68 percent of the poorest
women, compared to 87 percent of the richest, knowing that using condoms and limiting sexual
intercourse to one uninfected partner can prevent HIV. Knowledge of mother to child
transmission (MTCT) of HIV appears to be slightly lower. Only 61 percent of the poorest
women, compared to 78 percent of the richest women, know that HIV can be transmitted by
breastfeeding and that the risk of MTCT can be reduced by the mother taking special drugs
during pregnancy (ICF Macro, 2010). Despite women’s knowledge of HIV prevention, only 49
percent of the poorest women (and 52 percent of all women aged 15-49) believe that a woman is
justified in refusing to have sex with her husband if she knows he has sex with other women.
This suggests that even with improved knowledge, women may still be in a more vulnerable
position because of deep-rooted social attitudes. In another example of the inadequacy of
knowledge by itself as a protective mechanism, one study of garment factory workers in Lesotho
showed that greater knowledge of HIV did not translate into safer sexual practices, except for
condom use (Khobotlo at al, 2009).
213. There is a relationship between women’s level of economic empowerment and their
vulnerability to HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Research suggests that
women are more likely to engage in risky sex (transactional sex, or multiple and concurrent
partnerships) when they lack economic opportunities or experience a negative economic shock.
For example, a four-month study by de Walque et al (2014) shows that non-sex worker women
who experienced a negative shock to their households’ food security were 36 percent more likely
to test positive for an STI than those women who did not experience such a shock. The impact on
the risk of testing positive for an STI was even greater for women with the lowest social status,
who have fewer alternative sources of economic support. This evidence points to the importance
of ensuring that women are sufficiently empowered to act as independent economic agents—for
example, through effective implementation of the legal rights provided in the LCMP Act. This is
especially important in a country where women are often separated from their husbands due to
migration.

214. Migration has played a key role in the spread of HIV in Lesotho, and the way this
has played out has an explicit gender angle. Migration of a single partner breaks up the
household and increases the risk of either partner having multiple and concurrent partnerships
(MCPs). Indeed, 24 percent of people in Lesotho are estimated to be involved in MCPs
(compared to an average of 10 percent for the region) and multiple sexual relationships before
and during marriage are thought to be a key factor in the high prevalence of HIV in Lesotho
(Khobotlo at al, 2009). Condom use for people with multiple partners is only 38 percent for
women and 51 percent for men (ICF Macro, 2010). Before the end of the 1990s, the migration of
large numbers of men to work in South African mines was thought to play a significant role in
the spread of HIV in Lesotho. Interestingly, we see a steep fall in the HIV incidence rate with the
decreasing labor intensiveness of the mines and consequent rapid drop in the proportion of
Lesotho’s adult population employed by South Africa’s mines (Figure 87). The small increase in
incidence that we see in the early 2000s may be related to changes in employee regulations,
which allowed miners to return home more frequently. This could have aided to spread of the
disease if either the miners or their spouses had MCPs (Khobotlo at al., 2009).

215. In more recent years, migration has caused partners to be separated again as
women migrate to urban areas to work in garment factories. In 2008, around 75 percent of
the employees in Lesotho’s garment factories were estimated to be migrant workers (Khobotlo at
al, 2009). However, it is thought that the most at risk group among garment factory workers are
single females aged between 25 and 39. Overall, 44 percent of female and 36 percent of male
garment workers tested positive for HIV in 2007, higher than the overall rates for all females and
all males (Khobotlo at al, 2009).

216. Finally, women are not only disproportionately affected in terms of being infected
with HIV, but are also more likely to take on the role of primary care provider for the sick
(Newman et al, 2011).

III.     Maternal Health

Overview:
   The latest estimates suggest that maternal mortality is even more critical in Lesotho than
      in many peer countries.
   Lesotho’s progress on maternal mortality appears uneven and actually reversed since the
      early 1990s.
   Access to quality medical care appears to be the main constraint to women’s maternal
      health, with large gaps in access between the rich and poor.
   The main factors impeding access are concerns about the quality of care, the availability
      of drugs and costs, including those associated with transport and distance to the nearest
      health facility.
   Total and adolescent fertility rates do not appear to be as critical an issue as they are in
      peer countries. As with most indicators in Lesotho, significant gaps exist between rich
      and poor.

A closer look

217. The need to improve women’s access to quality health care is evident in a very high
maternal mortality rate. The latest modelled estimates from the World Bank and the UN
suggest a maternal mortality rate of 490 deaths per 100,000 live births, an improvement from
540 in 2010. However, charting Lesotho along with a range of peer countries shows that its
performance is toward the poorer end of the spectrum (Figure 88).55 Moreover, looking at the
trend over the last 15 years, we can see that progress has not been even and that the country
actually has a higher rate of maternal mortality today than it did in 1990 (Figure 89). It is clear
from this trend that Lesotho will not even get close to its MDG target of 90 deaths per 100,000
live births by 2015.

per 100,000 live births)                                        100,000 live births) in Lesotho, actual and MDG

  It should be noted that these figures are modelled estimates from the UN and World Bank. The latest DHS figures
(2009) estimate a far higher rate of 1,200 deaths per 100,000 live births. However, this represents an unusually large
increase from the estimate of 762 in the 2004 DHS, causing us to question the figures’ accuracy.

                                                         98
218. Prenatal care appears to be fairly universal, yet the quality appears to be lacking for
the poorest women (Figure 90). Around 92 percent of all women and 87 percent of the poorest
women received at least one session before pregnancy. However, only 35 percent of the poorest
women took an iron tablet during their last pregnancy (compared to 61 percent of the richest):
overall, 31 percent of pregnant women were classified as anemic (ICF Macro, 2010). In addition,
only 54 percent of the poorest women reported having had urine samples taken during their
prenatal sessions, compared to 82 percent of the richest women (ICF Macro, 2010). Finally, only
48 percent of the poorest women (compared to 70 of the richest) received at least two tetanus
toxoid injections during their last pregnancy (ICF Macro, 2010).

across wealth quintile (1= poorest, 5= richest)      facility, by wealth quintile (1= poorest, 5= richest)

219. For care delivered at the time of the birth, there are even larger gaps between rich
and poor women (Figure 91). While 59 percent of women delivered in a health facility, only 32
percent of the poorest women did so, with the majority of this group of women (66 percent)
delivering at home. Given this information, it is not surprising that the most common person to
assist the poorest women with births is a relative (39 percent), with midwives delivering only 31
percent of their births, compared to 68 percent for the richest women (ICF Macro, 2010).

220. Postnatal care is also deficient. Sixty percent of the poorest women receiving no post
natal checkup at all (compared to 20 percent of the richest women) and only 2 percent receiving
a checkup within the recommended period of one hour after the birth (ICF Macro, 2010).

221. In addition to inadequate access to quality health care, high maternal mortality
rates are related to high fertility rates that can be traced back to low contraceptive use and
traditional attitudes. Lesotho appears to be performing better in terms of fertility, adolescent
fertility, and contraceptive use than many comparable countries. Therefore, the priority for
improving maternal health in Lesotho may lie with improving access to quality medical care.

222. With 3.1 births per woman, the total fertility rate in Lesotho is significantly lower
than the average for sub-Saharan African countries (5.1) and countries with a similar GDP
per capita, such as Cameroon (4.9), Senegal (5.0), and Kenya (4.5). However, the overall
figure for Lesotho masks important differences by wealth quintile. The total fertility rate for the

                                                    99
poorest wealth quintile (5.9) is considerably higher than that for the richest quintile (2.0) (Figure
92). The figure for the poorest quintile represents an increase from the 5.2 reported in the
previous DHS in 2004. The figure for the richest quintile did not change, and there was an
improvement in from 3.4 to 2.5 for the second richest quintile. This suggests that more efforts
need to be directed at the poorest women.

223. Adolescent fertility remains stubbornly high at 89 births per 1,000 women ages 15-
19; this is particularly critical because births to this age group carry a higher risk of
maternal mortality.56 While other countries have made significant inroads, Lesotho has seen no
progress reducing this figure over the past 20 years (Figure 93). As with total fertility, significant
differences exist by wealth quintile: 42 percent of the poorest women 20-24 years old gave birth
before reaching 18, compared to only 16 percent of women in the richest quintile (ICF Macro,
2010). Moreover, early childbearing and the gap between rich and poor both appear to be
increasing. However, Lesotho still has a lower adolescent fertility rate than many comparable
countries (Figure 94), with a higher median age at which women first give birth and a lower
proportion of 25-49 year olds who had given birth before they reached the age of 18 (Figure 95).

224. Contraceptive use in Lesotho has increased markedly in recent years, yet there are
significant disparities by wealth and a great deal of unmet demand. The percentage of
women (ages 15-49) who used some form of modern contraception increased from 37 percent in
2005 to 47 percent in 2009. This compares to an average of around 24 percent across all sub-
Saharan African countries (Figure 96). However, there are significant differences by wealth
quintile, with only 19 percent of those in the poorest quintile using some method, compared to 61
percent of women in the richest quintile. Unsurprisingly, there is a very high level of unmet need
for contraception among the poor, with 37 percent of the poorest women reporting an unmet
need, compared to 13 percent of women in the richest quintile (ICF Macro, 2010). Overall, more
than 60 percent of women ages 15-49 who were not using contraceptives at the time of the most
recent DHS responded that they intended to start using them in the future. This data suggests
significant room for expanding access to contraceptives in Lesotho. Unfortunately, the latest
DHS survey did not ask women why they did not intend to use contraceptives. Asking this
question in the future could help highlight the barriers (cultural, cost, access to supply, etc.) that
are preventing those not already using contraceptives from doing so.

     ANNEX 3: DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND RESULTS OF
     PRIORITIZATION PROCESS
225. To define priority interventions, each of 26 challenges identified in this note was
assessed against a set of five criteria shown in Box 5 of Chapter 6. For each challenge, all the
criteria were scored on a scale of 1-3—low to high in terms of importance of priority. The result
was a raw score that was converted into a rank. Where two challenges received the same raw
score, they were given a common ranking—this was the case across many of the challenges.
Table 24 summarizes the results of the desk prioritization assessment. Overall, the analysis
resulted in converting the 26 challenges to 14 ranked sets of priorities. Those that achieved a
ranking among the top three were marked as “highest” priority; those ranked in the range of four
to five were marked as “high” priority; and those ranked six to eight were marked as “secondary”
priority.57 Those marked ‘highest’ and ‘high’ priority are highlighted and listed in Table 25. This
results in a prioritization of 14 of the 26 challenges identified.

226. To give a sense of the reasons why other challenges were identified as among the top
priorities, Table 26 provides some very brief explanations. In most cases, it came down to
particularly long pathways to impacting the twin goals (both in terms of time and the degree to
which they were removed from other challenges and/or several stages downstream) and the
degree to which a strong intervention to address the challenge was already in place. In addition,
many of the challenges, particularly in the pathway of job-creating growth, were expected to
have a limited impact on elimination of extreme poverty because the nature of the challenge
often is disconnected from the extreme poor. Finally, several potentially important challenges
lacked sufficiently strong supporting evidence.

227. Finally, Table 28 maps the high priority challenges to the set of three priority
interventions shown in of Chapter 6. In some cases, challenges mapped to more than one
intervention.




57
  This rating of “highest,” “high,” and “secondary” was chosen to highlight the fact that none of these challenges
should be considered low priority. By definition, the analysis in this note was designed to identify the most
important challenges facing the country in addressing the twin goals. Therefore, all the challenges identified here
should be considered important.

    ANNEX 5: ASSESSMENT OF KEY KNOWLEDGE GAPS
230. Throughout the report, key knowledge gaps have been identified. These are topics
that are critical to understanding the challenges facing Lesotho but where we have limited
quantitative and qualitative evidence to enable taking a clear position on the degree to which the
issue is a priority and/or on the interventions required to address it. It can be viewed as a set of
research priorities for the Government, development partners, academics, and research
institutions over the next few years.

Knowledge gap                       Description
Limited understanding of the        There are important discrepancies between the income from national accounts
growth-poverty link                 and consumption from the household survey. Due to the poor quality of data, a
                                    deeper analysis cannot be made on the growth-poverty link. There is a need to
                                    strengthen the household survey methodology.
Skills premium/New labor force      A better measure of skill shortage is the skills premium employers are willing to
survey                              offer in specific industries. To do such analysis a strong labor force survey is
                                    needed. The last labor force survey in Lesotho was done in 2008. A new
                                    comprehensive labor force survey is needed to do a more profound analysis of
                                    the labor market.
Energy                              Lesotho has a good understanding of its power needs but relatively limited
                                    information at the moment on how to address this issue. Currently, a feasibility
                                    study is being conducted on a power generation plant linked to the Lesotho
                                    Highlands Water Project Phase 2. However, there are no feasibility studies on
                                    solar generation plants.
Agriculture sector and irrigation   The data and information on the agriculture sector as well as irrigation is dated.
                                    It would be particularly useful to have gender disaggregated data on
                                    smallholder’s access to inputs (land, labor, fertilizer, extension services, etc) and
                                    agricultural yields. This would allow an analysis of gender specific constraints
                                    to agricultural productivity, in the style of the World Bank and One
                                    Foundation’s Levelling the Field Report (2014).

                                    At the heart of agriculture’s inability to make a strong contribution to poverty
                                    reduction and shared prosperity is the very low rate of productivity growth in
                                    the sector, one of the lowest in Africa. It is clear that this is due to many factors,
                                    including low uptake of modern production technologies (embodied in inputs),
                                    low labor productivity, low irrigation use, land degradation, and others. But
                                    what is lacking is good analysis of what conditions and policies underlie these
                                    factors, and clear recommendations on how these could be addressed. One tool
                                    for helping to fill this gap would be an agricultural public expenditure review,
                                    which would identify whether current spending patterns correspond to the major
                                    problems. While most of these problems will ultimately need to be addressed by
                                    on-farm private investment, smart public spending is needed to create the
                                    enabling environment. Another important knowledge gap is what are the real
                                    opportunity costs (e.g., in terms of loss of net foreign exchange) of the strong
                                    policy focus on encouraging production of staple food crops at the expense of
                                    other products in which Lesotho may have a comparative advantage. This gap
                                    could be filled by a good analytical study of domestic resource costs of
                                    production of different products. Both of these kinds of studies would produce
                                    information that would be key to deciding on spending and policy priorities.
Informal economy                    There is very little information on the informal sector of the economy outside
                                    subsistence agriculture. Labor market data comes infrequently and only
                                    provides a very broad snapshot of this part of the economy. It will be important
                                    to analyze key issues in more detail—what is the nature of the sector, what are

                                                         113
                                 the constraints to formality, to what degree the formal and informal sector act as
                                 substitutes or complements?
Analysis of the private sector   Identifying the incentives to develop the private sector will require a much
                                 deeper analysis. How big is it? How is it structured (firm size, sectors,
                                 formal/informal)? How much is it dependent on government contracts? This
                                 analysis will help identify specific opportunities that may be available given
                                 Lesotho’s location and endowments.
Childhood malnutrition           Childhood malnutrition is an important issue in Lesotho. Despite several
                                 government interventions, it still remains a lingering issue. Given the potential
                                 importance on long-term outcomes, further research on this issue is needed.
Climate change impact            Currently, there is no climate change strategy. Understanding of how climate
                                 change may affect vulnerable rural communities is limited, along with the
                                 implications this may have on migration and urbanization.
Brain drain and migration        There is very limited information on income on the household survey. Also,
                                 there is no information on migrants. A comprehensive household survey, which
                                 has an income and consumption module as well as social and economic
                                 characteristics of migrants is needed. This will allow seeing whether remittances
                                 may have created Dutch-disease type effects in the country or other effects on
                                 human capital formation. For instance, a large migrant population may also
                                 affect school decisions and the behaviour of children left behind. Also, there is
                                 only dated and anecdotal evidence on the brain drain. Further research on this
                                 issue is needed.

   ANNEX 6: ASSESSMENT OF DATA AVAILABILITY AND
   GAPS
231. The table below provides a brief overview of data availability and quality in
Lesotho, as identified during the process of carrying out the SCD analysis.

Broad area                 Assessment of data availability and quality
Macroeconomic              National accounts are reported on annual basis. They have some important gaps,
                           such as in distinguishing between public and private investment. Central Bank of
                           Lesotho provides monthly financial data; BoS publishes quarterly reports on the
                           performance of manufacturing with a nine-month lag; BoS publishes annual crop
                           reports with a year lag; CBL produces monthly economic reviews with a three-
                           month lag. The quality seems good.
Fiscal and debt            LRA publishes annual data on tax collection. MoF publishes the budget every year.
                           Financial statements are not published. CBL publishes fiscal balances as part of its
                           annual report. Fiscal data usually available upon request. The quality is poor.
Employment                 Very weak; last labor force survey was published in 2008. Key labor data are
                           monitored through the quarterly Continuous Multi-purpose Survey, but results have
                           not been published since the last quarter of FY2011/12; data quality may also be an
                           issue (e.g. unemployment figures don’t match those in the labor force survey).
Poverty and social         No regular reporting—only available following major surveys (2003 and 2010).
                           Data quality on the most recent survey is questionable, particularly in the
                           consumption module. A survey to survey imputation method was used to restore
                           the comparability of consumption data and poverty estimates between the
                           FY2002/03 HBS and the FY2010/11 CMS/HBS because the questionnaire design
                           and survey logistics changed significantly in the latter round.
Industry, private sector   Very weak—no industrial census or other firm-level data available; trade data
                           sufficient.
Environmental              Very limited data.
