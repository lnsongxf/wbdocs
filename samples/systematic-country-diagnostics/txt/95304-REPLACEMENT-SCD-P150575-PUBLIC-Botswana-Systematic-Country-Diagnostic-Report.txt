 Executive Summary
 Introduction
 Botswana has been one of the world’s fastest growing economies over the past 50 years, allowing the country
 to move from being among the poorest to upper middle income status – this has had the effect of pulling the
 majority of the population out of poverty. At the same time, many Batswana are still poor, inequality is among
 the highest in the world, and human development outcomes are far below the norms for an upper middle
 income country. Moreover, the country remains reliant on a diamonds and public sector driven model. This
 makes it vulnerable both to short term shocks and structural changes.

 The future will be more challenging. Diamond revenues will decline in the medium term. This will raise fiscal
 and external vulnerabilities; and increasing environmental risks will put even more pressure on a fragile
 resource base. While Botswana is rightly praised for its management of resource wealth, it is apparent that
 the high levels of investment by government (in health, education, and infrastructure) are not delivering
 quality outcomes, making it increasingly difficult to meet the objectives of growth, diversification, and
 poverty elimination. Indeed, some of the foundations which drove the development success of Botswana
 over the past half century are being eroded or face risks.

 In this context, this Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is intended to assess the priorities for Botswana to
 make rapid progress in achieving the objectives of: i) elimination of extreme poverty on a sustainable basis;
 and ii) ensuring shared prosperity by improving the welfare of the less-well-off in the country. It includes
 individual chapters analyzing the opportunities and challenges to meeting these objectives with respect to:
 growth; inclusiveness; and sustainability. The SCD concludes with a prioritization of the key challenges.

 Poverty declining rapidly but low job creation keeps inequality extremely high
 Poverty has fallen sharply, with the national poverty rate down from 30.6 percent in 2003 to 19.4 percent in
 2010 and extreme poverty now below 14 percent. While nearly all spatial and demographic groups
 experienced improvements, growth was strongly pro-poor over the past decade. The largest declines in
 poverty were in rural areas (where it fell by almost 21 percentage points), in the regions furthest from
 Gaborone, and among the elderly, women, and children. Consumption growth among the bottom 40 percent
 far outstripped that of the top income deciles.

 But poverty is still high in rural areas, remote communities, and in households headed by females and by
 those with low levels of education. Most notably, poverty is concentrated among children and youth, which
 has important implications for inclusion and inter-generational transmission of poverty. Moreover, while
 many have escaped poverty and have progressed through the income ranks, there are still a large number of
 people just marginally above the poverty line and at risk of falling back into poverty. This is particularly a risk
 for smallholder households in rural areas.

 High levels of poverty in Botswana are tied closely to the country’s extraordinarily high inequality, which has
 restricted the extent to which growth contributed to poverty reduction. Inequality has fallen over the last
 decade, with the national Gini coefficient (of per capita consumption) down from 64.7 to 60.5. But this still
 leaves Botswana among the most unequal societies in the world. Declining inequality has been driven mainly
 by substantial regional convergence – inequality in Botswana is no longer simply a spatial story, but instead
 is explained primarily by within-group differences, most importantly by access to productive livelihoods.
 Indeed, the most important driver of poverty and inequality reduction has been employment, although most
 of this has come through heavily subsidized smallholder agriculture.


                                                                                                                  vi

Building upon the poverty reduction efforts of the past, Botswana has a unique opportunity to eliminate
extreme poverty and reduce inequality. To achieve this will require a broad set of integrated measures
including the deepening of inclusive growth and improving the targeting and efficiency of social protection
spending. Inclusiveness will require broad-based job creation, enhancing productivity, and changing the
structure of growth. Effectively, this will require a fundamental shift in Botswana’s growth model, from one
dependent on extractives and the public sector to one based on a diversified, competitive private sector.

Growth: traditional drivers waning; need for jobs-intensive, export-oriented, private sector-driven model
Botswana’s traditional growth model has involved diamond revenues being channeled through the
government, with subsequent high investment in infrastructure, health, and education. The model has served
Botswana well, delivering sustained, high growth over many decades (with growth still robust in the 5-6
percent range) but it also has significant drawbacks. Most notably this model has been poor in generating
jobs, contributing to high inequalities. It has also created a strong dependence on the state, both as the main
investor and employer in the economy. Indeed, the formal private sector created just one job for every 6 new
entrants to the labor market over the past decade, and the non-farm, informal sector remains small and
lacking dynamism.

Botswana has achieved substantial diversification over the past decade, with the services sector and
household consumption becoming the largest contributors to GDP. But the sustainability of diversification
and of growth is of concern for three reasons. First, maintaining the pace of consumption growth will become
increasingly difficult in an environment of weak job creation, slow wage growth, and growing household debt.
Second, growth through public investment-led capital deepening will continue to be constrained by fiscal
tightening, low productivity, and poor returns on public investment. Finally, failure to diversify exports will
heighten the risk of external imbalance, which will seriously restrain growth, perhaps even triggering a GDP
contraction. On a positive note, demographics should offer a boost to growth in the medium term, with the
dependency ratio expected to fall by 40 percent between 2000 and 2040. Moreover, while total factor
productivity has been a drag on growth over the past 15 years, evidence suggests non-mining (labor)
productivity, particularly in the services sector, is increasingly contributing positively to growth.

Diversification in the mining sector offers potential to support external and fiscal balances, but it is not the
solution to sustainable poverty reduction due to its limited job creation potential. Instead, what is required

intensive services sectors (like nature-based tourism and some high value-added business services) where
Botswana can exploit global or regional comparative advantage. With a small domestic economy, successful
development of the private sector will depend crucially on export markets. This requires improving the
integration of Botswana’s firms into regional value chains which, in turn, requires addressing the trade policy
and trade facilitation barriers that regional trade and investment.

Delivering a new growth model for Botswana will require the private sector to take the lead in investing and
developing competitive, outward-oriented firms. At the moment, while entrepreneurs are emerging, the
private sector remains shallow. Encouraging entrepreneurs to invest in export-oriented activities will require
reforming the existing inward-looking investment environment which raises the relative returns to focusing
on domestic non-tradables and government contracts. It will also require addressing the high costs of
operating in Botswana. Progress is being made on many aspects of the ‘Doing Business’ agenda, but firms
remain weakly competitive. Improving productivity through investment in workforce development (skills,
training, and work ethic) and the adoption of technology will be critical to developing more competitive firms.
So too will be improving connectivity by improving the trade facilitation environment (promoting value chain
integration), improving air transport links, and improving the quality and cost of ICT infrastructure. It may
also require re-focusing industrial policy on sectors where Botswana’s comparative disadvantages are less
binding, including modern commercial services and tourism.

Inclusion: despite broad and well-intentioned investment, barriers remain
But growth alone, even jobs-intensive, broad-based growth, is not sufficient to eliminate poverty and reduce
inequalities. Moreover, wider notions of human development, encompassing health, human capital,
freedom, and voice are all critical to individual well-being, and contribute to ensuring the sustainability of
economic gains. Botswana has invested over decades to provide widespread and equitable access to basic
services, including health, education, and infrastructure. This has been costly given the country’s dispersed
population. Results are mixed – in health and education broadly equitable coverage has been achieved; in
basic services, especially sanitation and electricity, major gaps (especially urban-rural) remain. Across the
board, however, quality and consistency remain a problem, raising barriers to individuals achieving
productive, sustainable livelihoods, particularly in poor households and (still) in rural areas.

As a result of heavy and sustained investment in ARVs and other treatment programs, Botswana has turned
the corner on HIV/AIDS. However, it still has a major impact on households and on the healthcare system,
contributing to poor outcomes in other areas, like maternal and child health and some non-communicable
diseases, and limiting the ability of women (especially as single head of households) to engage in productive
                                                                                                                 viii

employment. Poor child nutrition represents a serious threat to inclusion, given its long term impacts on
health and cognitive abilities. Access to basic infrastructure still suffers from major rural-urban gaps, with just
42 percent of rural households having access to proper sanitation and 22 percent to electricity. Access to
land is generally equitable, but becoming an increasing problem (at the individual and municipal level) in the
context of rapid urbanization and inflexible land ownership structures.

 Childhood malnutrition far in excess of global peers, with   Rural access to sanitation and electricity remains very
 long-term implications: stunting rates                       limited: share of households with access (2010)




Despite huge public investment in education (on average close to 8.5 percent of GDP) and generally equitable
access, outcomes are not only unequal, but also weak across the board. Moreover, changing demographics,
linked to declining infant and child mortality, is putting pressure on the secondary education system. The
secondary education system in particular is failing to equip young Batswana with the skills that are needed
for them to contribute productively to firms and to society. This failure of the education system, combined
with a labor market that has failed to create employment opportunities (particularly for women), increasingly
restricts the long-term prospects for youth. Tertiary education remains a key route to quality employment,
but enrolment growth has been slow and tertiary and vocational systems align poorly with labor market
needs. Poor Batswana, especially in rural areas, still have few formal financial assets, which not only
heightens vulnerability, but hinders their capacity to invest in sustainable livelihoods, for example in
improving farm productivity or in household enterprises.

Social protection systems have been effective in reducing the level and depth of poverty, but they could be
much better targeted to reach poor households, and made much more efficient. They could also be better
linked with other key interventions, including health, education, and active labor market programs. This
would improve both efficiency and effectiveness of delivery and make a major contribution to sustainable
poverty reduction by limiting inter-generational transmission of poverty.

Botswana remains a cohesive society, with a strong democratic and consultative tradition. However, some
groups – most notably women, some ethnic groups, and possibly youth – face limitations on their voice and
participation in society, and especially in the policy environment. Civil society remains overly-reliant on
government, particularly in the context of declining donor funding. Together, these dynamics point to an
environment where the poor and vulnerable are highly dependent not just on the benevolence of a
centralized government, but also on its effectiveness.

Sustainability: resource vulnerability raising challenges for long-term growth and inclusion
Botswana has a long history of effective management in the conversion of natural capital wealth to
investment in productive capital and human capital. It is has been effective in maximizing revenue capture
                                                                                                                  ix
                                                                                                                   ix
    from diamonds and it has invested wisely in infrastructure and human capital. However, there is increasing
    evidence that the quantitative process of wealth conversion is not being matched in qualitative terms –i.e.
    that public investment has not been efficient.

    Natural resources wealth remains the foundation for growth and inclusion in Botswana. But it is also
    constrained, fragile, and open to many competing demands. Understanding the trade-offs involved in various
    development scenarios will be critical to managing resources for both sustainability and effective outcomes.
    Water is the most critical resource in this regard. While substantial investments are being made to increase
    access to water, demand is also rising, perhaps at a faster pace. There is an urgent need to ensure that
    development decisions take into account water resources and their alternative uses, that further sources
    (especially regional) be pursued, that efficient technologies are invested in, and that water pricing adequately
    reflects scarcity and opportunity costs. Similar considerations are relevant in managing energy and
    biodiversity resources.

     schematic of potential water demands                      GDP




    In the context of declining diamonds revenues and SACU revenue vulnerabilities, fiscal prudence and re-
    building fiscal and external buffers will be critical for sustainability. This will require not only broadening the
    tax base, but also consolidating spending, particularly given the continued high fiscal burden from HIV/AIDS.
    Both will be a challenge. In terms of consolidation, reform and downsizing of the public sector will need to
    be part of the answer. Stepping up the pace of outsourcing and privatization will face many political hurdles,
    but it will be critical to achieve these aims and to support private sector development.

    Above all, improving outcomes in Botswana will require a significant reform and modernization of the public
    sector, which is increasingly seen as a source of weakness rather than strength. Poor outcomes in public
    investment have been most visible, but the problems appear to run across the board. Reforms will require
    improvements in planning, procurement, and management processes. They will also require far greater
    attention to monitoring and evaluation. But more than anything, they will require a new approach to
    government – a mindset that focuses on efficiency and accountability. This, in turn, will require
    improvements in capacity (human capital), as well as an adoption of modern technologies and techniques.
    Support for a more effective public service, as well more informed policymaking, requires substantial
    upgrading of statistical capacity to ensure access to more regular, consistent, and comprehensive data.

Priorities for eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity
Botswana faces a broad range of constraints in achieving the transition to this new growth model, and
subsequently in making continued, rapid progress toward eliminating poverty and delivering shared
prosperity. The SCD identifies 30 main challenges organized across the three pathways of: i) establishing an
environment for private sector-led, job-creating growth; ii) ensuring inclusion by strengthening individual and
community assets; and iii) ensuring the sustainability of growth and inclusion through effective management
of resources. A combination of desk assessment and consultation were used to identify the highest priority
challenges, with the most important criteria focused on the impact that addressing these challenges would
have on eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring shared prosperity. This process resulted in identifying 7
broad priority areas for intervention, as shown below:

Overview of identified priority interventions to eliminate extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity




The SCD argues for a fundamental shift to a new growth model; one that creates sufficient, broad-based
employment. This will require the development of a competitive and export-oriented private sector,
including:
     Establishing the incentives to support an export-oriented private sector, including trade, competition,
        and immigration policies that ensure access to competitively priced inputs and skills, and incentives
        to compete in tradable sectors. This will require a rethink of a wide range of trade and industrial
        policies that promote national champions, localization, and ‘citizen empowerment’ through
        protection.
     Improving connectivity: Helping to close Botswana’s connectivity gap – thus increasing market access
        and lowering costs – is critical to competitiveness. This will require a focus on: i) improving national
        and regional trade facilitation to support integration into regional and global value chains; ii)
        improving air connectivity to open up opportunities in key sectors; and iii) improving the speed,
        quality, and cost effectiveness of ICT infrastructure (especially broadband).


                                                                                                              xi

                                                                                                               xi
 But developing a competitive private sector capable of generating broad-based employment will take time.
 The reality is that the process of structural change will take 10-20 years to achieve. During this time a large
 share of the population (at least in rural areas) will still rely on farming. And even for those in the urban
 villages and outside of the agricultural sector, Botswana’s formal labor market is not likely to provide
 sufficient income-earning opportunities for all Batswana. Many of the poor and ‘near-poor’ that fall outside
 the formal labor market will continue to face risks of falling back into poverty. For this reason, there is a need
 to focus on increasing the opportunities and returns to self-employment by raising productivity of
 smallholders and microenterprises. Improving productivity and increasing agricultural incomes is the key to
 reducing vulnerability and developing a more vibrant rural economy. The agenda for raising smallholder
 productivity will focus on establishing the right incentives for smallholders to adopt more appropriate
 technologies and methods to improve yields and mitigate risks and strengthen the extension system. Outside
 of agriculture, interventions will promote a more dynamic microenterprise sector, both in rural and urban
 areas, with a focus not only on entry into self-employment and the SMME sector but improving productivity
 within the sector through capacity building and access to services.

 Developing a new growth model will also require a step-change in the productivity of Botswana’s firms, which
 is dependent on substantial improvements in human capital, including education and health:
       Education: Raising the quality of education, with a specific focus on aligning skills with labor market
         needs will equip Batswana, especially its youth, to participate productively in the economy, whether
         through formal employment or micro-enterprises. The focus will be on increasing the relevance of
         skills and improving intangible skills like communication and work ethic.
       Health: This will focus on the health barriers to skills acquisition and labor market participation, in
         particular childhood malnutrition, and the impact of disease (especially HIV) on female participation
         in income-earning activities. Intensifying efforts to improve outcomes in HIV prevention is likely to
         be critical over the medium term.

 Ensuring sustainable growth of formal commercial activities, sustainable livelihoods, and quality human
 development outcomes in the future will increasingly require focus on infrastructure and policies for water
 and sanitation. None of Botswana’s growth opportunities will be achievable over the long term if sustainable
 sources of water are not made available, if new technologies are not adopted, and if pricing policies are not
 reformed to ensure its efficient use. Moreover, addressing the major gaps in access to sanitation is likely to
 be critical to ensuring improved livelihoods and reducing incidence of disease and malnutrition. Interventions
 in this area are expected to focus on infrastructure development, support for regional integration of water
 resources, adoption of recycling and other technologies, and introduction of policies to ensuring water pricing
 reflects true value (and opportunity costs).

 But even with greater job creation and self-employment, improved human capital, and access to resources,
 a relatively small minority Batswana will fall not be in a position to participate. With a focus on reforming
 social protection, Botswana has a unique opportunity to eliminate extreme poverty within the next 5-7
 years. Among the priorities for the reform of social protection include adopting technologies and processes
 to improve targeting efficiency, consolidating the fragmented programs and introducing a single household-
 level grant as ‘last resort’ protection, introducing conditional interventions to promote behavioral changes,
 and more effectively linking social protection with public works and active labor market programs.

 Finally, none of the priority interventions outlined above will deliver rapid and sustainable progress on the
 twin goals without addressing fundamental enablers, including modernization of the public sector and
 improved management of increasingly-scarce natural resources:
         Public sector modernization for effectiveness and sustainability: Delivering on any of the
                                                                                                                xii
xii
        interventions discussed in this SCD requires a substantial, if not leading, role from the public sector.
        Improving public investment management, project management, and program delivery through
        adopting modern technologies, systems, and processes, and putting in place systematic and
        meaningful processes for monitoring and accountability will be fundamental to addressing the above
        challenges and maintaining sustainability.
       Natural resources management to support sustainable growth and livelihoods: Botswana’s natural
        resources will remain at the heart of the country’s success. But they are highly constrained, fragile,
        and face many competing demands. Putting in place effective systems for planning that take clear
        account of the (often irreversible) implications on critical resources will be critical to maintain
        sustainability over the medium term.

In summary, Botswana has a genuine opportunity to eliminate extreme poverty in the coming years. But the
real challenge will be making this sustainable and, most critically, to reducing the extreme levels of inequality
that still hinder macro level growth and micro level inclusion. This will require a change in Botswana’s growth
model built on an export-looking private sector underpinned by higher skilled, more productive, and more
entrepreneurial individuals, households, and firms. It will also require balancing competing demands for
limited natural resources, particularly water. Underpinning all of this is the imperative for a more modernized
and effective public sector.

1. Setting the scene
1.1.      A global success story, but not shared among all Batswana
Botswana has been among the world’s biggest development success stories of the past half century. One of the
ten poorest countries at independence in 1966, Botswana’s GNI per capita has since grown five times faster than
the global average (Figure 1). Botswana’s success was catalyzed by the discovery of the world’s richest deposits
of diamonds. But it has also been a story of effective governance and economic management, as the country
invested minerals rents in physical capital, human capital, and institutions. To put this into perspective, at
independence Botswana had just 6 kilometers of paved roads, 3 secondary schools, and few health facilities;
only 1.5 percent of the population had completed primary education. Today, there are 7,000 km of paved roads,
more than 300 secondary schools, and 95 percent of the population lives within 8 kilometers of a health facility;
primary education is free and the enrolment rate has reached 90 percent.

But poverty and inequality remain serious challenges. Despite considerable progress, nearly a fifth of Batswana
still live in poverty, with almost 14 percent in extreme poverty1. Moreover, Botswana ranks as one of the most
unequal countries in the world, with a Gini coefficient 60.52. This, in combination with the devastating impacts
of HIV/AIDS (Botswana has the world’s second highest rate of HIV), has contributed to human development
outcomes that are among the lowest in the world for a country at Botswana’s level of development (Figure 2).

Note: Throughout this document, we compare Botswana (abbreviated as BWA in the charts) to a set of ‘peer countries’ (where da ta is
       available) selected based on their having a combination of size, income level, location, and/or other characteristics (e.g. natural
       resource dependent, landlocked, low population density) similar to Botswana. These peer countries are: Chile (CHL); Costa Rica
       (CRI); Kazakhstan (KAZ); Malaysia (MYS); Mauritius (MUS); Namibia (NAM); and South Africa (ZAF). Other countries are highlighted
       in various charts to point out countries with similar results to Botswana or those that are outliers.




1 Estimates by the World Bank (World Bank, 2014) put the national poverty line in 2009/10 at 19.4 percent and the food poverty line (a
definition of extreme poverty) at 13.8 percent, based on data from the 2009/10 Core Welfare Indicators Survey. Both the national poverty
line and the food poverty line are based on the definitions of Statistics Botswana. In addition, the same study estimates the internationally
comparable US$1.25 poverty line (another measure of extreme poverty) to 13.4 percent in Botswana in 2009/10. See chapter 2 for a more
detailed discussion.

                                                                                                                                          1
                                                                                                                                          1
These challenges are well understood. They are reflected, for example, in the government’s Vision 2016, which
aims at “prosperity for all”, with the goals of: poverty eradication; a more equitable distribution of income; and
rapid economic growth and diversification. And they are operationalized in the current National Development
Plan (NDP 10: 2009-2016), whose implementation is organized around four pillars: i) Economy and Employment;
ii) Social Upliftment; iii) Sustainable Environment; and iv) Governance, Safety & Security. They are also not new
challenges. Successive governments have grappled with them, with only limited success. This highlights their
difficulty, and also indicates that success is not likely to come from ‘more of the same’.

1.2.    Preparing for a more challenging future – a framework for asset building
Diamonds are not forever. This is well accepted in Botswana, and indeed the need to promote diversification for
the day when resources run out has been central to the economic development discourse almost since diamond
production first started. While diamonds may not be fully exhausted for another generation, output is already
well past its peak. Thus, preparing for a post-diamonds world is still at the heart of Botswana’s development
challenge. In this respect, progress has been made on diversification. The non-mining sector’s contribution to
value added (in current Pula) has grown from two-thirds to three-quarters over the past decade. As Botswana
seeks to develop a still more diversified, competitive, and inclusive economy, it has a number of assets on which
it can draw, including:
      Minerals diversity: Outside of diamonds, Botswana is a significant producer of copper/nickel (which has
         long been the #2 mineral export), and recent finds of natural gas, uranium, and potentially iron ore have
         potential to contribute substantial export earnings. But the biggest opportunity may lie in coal, where
         Botswana is estimated to have more than 200 billion tons of coal reserves (around two-thirds or Africa’s
         total), although it is not yet proven commercially viable.
      Biodiversity: Botswana’s biodiversity resources, including the recently UNESCO-listed Okavango Delta,
         as well as Chobe and the Kalahari, are at the heart of the successful nature-based tourism industry and
         play an important role in the economic and cultural life of Botswana’s rural communities.
      A history of good governance: Botswana is consistently ranked among the top countries in Africa in
         ratings of governance, which helps ensure an enabling environment to manage effectively the balance
         between growth and redistributive policies.

At the same time, Botswana also faces vulnerabilities on many fronts that risks continued progress toward the
goals of poverty eradication and inclusive growth. Indeed, some of the foundations which drove the
development success of Botswana over the past half century are being eroded or face risks, including:
     Macro-economic and fiscal: Vulnerability arises from heavy reliance on diamonds and SACU customs
        receipts, both of which are volatile and face existential threats. The depletion of diamonds may also
        expose the country to severe external imbalances.
     Social: Improved social indicators have relied on heavy government investment, while the quality of the
        investment has been below par; a sustained growth / fiscal shock could seriously hamper government’s
        ability to continue to support social spending.
     Environmental: Both growth and poverty reduction are at risk from acute shortages of water and energy,
        which threaten agricultural, industrial, and tourism sectors. Climate change is expected to hit Botswana
        particularly hard, with significant impacts on agricultural production and health.
     Institutional: Public sector capacity to plan and implement is perceived increasingly to be a source of
        weakness rather than strength, as evidence by recent problems with major projects like Morupule B,
        SSKI airport, Fengyue Glass, stadiums, and schools. This is a risk in a country that relies so heavily on the
        government for investment and service delivery.

To eliminate rather than just alleviate poverty, particularly in the context of declining resource rents, will require
diversification. But the answer is not to be found simply in a focus on diversification of production and exports

2                                                                                                                   2
per se. Instead, what is needed is for Botswana to be more effective than it has been in the past in converting
its natural resources wealth into productive assets and institutions, for its citizens and its firms, to support the
development of a competitive, inclusive, and resilient private sector led economy. With this, the aims of
economic diversification will be achieved (Box 1). It will also require continued focus on ensuring that all
Batswana, regardless of location, background, and needs have access to quality assets and public services,
including health, education, infrastructure (water, sanitation, electricity, housing), and credit. Finally, and critical
to addressing all the challenges Botswana faces, is the need to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and
accountability of public investment and public service delivery to ensure the sustainability of natural and fiscal
resources and quality of development outcomes.

It is important to recognize that none of this is easy. It is also important to accept Botswana’s reality. It is a small,
landlocked country with a highly dispersed population and very challenging agri-climatic conditions. Its modern
economy is still in relative infancy – just 40 years ago virtually no formal businesses operated in the country and
only a fraction of the population were formally educated or participated in the modern economy. While the
prudent management of diamonds resources has opened up huge opportunities that Botswana has exploited
well, these historical and structural challenges restrict Botswana’s potential today. In particular, Botswana’s
small and dispersed population raises barriers to achieving agglomeration and scale and increases service
delivery costs. Moreover, highly specific skills are naturally in short supply and entrepreneurialism is still nascent.
In this context, Botswana cannot do everything itself. Instead it must focus (where it has comparative advantage
and can exploit niche opportunities) and it must be open to the region and the world (where it is more efficient
and effective to exploit resources outside its borders.

 Box 1: Diversified Development – an asset-building framework
 A recent World Bank flagship report – Diversified Development: Making the Most of Natural Resources in Eurasia –
 outlined an innovative framework for looking at policies to promote diversification. Behind it was the key finding that
 the long-term experience of resource-rich nation (such as the United Kingdom and the United States, Australia and
 Canada, and Argentina and Brazil) shows that diversification of exports or production is neither necessary nor sufficient
 for economic development. Instead, the report found that diversification is the result and not the cause of successful
 development. And successful development in resource-rich countries is directly linked to how successful countries are
 in converting their resource revenues into built capital, human capital, and institutions.

 So from a policy perspective the implication of these findings is that countries should worry less about trying to diversify
 production or exports, but rather focus on building diversified national asset portfolios – to ensure better balance
 between natural resources, built capital, and economic institutions, with an important focus on intangible assets
 intangible such as education levels, quality of healthcare, and institutions for managing volatile resource rents, providing
 high-quality public services, and effectively regulating private enterprise.

1.3.    Objectives and approach of the Systematic Country Diagnostic
The objective of this Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is to address the question: what are the most critical
constraints (and opportunities) facing Botswana in accelerating progress toward the goals of ending extreme
poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner? The emphasis of the SCD is on identifying
priorities over the next 5 to 7 years, while recognizing that some critical interventions will only bear fruit over
the longer-term.

The SCD is expected to be a relatively brief report, based on a comprehensive analysis of the available evidence3,
and developed in consultation with national authorities and other stakeholders, as well as all parts of the World
Bank Group. In that context, this note draws from an extensive set of reports, papers, and studies carried out by
the World Bank, the government of Botswana, development partners, and academics and research institutions.
A full list of these reports is provided in Annex 5 and most are also included in the references at the end of the
note. It is worth noting in particular the forthcoming World Bank Botswana Poverty Assessment, which formed
the critical baseline for assessing poverty trends in Botswana.

In addition, the SCD was informed by extensive consultations with key stakeholders in Botswana, including
government, parastatals and agencies, the business community, civil society organizations, development
partners, academics and research institutes. The purpose of the consultations was to seek inputs from key
external stakeholders on specific issues as part of the systematic and evidence-based identification of
Botswana’s key opportunities and challenges towards achieving the twin goals. Stakeholder consultation
included several workshops as well as one-on-one sessions. Annex 2 provides a brief overview of these
consultations. The SCD benefited in particular from consultations with government in the context of Vision 2041
and of NDP 11.

The remainder of this SCD is structured as follows:
     Chapter 2: Understanding poverty in Botswana: profiles and progress: presents an analysis of recent
       trends in poverty, inequality, and the welfare of the bottom 40 percent of the population; it includes
       profiles of the poor by demographic and geographic perspectives, as well assessing the main
       determinants of poverty.
     Chapter 3: Growth assessment: drivers, constraints, and risks: presents an analysis past growth patterns
       and recent trends, including an assessment of the main sectors, trade and investment, and private sector

     Chapter 4: Inclusion assessment: building assets at the micro-level: assesses the degree to which
       individuals and groups are in a position to build and leverage assets to contribute to and benefit from
       growth; this includes analysis of education, skills, health, and other key assets along dimensions of
       gender, location, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity.
     Chapter 5: Sustainability assessment: managing resources for long-term prosperity: assesses the
       increasing challenges Botswana faces in managing natural resources and fiscal vulnerabilities, and
       analysis the effectiveness of the public sector in managing these challenges and in converting natural
       endowments to productive, sustainable assets.
     Chapter 6: Prioritizing the challenges: summarizes the main challenges and identifies key short and
       medium term priorities to meeting the aims of poverty eradication and improving the welfare of the
       bottom 40 percent in a sustainable way.

2. Understanding poverty in Botswana: profiles and progress
Identifying the challenges to eliminating poverty and promoting shared prosperity requires an understanding of
the scope and nature of poverty in Botswana today. This chapter, which draws on the recently completed
Botswana Poverty Assessment4, will show that Botswana has made major strides in reducing poverty over the
past decade. Nevertheless, poverty remains relatively high and concentrated among certain groups. Most
importantly, inequality is still extremely high, and acts as a barrier both to growth and poverty reduction.

2.1.      Overview: poverty, shared prosperity, and inequality
Improvements across the board, driven by rural areas
By all measures, poverty declined sharply and living standards improved in Botswana over the last decade (Table
1). The share of the population below the national poverty line fell from 30.6 percent to 19.4 percent between
2003 and 2010. Thus, around 150,000 people moved out of poverty. Similarly, the incidence of extreme poverty,
as measured by the national food poverty line or the international standard US$1.25/day, fell from around 23
percent to between 13 and 14 percent during this period. The depth and severity of poverty5 has also fallen –
i.e. the poor have become less poor. Measures of asset poverty and food poverty confirm these trends, but also
highlight that poverty remains a serious concern in Botswana (Table 1).

Poverty reduction has been accompanied by significant improvements in shared prosperity. The growth
incidence curve6 (Figure 3) shows consumption per capita among the bottom 40 percent of population grew 4.9
percent annually in real terms between 2003 and 2010, compared with just 1.1 percent for the upper two
quintiles. Performance on this ‘shared prosperity indicator’ was among best in Africa, although just average
compared with other upper middle income countries. Reductions in poverty were strongest in rural areas, while
in urban areas improvements were modest (Table 1). Figure 3 shows why this was the case – across all income
deciles, consumption growth in rural areas was far above urban areas. Moreover, in urban areas, per capita
consumption actually declined for the top 40 percent of the income distribution between 2003 and 2010,
suggesting the possibility of a squeeze on the urban middle class.

But many still at risk and inequality high
Figure 4 shows that Botswana made serious progress not only in moving people out of poverty, but also in
transitioning them up through higher levels of consumption. While only 36 percent of the population had
consumption more than twice the poverty line in 2003, this increased to 53 percent by 2010. But this also means
that almost 28 percent of the population, while technically ‘non-poor’, is consuming at a level below an average
P530 monthly (in nominal, 2009/10 Pula7). Given that a large share of these people are living in rural areas and
dependent on subsistence farming and small holding of livestock, which is prone to significant output volatility,
many remain at serious risk of falling back into poverty, at least on a temporary basis.

    Box 2: Alternative measures of poverty8
    Food poverty
    Given the poor agricultural potential of much of Botswana, access to food remains an important dimension of poverty.
    A similar picture is revealed with respect to the depth of food inadequacy. At least 25 percent of Botswana was
    undernourished between 1990 and 2013, peaking at 36.3 percent in between 1998 and 2000; the incidence of food
    inadequacy9 averaged 43.5 percent, between 1990 and 2013. Both these are far above the average for upper middle
    income countries, and even higher than the Sub-Saharan Africa average. However, as with other dimensions of poverty
    food poverty fell significantly (by more than 20 percent) between 2006-08 and 2013.

    Asset poverty
    Ownership of physical assets is frequently used to examine the welfare status of households. Findings from the most
    recent household surveys show the number of assets owned by an average household increased by around one unit
    between 2003 and 2010. This translates to a steep decline of close to 40 percent asset poverty – from more than half of
    all households in 2003 to 30.7 percent in 2010. Growth in asset ownership was steepest for cell phones (from 15 percent
    to over 43 percent) and televisions (from 4 percent to 24 percent) among the poor, and in electric / gas cookers (from
    36 percent to 56 percent) among those above the poverty line. Improvements in asset ownership were biased toward

different line (based on location, size, etc)

access is considered inadequate when benchmarked against minimum dietary energy.
6                                                                                                                                 6
 households in rural areas (71.3 percent growth in assets) versus cities and towns (21.4 percent) and urban villages (38.2
 percent). Growth in asset ownership was highest among the poorest deciles, which led to halving of the gap between
 rich and poor. Despite these gains, asset poverty remains high (60.4 percent for the poor) and concentrated in rural
 areas, among unemployed, and female-headed households.

Declining poverty has contributed also to reductions in inequality, although inequality remains exceptionally
high by global comparison. The Gini coefficient of inequality10, as measured by per capita consumption, declined
from 64.7 percent to 60.5 (Table 2). Using an alternative measure, per capita consumption among the richest 10
percent of households in Botswana was 19.2 times that of the poorest in 2003, it declined to 13.7 times by 2010.
But this still leaves Botswana near the top of the table as one of the world’s most unequal economies. The data
show that it is the broad welfare improvements in rural areas driving the reduction in aggregate inequality, with
within-group inequality in rural areas hardly changing over the decade.

2.2.     Who are the poor and the less well-off in Botswana?
Like anywhere in the world, poverty, shared prosperity, and inequality in Botswana are unevenly distributed
across groups and locations. The good news is that, in general, the biggest gains in recent years were experienced
by the most vulnerable groups in Botswana.

Spatial: rural concentration, but changing patterns
Historically, poverty in Botswana has been strongly spatially defined – concentrated in rural areas and in remote
regions. Generally, poverty rates increase the further one moves out from the A1 corridor in the southeast
Lobatse, through Gaborone, to Francistown. As Figure 5 illustrates, the large majority of the poor are in the
southeast and northeast of the country, where the population is concentrated, but acute levels of poverty are
found in more remote areas, most prominently in the far northwest (Ngamiland) around the Okavango and
Chobe, and in the west and southwest (Kgalagadi)11. Pockets of very high poverty are also found in the southeast
of the country, particularly in Kweneng and parts of the Central district.

But while this spatial distribution of poverty has remained more or less consistent over time, contributing to the
persistence of high rates of rural-urban migration over decades, the relative differences across locations have
changed considerably. 87 percent of the fall in poverty between 2003 and 2010 occurred in rural areas; by
consequence, poverty fell most sharply in the more remote regions, which are almost entirely rural. This has
contributed to substantial regional convergence – as of 2010, only North West (30.1 percent poverty rate) and
Ghanzi (26.0 percent) remain with poverty rates that are substantially above the national average (Figure 6).




10 We focus on the consumption measure of inequality in part because income data from the household surveys is incomplete. Note also
that our measure of consumption inequality differs from the number published by Statistics Botswana, which uses a different methodology
and calculates consumption at the household level.
11 The Northwest and Southwest account for just 22 percent of the poor, while the Northeast accounts for 41 percent of the poor, and the

Southeast for 38 percent of the poor
                                                                                                                                     7
                                                                                                                                     7
Patterns of extreme poverty have followed similar trends. Today, only marginally more of the poor (around 55
percent, or 190,000 individuals) live in rural areas, with the 45 percent (around 160,000 individuals) in urban
settlements, mostly urban villages.

 This pattern of urban/rural convergence contributed significantly not only to reducing overall inequalities
 in Botswana, and to reducing the regional manifestation of inequality, which traditionally followed along
 the regional poverty distribution, with highest inequality in the Northern and South-Western parts of the
 country, and relatively lower inequality in the Central-Southern areas. The reduction in inequality between
 2003 and 2010 was concentrated in the rural North-West and rural South-East provinces, while in Gaborone
 inequality actually increased by 3.6 percentage points (from 57.0 to 60.5). The strength of the spatial driver

 poverty and inequality across Botswana’s regions.

Demographic: pockets of concentrated poverty: children, large families, and female-headed households
Poverty is increasingly concentrated amongst the youngest Batswana. Historically, poverty followed a U-shaped
pattern, peaking with the young and over 65s, with the working age population having much lower rates.
However, between 2003 and 2010, poverty rates for these groups, particularly for the elderly and children under
5, fell sharply. As a result, children (age 0-19) are now the only age group whose share of the poor (57 percent)
is higher than their share of the population (44 percent), with those between the ages of 6 and 14 now
accounting for close to 30 percent of all the poor. Figure 8 shows that extreme poverty is also most pronounced
among children, with the 6-14 age group having by the highest rate (20.3 percent, almost 60 percent higher than
the national rate), followed by the 0-5 age group (18.5 percent). Overall, the chances of being poor are more
than 36 percent higher among children than the general population. The age demographics of poverty are linked
closely to household structures – larger households with more children are significantly more likely to be poor.
In 2010, poor families had an average household size of 6.2 persons, while households of 5 or fewer have a
poverty rate well below 10 percent.

Family structure also has a substantial influence on the likelihood of being poor, with the poverty rate in single-
parent families almost double that in families with both parents (Figure 9). The poverty rate for full families fell
by 12 percentage points over the decade, suggesting the increasing importance of having scope for flexibility
among earners at the household level.

While the gender gap is narrow on measures of overall poverty (20.5 percent of females versus 18.2 percent of
males), female-headed households are significantly more likely to be poor – 58 percent of poor households are
headed by females. This gap widened over the past decade.

Education also plays a crucial role in explaining poverty. More than 50 percent of households headed by
someone with no more than a primary education are in the bottom two consumption quintiles (40 percent)
versus less than 18 percent of those with a tertiary or university degree (Figure 10). However, poverty rates fell
least among the secondary educated population between 2003 and 2010, underlining the declining relative
returns to secondary education.

Finally, poverty levels are highest among the unemployed and inactive. In 2010, the rate of poverty in households
where the head of household was employed was below 8 percent, while the rate for those that were
unemployed was above 19 percent (Figure 11). The big change over the decade is the massive reduction in
poverty in households whose head was inactive, from over 40 percent to 17 percent – the likelihood of being
poor is now higher among households with an unemployed head than an inactive head. Employment is a buffer
but not a guarantee against poverty – more than half of all poor households in Botswana (and almost two-thirds
of poor households in cities) are headed by an employed individual.

Determinants: employment, transfers, demographics, and credit driving down poverty
Employment, including formal jobs and self-employment, was by far the most important factor in driving higher
consumption and poverty reduction over the past decade (Figure 12). The dynamics of the employment rates
have been pro-poor and associated with rapid poverty reduction, particularly in rural areas. Demographic factors
made the second greatest contribution to reducing poverty over the decade. As a result of declining fertility
combined with HIV/AIDS-related mortality, the average household size declined by more than 16 percent in just
7 years (from 4.14 to 3.46). Subsequently the dependency ratio fell from 0.34 children and elderly per household

to 0.2912. This explains almost one quarter of the poverty reduction between 2003 and 2010. In urban areas,
increased access to loans (household lending from the banking sector expanded at close to 20 percent annually
during the decade) also played an important role, accounting for more than 16 percent of the reduction in
poverty between 2003 and 2010.

While social transfers appeared to be less important as a direct contributor to poverty reduction, they actually
played a substantial complementary role. First, the large majority of employment came not through wage
employment but through subsistence farming, subsidized substantially through programs providing in-kind
transfers, like ISPAAD13. Thus, in effect, much of what appears to be employment-led poverty reduction really
reflects social transfers. More than half of poor households in Botswana are headed by a working adult; but 80
percent of these working poor are self-employed, with about half of those in agriculture. Indeed, evidence from
rural households suggests the combination of direct transfers and programs like ISPAAD, along with wage
employment by at least one household member, was the key to escaping poverty. Social transfers were also
critical for reducing the depth of poverty. Almost seven out of ten people, and up to nine in ten people among
the poorest 20 percent, live in households receiving some form of government support from various social
protection programs. Increased social transfers accounted for 34 percent of income growth among all
households between 2003 and 2010, and 40 percent in rural households (Figure 13). For poor households, more
than 40 percent of income came from social transfers in 2010.

As illustrated in Figure 14, inequality is explained mainly by within-group differences14 than by any aggregate
determinant. Among the factors that do have some measurable impact are household size, number of children,
and poverty status. Other factors like location (urban / rural and region), gender, educational attainment, and
employment status have surprisingly little explanatory power. Moreover, these between-group determinants –
in particular, location, gender, poverty status, and household size, contributed significantly to convergence over
the past decade (Figure 15).

     Box 3: Sectoral and historical factors behind inequality in Botswana
     At the heart of Botswana’s inequality problem is the extractives -based economy, and the fact that this economy
     emerged suddenly in a context devoid of almost any developed economic institutions. Prior to the discovery of
     diamonds Botswana was one of the world’s poorest nations, with no real jobs or wealth creating sectors beyond
     rearing cattle. Diamonds brought wealth to the government, but not widespread employment. The mining sector
     overall accounts for less than 15,000 jobs – just 2.5% of national employment; moreover spillovers from infrastructure
     and supply chains are very limited. Thus, the spread of diamonds wealth required direct central redistribution from
     government. And by investing mineral rents in long-term asset building (physical and social infrastructure), the process
     of redistribution is necessarily slower than it would have been had the government, for example, made direct
     payments to its citizens. Given the nature of this growth dynamic, high concentration is not surprising. In this context
     Botswana’s level of inequality is not out of line with global norms, particularly given the relative recent transformation
     of its economy (compared with countries like Chile, for example, where copper was a dominant sector from the early
     20th century, but where inequality levels remain very high).

     But inequality in Botswana has deeper roots, with historical inequalities strong both between and within groups. Given
     the harsh physical environment of Botswana, groups located in more parts of the country vulnerable to regular
     droughts (Okavango, Kgalagadi and Ghanzi and parts of the Kweneng and Ngwaketse) were less able to invest in
     education and building up productive assets15. And Tswana societies were strongly hierarchical – the elite controlled
     the cattle and access to water, while the serfs were left largely herding and without assets 16.

2.3.        Looking ahead: jobs are the key to reducing inequality and eliminating poverty
The inequality-poverty link
The dynamics discussed in this section contributed to a reduction in the headcount of the poor by more than 11
percentage points between 2003 and 2010. Two-thirds of the fall in the national poverty rate is explained by
changes in inequality, which was the result of the disproportionally fast growth in the rural areas. Indeed,
analysis suggests that if the growth rate in agricultural employment was in line with urban growth, the
headcount poverty rate and inequality would have remained almost unchanged.

Micro simulations indicate that, assuming the dynamics of growth from the 2003 to 2010 period continued, the
national poverty level should have declined a further 3.7 percentage points to 15.7 percent, with extreme
poverty falling to 10.5 percent (Figure 16; Figure 17). Assuming the main growth projections and the structure
of growth remains in line with projections over the next five years, poverty should fall further, to just under 12
percent by 2018. Thus, in the current trajectory, Botswana should be in a position to continue to see relatively
rapid poverty reduction over the next few years. Beyond this, however, further reduction in poverty will become
much more difficult due to the high levels of inequality that remain. Projections suggest that the current growth
trajectory will result in slowing reduction in inequality – in fact, inequality may well increase slightly in the next
five years.

In a neutral growth scenario (i.e. where consumption growth is constant across income groups), a 40 percent
cumulative growth rate in consumption per capita is required to halve the poverty rate (from 19.4 to 10 percent).
Assuming average growth of 4 percent per annum it would take 7 to 8 years to achieve this goal, and thus up to
25 years to eradicate poverty. If growth coincided with further reduction of the inequality, poverty could be
reduced much faster; thus, halving the poverty rate could be achieved in 4 years if growth is associated to the 2
percentage point reduction in the Gini coefficient (Figure 18). By contrast, an increase in inequality would have
the opposite effect: if the Gini coefficient increases by 2 percentage points, poverty will not fall even with
cumulative growth of 30 percent.

Social protection can play a major role in eliminating extreme poverty
Thus, for Botswana to achieve continued rapid progress toward eradicating poverty, not only will robust
aggregate growth be needed, but growth will need to continue to be at least as strongly pro-poor as it has been
over the past decade. One key to achieving this will be through social protection systems. Social protection is
already playing an important role in poverty reduction in Botswana. The simulated poverty headcount at the
national poverty datum line is 25 percent lower than it would be in the absence of social protection transfers
(19.4 versus 24.3). Moreover, the depth of poverty is much lower as a result of social protection: the poverty
gap is estimated to be 69 percent lower as a result of social protection. Findings from a recent assessment of
Botswana’s social protection program17 indicates that the total amount spent on social assistance annually in
Botswana would be more than enough to completely close the consumption gap and eradicate poverty.

Assuming perfect targeting, the annual cost of giving every poor person just enough to fill in their consumption
gap would be P407 million or 0.33 percent of GDP – this is far below the level spent on social protection at
present (Figure 19), and even on some individual programs within it. Further details on social protection and the
potential impact of social protection reforms on poverty reduction and inclusion are provided in chapter 4.

Broad-based job creation is the key to making poverty elimination sustainable
However, while social protection can play a key role in shifting inequality and reducing poverty, it will not be
sufficient, and certainly not sustainable, in isolation. Reducing inequality will require much higher rates of
employment, both formal and informal. Botswana has experienced high structural unemployment (averaging
around 20 percent) combined with relatively low labor market participation over a long time period. While
unemployment was historically a rural phenomenon, strong rural-urban migration has shifted part of the
problem into the urban areas. But regardless of the location, at the heart of the problem is the extractive nature
of the Botswana economy, and the growth model that derives from it, which has failed to create the employment
opportunities necessary to ensure the sustainability of poverty elimination shared prosperity. Chapters 3 and 4
explore the potential for greater employment generation in more detail, assessing the macro-environment for
sustainable growth, and the micro-level environment for individuals and groups to take advantage of growth for
productive employment and to improve human development outcomes.

3. Growth assessment: drivers, constraints, and risks

Eliminating poverty and ensuring shared prosperity on a sustainable basis requires strong growth. But as this
chapter will show, the nature of growth will need to change, from public sector channeling of minerals revenues
to a model which is private-sector driven, export-oriented, and, most importantly, job creating.

3.1.     Historical growth model and the challenge of diversification
A history of strong growth on the back of diamonds
Botswana has experienced sustained growth – GDP per capita expanded at an annual average of 6.4 percent for
close to 50 years. Such rapid growth was made possible by the unique impact of large diamonds revenue (see
Box 4). At its peak in the early 1980s, minerals (mainly diamonds) accounted for more than 50 percent of
Botswana’s GDP and fuelled annual growth well in excess of 10 percent (Figure 20). Following the 1980s,
however, GDP growth slowed rapidly as diamonds moved into steady-state production, and growth trended
further downward during the 2000s. While slowing growth is not to be welcomed, neither should it be
unexpected. Botswana’s rapid growth in the 1980s and 1990s came off an extremely small base – at
independence, Botswana’s per capita GDP was just US$80 (around US$480 in 2005 prices). In fact, Botswana’s
growth compares favorably with the Growth Commission’s “post-war growth success stories”18, and remained
on track with this benchmark in the 2000s up until the global financial crisis.

   Box 4: Diamonds in Botswana - a unique situation in a unique industry
   There is no doubt that Botswana played its hand well since the discovery of diamonds. But it is also important to
   recognize just how special a hand the country was dealt. Following discovery of diamonds just after independence, the
   first major mine opened at Orapa in 1972, with Jwaneng (the world’s richest diamond mine) opening in 1982. Thanks
   to the unique historical structure of the industry, diamonds have largely avoided the cyclical booms and busts in pricing
   that characterize most natural resource commodities. Until relatively recently, Debeers19 controlled more than 90
   percent of the world’s supply of diamonds, and were strongly vertically integrated fro m mining through distribution,
   marketing, and retailing. This extreme market power allowed Debeers to maintain rising prices and income by
   controlling output20. For Botswana this has meant stable income flow and avoidance of volatile swings in terms of trade
   that can depress growth. Perhaps most importantly, Botswana’s position in the diamond sector is unique among
   resource-rich countries. Botswana’s diamond mines are by far the largest and most productive (profitable) in the world.
   This allowed the Government of Botswana to negotiate from a position of power, which enabled it to secure more than
   80 percent of the revenue stream flowing from diamond operations in Botswana, and more recently to secure major
   concessions from Debeers to move global diamond aggregation and sales to Gaborone to support the development of
   diamond value-addition in Botswana.

   While this unique situation has clearly been a boon to Botswana, it also raises certain challenges, which are discussed
   throughout this note. An obvious one is the heavy reliance of the government on diamond revenues. A related, and
   perhaps more far-reaching one, is the fact that the impact of diamonds on the economy is almost purely fiscal – the
   sector creates little employment and there are relatively few supply and infrastructural spillovers. This has serious
   implications for the inclusiveness of growth, and puts extraordinary obligation and responsibility on government, as the
   intermediary of diamonds rents.

But diamonds are (still) not forever
Growth since the crisis has been robust, averaging more than 6 percent annually between 2010 and 2013 – more
than twice the global average. This comes despite value added in the mining sector remaining 40 percent below
its pre-crisis peak. Indeed, while the return to solid growth is partly a function of stabilization in the mining
sector, the crisis may have accelerated the ongoing structural decline of diamonds. It would be wrong to dismiss
the continued growth potential of the diamond sector in Botswana. New discoveries have led to several new
mine openings recently, and the development of new extractive technologies is likely to extend the life of some
of the country’s most productive mines. Moreover, global demand looks to outstrip supply in the medium term,
which should contribute to buoyant market prices. The development of a diamonds cutting and polishing
industry in Gaborone is also helping Botswana to capture additional value beyond rough diamond exports. But
despite these positive developments, Botswana is already past the heady days of the diamond bonanza.
Diamond production began to decline from its peak of over 34 million carats already by 2007 and has plateaued
around 22 to 23 million carats. Further exploitation of Botswana’s largest mines (Jwaneng and Orapa) will require
substantial new investments, which will reduce profits and the fiscal take. So while recent reports of diamond
production extending to 2050 may well come to fruition, the basic fact that diamonds are a declining resource
remains as relevant as ever.

The growth model: diamonds revenues and public investment
Botswana’s traditional growth model has involved taking mineral revenues and investing in education, health,
and other public and social infrastructure, with the intention of building the infrastructure and human capacity
for the development of sustainable, diversified sectors. This has meant high levels of public investment with
growth being driven by capital deepening. Despite the changing economic structure in recent years, fixed capital
formation remains well above the levels of peers (Figure 21), although it is still well below the levels of many
East Asian economies (which reach 35-40 percent) and below the target of 40 percent (average 1996-2016)
initially set in Vision 201621 . The relatively high levels reflect continuing investment in infrastructure by the
public sector, which accounts for around 40 percent of capital formation, and by parastatals.

Did the model work? A snapshot of progress on diversification
There is no doubt that Botswana has diversified significantly in recent decades. On the most basic measure of
diversification – share of economic output – minerals contribution has declined from a high of close to 60 percent
of value added in the early 1980s to below 16 percent in constant terms (Figure 22). Similarly, the contribution
of minerals to fiscal revenues declined from around 60 percent (reached in 1988 and again briefly around 2000)
to around 30 percent today. On the other hand, Botswana remains almost fully dependent on diamonds for its
exports – indeed, even more so today than it has been in the past23. This raises questions over the sustainability
of other aspects of diversification, as will be discussed in the next section and again in Chapter 5. And given the
importance of government employment and spending in driving many other parts of Botswana’s economy, the
real impact of diamonds goes much deeper. The reliance on diamonds was laid bare during the 2008-09 global
financial crisis, when major decline in the global market for diamonds contributed to a 8 percent contraction in
Botswana’s GDP and forced the government to run down significantly their fiscal buffers and take on substantial
new debt.

3.2.     The challenge of diversification remains
A consumption-led growth model, but is it sustainable?
So what is replacing diamonds in the growth model? Figure 23 and Figure 24 show clearly it has been services
and consumption. The structure of output in Botswana in was remarkably static between 1994 and 2003. But
services began to play a more important role in the pre-crisis years, and accelerated through the crisis, with
mining’s contribution to GDP falling from one-third to one-quarter following the crisis. This was not simply due
to declining diamonds output – two-thirds of the growth in services contribution to GDP was explained by real
growth in services, while just one-third is explained by declining minerals output. While all parts of the services
sector are growing, in the post-crisis years growth has been particularly strong in consumption-oriented
segments, in particular retail and vehicle trade. Data on GDP composition by expenditure also gives an indication
of how important consumer spending has become for Botswana’s economy (Figure 24). Again, the post-crisis
period marks a significant shift from the previous 15 years, with net exports turning negative, investment rising




23 Although some of the very recent growth in the share of diamonds exports (since 2010) is related to diamond aggregation and re-

exports

                                                                                                                               17
                                                                                                                              17
moderately, and household final consumption increasing sharply, from less than 40 percent of GDP to 50 percent
between 2010 and 2013. Between 2004 and 2013, per capita consumption in Botswana grew by close to 9
percent annually in real terms (15.6 percent in nominal terms – see Figure 27), from less than 2 percent annually
in the period 1994-2003.

How sustainable is this new pattern of consumption-led growth? Consumption share of output in Botswana has
historically been low, and it remains well below the level in peer countries (Figure 28). However there are three
main reasons to be concerned over sustainability of the diversification trajectory, and therefore of growth more
generally: i) weak private sector job creation, low wage growth, and increasing household debt; ii) the continued
reliance on public investment to drive growth, in the context of future fiscal vulnerabilities; and iii) the failure of
export diversification and the vulnerability of growth to declining external balances.

Weak job creation, slow wage growth, and increasing household debt
One of the concerns about the nature of growth in Botswana is its weak capacity to create jobs. An assessment
of the most recent household surveys24 (2003 and 2010) shows a mixed picture of the labor market. While
employment grew strongly and unemployment fell between 2003 and 2010, more than half of all new jobs came
in small-scale or subsistence agriculture (where the poor are concentrated), heavily supported through
government programs like ISPAAD. Evidence from similar previous programs25 suggests that employment levels
may fall back sharply if subsidies were to be discontinued or scaled back. Outside of agriculture, job creation has
mainly been coming from the public sector, although this has slowed considerably since a de facto hiring freeze
was imposed in 2010.

The private sector is struggling to create jobs. The formal private sector created on average just over 3,000 jobs
per year over the period 2003 to 2010, far below the level needed to absorb the 15,000-20,000 annual new
entrants to the labor market (Figure 25)26. And the non-farm informal sector has not been effective as either a
stepping stone to formal sector employment or to absorb excess labor. While the pace of growth of non-farm
self-employment has increased in recent years, it still accounts for just 23 percent of private sector employment




24 Statistics Botswana does not carry out regular labor market surveys. It publishes quarterly estimates formal employment (although the

last published is only from September 2012). The last labor market survey was carried out in 2005-06.

and 10 percent of all employment, well below the level in peer countries. Job creation has been particularly
weak in urban areas, where non-agricultural private sector employment grew below 1 percent annually between
2003 and 2010. And virtually all private sector job creation has come in untraded (local) services. By contrast the
manufacturing sector has shed jobs and the construction sector has been stagnant (Figure 26). Thus,
opportunities for lower and mid-skilled Batswana have been limited.

                            KNOWLEDGE GAP: THE INFORMAL ECONOMY IN BOTSWANA
 As noted above, while subsistence agriculture is large and growing in Botswana, informal activities outside the
 agricultural sector appear to be relatively small in size lacking dynamism, particularly in light of limited employment
 creation in the formal sector. Labor market surveys that cover the informal economy come out only infrequently
 (every 5-7 years) and provide only a broad snapshot of those earning incomes in informal activities. Beyond this
 little is known about the Botswana’s informal economy: the nature of activities; the factors which contribute to
 informal participation; the constraints to formality and to operating informally; and perhaps most importantly, the
 potential of home-based enterprises and other informal activity in absorbing labor, supporting household incomes,
 and moving people out of poverty. Moreover, the degree to which the formal and informal economy operate as
 complements or substitutes (and what potential there is for this to change in the future) is poorly understood.

In this labor market environment, households are becoming increasingly indebted, as growth in wages,
particularly among public sector workers27 (Botswana’s core consuming class) has been far below the rate of
consumption (Figure 27). Between 2004 and 2013, bank lending to households grew by more than 20 percent
annually. This comes off a low base – bank credit to the private sector in Botswana still represents only around
30 percent of GDP, well below all peer countries (Figure 28). But this is almost double the level of a decade ago;
and a recent analysis of take-home pay28 in the public sector shows that average loan repayments (including for
mortgages) rose from 14.5 percent of gross salary in 2004 to 21.5 percent in 201429.

This expansion in credit excludes debts to smaller microlenders, which have grown rapidly, retail store credit,




27 However, as Grynberg (2014) shows, while wage growth in the public sector has been restrained, there has been a rapid growth in

allowances, which have grown in share of total emoluments from 33 percent in 2005 to 45 percent in 2014.
28 Grynberg (2014)
29 The public sector has an arrangement with bank and large microlenders to ensure monthly loan repayments by garnishing wages at

source, virtually eliminating repayment risk.

                                                                                                                              19

and other non-bank sources of credit. With interest rates currently at their lowest level in more than 20 years,
the concern is that any future increases in the interest rate may expose significant vulnerabilities. This is not
likely to threaten stability in the financial sector (non-performing loans remain low) but may result in stress on
Botswana’s households, and contribute to slowing growth.

Overreliance on public investment and weak productivity performance
Diversified growth in Botswana has relied extensively on investment, most of which has originated from the
public sector and parastatals. Figure 29 shows that capital deepening has accounted consistently for around
two-thirds of growth since the early 1990s. Total factor productivity (TFP), meanwhile, has had a negative
contribution to growth throughout the period. While capital stock grew strongly and consistently, the pace of
growth in labor and in human capital (proxied by education levels) slowed throughout the 2000s. With fiscal
conditions tightening, government will not be in the position to continue to drive such high investment levels on
a consistent basis in the medium term, raising the importance of private sector investment, but also of making
a step change in productivity performance.

Analysis of productivity in Botswana is somewhat distorted by the large contribution of the mining sector and
its volatility. Clearly the major drop in TFP between 2008 and 2010 is a function of the collapse in mining output
in the context of a large fixed stock of capital and relatively limited variable labor. Unfortunately, data does not

20                                                                                                                              20
allow for a robust analysis of TFP at the sectoral level. But it is possible to do so for labor productivity, and here
the story is different. Figure 31 shows that non-mining labor productivity contributed around 1.3 percentage
points to annual (non-mining sector) growth between 1996 and 2010. Productivity growth contribution was also
fairly steady across this period, although it was particularly rapid in 2008-2010 (which may be distorted by the
fiscal stimulus which inflated the non-mineral economy). At the same time, demographic factors, perhaps linked
to HIV/AIDS, were a drag on growth across the period.

Most of this productivity growth is being driven by the services sector (Figure 32), while manufacturing has also
had a positive contribution, although the latter in the context of jobs-shedding. Indeed the data on capital and
labor contributions highlight the slow growth in employment in the overall economy. But they also show that
while the link between growth and employment is weak overall, it is much stronger in the non-mining economy.
The non-mining primary sector, mainly agriculture, contributed negatively to productivity growth. Looking more
deeply at the services sector, most sectors experienced productivity growth although the largest sector from an
employment perspective – government – contributed negatively to productivity growth. The combination of
relatively strong employment growth in low productivity sectors like agriculture (and to a degree, government)
contributed to a negative inter-sectoral impact on growth, indicating low poor allocative efficiency. So while
productivity growth is robust in the tertiary sector, overall productivity growth is being held back by slow
structural change – labor is not moving quickly enough out of the primary sector and into the secondary and
tertiary sectors.

External vulnerability
Botswana’s failure to achieve successful diversification of exports raises a significant risk to growth in the
medium term. The countercyclical strategy in response to the collapse of diamonds exports during the global
financial crisis had a severe impact on Botswana’s foreign exchange reserves, and only limited progress has been
made on rebuilding them since. Foreign exchange reserves fell from 90 percent of GDP in December 2008 to just
55 percent of GDP in December 2013 – a decline of almost 40 percent. Box 5 presents a basic simulation of the
external implications of Botswana experiencing another demand shock for diamonds. It also models the more
certain, longer-term scenario of slow decline in diamonds output. The simulations show that the real concern is
indeed not another shock, but the longer-term decline of diamonds. It shows clearly that in the absence of
significant growth in exports outside of diamonds, Botswana may already begin to experience a balance of
payments crisis by the late 2020s. Such a situation would quickly become unsustainable and could lead ultimately
to a substantial contraction of GDP.

 Box 5: Simulating a short-term shock and the long-term decline of diamonds on external balances
 Short-term shock scenario:
 In terms of balance of payments (BoP), if we assume that a major global shock to the diamond market had a total impact
 equivalent to the loss of 6 months of diamond exports (similar to the global financial crisis), the cost would be P17.5
 billion, or just under 40 percent of annual exports (net of diamond re-exports). Maintaining imports in the face of such a
 shock would be feasible, although the foreign exchange reserves would drop significantly to around P50 billion – or down
 to some 40 percent of 2013 GDP. Import cover would also fall by around 4 months as a result. Essentially, Botswana
 could afford to withstand one more crisis of a similar magnitude to that of 2008-9, but it would use up the last of the
 ‘spare capacity’ in the foreign exchange reserves to support the BoP.

 Slow decline scenario:
 Although the present buffers can accommodate a shock to diamond exports, their ability to cope with long-term
 structural change is quite different. Botswana is already past peak diamond production and within ten years it is likely to
 reach peak revenues in nominal terms (Figure 33). Without substantial growth in non-diamond exports, this will quickly
 lead to balance of payments deficits and require a drawdown of foreign exchange reserves. With diamonds accounting
 for 75 percent of total exports, it is evident that a decline in diamond exports – in real terms, relative to GDP, not
 necessarily in absolute pula terms – will quickly deplete the foreign exchange reserves, unless other adjustments take
 place. Although the dynamics of such long-term developments are complex, a simple modeling exercise suggests that
 even with a slow reduction in diamond exports, the foreign exchange reserves would be exhausted after ten years 30
 (Figure 34). In practice of course, such a situation is not sustainable and would require either a substantial expansion of
 non-diamond exports or would lead to severe import compression and a decline in investment that the economy would
 contract (experience negative growth).

Conclusions on the growth model
The discussion in this section has highlighted that while economic diversification is happening, there is reason
to question its potential to deliver sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Sustainability will require more
employment-intensive growth, higher levels of private sector investment, and, critically, a greater export-
orientation of non-mining growth.




30 The parameters of the modelling exercise are as follows: diamond exports start at 30% of GDP and decline by 1% of GDP per year; non-

diamond exports and imports are steady at 10% and 40% of GDP respectively; the foreign exchange reserves start at their current level
(55% of GDP).

3.3.       Where will future growth come from?
Much effort at sectoral diversification, but limited results
Sectoral diversification has been at the top of the national agenda for more than 30 years, attested by a long list
of programs, going back to the Local Preference Scheme (1976), the Reserved Sectors Policy (1982), the Financial
Assistance Program (1982), and the more recent ‘Hubs’ and Special Economic Zones, along with agencies (CEDA,
LEA, BEDIA/BITC, etc.) established to promote diversification and the development of the domestic private
sector. The most recent policy – the Economic Diversification Drive (EDD) – aims to develop a diversified private
sector through a two stage process involving: i) local preferences in government procurement; followed by, ii)
facilitating competitiveness for firms to participate in regional and global export markets. Government is also
pursuing Michael Porter’s cluster approach. While both initiatives have identified priority areas for Botswana’s
diversification efforts, there is only limited common ground between the two.

Despite concerted efforts, progress toward diversification – at least in terms of establishing regionally
competitive non-resources sectors – has been slow. While there are no significant macroeconomic barriers to
diversification (Box 6), there are a number of structural issues, most notably lack of scale economies, as well as
supply side barriers that hamper diversification, both across the board and in specific sectoral contexts.

 Box 6: Diversification in Botswana: a non-traditional case of Dutch Disease?
 Despite Botswana’s reliance on natural resource exports, diversification does not appear to have been hampered by any
 obvious Dutch disease effect, at least in terms of its traditional manifestation through an overvalued real exchange rate.
 While Botswana accumulated large foreign reserves by running trade surpluses every year from 1983 through 2008, the
 real exchange rate (REER) was managed to fluctuate within a relatively narrow range over this time (Figure 35). An
 analysis of equilibrium exchange rates found that the Pula was overvalued around half of this period, but only by 1.2
 percentage points31, not sufficient to have a significant dampening effect. In addition, wages in tradable sectors like
 manufacturing are highly competitive in the region, with minimum wages at just one-sixth the level in neighboring South
 Africa. But many of aspects of Botswana’s economy suggest that other symptoms of Dutch Disease are indeed present,
 and may play a critical role in dampening the development of diversified, tradable sectors. These include: high structural
 unemployment, a high share of employment in the public sector, and a domestic business community focused on local
 non-tradables and government contracts.

While solid arguments can be made to support any of the broad sectors, there is perhaps a need to look more
critically at Botswana’s sources of comparative advantage (or alternatively its disadvantages in terms of climate,
scale, and location). Given the emphasis on employment for poverty reduction, consideration also needs to be
given to the degree to which patterns of sectoral growth will contribute to broad-based job creation, as well as
its sustainability over time. Table 3 provides a very simplified assessment of broad sectors based on these
criteria. It suggests that mining is a clear source of comparative advantage and potentially an important
contributor from a fiscal perspective, but it contributes little to jobs growth and, subsequently, aggravates high
inequality. It is also not sustainable from an environment perspective. Agriculture is a critical sector for poverty
alleviation and has the potential for broad-based employment impact, but from a commercial perspective it fails
to pass the test of comparative advantage or sustainability. Manufacturing sits somewhere in the middle, with
potential for broad-based job creation, but held back by weak comparative advantage, in particular lack of scale
economies and high transport costs, offset somewhat by the potential for competitive energy costs32. Finally,
services appear to offer the best combination of comparative advantage (especially in tourism), sustainability,
and jobs intensity. Services also represent a sector where Botswana is least constrained by comparative
disadvantages of scale and geography.

The remainder of this section provides a brief summary on the current development and growth prospects in
each of these broad sectors.

Mining: significant growth potential but not easily realized and not without drawbacks
Although diamond output is not likely to return to previous peaks, the recent shift of Debeers’ sales activities to
Gaborone, the establishment of an alternative sales channel (through the Botswana government-owned
Okavango Diamond Company), and the continued development of value-added polishing and manufacturing,
offers the potential for the development of high value-added employment and greater spillovers to the national
economy. Outside of diamonds, a number of other minerals commodities are historically or potentially
important in Botswana, including:
            Copper-nickel: Historically Botswana’s second largest minerals subsector, copper-nickel production has
             been ongoing since the early 1970s, with 5 main mines operated by four companies: in Selebi-Phikwe




32   Although this would tend to benefit capital intensive sectors and thus may have limited impact on direct employment creation

24                                                                                                                                  24
          (operated by BCL); Phoenix (Tati Nickel); Mowana and Thakadu (African Copper); and Boseto (Discovery
          Metals). While the sector has struggled in recent years with declining reserves and lower global prices,
          significant new deposits have been identified around Selebi-Phikwe and in Ghanzi and Ngamiland. These
          new finds open up the potential for measurable growth in copper production to offset the ongoing
          decline in nickel; however, their locations are not well-served by existing infrastructure. Moreover,
          significant fluctuations in global prices make copper-nickel an unstable contributor to output and fiscal
          revenues.
         Coal: Botswana is estimated to have more than 200 billion tons of coal resources (around two-thirds or
          Africa’s total), with about 40 billion tons of proven reserves33. The vast majority of this remains
          unexploited. Currently coal is produced only in small quantities (around 2-3 million tons per year) from
          a single mine at Morupule, and used mainly for domestic power generation. Growth in coal has the
          potential to be important as a contributor to exports and government revenue. And while neither of
          these will be anywhere near the scale of diamonds, coal does have greater non-fiscal linkages with the
          domestic economy, with higher employment elasticity (up to 60,000 jobs are forecast in a high-growth
          coal scenario34) and potential supply chain and infrastructural links. Monetizing this opportunity will,
          however, require attracting investment to support the massive infrastructure expansion (Box 7). This
          appears to be far from certain, however, as the commercial case remains vulnerable to many potential
          changes in the global environment, most importantly the demand, and therefore price, for coal.
          Moreover, the environmental implications of coal, particularly its demands on scarce water resources
          but also greenhouse gas emissions, have implications that must be considered.

 Box 7: Monetizing coal: how and where?
 Botswana’s coal resources are huge, with proven reserves sufficient for hundreds of years of production. But even proven
 reserves are of no value unless they can be monetized, and this requires not simply extracting them but getting them to
 where they can be used. Botswana’s coal is low to medium grade (in line with South Africa’s) which is generally suf ficient
 for global market needs. But exporting coal would require major investments in infrastructure, including both rail and
 ports (the latter would require dedicated capacity to ensure Botswana’s exports were not ultimately held back due to
 bottlenecks over which they had no control). Three main options are being considered in this respect:
      1. Trans-Kalahari Railway via Namibia: This option has received the most attention and been assessed for close to
          a decade. It would involve a greenfield 1,500km railway development as well as new port facilities in Walvis Bay,
          with total costs estimated at US$12-15 billion. Capacity would be at least 50 mtpa.
      2. Limpopo Line via Zambia and Zimbabwe and Mozambique : This option involves development of a 1,100km
          railway via Zambia and Zimbabwe to the proposed Techobanine port south of Maputo, in Mozambique. Capacity
          would also be at least 50 mtpa
      3. Waterberg via South Africa: This option would involve connecting into the existing Transnet rail network
          exporting via Richards Bay. While this option would have the lowest investment requirements it also offers
          significantly less capacity; not more than 10-20 mtpa

 A second option is power generation. The huge power deficit in the region represents an opportunity for Botswana to
 expand its coal power generation sector, both to support domestic generation (an additional 600MW are planned over
 the next decade) and for regional exports35. In fact, exports and power generation are complementary – the washing and
 sorting process in exporting coal results in substantial ‘waste’ (tailings) that can be used for power generation.




33 Resources exist with potential viability, while reserves are technically and economically feasible to extract
34 IISD (2014)
35 It is important to note here that while there is a shortage of electricity generation in the region at present, there are also many

investments being planned across the region, including from countries that have the potential to generate power at equal or even lower
cost than Botswana (e.g. Mozambique, with gas-fired power).

                                                                                                                                  25
                                                                                                                                  25
 If Botswana is to reach full development of its resources (estimated variously at least 70-90 mtpa), then at least two of
 the above options will need to be implemented. The choice and the viability comes down to the interplay among three
 main factors: 1) the quality of Botswana’s coal; 2) the cost to get it to where it needs to be; and 3) global prices. The
 problem is that the calculation of 1 and 2 shows that 3 (price) matters a lot, and of course price is changing all the time.
 Moreover, it is vulnerable to future downside risks (e.g. a climate change deal, China making a marginal shift away from
 coal power), which makes it challenging for any private investor to plant a firm stake in the ground. For the same reasons,
 it is risky for government, as such investments are largely inflexible (sector specific) and irreversible, leaving the prospect
 of the government being left with a costly and underutilized asset should external conditions change.

         Gold: Although it has a long history in Botswana, only one mine is currently in operation (Mupane).
          Production is low and declining, with reserves diminishing and no major new finds.
         Soda ash: Exploiting the Makgadikgadi salt pans, Botswana produced around a half a million metric tons
          per year of soda ash and salt over the past decade. Botswana is estimated to have the second largest
          reserves of natural soda ash in the world and is the fourth largest global producer. However, the sector
          is not likely to grow dramatically from its current level.
         Uranium: Substantial uranium deposit exists in northeast Botswana and could be relatively easily
          exploited, although depressed current market prices have put off investment.
         Coal-bed methane (CBM): Linked to the large coal deposits (see below) are substantial deposits of CBM,
          which could be used for power generation or as a fuel source. Viability has not yet been established,
          but development prospects are being tested and could be significant.
         Iron ore: While no production currently exists, Rio Tinto reportedly discovered large iron ore deposits
          in Southwestern Botswana in 2014, in what could be an extension of South Africa’s hugely productive
          Sishen deposit. Should this prove viable it would be a substantial development.

         derived. For coal assumption based on estimated reserves of 40 billion metric tons, production of 50 mtpa, and resource rent of
         40 pula per metric ton.

In summary, the minerals sector certainly has a role to play in supporting future diversification, particularly from
a revenue perspective. But the significant environmental risks it poses and its limited job creation potential mean
it is far from being the answer to Botswana’s diversification challenge.

Agriculture: a disconnect between poverty alleviation and commercial potential
With 70 percent of Botswana covered by desert, poor soils, and perennial droughts, it is not surprising that
agriculture contributes less than 3 percent to Botswana’s GDP despite very high levels of government financial
26
                                                                                                                                        26
support36. Yet the sector is still responsible for more than for a quarter of all employment (over 150,000 workers)
and plays a critical role in the rural economy, although this is mainly from the perspective of poverty alleviation
(subsistence farming) than from a commercial perspective. More than 60 percent of value added in agriculture
comes from livestock, mainly through beef, which has traditionally been Botswana’s second largest goods
export. The sector remains largely dependent on traditional management through communal grazing, reliant on
subsidized veterinary services, and has struggled with cyclical problems of disease (FMD), compounded by
quality and traceability problems that shut off the lucrative European export market from 2010-12, and with the
near-collapse of the Botswana Meat Commission (BMC). Future growth will depend on raising productivity,
which will in turn depend on shifting toward more commercial models and improving the incentive mechanisms
to both traditional farmers and exporters.

Crop farming is dominated by traditional, mainly subsistence37, farmers. While domestic production of grains
and horticulture is growing, Botswana remains a large net importer of food staples. Commercial production is
concentrated in the far north at Pandamatenga (mainly sorghum) and parts of the Southeast (mainly
horticulture). The potential of agriculture to be a more significant contributor to sustainable poverty reduction
depends on raising productivity of small farmers (Box 8) and livestock holders and ensuring the sustainability of
support programs like ISPAAD. A review of ISPAAD38 shows that while it has been successful as a poverty
alleviation instrument, reaching more than 100,000, primarily vulnerable, beneficiaries, it has failed in its other
primary objective – to promote farming as a commercially sustainable source of employment. The review
showed that output per worker has not improved and cereal yields remain at just one-third the ISPAAD target.
Reasons for low productivity are manifold, but among them are: i) weak incentives to farmers under existing
programs like ISPAAD, which are poorly targeted and have limited requirements (and enforcement) for adopting
improved techniques; ii) a disconnect between the technologies promoted by extension services and the social
and economic realities of farmers; and iii) poor skills among smallholders39.

Beyond agriculture’s role as a social safety net, it is questionable whether the sector (i.e. commercial farming)
has a significant role to play as a driver of growth and employment. Plans are underway to exploit the potential
for large-scale irrigation in the Chobe district, through the Zambezi Integrated Agricultural Development Project
(ZIADP). This project would channel water from the Zambezi to irrigate as much as 35,000 hectares (versus
around just 2,000 hectares currently under irrigation in the entire country). While the initial ZIADP project
developed in the late 2000s was ultimately rejected, the project has now been restructured and a feasibility
study is expected to be completed by the end of 2014. Such a project would contribute significantly to ensuring
Botswana’s food security objectives, but it would come at a large financial cost as well as a large opp ortunity
cost (particularly with respect to scarce water resources) – this will be discussed more in chapter 5.

 Box 8: The importance of agricultural productivity for rural poverty reduction
 With more than half of all rural jobs coming in the agricultural sector, eliminating poverty in rural areas, where is it most
 entrenched, clearly requires addressing agricultural earnings potential. And this requires significant improvements in
 agricultural productivity. According to the 2014 African Transformation Report40 Botswana’s cereal yields average 375
 kilograms per hectare compared to an average of 2,045 per hectare in the other 14 Sub-Saharan African countries




36 Findings from the recent agricultural public expenditure review (World Bank, 2014c) indicate that public expenditure on agriculture

stands at roughly 50 percent of agriculture’s value -added. This is among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa, where a typical level of
government expenditure would be 10 to 15 percent of value-added.
37 Data indicates that less than 15 percent of farmers in traditional sectors market their crops (World Bank, 2014)

 covered in the report. And productivity in the sector has not improved in a decade.

 Why does agricultural productivity matter? Raising yields and output per worker – through improved technologies,
 practices, and by shifting to higher value added crops – increases farm earnings. This not only has the direct effect of
 improving outcomes of agricultural households, but also has several important indirect impacts that go well beyond
 agricultural households. First, higher incomes in agricultural households will have spillover effects on the non-farm rural
 economy, as these households increase consumption of other goods and services. And as urban villages grow in
 Botswana, demand for food may create opportunities for non-farm employment in food processing41. Second, improved
 agricultural productivity will help contain rising prices in food, by far the most important component of the consumption
 basket in poor households. Higher incomes in agricultural households are also associated with greater investment in
 education, contributing over time to non-farm productivity and employment. And improved productivity in agriculture
 contributes to urbanization, which at the household level can provide additional incomes and insulation from shocks,
 and at the aggregate level is in most cases is associated with declining poverty over time.

Manufacturing: 30 years of running to a standstill
Botswana’s manufacturing sector remains small, fluctuating between 5 and 6 percent of GDP over the past
twenty years compared to an average of over 21 percent in middle income countries. Despite this limited output
contribution, manufacturing accounts for more than 11 percent of all formal jobs in the country and is
particularly important for male workers in urban areas. The performance of the manufacturing sector has been
decidedly mixed over the past decade. Overall, manufacturing output was up 11 percent in nominal terms
between 2000 and 2013 (4.4% in real terms), with stronger growth since 2006 (Figure 36). However, labor
intensive sectors like apparel have shrunk dramatically since the crisis – value added in the apparel sector in
2012 was just P180m (in current prices), down almost 40% from its pre-crisis peak.

There is an ongoing debate on Botswana’s potential to compete in labor intensive manufacturing. Despite its
status as the one of the richest countries in Africa, Botswana is by no means a high wage country. In fact,
minimum wages in manufacturing are just one-sixth the level in South Africa and are on par with levels in Lesotho
and Swaziland (Figure 37). So why is Botswana not attracting labor-intensive production from South Africa to

anything the like the (still moderate) degree in Lesotho? Clearly, productivity is part of the story, as are issues of
scale economies and location. In the absence of an existing manufacturing sector, Botswana relies on importing
virtually all inputs to any manufacturing process. And given its landlocked location and high transport costs
(Figure 37), much of this labor cost advantage is eroded (see Section 3.4).

One bright spot in the manufacturing story is the recent growth of the diamond cutting and polishing sector,
following the establishment of the Diamond Hub. While data on the diamond cutting and polishing remains
weak, it is likely to be Botswana’s largest single manufacturing sector in terms of employment, although its
contribution to manufacturing value-added may be relatively limited. As the diamond cutting and polishing
example suggests, there will certainly be niche opportunities for Botswana to develop manufacturing,
particularly where the country has access to unique resources. On the other hand, developing a large-scale
manufacturing sector, either in capital intensive or assembly type activities, appears to be hindered by significant
structural barriers.

Services: strength in tourism and other emerging sectors, but competitiveness still weak
Services have been the biggest contributor to GDP and employment growth in recent years. The sector expanded
14 percent in nominal terms (7.5 percent annually in real terms) between 2000 and 2013, with strong growth
across all segments (Figure 38), with the most rapid growth in has come in locally traded activities like retail and
household enterprises. Despite the relatively disappointing performance of the International Financial Services
Center (IFSC)42, modern services sectors like finance, communications, and business services remain important
in Botswana (Figure 39) and continue to grow moderately well. Investments in projects like the Innovation Hub
indicates continued emphasis on developing Botswana as a ‘knowledge’ or ‘headquarters’ economy, leveraging
the strength of Botswana’s macro environment, relatively good infrastructure, and its educated population
(although constraints in the latter two represent important barriers to growth in the sector).

framework and tax concessions. As of 2012 IFSC had attracted less than 50 firms. Numerous arguments have been put forth to explain
the performance, including the 2020 ‘sunset clause’ in tax concessions, lack of appropriate legislation in areas such as inve stment funds,
insufficient scope of double taxation agreements, and general lack of flexibility to respond to changing needs and circumstances in the
market (World Bank, 2012b)

Tourism, built around the country’s natural resources but with potential beyond this, remains Botswana’s most
important services export and a critical sector for employment and poverty reduction. The latest update of
Botswana’s tourism satellite accounts (2009) shows the sector accounts for up to 6.5 percent of GDP and
employs 45,000, including indirect and induced effects. The sector is also an important source of foreign direct
investment (FDI), although citizen-owned companies now account for half of tourism establishments43.
Botswana’s tourism built its success around low volume, high value, nature-based tourism in national parks and
game reserves in the north of the country. But this positioning, combined with fragile ecosystems, restricts its
expansion. The need for diversification outside of the UNESCO-listed Okavango Delta and Chobe areas is well
understood. However, growth is also limited by serious weaknesses in competitiveness. Figure 39 shows
Botswana’s competitiveness has slipped in recent years, with its global ranking (at 95th of 140 countries) in the
World Economic Forum’s Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) now well behind peers. Among the
main issues barriers to growth in tourism are the following44:
          Skills: The 2013 TTCI ranks Botswana 128th of 140 countries. This is partly driven by HIV-related issues,
           but also reflects lack of specialized tourism training (rank 94th) and difficulties in bringing in skilled
           foreign labor (125th). While the number of training institutions offering hospitality/tourism has
           increased in past years, none are singularly focused on hospitality/tourism, and specific knowledge gaps
           as well as core skills (business management, problem solving, customer service, and tourism-related
           technology) are lacking.
          Air connections: No direct, long haul connections are available and regional connections are costly.
          Visas: Many of the growing tourism supply markets, such as China and India, are not on the visa
           exemption list, often leading to significant delays.
          Land access: Investors often struggle with both land allocation and land use processes
          Conservation: Botswana has long been lauded for its strong wildlife conservation efforts, but important
           challenges exist, including decreasing wildlife numbers due to drought, habitat loss, and increased
           poaching. The situation has been exacerbated by the recent widespread use of fencing to control
           diseases in the cattle population.
          Other policy challenges: While the recent ban on hunting boosts Botswana’s conservation credentials, it
           may also work directly against the product and geographical diversification of the tourism sector, hitting
           some poor communities hard and potentially raising risks of poaching.

3.4.       Expanding trade and investment and deepening regional integration
Botswana must become a country of exporters if it is to achieve its aims of diversification and private sector
development. This is the lesson learned by many successful small countries like Singapore, Mauritius, and
Ireland. With a small domestic market, achieving the scale needed for productivity and growth requires selling
into regional markets and beyond. So while much of the recent emphasis in industrial policy and private support
has focused inward (e.g. developing local supply opportunities for government procurement), there is a need
for greater emphasis on integrating with global markets – this is what made Botswana’s traditional export
sectors (diamonds, beef, tourism) successful. And the starting point for this is through greater emphasis on
regional trade and integration.

A narrow, concentrated, and weak export base
Figure 40 shows that while Botswana has run a trade deficit since 2008, driven by consumption-driven import
growth, export performance overall has remained relatively buoyant since the crisis, with 2013 exports more

than twice their 2010 levels in nominal Pula terms. But export participation outside of commodities remains
limited, and performance is declining. In fact much of the export growth since the crisis is explained by
diamonds45 re-exports, along with the sharp decline in the Pula-dollar exchange rate46. Overall, between 2010
and 2013, the contribution of diamonds to exports was around 76 percent (and reached 84 percent in 2013).
Looking beyond diamonds, other minerals (copper-nickel, soda ash, and gold) dominate the rest of export
basket, taking the total minerals contribution above 90 percent of goods exports. Beyond this, only the beef
sector had exports of more than US$100m in 2013. Moreover, services exports, which accounted for around 15
percent of total exports in the early 2000s appear to have stagnated, and their contribution has subsequently
fallen to just 5 percent of exports in 201347.

Poor non-commodity export performance highlights a weak export base. Less than 10 percent of firms export,
and of those that do, the majority export on a very small scale (less than P100,000 per year), and to few markets
(Botswana’s exporters sell, on average, in only 2 percent of markets that import their products). Moreover, the
survival rate of new exports in foreign markets is unusually low – just 40 percent of export relationships survive
into a second year.

While mining, beef, and tourism are associated with global markets, for the majority of firms and sectors in
Botswana, taking advantage of export opportunities means selling more to the region, and in particular to South
Africa. Given its proximity48 to South Africa’s Gauteng province (the largest economic agglomeration in Africa),
its substantially favorable labor environment (including wages and labor relations), and advantages of stability
and security, Botswana should be a relatively attractive location for regional trade and investment. In the context
of the development of a SACU regional industrial policy built around the development of regional value chains,
Botswana could be positioned well to participate in regional value chains in agribusiness, light manufacturing,
and services. To date, however, such trade has been limited.

Botswana, but many of them require improved regional cooperation. Despite operating within the world’s oldest
customs union (SACU), both tariff and non-tariff barriers increasingly restrict competitiveness. A recent analysis
of the impact of SACU external tariffs49 shows that import tariffs raise the cost of inputs in Botswana‘s
manufacturing sector by an estimated 10 percent and creates a substantial bias to producers to sell in domestic
and regional rather than global markets (equivalent to a 46 percent premium). This undermines the long- term
competitiveness of Botswana‘s private sector.

Even trade within the region is fraught with barriers. Member states, including Botswana, use SACU’s infant
industry protection clause to block imports. Botswana bans or restricts imports of bread, live chickens, broilers,
and fertilized eggs, as well as cattle, and (at certain times of the year) horticulture; and places import levies on
UHT milk (40 percent), chicken (40 percent), and wheat flour (15 percent). A number of non-tariff barriers are
also in place, mainly to protect primary producers and food processors. Botswana’s own producers face similar
restrictions in trying to sell into regional markets. Overall, Botswana is the least integrated among all SACU
countries both in regional and global value chains.

Limited FDI
In a context where trade increasingly operates within global and regional value chains, expanding and
diversifying exports depends not just on the domestic firms but also on attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).
This is all the more important for a small economy like Botswana’s. According to a recent OECD report50, outside
of oil-producing countries, Botswana was Africa’s sixth most attractive target for FDI between 2003 and 2011.
However, these volumes remain small, just over 3 percent of GDP on average over the past two decades, lower
than most peers. Over the past decade, the largest share of FDI has gone into diamonds (38 percent) and other
mining, although significant investment has come into services, including financial services, communications,
real estate, and tourism51. Overall, however, non-mining investment has largely been market-seeking, with
relatively few investors establishing in Botswana to export regionally or globally.

What is preventing higher levels of FDI in Botswana, despite it having a lower effective tax rate than most peers
and being rated recently as the top FDI destination in the world52? Investment policy, while it has some
shortcomings, is not likely to be a significant barrier. As noted by the recent OECD Investment Policy Review53,
the regulatory framework for investment has been strengthened recently with laws facilitating business
establishment and strengthening investor and intellectual property protection, although some restrictions and
uncertainties remain with respect to investment and ownership (preferences for domestic investors) and access
to land. But more likely the main factors restricting FDI are similar to those that hamper the development of
domestic investors and exporters.

Part of the story is structural – why would an investor set up in Botswana and import virtually all its inputs from
South Africa only to turn around and export virtually all its output back to South Africa? The economics have to
be extremely compelling. As Section 3.5 will show, costs and other constraints make the business case difficult
except in niche situations, and existing barriers to smooth regional trade undermine many of them.

3.5.     Building a broader, deeper, and more competitive private sector
Changing the growth model and developing an export-oriented, diversified economic base relies on the presence
of a strong private sector, where entrepreneurs invest and have the competitiveness to survive and expand in
export markets. But as discussed elsewhere in this note, both the nature and competitiveness of Botswana’s
private sector has, to date, fallen short: entrepreneurship has been limited in scope and concentrated on non-
tradables; export participation has been limited; and survival of firms and exports has been low. This suggests
the constraints to private sector investment relate both to the nominal returns on investment (competitiveness),
and on the relative returns in the context of alternative sources of employment and investment. This section
discusses some of the factors impacting both of these, discussing the incentive framework and the business
environment that entrepreneurs face in Botswana.

Entrepreneurship: trending upward, but weak survival
At the heart of the discourse around private sector development in Botswana is the concern over what is
perceived as low levels of entrepreneurship. This has long been identified, and significant programs and
resources, including agencies like CEDA and LEA, were designed to address this gap. Given Botswana’s history
(there was very little established business at the time when diamonds were discovered) and the attractiveness
of public sector employment, lack of entrepreneurship is not surprising. Indeed, around two-thirds of all
university-educated Batswana were employed in the public sector as of 2010.

But the latest data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (2014), presented in Figure 42 and Figure 43
suggests the picture is not quite so simple. While Botswana has a low number of active entrepreneurs, the overall
share (20.9 percent of the adult population) is higher than in some peers and perhaps substantially above
perceptions. The data also suggests that entrepreneurialism is gaining ground fairly quickly: while just 3.4
percent of the adult population is running an established business (among the lowest in the entire survey), the
rate of new business establishment is 10.2 percent, higher than almost all peers. Moreover, close to 60 percent
of those surveyed indicated an intention to start a business – the highest among peers and nearly four times the
rate in South Africa. This picture of dynamism is supported by data from the Registrar of Companies, which
shows a high rate of company formation, running at around 1,500 per month.

                                                                                                                                   33
The big question is what drives the gap between the static and dynamic picture emerging from the survey? One
interpretation is that the long-term efforts to promote entrepreneurialism (perhaps combined with fewer public
sector opportunities) are finally bearing fruit. A less sanguine interpretation points to the extremely high
discontinuation, or failure, rates (Figure 43) and suggests there is a problem with either the quality of the
entrepreneurs (selectivity, incentives, and / or capacity) and / or with the business environment in which they
operate. The reality is we have limited understanding of how various factors come together to shape
entrepreneurship decisions and small business success in Botswana.

Moreover, there are likely to be considerable differences in how these factors shape the outcomes for
entrepreneurs with high growth potential and those in the microenterprise sector, including many informal
enterprises. Recent research54 on the microenterprise sector in Botswana shows that just one in five of them are
‘active’ enterprises (i.e. run by ‘opportunity’ entrepreneurs); the rest of involuntary (i.e. set up out of necessity
to earn an income) – the opportunity entrepreneurs tend to be younger and better educated and focus on higher
value-added businesses like manufacturing, transport, and non-retail services. While capacity constraints appear
to be a problem for all small businesses in Botswana, they may be most binding for microenterprises, which also
face perennial challenges (common across countries) of access to finance.

Openness and competition: costly protection, reluctant privatization, and distorting incentives
Attracting domestic entrepreneurs and FDI to invest in tradables in Botswana requires first a policy environment
that enables private firms to be competitive and gives them the incentive to focus on exports. While there are
clearly issues of scale and capacity in the private sector, it is also true that the domestic environment, and
government policies, have not been effective in significantly raising the bar for firm competitiveness. In fact,
through protection and incentives that raise the relative returns to focusing ont eh domestic market, they may
contribute to undermine the potential for a more competitive private sector to emerge. Indeed, this may well
be a critical factor behind the entrepreneurship question discussed above.

Part of the issue is competition. Long-standing policies to protect the domestic market for producers in certain
sectors have knock-on effects on other producers in non-protected segments of the market, as well as for
consumers. The most prominent case is in the poultry sector, where SACU ‘infant industry’ protection has been
in force for two decades. A recent study55 shows that as a result of these policies Botswana not only has the
among the highest poultry prices in Africa, but also that small farmers are increasingly squeezed out by the large,
protected players. And carrying out these policies necessarily leads to privileging certain sectors, or parts of
sectors, over others. Programs like EDD have the potential to support the development of new domestic entrants
to the market, but they need to be managed carefully to avoid entrenching already powerful firms. Ensuring
graduation of firms from local procurement preferences and emphasizing the ‘long-term’ aspects of the EDD
strategy (building firm-level competitiveness, with an emphasis on export markets) will be critical.

Some of the biggest concerns with competition arise in sectors where parastatals play a dominant role. In
telecommunications, Botswana Telecommunications Corporation (BTC) has an effective monopoly on the fixed-
line network, including the local loop, national backbone, and international gateway56. Despite government
commitment, plans to sell 49 percent of BTC have repeatedly stalled. This has contributed to a broadband
environment that is steadily declining in its regional and competitiveness – Botswana ranked 108th of 157

countries in ITU’s 2012 ICT Development Index, down 10 places from 2002. Inadequate technology and capacity
and high prices resulting from underinvestment and lack of competition has severe implications on in stifling
development of a potentially important knowledge-based services sector in Botswana. Beyond
telecommunications, parastatals dominate across the energy, transport, and communications sectors and
government is invested in firms in a wide range of sectors, including banking, insurance, real estate, education,
trade, and agribusiness.

Privatization and PPP have been prominent in government plans since 2002, and in 2009 the PPP Policy and
Implementation Framework was developed, directing the establishment of a PPP unit. But the unit remains
without a head, and no PPP legislation has followed57. Important privatizations are nearing completion, including
the National Development Bank and BTC, and BPC recently invited proposals for an independent power producer
to invest in a 300MW plant at Morupule. Overall, however, the capacity and will to implement privatization and
PPP quickly remains questionable. This not only narrows the scope of activities for domestic private sector
investment, but contributes to an environment where entrepreneurs face relatively high cost and poor quality
in critical services inputs.

Skills: poor work ethic, skills gaps, and closed market
Setting aside the incentive environment which biases against investment in tradables, entrepreneurs that persist
are faced with a host of barriers to competitiveness. Chief among these is the broad issue of access to skills and
its contribution to low productivity. Although firm quantitative evidence is difficult to come by, the issue of poor
‘work ethic’ of Batswana has been highlighted consistently in the annual World Economic Forum Global
Competitiveness Index as the single biggest constraint facing firms in Botswana, and has been echoed by
politicians and the business community. Evidence from the 2010 Employer and Employee Survey Botswana
(EESB)58, supported by a study carried out by the Botswana National Productivity Centre (BNPC)59, found the
biggest skills gaps were not technical but behavioral, with personal characteristics such as honesty, commitment
and hard work, reliability and punctuality, communication, and team work considered most crucial for
employers.

But the skills issues go beyond work ethic. Despite large investments in education, outcomes in primary and
secondary education trail objective benchmarks (see chapter 4). And while the Tertiary Education Council has
put in places measures to address quality and relevance in Botswana’s tertiary sector, there is concern that
Botswana’s system is poorly aligned with the needs of employers, having long been structured to turn out civil
servants, while the vocational system fails to address the higher level technical training needed by employers.
Moreover, slow growth in tertiary enrolment may be a barrier to innovation and Botswana’s attempts to develop
a knowledge economy. Results from the ESB indicate the number of firms citing insufficient skills as their single
most important constraint grew from 10 percent to 18 percent between 2005 and 201060, while time required
to fill vacancies is growing, despite high levels of unemployment.

Constraints to accessing skills are aggravated by a restrictive regime for obtaining work permits for foreign skilled
workers. Despite moving to a points-based system to make the process more transparent, domestic firms and
foreign investors almost unanimously cite work permit restrictions as the most serious barrier to growth and

investment. The recent launch of the ‘one-stop-shop’ at BITC may help alleviate the procedural delays in
obtaining permits, but process is only part of the issue. It is clear that deeper political considerations are at play,
and that the objectives of ‘citizen empowerment’ are driving the policy around skilled immigration. Skills
shortfalls not only reduce productivity and hinder new growth, they also contribute to Botswana’s low levels of
investment in R&D and broader innovation, both in the private and the public sectors.

Business environment: Doing Business still a work process
While work permits are often cited as the biggest constraint facing businesses in Botswana, other aspects of the
business regulatory environment also hinder the development of a more diversified and competitive private
sector. Figure 44 shows that while Botswana rates well relative to peers on some measures of the ‘Doing
Business’ index, including resolving insolvency, registering property, protecting investors, and paying taxes, it is
far behind in: i)starting a business; ii) trading across borders; iii) getting credit; and iv) getting electricity.
Substantial efforts are being made, through Botswana’s Doing Business Committee, to address these. To date,
significant qualitative improvements have been achieved in improving the administrative and regulatory
environment, but since 2010 these four areas have failed to improve significantly in relative terms.

Connectivity: trade facilitation and infrastructure gaps
Botswana’s trade enabling environment remains a serious barrier to exploiting regional and global trade
opportunities. Botswana ranked 88th of 138 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2014 Global Enabling
Trade rankings, and 145th of 189 countries in the World Bank’s 2014 Doing Business rankings for Trading Across
Borders. Its score in the latest World Bank Logistics Performance Index (LPI) 120th of 167 countries – places it
amongst the poorest global performers relative to its income level (Figure 45). Botswana’s landlocked position
and distance from ports is a structural barrier that raises costs for exporters and importers. These costs add an
average of 15-20 percent to imports – some three to four times higher than in developed countries61. In
Botswana’s case, the problem is not so much infrastructure, but scale and coordination challenges (which
contribute to high transport charges due to directional load imbalances), aggravated by regional policy issues,

charges and third-party insurance. In addition, border delays – most often linked to EDI systems for customs and
inspections by other border agencies (e.g. agriculture or health) – continue to be a significant source of cost and
time for Botswana’s exporters, who see 24-hour border posts as a necessity to help overcome the
responsiveness challenge that results from Botswana’s relatively peripheral location.

And while Botswana’s internal infrastructure is generally well developed, significant gaps remain in connecting
to regional and global markets. Road infrastructure is broadly adequate and will be improved with the
construction of the Kazungula Bridge to Zambia (construction beginning in the second half of 2014). Rail
infrastructure, however, requires massive investment if it is to support growth of the minerals sector (see Box
7) and air transport infrastructure remains at a limited scale, with no long-haul connections yet established63 -
this represents an important constraint to development of key sectors like tourism, finance, and business
services. Regional energy connections need to be strengthened further to ensure secure, cost effective access
to electricity. Finally, the recent landing of the WACS submarine cable to Namibia gives Botswana a second
option for routing broadband, which should offer potential to reduce the cost of broadband connections, which
have been prohibitive64. At the moment, however, broadband prices remain high and inconsistent access to
high-speed services represents a serious constraint to the development of Botswana’s fledgling modern services
export sector.

Access to finance: a perennial, but poorly understood, issue for SMEs
Crucial to the development of any private sector is a financial sector that ensures access to credit for firms (of
all sizes), to support start-up, expansion, and ongoing operations. Botswana has a relatively strong financial
sector that was largely unaffected by the global financial crisis65; it ranks fairly well (although below peers) on
the global rankings of financial sector development (Figure 46). It also ranks moderately well on access to
finance. Despite this, SMEs indicate they continue to face challenges in accessing credit for investment and
working capital. There are several possible reasons for this. First, as in many countries, the structure and
incentives in Botswana’s financial sector biases away from support to SMEs. With relatively risk-free Bank of
Botswana Certificates, T-Bills, and government bonds along with a largely captive market of government
employees against which lending is backed by salaries and a corporate market including large parastatals, the
fragmented and relatively high-risk SME market has been relatively unattractive. Until recently, this was
aggravated by limited competition, although recent growth of entrants has stirred some banks to focus attention
on SMEs. A third reason is related to the SMEs, which are often micro in nature and may in fact be unbanked as
individuals. Grassroots, non-bank financial institutions that could provide micro-financing services have not yet
emerged. Finally, mobile phone-based banking offers some promise to support access to finance for micro-
businesses; however, initial pilots have not gained much traction outside urban areas. Under the Financial Sector
Development Strategy (2012-16), a number of initiatives are underway to modernise many aspects of the

South Africa unless they are transiting through Botswana; while cabotage restrictions would prevent, for example, a South Africa
transporter from picking up and/or dropping off a load in Botswana as part of a trip delivering a shipment from South Africa to Zambia.

65 According to the Financial Sector Strategy (World Bank, 2012b) “ Banking system assets increased from 17 percent of GDP in 1989 to 49

percent in 2010, and bank lending increased from 8 percent to 21 percent of GDP over the same period. Significant money and capital
markets have been established. In particular there has been dramatic growth of the non-bank financial institution (NBFI) sector… the
sector has remained sound and profitable, and where problems have arisen they have been resolved smoothly through appropriate
regulatory intervention... Initiatives are currently underway to modernise many aspects of the regulatory structure, including the
preparation of new legislation governing the regulation of banks, insurance companies, and pension funds .”

regulatory structure, including the preparation of new legislation governing the regulation of banks, insurance
companies, and pension funds. To date, however, progress on implementation of the strategy has been slow.

In the meantime, the historical gap in credit to the private sector has been filled through government institutions
including the National Development Bank and, most notably, CEDA, which provides substantial and heavily
subsidized loans and credit guarantees to SMEs. However, CEDA has had a relatively poor record of success in
its lending portfolio, with very high rates of non-performing loans. While some reforms of CEDA structures and
processes may be required, poor performance also suggests there may be a lack of sufficient credit-worthy SMEs.

Overall, while finance is often noted as a constraint to investment, there is little evidence that it is indeed a
binding one. Results from the most recent World Bank Enterprise Survey (2010) show Botswana outperforms
regional and global averages in terms of the share of firms with access to credit, the share of investments
financed by bank credit, and the share of firms that perceive access to finance to be a major constraint.

  KNOWLEDGE GAPS: COST OF CAPITAL, ACCESS TO FINANCE, AND CONTRIBUTION OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
 While there is much speculation and anecdotal discussion in Botswana on the challenge of SME access to finance,
 there have been no comprehensive surveys to understand the nature of finance demand and provision in
 Botswana. Moreover, there have been few analysis to assess the degree to which interest rates over time have
 been a barrier to firm take-up. More broadly, the remains very little understanding of the degree to which
 Botswana’s financial sector is supporting or constraining investment, particularly from the domestic private
 sector. Similarly there is limited understanding of the role of access to finance in constraining development of
 non-farm self employment and microenterprises. At minimum, there is a need to carry out a baseline survey on
 SME access to finance and the contribution of bank finance to investment in key sectors.

Technology: low adoption and misplaced focus
Finally, private sector competitiveness is also hindered by low levels of technology adoption. Botswana ranks
very poorly on global measures of technological readiness and innovation (Figure 47). While this reflects
problems across the entire innovation system in Botswana, at the heart of the issue is low level of technology
use and overall weak business sophistication in Botswana – Botswana ranks 116th of 144 countries worldwide
on business sophistication in the Global Competitiveness Index. The establishment of the Botswana International
University of Science and Technology, the expansion of the University of Botswana and other institutions, and
the investment in developing the Botswana Innovation Hub, will contribute to supporting innovation and
development of the knowledge economy. Yet Botswana’s science and technology strategy biases the country
toward ‘blue-sky’ innovation, emphasizing spending on research and development and establishing an
environment for leading-edge technology development. In the context of weak business sophistication and low

technology adoption, and in a country with limited scale and still relatively low levels of human capital
development, the opportunities for growth through technology might be better oriented toward learning rather
than creating, with a subsequent emphasis on technology adoption and absorption.

3.6.    Growth: brief summary of main messages and key challenges identified
This chapter argued that Botswana needed to shift its growth model away from a reliance on diamonds and the
public sector toward a model that can deliver the broad-based employment growth that will be needed to ensure
sustainability of poverty elimination, shared prosperity, and over time, structural change. Such a model will need
to be built around development of a diversified, competitive, private sector, oriented toward export markets
and focused on activities where Botswana has or can develop strong comparative advantage. In the short-to-
medium term, this should also be supported by a dynamic and productive informal sector, including both farm
and non-farm activities that can absorb a rapidly expanding labor force.

Building a competitive, outward-oriented private sector requires improving the absolute and relative returns to
investing in such activities. This, in turn, requires: i) reforming a policy environment that incentivizes focus on
the domestic non-tradables and the public sector; and ii) improving the competitiveness of firms and the
environment in which they operate, to increase the returns to investment. The assessment of the incentives and
investment environment carried out in this chapter identified a number of issues that currently constrain the
realization of this new growth model. Table 5 summarizes these issues and identifies the channel through which
they impact the twin goals – this is analyzed in further detail in Chapter 6 and Annex 1.

4. Inclusion assessment: building assets at the micro level
It is clear from the experience of Botswana and many other countries that growth alone is not sufficient to
eliminate poverty and reduce inequalities. Moreover, for individuals, income or consumption growth – in a static
sense – is only part of the story. Broader notions of human development66, encompassing health, human capital,
freedom, and voice are all critical to individual well-being67, and contribute to ensuring the sustainability of
economic gains. This chapter focuses on the capacity of all individuals and groups in Botswana to access and
build assets, and to leverage those assets to contribute to and benefit from productive growth.
Overall, the Government of Botswana has long invested heavily in ensuring access of its citizens – regardless of
who they are, what special needs they may have, and where they are located in the country – to basic public
services, including health facilities, education, infrastructure, and social safety nets. As a general rule coverage
is broad, although gaps exist in key infrastructure and serious challenges remain in ensuring the quality,
consistency, and efficiency of delivery.

4.1.     Health and nutrition
The starting point for citizens to be in a position to contribute to society and take advantage of opportunities
afforded by growth is to ensure they are healthy and have access to the nutrients required to remain so. As
highlighted in the discussion of Botswana’s poor human development outcomes (Figure 2), health is a major
factor hindering individual capacity and contributing to poverty in Botswana. The Government recognizes this,
and over several decades has maintained a high level of investment in health. Data from the National Health
Accounts68 shows that between 2007 and 2010, health expenditure averaged 5.5 percent of GDP, among the
highest in the region and at the high end of the range for middle-income countries. This has allowed for the
development of maintenance of an extensive health network. 95 percent of the population (and 89 percent of
the rural population) lives within 8 kilometers of a health facility. Immunization coverage and antenatal service
delivery coverage are notably comprehensive. But outcomes are uneven, and the high level of spending remains
weakly associated with key outcomes like life expectancy, child and maternal mortality, and child nutrition, all
of which remain seriously out of line with expectations for a country as developed as Botswana.

HIV/AIDS: turning the corner, but impacts remain huge and widespread
One of the principal reasons for poor outcomes is, of course, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which has now been
impacting Botswana for more than two decades. Despite progress, HIV prevalence is estimated at 18.5 percent
of the general population69 – the second highest rate in the world. The impact of HIV/AIDS differs markedly by
gender and age, with rates highest among females between 30 and 50 and males between 35 and 60 (Figure
48). It is estimated that more than half of all women between the ages of 35 and 39 have tested positive for HIV.
Overall the prevalence rate for women (20.8 percent) is well above the rate for men (15.6 percent).

From the start, the government declared HIV a national emergency and committed itself to a long-term
response70. This was seen most notably in the pioneering decision to make anti-retroviral (ARV) medicines freely
available to the entire population, to ensure broad testing, and to target mother-to-child transmissions. The
results are clear to see: prevalence rates in the young adult population have declined substantially over the past
decade (Figure 49) and mother-to-child transmissions fell from 40 percent to just 4 percent (and HIV prevalence

in the 18 month to 4 year old age group has fallen to just 1.2 percent). The latter is particularly important for
reducing the inter-generational impacts of the disease on poverty and inequality. The widespread availability of
ARVs has had a huge impact in controlling the sickness and death rates linked to HIV, making HIV now a chronic
rather than a crisis situation. But there are genuine concerns that success may have bred complacency. Incidence
rates are still high, especially among young women, and evidence from the recent BAIS IV survey shows that
risky behaviors have increased71. Prevention efforts are still under-resourced.

HIV continues to impact both the scale and inclusiveness of growth. At an aggregate level, the magnitude of the
epidemic tripled crude mortality rates (deaths per 100,000 of population) in Botswana between 1991 and 2003,
and resulted in unprecedented death rates among young adults across all social strata. HIV has had a
disproportionate effect on women and children – women not only have higher rates of HIV but also bear the
burden of looking after other family members who have the disease. And while parent-to-child transmission of
HIV has been virtually eliminated, a large number of children suffer from having been orphaned. The BAIS IV
survey found 14.4 percent of children in Botswana had lost at least one parent from HIV. Finally, fiscal
sustainability of treating HIV/AIDS and its impacts will be an increasing challenge (see Chapter 5 for a more
detailed discussion of the fiscal risks associated with HIV/AIDS).

Maternal and child mortality levels far too high
The effects of HIV on households and on the healthcare system also contribute to poor outcomes on other health
indicators, including maternal and child mortality and child nutrition. Both maternal and infant mortality rates
are declining, but they remain far above global peers (Figure 50) and off track for meeting the Millennium
Development Goals. More than half of all deaths of children under five in Botswana are a result of preventable
diseases. Government is investing both to understand the factors contributing to these high rates (e.g. through
the recent establishment of a Maternal Mortality Audit Committee) and to put additional resources into local
health clinics (e.g. to improve the provision of emergency obstetric care).




71 This is attributed partly to engrained cultural norms and insufficient spending on prevention, especially on communications and other

strategies focused on behavioral change. There is also some evidence of moral hazard, as a result of the guaranteed availability of free
ARVs.

Childhood malnutrition is putting many Batswana at risk from the start
An area that may have the biggest impact on inclusion and inter-generational poverty transmission is child
nutrition (Box 9). Chronic under-nutrition (stunting) in Botswana is 30 percent higher than in South Africa and
many multiples higher than in global peers (Figure 51). Less than one in four newborn children are exclusively
breastfed for the first three months in Botswana. Diarrheal diseases continue to be a challenge and put formula-
fed children at a particularly high risk of malnutrition and death. Figure 52 shows that socio-economic status and
location both matter for malnutrition. The poorest 20 percent of Batswana children are 50 percent more likely
to be malnourished than the richest 20 percent. And a child in the rural Southwest is 40 percent more likely to
be malnourished than one in Gaborone. Data on access to medical services (Figure 53) suggests that coverage
in equitable, but also indicates that differences are more an issue of location than of income72.

72 Interestingly, while the rural Northwest is the poorest among all regions in the country, it has a relatively low rate of stunting compared

to other non-urban regions and also has a much higher rate of appropriate diarrhea treatment.
                                                                                                                                         43

On the other hand, Botswana has an extensive program of nutrition support, including Tsabana (nutritional
supplement), which is distributed to almost all households with children, regardless of income. And stunting
rates for the richest households in Botswana (22 percent) are still far above international norms. This suggests
it is not simply a question of access to food or of income. In addition to the low levels of breastfeeding (attributed
to the HIV epidemic), lack of nutritional education, poor hygiene, and intra-household distribution of food are
all seen to be part of the problem.

 Box 9: Malnutrition and development
 Under-nutrition, manifested as being underweight and having vitamin and mineral (micronutrient) deficiencies, is one
 of the world’s most serious but least addressed public health challenges. Children between 0-24 months of age are
 highly susceptible to becoming undernourished, due to their rapid growth which, if coupled with repeated childhood
 infections/illnesses and inadequate nutrition, leads to slowing/reduced growth. At an aggregate level, under-nutrition
 results in an estimated 261 million lost disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally each year73, with economic costs in
 terms of lost national productivity and growth ranging from 2-3 percent of GDP in some countries74.

 Under-nutrition has a particularly big impact on inclusion, because the effects are long-lasting and impact on a child’s
 life chances by affecting academic performance and future earnings. The effects of low weight and micronutrient
 deficiencies include irreversible physical and cognitive damage, including suboptimal brain development and reduced
 disease resistance (which increase the severity of illnesses such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria). Recent studies
 have further indicated that low-birth weight infants and stunted children may be at greater risk of chronic diseases, such
 as diabetes and heart disease75.

                    KNOWLEDGE GAPS: CHILDHOOD MALNUTRITION – CAUSES AND IMPACTS
 As discussed above the problem of malnutrition in children is deep and widespread in Botswana. It is also puzzling
 given the relative quantity and quality of financial and nutritional support provided to poor (and even non-poor)
 households. It is also not clear how extensive is the impact of malnutrition. Given the potential importance of
 malnutrition on long term outcomes, further research on these issues should be a priority.

Non-communicable diseases on the rise
Looking ahead, Botswana faces a challenge to maintain the quality and coverage of the health system,
particularly given its small, dispersed population. While HIV/AIDS will continue to a priority, other diseases
(including drug-resistant TB and potentially malaria), and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), are a growing
issue – indeed, NCDs are expected to become the leading cause of morbidity and mortality by 2030.

4.2.      Basic resources and services
Botswana’s harsh and volatile natural environment is a significant barrier to escaping poverty for the individuals
and communities in its rural areas. And low population density, makes widespread provision of basic resources
and services challenging and costly. Significant improvements have been made in access to essential services
over the last decades, but inequities in access and quality persist.

Water is broadly available, sanitation is not
For a country as arid as Botswana, access to water resources has always been a critical determinant of well-
being. Indeed, the historical development of private water syndicates as a means of financing the development
and maintenance of boreholes and dams76 is seen as a factor contributing to the persistence of inequalities in
Botswana77.
Figure 54 shows that the large majority of the population is concentrated in relatively water-scarce areas; and
that the most acute poverty seems concentrated where water is both least and most available. Access to water
is one of the few issues that have taken on an ethnic element in Botswana, with the contentious issue of the
rights of the Basarwa (San) to drill boreholes on their land in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve78.

Botswana has been very successful in ensuring wide access to clean water, with more than 95 percent of the
population having access to “improved drinking water sources”79, with a commitment to universal access by
2016. Government also subsidizes water and structures tariffs so that prices are kept low for the poor, and for
household users in general80.




76 Private syndicates (user groups) acquire water rights and are responsible for operating and maintaining boreholes / dams (as well as
paying a portion of capital costs). In return they obtain exclusive use without any charges for the water.
77 UNRISD (2012)
78 In 2010 a High Court ruling upheld the restrictions on San drilling boreholes on their homelands in the game reserve; this was reversed

in a 2011 Appeal Court ruling
79 Improved drinking water source includes piped water on premises (piped household water connection located inside the user’s dw elling,

plot or yard), and other improved drinking water sources (public taps or standpipes, tube wells or boreholes, protected dug wells, protected
springs, and rainwater collection, as defined by WHO.
80 Low baseline rates are in place for household use up to 40 liters per person per day.


                                                                                                                                        45
                                                                                                                                        45
However, despite some progress, sanitation remains a serious gap81. Only 64 percent of the population, and just
42 percent in rural areas, has access to improved sanitation. This is far behind peers (except Namibia), most of
which have achieved almost universal access (Figure 55). Just 7 percent of the poor and 11 percent of the bottom
40 percent in Botswana have use of personal or communal flush toilets; moreover, the urban-rural divide is
strong, with just 10 percent of rural households having access compared to 56 percent of urban households
(Figure 56). Poor access to sanitation undoubtedly has a significant impact on health outcomes of the poor, with
consequences for poverty and inequality.

Access to electricity remains low in rural areas
Similarly, access to electricity in Botswana remains very low by global standards (Figure 55), and is again
characterized by significant disparities in access. While BPC reports that the rural electrification rate has now
reached 55 percent, this remains low in global terms and below the NDP 10 target. Moreover, data from the
2009/10 household survey (CWIS) highlights major disparities in access to the grid both between urban and rural
households and across the income distribution. Figure 56 shows access to the grid among the richest declie (74
percent) is more than 3.5 times that of the lowest decline (21 percent) and 2.5 times that of the bottom 40
percent of the population (30 percent)82. Again, the cost of rolling out access to dispersed rural populations is a
significant barrier. As a result, public facilities have been prioritized in many remote areas. On the other hand,
to date, there has been limited use of distributed technologies (e.g. solar panels) to overcome these challenges.

Communications and transport infrastructure is relatively extensive
Limited coverage of the electricity grid contributes to low penetration of fixed-line telephony and broadband,
particularly in rural areas. On the other hand, massive expansion of mobile phone penetration opens up
significant potential for information and market access to the poor. From the early 2000s, mobile phone
subscriptions went from almost none to reach a penetration rate in 2010 of 118 per 100 population – the highest
in Sub-Saharan Africa. This expansion was made possible by regulatory reforms that substantially liberalized the

pit latrine with slab, and composting toilet, as defined by WHO.
82 Note that the specific access figures quoted in Figure 56 come from the 2009/10 household survey (CWIS) and are significantly lower

than what is reported by BPC, which cites the 2011 population census.

market over the decade83.

Road transport infrastructure is relatively extensive. On a per capita basis, Botswana has one of the densest road
transport networks in Sub-Saharan Africa. And quality is relatively good, with 80 percent of the main road
network and 73 percent of the rural network rated as in “good or fair” condition84. Figure 57 shows that the vast
majority of villages are located within 2 km of main roads, although many of the poorest villages are off the road
network or linked only through tertiary roads. In the urban context, the lack of public transportation may
increasingly become a barrier to inclusion, as poor Batswana may be forced to spend higher shares of their
income on transport due to greater distances between housing and employment opportunities.

Land and housing becoming a constraint
While the constitution provides no guarantee of right to land, government policies since independence have
ensured equitable access to land for all Batswana85. Any Motswana can apply for land anywhere in the country
and obtain a customary land right certificate, allowing use of the land for residential, grazing, or arable
purposes86. Access to the commons has a long tradition in Botswana, and the vast majority of the country’s 2 -3
million cattle herd graze on communal lands87. For the most part, access to land is inclusive, even if it is plagued
by administrative bureaucracy and time delays.




83 World Bank and BIDPA (2013)
84 Data source: WDI
85 Idasa (2012)
86 The land board issues a customary grant, which gives the recipient an indefinite right to use of the land – this right can be inherited and

transferred (e.g. through sale).
87 Although in practice, this is controlled by exclusivity of water access, which means that communal grazing tends to be organized at the

community level.

                                                                                                                                          47
                                                                                                                                          47
There are, however, some exceptions. First, from a gender perspective, while there is no discrimination in access
to land, Tswana tradition has, at least until very recently, restricted women from inheriting property (see Section
4.4). Second, the secondary market for purchasing residences is constrained by the fact that customary grants
are not accepted by banks as collateral for mortgages. While it is possible to transfer these to a common law
lease, the poor are often restricted from doing so due to lack of knowledge and the costs. Poorer farmers also
tend to be excluded from accessing commercial agricultural land due to the costs and processes (e.g. business
proposal and bank statement required) involved88. Moreover, the policy to allow commercial livestock farmers
to fence of grazing areas has cut off some poor communities from access to natural resources (see Section 5.2).

More broadly, one challenge for poor, rural communities is that while Botswana has plenty of land, much of it is
controlled for specific use. Over 43 percent of Botswana’s land is designated for conservation purposes. Another
15 percent is in use as freehold or leasehold farms, fenced grazing areas, game ranches, or mining. At the
aggregate, this still leaves a lot of land, but in some locations, accessing suitable land can be a challenge. Figure
58 shows that many of the poorest communities are located around conservation-controlled areas.

At the opposite end of the spatial hierarchy, access to land in cities, the urban fringe, and nearby urban villages
– particularly in Gaborone, but also in Francistown, Lobatse, and Kasane-Kazungula – is becoming increasingly
constrained. Pressures from urbanization are exacerbated by land allocation and tenure systems which restrict
the growth of cities. Gaborone, for example cannot expand its geographical footprint as it is hemmed in by tribal
and freehold lands. This not only limits availability of land for residential purposes, but makes it difficult for local
government to invest in the public infrastructure (roads, dams, water treatment facilities, solid waste, etc)
required to meet the needs of the growing urban population89. In theory, government has the authority to
implement compulsory purchase of land. However, to date it has tended to avoid taking this step to convert

agricultural to urban land use around cities due possibly to cost and cultural considerations. As a result, however,
land gets trapped in its lowest productivity use, and the costs for land and housing around cities face strong
upward pressures. This may raise the costs of migration and restrict the mobility of the rural poor, while also
contributing to environmental damage and lowering the quality of life for existing urban residents.

This, for example can be seen in the prevalence of overcrowded housing (typically measured as more than two
persons per room). More than 42 percent of the population is defined as living in overcrowded housing in 2010,
with around 10 percent living with 4 or more persons per room. While some argue that the practice of living
many to a room is a cultural norm in Botswana, in fact it confined predominately to the poor. Poor households
have an overcrowding headcount rate over 70 percent – 10 times that of rich households. Like other correlates
of poverty, overcrowding is biased toward: rural, peripheral areas (rural South-West had the highest rate while
Gaborone had the lowest); households where the head has lower educational attainment; and in female-headed
households. Overcrowding matters, because it is linked to poor health outcomes (spread of communicable
diseases) as well as poor educational outcomes (lack of quiet locations to study), and as such has significant
implications for inclusion.

4.3.       Education and skills
Equitable access overall
Access to quality education is among the most critical determinants of inclusion in any society, as it is central to
building capabilities at the individual level. Botswana is no different – educational outcomes are highly
correlated with labor market and poverty outcomes. Over several decades, Botswana has made large public
investments in education, averaging more than 8 percent of GDP annually, and accounting for close to one-
quarter of total government spending. This allowed for expansion of schools to reach all parts of the country,
improved equipment and materials in schools, declining (and low, in global terms) pupil-teacher ratios, improved
access to accommodation for teachers, and increasing qualifications of teachers90. This in turn has contributed
to substantial increases in enrolment and completion rates, and in reducing illiteracy dramatically among the
working age population. At the same time, changing demographics, linked to declining infant and child mortality,
is putting pressure on the secondary education system.

Botswana has placed significant emphasis on equity of access and quality. A recent assessment as part of the
regional SACMEQ91 program confirms that material and human resources are distributed equitably to schools
both across and within regions. Botswana has also been effective in ensuring equal access to education for girls
and women. The primary completion rate is higher for females than males, as is the enrolment and completion
rate for secondary education. Despite this, shortcomings in the educational system raise barriers to inclusion at
two levels: i) significant disparities remain across socioeconomic groups and locations; and ii) for all Batswana,
relatively poor outcomes raise concerns over the quality of education.

Barriers to inclusion
The net primary enrolment rate rose from around 80 percent to 84 percent during the 2000s, but this still means
several thousand children between the ages of 6 and 12 are not being educated in schools. What is unclear is
whether this actually means many children are falling outside the education system completely (i.e. never going
to school) or is driven by ages at which children start primary school (see below). Enrolment lags well behind
middle income peers (despite substantially higher spending – see Figure 59). Moreover, a large number of

                                                                                                                49
                                                                                                                 49
children do not progress from the primary to the secondary level, where enrolment drops to just 61 percent
(although it increased more than 7 percentage points in a decade), and most students leave before the senior
secondary level. These shortfalls in educational participation are biased toward the poor rural populations.
Figure 60 highlights major disparities in educational outcomes from an income and spatial perspective. The poor
tend to both start school later and finish earlier. By age 6, only 25 percent of poor children had started school
compared to 33 percent of the middle class and rich92; similarly, 49 percent of the poor finish school between
ages 15 and 18 versus just 36 percent of the rich.

One factor contributing to weak outcomes among the poor at the secondary level may be cost. While education
is free at primary level, ‘cost-sharing’ fees were introduced in 2006 –P300 for junior secondary per year and P450
for senior secondary93. Exemptions are available for the extremely poor, but for a family of five with two earners
on minimum wage, these fees would account for between 6 to 9 percent of earnings. Along with other costs,
notably transport, this may represent a barrier to some households, with implications for inclusion. Indeed, the
indicator of progression to secondary school has sharply dropped for females in 2006, when the cost recovery
fee was introduced. But most likely this is only a small part of the story, with a number of other factors coming
into play that prevent the poor from completing education. The 2010 household survey asked respondents to
indicate reasons for having stopped schooling – among those most associated with poverty were: lack of
affordability; lack of interest; family illness or death; and becoming pregnant.

At the tertiary level, Botswana’s enrolment rate (16.4 percent) is less than half the middle income country
average – Mauritius, for example, reached almost 40 percent tertiary enrolment in 2012. At the aggregate level,
the limited supply of highly educated Batswana may contribute to the particularly high returns to university
education (Figure 62). While government supports students at the tertiary level (the budget for scholarships and
sponsorships was more than P1.7 billion in 2012), much of this goes to households in the middle and upper
income deciles.

Quality concerns across the board
The second concern in education is around quality. As noted earlier, educational outcomes appear to be
increasingly insufficient to meet labor market needs. As a result, individuals are finding it difficult to leverage
their assets into productive, income-earning employment. Figure 61 shows the considerable gap in Botswana’s
student test scores relative to international peers (with the notable exception of South Africa). At the tertiary
level, too, the Tertiary Education Council is attempting to address ongoing concerns over the quality and
relevance of tertiary education, which is seen to be increasingly out of line with labor market needs. Finally,
outcomes as measured by test scores also show significant disparities between the rich and poor, despite the
efforts of government to address equity concerns. In fact, Botswana has the one of the largest gaps in test scores
between students from rich and poor households among 13 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa (only
Mauritius and Seychelles had higher gaps)94. Students from the richest 25 percent of households scored on
average 23 percent higher than their peers from the poorest 25 percent of households in reading and 15 percent
higher in math. Declining quality of education may be contributing to the situation whereby secondary school
leavers and graduates are seeing their relative gains in the labor market eroded over time.

4.4.      Financial assets
Still more cattle than bank accounts– big gap with the poor and rural
The only available global dataset on financial inclusion – Global Findex – indicates just 30 percent of the adult
population in Botswana is banked; in rural areas it is just 22 percent (Figure 63)95. This places Botswana easily
the lowest among peer countries. Moreover, Botswana shows by far the biggest gap among peers in financial
inclusion between the bottom 40 percent and top 60 percent of the population. Less than 14 percent of the
bottom 40 percent of Botswana’s population has access to a formal financial institution (compared to an average

95 The FinScope Access to Finance Survey (FinMark Trust and EConsult Botswana, 2013), which is regarded as the main source of data on
financial inclusion in Southern Africa, indicates a higher rate of financial inclusion in Botswana (as per 2009), with 41 percent banked (26
percent in rural areas), 18 percent using other formal financial products, and another 41 percent excluded. This places Botswana ahead

of 42 percent in the peer countries). The rural-urban divide is stark here, with nearly 50 percent of Botswana’s
urban residents banked versus just over 20 percent in rural areas. Gender differences are, however, relatively
limited (Figure 64).

Lack of access to formal finance makes households vulnerable to short terms shocks (e.g. illness, loss of
employment). It may also be a significant barrier to their potential to invest to build human and other physical
assets, or to start and operate a small business, although other forms of assets (i.e. cattle; and for the poor,
other small stock like goats) remain important in Botswana96. Informal moneylending is increasingly common in
Botswana. The Findex dataset indicates that in urban areas obtaining a loan from a private moneylender was
more common than obtaining it from a formal bank.

While substantial public financial assets were invested in funding a pension fund for civil servants, just 13 percent
of the Batswana are covered by a formal pension system. Government does provide a universal old age pension,
but this is insufficient a means of support, meaning that the majority of the bottom 40 percent are dependent
on family in their old age97.

Women do not appear to face significantly greater barriers in accessing formal finance. However, female-headed
households do tend to own fewer assets, including smaller land plots and fewer livestock. In addition, women
face barriers to wealth accumulation – under Tswana tradition, women cannot inherit property, such and land,
housing, and cattle. However, in 2012 a landmark ruling at Botswana’s High Court overruled these traditional
laws, setting a legal precedent that the right to equality enshrined in Botswana’s constitution overrules
customary practices.

4.5.     Labor markets
Big challenges for youth and women
Unemployment persists at over 17 percent and inactivity rates have increased substantially, meaning that little
over half of the working age population is in employment. The problem is particularly acute among youth. In the




96 Cattle are a common vehicle for wealth accumulation in rural areas (and among working-age, urban males); this is evidenced by the
fact that less than 10 percent of the country’s communally-grazed cattle are marketed in any year.
97 The Old Age Pension is a universal cash payment of P250 per month (US$33) as of 2012/13, equivalent to 37 percent of the food poverty

line (World Bank and BIDPA, 2013)

52                                                                                                                                   52
20-24 age cohort, nearly 47 percent of the population is either unemployed or inactive (Figure 65). Substantial
youth unemployment has long-term implications on labor market outcomes and earnings, and prevents
individuals from beginning to accumulate transferrable skills and wealth. It places additional burdens on families
who are often called on to support unemployed youth, as well as on the state. While the government provides
no unemployment insurance it does invest in countless training, entrepreneurship development other support
programs targeted at youth.

As discussed in Chapter 3, jobs are not being created at anywhere near the pace needed to enable young
Batswana to make effective use of their human capital endowments. The formal private sector created just 1
job for every 6 Batswana that reached working age over the last decade. And the non-farm informal sector
accounts for just over 11 percent of employment in Botswana, compared to a regional average of 15 percent for
upper middle income countries and 20 percent in resource-rich countries like Botswana98. Job creation has been
particularly weak in cities, while it has been more buoyant in rural areas, although a substantial share of rural
job creation has come in subsistence farming.

Despite significant gains over the past decade, the labor market continues to reflect substantial barriers to
inclusion of women in Botswana. Gender differences in labor market outcomes are striking: participation of
males is 13.3 percentage points higher than for females (65.7 to 52.4 percent); the employment rate is more
than 15 percentage points higher (56.6 to 41.5 percent); the unemployment rate is 7 percentage points lower
(13.8 to 20.8 percent); and men earn 29 percent more than women. The gender gap is particularly stark in the
younger age cohorts (Figure 66). This does not appear to be a function of an education and skills gap; in fact,
women show higher enrolment and performance in education through the secondary level. Rather, it appears
to be a gap in how the multiple roles of females in society (as mothers, carers, managers of households, and
earners) is managed both formally (in labor markets) and informally (culturally).

Surprisingly, the gap in labor market outcomes between males and females grew at a time during which the
fertility rate fell sharply. And while outcomes for older women have improved significantly over the past decade,
the disparity with male counterparts is even larger in these cohorts. Among the factors contributing to these
disparities is the fact that females tend to have responsibility not just for raising children but also looking after
sick family members (including spouses, parents, and siblings). In the context of the HIV/AIDS epidemic this may

have severely curtailed the potential for women to increase their participation in the labor market. By contrast,
at the highest skills levels female outcomes are at par or even ahead of males, although this is distorted by high
public sector employment99. Women are, in fact, strongly over-represented in public sector employment,
particularly at the high skill end, and in self-employment at the low skill end. They are under-represented in the
private sector across all skill levels.

4.6.        Social protection system
Modernization to improve effectiveness and efficiency
Social protection systems not only play a critical role in poverty alleviation, but are fundamental to facilitate the
productive potential of individuals in vulnerable situations and to help stem the intergenerational transmission
of poverty. Botswana has a mature and comprehensive social protection system covering social insurance, active
labor market programs, and social assistance. Overall, Botswana spends 4.4 percent of its GDP to social
protection. Botswana’s allocation to social assistance (as compared with social insurance) is relatively high
(Figure 67).

Right panel: SP=social protection

As noted in Section 2.3 spending is making a difference – the simulated poverty headcount in the absence of
social protection is 25 percent higher (at 24.3 percent)and the poverty gap is 69 percent lower (Figure 68),
suggesting that the program is most effective at alleviating poverty of the very poor rather than lifting the poor
out of poverty. School meals, old age pensions, and several forms of government aid, provided in kind or in cash,
have the largest effect on reducing the poverty gap.

Modernization of social protection programming, however, could contribute to even larger gains against
poverty, particularly extreme poverty. First, reducing the fragmentation of existing programs (Figure 68) could
help improve the efficiency of current social protection spending. At the moment, there exist many, overlapping
programs, none of which is nearly sufficient to reach all the poor. The World Bank’s Social Protection and Labor
Strategy, 2012-2022, highlights that reforms toward a systems approach to social protection can improve

effectiveness through “better designed tax/ financing arrangements, economies of scale, and common platforms
such as registries.” 100

Second, improved targeting of programs could reorient social protection spending to benefit the country’s poor.
At present, the distribution of social assistance spending is biased towards programs which by design are not
meant to target only the poor; non means-tested programs, pensions and annuities take up the majority of the
social assistance budget and are biased toward richer segments of society. For example, 45 percent of spending
in the broadly-defined social protection budget goes to non means-tested scholarships and sponsorships. These
have an important role in national human capital development, but arguably have limited impact on the poverty
eradication targets. More progressive targeting mechanisms, and/or scaling up of programs that specifically
target the poor, could increase the effectiveness of social protection to combat poverty. Evidence from across
Africa suggests that inclusion and exclusion errors are minimized when a combination of targeting mechanisms
(such geographic, categorical and community targeting, as well as proxy means testing) are adopted.

Third, social protection programs also can be designed specifically to help break the cycle of inter-generational
poverty transmission. More focus could be placed on conditional safety net interventions that promote behavior
changes (nutrition, education, and preventive health care including HIV prevention), public works that could
invest in much-needed public goods (such as sanitation) and linkages with active labor market programs. Indeed,
while several active labor market programs are in place (e.g. the National Internship Program, the Apprentice
Program, the Youth Development Fund, and the Youth Empowerment Fund), they account for just 4 percent of
spending on social protection and labor, and remain poorly integrated with social assistance programs. Finally,
existing social protection programs have limited coverage of the informal sector and integration with
community-based initiatives.

4.7.     Social cohesion, voice, and participation
Cohesive society
Despite diversity in ethno-linguistic groups 101, the Tswana (which incorporated a number of these groups)
account for 79 percent of the population. This consolidation of identity, along with a tradition of consultation
and democracy, and the lack of strong colonial institutions102, has contributed to social cohesion. Botswana is
the only country in Sub-Saharan Africa to have experienced no ethnic violence since independence, and ethnicity
has played a limited role in electoral politics. While the Botswana Democracy Party (BDP) has maintained power
since independence, opposition is substantial, and the country’s institutions are largely open and responsive.
The traditional kgotla system retains an important role and consultations at the village level, and between
government and communities, are expected.

But gaps are emerging
Yet, concerns remain that civil society as a whole is weak and overly reliant on government, all the more so given
the decline in donor funding that resulted from Botswana reaching upper middle income status. Indeed,
questions are sometimes raised over the degree to which Botswana is truly an open democracy or a
consolidation of elite interests103. While Botswana rates in the middle of peers on global ratings of ‘voice and

accountability’ (Figure 69) its performance on this component of the World Governance Indicators is below its
overall average and has slipped over the decade. While the government is open to civil society, they are also
seen to do little to support it, treating civil society more as a mechanism for service delivery than as a contributor
to policy104. Moreover, specific groups do face some challenges to ensuring voice and agency. Most notable here
are women. Following the 2014 general elections, just 8 percent of seats in parliament (5 of 61) are held by
women – this is far below peers and represents a halving of women’s participation since the beginning of the
2000s (Figure 70). It is also far below the 50 percent threshold called for in the Protocol on Gender and
Development, which Botswana has not signed. The winner-takes-all structure of the electoral system in
Botswana may contribute to relatively low success of female and other non-traditional candidates.

Concerns are also raised about voice and rights given to ethnic minorities. Most prominent is the long-running
saga between the government and the Basarwa (San), which aside from the specific conflict around their rights
in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, are generally poor, marginalized and unrepresented in national fora.
Beyond the Basarwa, there is growing public debate around ethnicity, which has contributed to further opening
of voice to minor tribes, for example through the amendments to Sections 77,78, and 79 of the Constitution,
which had previously reserved the right of permanent membership in the House of Chiefs to the 8 Tswana-
speaking tribes.105

Finally sexual minorities face significant discrimination, with homosexuality technically illegal. This prevents
representative groups from getting a seat at the table of most discussions with government.

4.8.       Inclusion: brief summary of main messages and key challenges identified
This chapter argued that Botswana has made great efforts to ensure equitable access of its citizens to the
infrastructure and services required to build productive assets and enable quality human development
outcomes. This has been achieved through heavy investments in basic public services, including health facilities,
education, infrastructure, and social safety nets, which has been particularly costly in an environment where: i)
a small population is dispersed over a large geographical area; and ii) the low starting point in terms of

infrastructure and institutions (as well as outcomes). Overall, Botswana has been successful in ensuring equity
of access, although gaps exist in key infrastructure and serious challenges remain in ensuring the quality,
consistency, and efficiency of delivery.

Improving human development outcomes and ensuring that individuals can more effectively contribute to
growth and competitiveness of the economy will require improving overall outcomes in health, where the
impacts of HIV remain significant, and where childhood malnutrition is a major blight. It will also require
improving both broad quality and equity in education and skills development and closing gaps in access to key
infrastructure in rural areas, particularly in sanitation but also in access to electricity. In addition, improvements
are needed in the functioning of key markets, including financial markets, labor markets, and land and housing,
to ensure greater inclusion of vulnerable groups, particularly women and youth. Table 6 summarizes these issues
and identifies the channel through which they impact the twin goals – this is analyzed in further detail in Chapter
6 and Annex 1:

5. Sustainability assessment: managing resources for long-term prosperity

Botswana’s long-term success has derived from its effective management in the conversion of natural resources
wealth into productive infrastructure and human capital. As this chapter will show, the future will be more
challenging, as natural resources wealth will become increasingly vulnerable, leading to a more constrained fiscal
environment and thus threatening both growth and inclusion. Overcoming these challenges will require even
more effective governance and resource management in the future. It is precisely here – in the effectiveness and
efficiency of the public sector – that Botswana has struggled in recent years, and where it will require the most
significant reforms and modernization to ensure it is able to continue on the path to poverty elimination and
shared prosperity.

5.1.      Sustainability in Botswana: a wealth accounting framework
Natural capital and wealth conversion – the numbers look good
Wealth accumulation is fundamental to ensuring sustainable growth and development. But wealth comes in
many forms – natural capital (including minerals, croplands, forests, etc.), produced capital (machinery,
equipment, and infrastructure), human capital, and social capital – all of which can be built up as well as
depleted. So growth that simply runs down assets is obviously less sustainable than growth that is associated
with maintaining and building assets. Natural capital is most critical in this assessment, as once it depletes, it
cannot be replaced. Therefore, sustainability of growth and poverty reduction depends on converting natural
resources into renewable assets, including high quality human capital, financial reserves, and physical assets.
This is measured through an indicator of changes in wealth per capita106.

The wealth accounting analysis shows that while Botswana has substantial natural capital in nominal terms
(around US$15,000 per person), it makes up only 17 percent of the country’s total wealth in 2010107,
substantially lower than resource-reliant peers like Kazakhstan (Figure 71).


This suggests Botswana has been effective in converting natural endowments into other forms of capital. Indeed,
between 2000 and 2010, Botswana’s natural capital wealth actually declined in real terms, due mainly to the fall
in value of diamonds production108; yet Botswana’s total wealth per capita grew robustly over this period – faster
than in almost all peers, most of which experienced stronger growth in natural capital wealth (Figure 72). It also
contrasts sharply with the Sub-Saharan African trend, which has seen persistent declines in wealth caused by
resource depletion without sufficient savings and investment. Botswana’s high gross savings, which have
averaged more than 40 percent of GNI over the past decade, and its relatively high levels of education




106 With annual wealth data not readily available, change in wealth per capita can be calculated based on the investments in and

depreciation of capital following the concept of adjusted net savings (which is already estimated). Where population is not static, however,
population growth needs to be factored in, since by the end of the year total tangible wealth would be shared by the larger national
population. Therefore, the measure is calculation as follows: ∆ Wealth Per Capita = Gross Saving – Consumption of Fixed Capital +
Education – Natural Capital Depletion – Population Adjustment. Negative changes in wealth per capita could be caused by either a
decrease in total wealth (i.e., increases in income are generated at the expense of asset depletion) or total wealth growing at a rate that
is lower than the growth of population (i.e., the savings rate does not keep up with population growth).
107 Note that the natural capital data does not include water. In addition, diamonds are not normally included in the measure of subsoil

assets. However, for this exercise, diamonds have been included given their critical importance in Botswana.
108 In fact, natural capital wealth increased up until the crisis



                                                                                                                                        59

                                                                                                                                       59
expenditures, have sustained a positive trend of wealth accumulation. In addition, steady growth in produced
capital and foreign assets helped to offset declining natural resources wealth.

         diamonds; Note that Botswana’s energy wealth (which includes coal, oil, and natural gas) is assessed at zero value for two
         reasons: i) according to the wealth accounting methodology, mineral reserves that are not yet in production are not included in
         the natural capital measure; and ii) existing coal production in Botswana has been assessed to have a negative per unit rent
         (see World Bank, 2014d)

Effective institutions for managing resource rents
How did Botswana succeed in converting natural to productive capital? First, it is important to acknowledge the
limitations of this accounting exercise. A critical assumption is that all public investment spending translates fully
into capital stock – a situation possibly far divorced from any practical reality109. Indeed, the degree to which this
quantitative conversion of assets has been matched in qualitative terms is the fundamental question Botswana;
and there are many reasons to be concerned, particularly in recent years.

Putting this question aside for the moment, it is certainly the case that effective management and conversion of
resource rents has been recognized as one of the principal factors behind Botswana’s historic success (see Box
10). Specifically, Botswana has done two things well. First, it has been effective in extracting resource rents
through a variety of mechanisms (e.g., royalties, taxation, dividends). Figure 73 shows that over the past 20
years, mineral revenues were equal to 83 percent of mineral rents. This is obviously thanks in large part to
diamonds (see previous discussion in Box 4). Nevertheless, the willingness and capacity of government to
negotiate such a large revenue share is almost without precedent globally.

Second, Botswana spent the mineral windfalls wisely, at least in the sense that these revenues were directed
almost exclusively to investment in physical and human capital assets rather than financing recurrent spending
– investment has been divided between physical assets (44%), education and training (42%), and health (14%)
(Figure 74). Notably, however, financial savings have been relatively limited (see Section 5.3)

Botswana’s public finance policy framework follows the principle of sustainable development in mineral-rich
countries: revenues from minerals, being derived from the sale of an asset, are used to finance investment in
other assets that will generate future income when the mineral resources are depleted. The implementation of
the asset-preservation principle has been historically monitored through the Sustainable Budget Index (SBI),

which prevents the use of mineral revenues to finance recurrent (non-investment) spending 110. For most of the
past three decades the SBI has been below 1.0, indicating the budget has been ‘sustainable’. However, external
analysis, including from the IMF argues that the fiscal balance needs to be improved significantly to ensure
sustainability of mineral wealth for future generations111.

 Box 10: Succesful institutions for managing resources wealth in Botswana
 Botswana’s long-term success in extracting resource rents and channeling them to productive activities, while avoiding
 serious governance lapses (the so-called ‘resource curse’) that plague many resource-rich countries, can be put down
 to a number of key institutions:
          Democracy and Parliament: Elections have been held regularly since independence in 1966 without major
           incidents, allowing citizens to hold to account those managing resource revenues on their behalf;
          Long-term economic planning and fiscal discipline: There is a close connection between long term planning and
           the budget. Mineral revenues can be spent only for capital projects included in the national development plan
           (NDP), and on education, training, and health. The fiscal rule and link with NDPs, which are developed and
           debated through public consultation, helps avoid ‘prestige projects’ and limits potential for corruption.
          Regulating and managing the mining sector: Botswana establishes clear, demarcated responsibilities for the
           natural resource sector, which avoids conflicts of interest: The Minister of Minerals, Energy, and Water
           Resources (MMEWR) issues prospecting licenses on a first-come, first-served basis and collects mineral
           royalties; Botswana Unified Revenue Service (BURS) collects mining taxes and dividends. Both report to
           Parliament and the Office of the Auditor-General.
          Anticorruption institutions: A transparent budgetary and procurement process (through a centralized
           procurement agency) helps prevent corruption. The Directorate on Corruption and Economic Crime was
           established in 1994 to drive the anticorruption agenda.
          Pula Fund to invest revenues: To preserve part of the diamond revenues for future generations112, Botswana’s
           Pula Fund is managed by the Executive Team of the BoB, without undue interference from the government.

 Source: ACET (2014)




110 Note that spending on health and education (even if recurrent in nature) is considered to be ‘asset building’ and therefore part of

development expenditure for purposes of the SBI rule.
111 The IMF analysis suggests that in order to fully preserve mineral wealth for future generations, the non-mineral primary balance would

need to around 5 percent of non-mineral GDP versus a level in 2013/14 of around 14 percent (IMF, 2014)
112 As discussed earlier, the Pula Fund has, to date, not ostensibly played a role as a fund for future generations.

Challenges lie ahead
Despite this success, a number of challenges lie ahead. First, questions are increasingly being asked as to whether
the quantitative conversion of assets is paying off in real terms – i.e. are these investments actually delivering
sufficiently productive assets? The issues of low productivity, poor educational and health outcomes, skills gaps,
and infrastructure shortfalls suggest there may already be a serious gap between outputs and outcomes as a
result of investment quantity not being matched by quality. Second, Botswana faces a future with significant
vulnerabilities, most notably in its natural assets but also (and relatedly) in its macro-fiscal situation, which may
make it increasingly difficult to sustain the progress toward poverty reduction, much less improve the
effectiveness of spending and drive growth. The remainder of this section discusses the challenges to sustainable
transformation of resource wealth for poverty reduction in Botswana by looking at: natural resources
management, fiscal management, and public sector management.

5.2.        Natural resources management: recognizing the trade-offs
Natural resources: a blessing and a curse
Minerals aside, Botswana relies on the natural environment for growth and sustainable livelihoods – the rural
population is highly dependent on the agricultural and livestock sector, remote communities make extensive
use of the country’s biodiversity, and tourism, Botswana’s most important non-mineral foreign exchange earner,
is intimately linked to the environment. But Botswana’s environment is also volatile and fragile. With rainfall
highly variable across space, seasons, and years, Botswana is vulnerable to floods and, on a recurring basis, to
drought, particularly in its western and southern regions. During the last 25 years, the country was affected by
at least 5 major droughts.

Moreover, climate change is likely to aggravate the existing vulnerabilities. Projections suggest that average
temperatures could rise by 2-4 degrees Celsius by 2100, with precipitation decreasing by 5 percent and dam
yields declining 10-14 percent by 2050113. This will have serious implications for water security. Certain parts of
the country may also face greater risks of food security as a result, although aggregate grain production is
expected to increase. In addition, recent outbreaks of malaria have raised concern that climate change may be
spreading the disease into parts of the country where residents have not developed immunity.

                                    KNOWLEDGE GAPS: CLIMATE CHANGE
 While Botswana is in the process of developing a climate change strategy, there is still relatively limited
 understanding of how climate change is likely to impact key resources, how these changes may affect vulnerable
 rural communities, and what implications this may have on migration and urbanization.

The importance of natural resources management is well accepted in Botswana, as evidenced by the
incorporation of sustainable management of natural resources as a priority in both NDP 10 and Vision 2016,
which states clearly: “The natural resources of Botswana are one of its greatest assets. The strategy for
protecting these resources must be based upon sound domestically based research as to the extent of mineral
and water resources, the possible implications of increases in manufacturing, urbanisation, tourist volumes or
long term changes in climate, and the effect of the use of water resources both within Botswana and in
neighbouring countries ... The results of research must then be translated into effective measures that will protect
the resource base and environment in a sustainable way so that they can be enjoyed by the citizens of the
future.”114

Water: capacity constraints, vulnerabilities, and competing demands
Botswana is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, characterized by general scarcity and high
dependency on internationally shared and trans-boundary waters. Figure 75 shows that 80 percent of
Botswana’s available freshwater resources are located outside national boundaries, in basins shared between 3
(Okavango) and 8 (Zambezi) states. In the case of the Okavango, the water source is also one of the world’s most
important, and fragile, wetland habitats. Low and unreliable rainfall, extremely high levels of evaporation115 and
flat topography result in low rates of surface runoff and of groundwater recharge. Moreover, Botswana’s
dispersed population and the significant spatial mismatch between water resources (northwest) and population
centers (southeast) make the fixed costs to deliver water particularly high. Recent experience highlights these
challenges. While severe water shortages persist in the southeast (as of September, 2014, the Gaborone dam
remains at a critical 11.3 percent of capacity, equivalent to just four months’ supply), the north of the country
experienced flooding and overloading of dams, without the infrastructure to transfer the water to the southeast.

Groundwater (boreholes) accounts for around half of all water used in Botswana (Figure 76). Availability, depth,
and quality (e.g. salinity) of water from boreholes varies substantially across the country, as does their potential
for recharge. The majority of the 25,000 registered boreholes in the country are for domestic purposes and
livestock, although wells also service some large mines and villages116. For the most part, existing boreholes are
not in imminent danger of collapse, but they are also not sufficient to support growth. Essentially, groundwater
resources are at or near their capacity for sustainable use.

Dams remain the main source of surface water, particularly for serving the large population centers in the
country. Current dam capacity is around 800 million cubic meters117, although actual yield tends to be much
lower due to sporadic rainfalls, poor conveyance, and high evaporation rates. Substantial investments have been
made in dams in recent years, notably the Dikgatlhong Dam – by far the largest in Botswana, and more are being
planned.

                                                                                                                                  63
To date, perennial rivers – of which there are two, Okavango and Chobe-Zambezi – play a limited role in
Botswana’s water use. While the Okavango already provides some limited feeds to communities in the
northwest, volumes from the Okavango tend to be extremely variable between dry and wet years. For this
reason, and due to concerns over the fragility of the critical Okavango ecosystem, large-scale water extraction
has not been pursued. But Botswana recently negotiated the right to abstract 495 million m 3 annually from the
Chobe-Zambezi, with the proviso that 75 percent of this would go toward irrigation118.

Botswana has achieved significant improvements in productivity of water use over the last 20 years – real GDP
per cubic meter of water used has grown around 3 percent per year and water use per capita has declined by
nearly 12 percent. Nevertheless aggregate water use has grown by around one-third to 200 million m3 over this
period119. Moreover, the intensity and productivity of water use varies dramatically across sectors (Figure 77).
As in most countries, agriculture is the biggest user of water – it accounts for 45 percent of all water used in the
country120, followed by mining and households, each with around 20 percent. But agriculture and mining are
also by far the least productive users of water – together they produce 20 times less GDP per unit of water than
the rest of the economy (and agriculture alone is 57 times less productive121) and almost 12 times fewer jobs. Of
course, these sectors are also critical for the economy (mining) and for poverty alleviation (agriculture), so this
may well be a cost worth bearing, but where supply constraints may require decisions around what activities do
and do not take place, it is a tradeoff that at least needs to be considered.

Indeed, supply is constrained relative to demand. Most estimates suggest that Botswana has reached capacity
for sustainable water consumption from existing internal resources. The current and planned sustainable
groundwater and safe dam yields amount to 242 million m3. Recent analysis of the water accounts122 shows that
demand is already at 200m m3 and a “business as usual” scenario will push demand to 229 million m 3 in 2020

and 286 million m3 in 2030. And this does not even take into the significant new developments in mining123. In
addition, major new projects that are targeted for economic diversification and food security – notably the ZIADP
agricultural project around Kasane124 and the huge volumes of coal from Mmamabula and elsewhere that are
slated for export or electricity production125 – all are extremely water intensive. Thus, even taking into account
the Chobe-Zambezi offtake and the major investment in regional water infrastructure, including the North-South
Carrier (NSC)126, to meet the demands of rapid urbanization, demand is likely to outstrip supply before long
(Figure 78). This has several implications.

First, some projects and policy objectives may need to be reconsidered in the light of competing demands for
water, with those that can deliver sustainable value added and broad-based employment given priority over
those that are non-renewable and/or offer less potential for growth and poverty reduction. For example,
expansion of irrigated cropland by 13,000 hectares to meet targets for food security would increase water
demand by an additional 130 million m3 annually; and expanding the livestock sector by 50 percent would
require an additional 30 million m3 annually. Ensuring sustainability may require scaling back mega projects like
ZIADP or reconsidering the possibility of finding regional solutions to food security objectives (Box 11). Second,
more efficient technologies for water supply and use (including for sanitation and industrial purposes) will need
to be prioritized in order to make substantial improvements in productivity. At the moment, 25 percent of all
water supply in Botswana is lost through the Water Utilities Corporation distribution system; additional losses
by the many self-providers such as mines and irrigators is not even tracked. One priority will be investing in
recycled water for use in metropolitan residential environments as well as for irrigation (in the southeast of the
country)127. At the moment, Botswana makes almost no use of recycled water, while in Namibia, for example,
all metropolitan water is recycled. Third, new sources of non-domestic supply may be necessary – this could
include accessing water from the Lesotho Highlands128. Indeed, Botswana needs to reassess the role of regional
markets for accessing key resources across the board and perhaps revisit its policies on self-sufficiency in the
light of resource trade-offs (Box 11).

Finally, and critical to any efforts to promote efficiency in water use and to support the shift from groundwater
to surface water, will be designing a water pricing model that continues to support low cost access to meet the
basic needs of the poor while ensuring access to appropriately priced water for commercial purposes. At the
moment, government continues to subsidize WUC to the tune of P250m a year129. And holders of rights to
groundwater still pay nothing based on use, and so have no incentives for prudent use of water or investment
in water efficient technologies. In South Africa, by contract, a resource management tariff is applied for
groundwater use. An important step toward this has been taken by recent recognition of groundwater as a
strategic resource, but putting policy into action will be critical.




123 Grynberg and Sekakela (2013)
124 Based on the original feasibility study for ZIADP, water requirements were estimated around 440m m3 (Grynberg and Sekakela, 2013);
the project set out in that study has, however, been shelved and a new feasibility study is being undertaken in 2014.
125 Export grade coal must be washed before it can be sold; coal burned for electricity also makes significant use of water. Current estimates

of water use from Morupule A and B is around 2 million m3; production of additional 600MW of electricity over the next decade is expected
to add an additional demand of 1 million m3 (IISD, 2014)
126 The NSC carries raw water south for a distance of 360 kilometers to Gaborone. Phase 1 was completed in 2000 with implementation

of Phase 2 aimed at duplicating the pipeline to carry water from the Dikgatlhong Dam. A proposed extension to deliver water from the
Zambezi would add more than 500 kilometers to the total pipeline length.
127 Treated wastewater amounts to an estimated 20 to 30 million m3 annually, but only 10 percent is currently re-used

128 A study supported by the World Bank (funded by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Cooperation in International Waters in Africa) will be

carried out in 2014-14 to assess the viability of options for Botswana to access water from the Lesotho Highlands.

Regardless of what investments are made and technologies deployed, it is critical that the intensity of water
demand, productivity, and investment costs are taken clearly into account when considering which sectors and
projects are pursued to achieve the ultimate aims of diversification, job creation, and poverty reduction. As
competition for water resources rises and water scarcity grows, it will be critical that Botswana needs to be in a
position to make careful and informed allocation strategies that prioritize the most beneficial sectors, balancing
economic, strategic, and livelihood benefits, including employment.

 Box 11: Self-sufficiency versus security: resource trade-offs and the importance regional markets
 Given the fragile natural environment, uncertain weather patterns, and landlocked location, it is natural for Botswana to
 be particularly concerned about guaranteeing security of access to key resources like food, energy, and water. Recent
 events like the spike in global food prices following the global financial crisis, and the power crisis resulting from the
 problems with Morupule B have contributed to lend weight to the arguments that Botswana needs for self-sufficiency.
 At the moment, Botswana does not have any formal policies calling for self-sufficiency. Indeed, in the case of food, for
 example, Botswana explicitly shifted its policy from self-sufficiency to security in the early 1990s. Yet, in practice there
 are stated aims to achieve self-sufficiency in some aspects of food production (for example, grain – this is part of what is
 behind the ZIADP project) and in energy.

 This is not inherently problematic, and in the case of energy, Botswana’s comparative advantage in coal and solar
 resources may make this a logical strategy. But it also should not be a strategy pursued without taking clear account of
 the resource trade-offs and the costs. On the trade-offs, as discussed in this section, self-sufficiency in food and energy
 both have serious implications for water demand. This, in turn, has implications not only on sustainability but on costs
 (accessing new water resources will require major infrastructural investments).

 More generally, recognizing costs of self-sufficiency relative to the availability, costs, and risks of alternative regional
 sources is critical. Botswana is a well-integrated state that is party to many regional agreements, including a customs
 union, a regional free trade agreement, and regional arrangements on power sharing and water. Indeed, the recent
 situation with Botswana’s power crisis shows just how important access to regional resources is for Botswana.

Energy: crisis past? Need for a more sustainable future
Given the scale of Botswana’s coal and solar resources, reliable, cost effective energy might be a source of
comparative advantage for the country. Instead, Botswana has faced an electricity crisis in recent years, due
largely to problems with the commissioning of the Morupule B plant. Since 2012, Botswana has relied on imports
for more than 90 percent of its electricity needs (Figure 79), and with the end of the long-term purchase
agreement with Eskom (designed to coincide with the planned commissioning of Morupule B), Botswana was
forced to purchase electricity at premium tariffs without guaranteed supply. This contributed to serious energy
shortfalls, instability, and rising tariffs, which hit productivity (particularly in the already-struggling
manufacturing sector) and threatened growth. It also hit the government’s budget, as it was forced to make a
cash injection of more than P2 billion to BPC in 2013.

The problem of Morupule B is of a technical nature and ultimately will be solved. However, it will take time.
Indeed, while all units of Morupule B began for the first time to operate in tandem and at their design capacity
in June 2014, all units were again down in October 2014 – this highlights the technical risks that remain. Thus,
the supply crises that Botswana has experienced in recent years are likely to recur over the next two to three
years, with implications for firms, citizens, and government finances.

Substantial new capacity is expected to come on board over the next decade (Figure 80) – installed capacity at
Morupule B is expected to increase to 4000 GWh by 2018 and to 6000 GWh by 2025130. Botswana may even
become a significant exporter of power to the region. Again, however, this has trade-offs, as coal-fired power
plants have extensive water requirements, which are likely to deplete local groundwater sources as well increase
water effluents and air pollutants. It will also massively increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Given
Botswana’s local population and industrial density, air pollution and GHG emissions may not be a top priority in
the short term. However, over time, it may need to be given greater consideration.

A more pressing environmental issue linked to electricity is deforestation. Lack of access to electricity in rural
areas contributes to a situation where the vast majority of rural households rely on fuel wood for cooking.
Estimates from FAO suggest the deforestation rate in Botswana was close to 1 percent annually between 1990
and 2010131. In the absence of alternative solutions, this will ultimately risk energy security in poor, rural
households and damage the wider ecosystems on which they rely. Several ongoing programs aim to promote
the use of improved cook stoves in rural areas; in the longer term, however, increased rural electrification will
be critical to manage this risk.

As with water, Botswana will need to confront pricing in considering the management of energy resources going
forward. At the moment, government sets an energy tariff below BPCs costs. While this amounted to around 10
percent in the past, rising tariffs from Eskom and other factors related to the Morupule crisis has contributed to
this pricing shortfall increasing to 30 percent in recent years (Figure 79), which is subsidized by government
transfers. This is not sustainable. Part of the answer certainly lies in improving the efficiency and the parastatal
through internal improvements and introduction of competition to the market. But government may also need
to consider the relative importance of energy tariffs in supporting access to electricity and the competitiveness
of firms. This highlights the direct link between industrial policy and resource management, a link which today
is not being considered adequately. A proposal has been tabled to establish a utilities regulator for water and
power, a step which would at least help depoliticize pricing.

Linked to this is the question of renewable energy, which to date has played a minimal role in Botswana. More
than 90 percent of current electricity generation comes from coal-fired plants (either Morupule or imported
from South Africa), while solar generation accounts for less than 0.1 percent of installed capacity132, despite
Botswana’s clear natural comparative advantage in solar. However, in recent years, the government has put
increasing focus on solar as part of efforts to promote energy security and facilitate improved access to rural
areas. This has included subsidized photovoltaic (PV) packages in rural villages, the commissioning of a 1.3MW
PV plant in Phakalane133, and feasibility study for a 200 MW Concentrating Solar Thermal Power plant134. In the
context of huge coal reserves, renewables are unlikely to play more than a supporting role in the Botswana’s
energy regime in the medium term, but it will continue to be important as a complement to coal.

Biodiversity: risks more far-reaching than they appear
Home to the largest inland delta in the world – the UNESCO-registered Okavango – and countless other unique
ecosystems, Botswana’s biodiversity is important in global terms. It is also critical as a driver of national growth
and diversification, and supporter of sustainable rural livelihoods. Biodiversity supports livelihoods through
agricultural production, hunting and gathering of veld products, and for commercial purposes such as game
ranching, fishing, hunting and eco-tourism. Biological resources are further used by community-based
organizations through community-based natural resources management projects for subsistence and
commercial purposes. But in the context of rapid population growth and urbanization, biodiversity resources in
Botswana are increasingly coming under threat from a variety of factors including: habitat destruction, habitat
conversion and disturbance, barriers to wildlife movement, high populations of elephants, unknown effects of
the safari hunting industry, increases in poaching, disruption of natural fire regimes, overuse and over-collection
of wild plant species, alien invasive species, climate change, and changes to hydrology and water quality of
inflowing rivers

In the Okavango, for example, human settlement growth has increased rapidly over the past decade,
contributing to land degradation and conflict over natural resources. In Kgalagadi, where just 1 percent of the
land is arable, rising populations in rural communities rely extensively on agriculture and livestock, putting huge
pressure on the land. Beyond land, rural communities are heavily dependent on wildlife and natural resources
(e.g. traditional medicines). There are strong links between poverty in rural communities and risks to
biodiversity, including overuse as well as poaching.

Any decision to monetize coal resources – whether through export of coal or energy – will have consequences
for Botswana’s natural environment, which will in turn impact the potential for the development of other
renewable sectors like tourism. For example, based on projections of increased output of coal-fired power
generation, annual emissions of greenhouse gases will be 2.0 to 2.4 times their 2012 levels by 2030135. While the
effects may be mitigated, it is important to recognize that the decisions taken may be irreversible.

Conflicts in resource demands across communities and industries require careful management and an
understanding of the tradeoffs involved in policy decisions. For example, fencing of grazing land on commercial
cattle farms is a critical step to ensure access to EU export markets. But has implications for local communities,
who lose access to resources, and the to the tourism sector, which for example, is faced with disruptions to
traditional wildlife migration routes. Similar to the situation with water, there are costs and benefits that can be

quantified so that policy decisions can be taken with recognition of the tradeoffs. There are also clear
complementarities in ensuring an environment that facilitates key industries like tourism while also supporting
sustainable livelihoods for poor communities. The launch of a National Biodiversity Strategy in 2014 will be a
critical step in providing both the information and the policy framework to put such considerations into action.

5.3.      Fiscal management: what is the right size for Botswana’s government in the future?
Fiscal and financial management is central to the conversion of natural endowments to productive assets. This
includes effective and sustainable revenue extraction, well-targeted and controlled spending, and a sound
investment and debt management strategy. Historically Botswana has been broadly successful in all three of
these areas, although shortfalls in each of them raise risks for the sustainability of growth and poverty reduction.
This is particularly salient given that the fiscal environment in which government operates will surely become
increasingly less comfortable in the future.

First, excessive reliance on volatile and vulnerable revenue streams make it critical for Botswana to continue to
(re) build financial buffers, but it also underscores the importance of developing broader, more sustainable
revenue streams. Second, while Botswana has used its mineral revenues effectively to invest in physical assets
and build short term buffers, the protection offered by these buffers has been shown to be relatively shallow,
and the government revenues have not been invested to build up long-term financial assets for future
generations. Third, while fiscal consolidation has been marginally successful, the government is still far from its
targets and the space for reduced spending (without compromising continued poverty reduction and growth) is
limited. Government will need to focus on taking out structural costs in government, while at the same time
improving the quality and efficiency of service delivery.

Vulnerable revenue streams: diamonds and the SACU Customs Pool
Botswana’s fiscal reliance on diamonds is well understood, and the country has long had a policy of building up
buffers to manage short term shocks for both fiscal and balance of payment purposes. Savings from fiscal
surpluses are deposited at the Bank of Botswana (BoB)136, and can be used to finance fiscal deficits. Similarly,
savings from balance of payments (BoP) surpluses are also deposited at the BoB and can be used to finance BoP
deficits137. To understand Botswana’s vulnerability to shocks, it is instructive to look at the most recent global
financial crisis (2008-09), when the international market for rough diamonds virtually shut down. As a result, the
current account, which registered a surplus of 15 percent of GDP in 2007, collapsed to a deficit of 11.5 percent
of GDP in 2009. Similarly the fiscal balance fell from a surplus of 5.5 percent of GDP in 2007-08 to a deficit of
almost 13 percent of GDP in 2009-10. Government did not attempt to restore fiscal and external balance.
Instead, it pursued a countercyclical policy to maintain demand and drew down accumulated financial assets to
finance the resulting deficits (as well as taking on substantial new borrowing). It is generally accepted that this
approach was successful – government stimulus enabled the non-mineral economy to continue to grow through
the crisis. But it came at a cost, significantly depleting the main financial buffers. Since then, only limited progress
has been made in rebuilding them. Foreign exchange reserves as a share of GDP are today 39 percent below
their pre-crisis level, and government net financial assets 57 percent lower (Table 7).




136 These are held in: i) the Government’s current account for day -to-day running; and ii) the Government Investment Account (GIA) – a
longer-term vehicle for managing shocks and business cycle fluctuations
137 The foreign exchange reserves are partitioned into the Liquidity Portfolio and the Pula Fund. The former portion represents
conventional foreign exchange needs to finance transactions, while the latter represents longer-term savings. Note that while the Pula
Fund is usually classified as a Sovereign Wealth Fund, it does not have a separate legal existence. Moreover, there is a lack of clarity in its
objectives, in terms of whether it is for short-term stabilization purposes only, or is intended to have an intergenerational savings
component.

                                                                                                                                          69

As discussed in Box 5, simulations suggest that Botswana’s fiscal buffers remain sufficient to manage another
shock of the size of the 2008-09 global financial crisis, but not much beyond it. More importantly, the longer-
term decline in diamonds revenue (starting from the late 2020s) will quickly create both fiscal and balance of
payments problems. It is therefore important in the short term that Botswana continues to rebuild fiscal buffers
to better withstand shocks and manage the transition to a non-diamonds economy. This will require further
attention to fiscal consolidation (see below).

It also highlights the continuing importance of diversifying the revenue base, an area where Botswana has
already had some success. Indeed, even while minerals revenues have continued to grow in nominal terms, their
share of government revenue has declined steadily, from consistently above 50 percent in the early 2000s to
just above 30 percent today. Part of this has come from expansion of tax revenues through a broader non-
mineral income tax base, as well as through growing fees and other levies; together, these have grown from just
20 percent of revenues a decade ago to more than 30 percent today (Figure 81). The other major piece of the
story is the rapid growth of revenues from the SACU customs pool, following the renegotiated revenue-sharing
formula which came into effect in 2005138. The SACU customs pool contribution shot up from just 15 percent of
revenues in the period 2000-05 to 25 percent just 5 years later – a growth of 25 percent annually over this period.
They are now the largest contributor to the budget, accounting in 2012-13 for almost 35 percent of revenues.

But SACU revenues have proven volatile (Figure 82), and although the two year lag between collection and
distribution at least allows for advanced planning, their volatility again underscores the critical importance of
Botswana having adequate buffers. Perhaps more important, like diamonds, the future of SACU revenues may

be less abundant than its present. Discussions on a revision to the SACU revenue sharing formula have been
going on for years with no resolution in sight. More recently, South Africa has become more outspoken over its
unhappiness with the formula139, and there has been speculation that radical changes to the formula, or even to
SACU itself, may be imminent. Whatever the ultimate result, Botswana (along with Namibia) is likely to be on
the losing end of any change to the formula (as the richest country in the region and a net recipient in the
sharing). In this context, Botswana rising fiscal dependence on SACU revenues raises vulnerabilities.

In this context, it is imperative that Botswana continue to expand its revenue base to find more diversified and
sustainable sources of income. Of course, extracting revenues from new, non-diamonds minerals developments
– particularly around coal – will be an important priority. However, the potential scale of these revenues needs
to be kept in perspective. They will not be inconsequential, but neither will they come anywhere close to
replacing the hole that will be left by declining diamonds revenue (see Box 12). Therefore, the focus on building
sustainable revenues must go much wider. The newly proposed fiscal rule that aims to require a minimum
collection of 30 percent of non-mining revenue to non-mining GDP will help in this regard. So too will ongoing
efforts by BURS to bring a larger share of the population into the tax system. Further reforms to simplify the tax
system and close many loopholes that enable firms and individuals to avoid taxes (for example, the many tax
write offs that can be taken again agricultural costs and incomes, even by wealthy urban residents who maintain
cattle in the countryside) will also be needed.

 Box 12: Coal as a revenue stream – assessing the potential
 While Botswana has large reserves of coal, monetizing them will still require major investments in export infrastructure
 (see Box 7), which are yet proven to be commercially viable. The analysis below does not evaluate these projects, but
 instead focuses on potential fiscal revenue impacts based on different potential export coal scenarios. The analysis is
 based on the following scenarios:

   Scenario                    Export Volumes (mtpa)                  Comment
                        2020           2030          2040

 Other assumptions
 Coal price: P300/tonne fob mine mouth, constant throughout the projection period, in real 2012 prices (equivalent to
 approx. US$ 40/t)140.
 Tax revenues: royalties (3%); profits taxes (25%); withholding taxes on dividends and interest (10%).
 Other parameters: taxable profit as % of gross output (20%); dividends as % of post-tax profits (67%); interest costs as %
 of total costs (10%).
 Other economic variables: the scenarios also incorporate projections of diamond output, exports and revenues; other
 minerals and non-mining output; fiscal revenues and spending, prepared by Econsult Botswana.
 Government participation: it is assumed that GoB does not exercise its option to acquire up to a 15% equity stake in coal
 mining projects (at cost) at the time of granting a mining licence. If it does exercise this option, it will involve upfront
 costs (to meet GoB’s share of equity investment costs), but yielding higher fu ture revenues.




139 South Africa essentially subsidizes the other countries of SACU through the revenue sharing formula (most notably Lesotho and

Swaziland, but to a lesser degree also Namibia and Botswana). The other members argue it is compensation for the costs imposed on
them by South Africa’s trade and industrial policy (which determines SACU’s tariff -setting)
140 Additional costs of loading transport and port handling fees would add approximately US$ 50/t to give a fob onboard ship price of US$

90 (which is higher than the current world market price).

                                                                                                                                     71
                                                                                                                                      71
 The projections indicate that the economic contribution (fiscal revenues and exports) of coal mining will increase sharply
 under all scenarios, albeit from a very low base. Revenues would reach close to P2,500m by 2020 and nearly P7,000m by
 2040 under a moderate growth scenario (a high growth scenario would put 2040 revenues over P11,500m). Nevertheless,
 fiscal revenues from coal are likely to remain lower than fiscal revenues from diamonds in nominal terms, through to at
 least 2040, despite the decline in diamonds (Figure 83). The reason for this is threefold. First, the value of diamond
 exports is projected to remain higher than that of coal exports until at least 2030, and even after that time coal exports
 will only exceed diamond exports only under the “High Coal” scenario. Second, the profitability of diamond mining
 remains much higher than that of coal mining. And third, the effective tax rate on diamond mining profits is much higher
 than that on coal mining.

 As a result, the potential contribution of coal mining to government revenues is relatively small, even under the “High
 Coal” scenario141. Under the moderate scenario, coal revenues can be expected to peak and just above 3 percent of
 government, just one-tenth the level of diamonds today.

Has Botswana saved enough for the future?
Most countries dependent on extractive resources establish some sort of sovereign wealth fund where funds
are invested for the long term in foreign assets for the purposes of stabilization and/or savings for future
generations. Botswana’s Pula Fund is essentially the sovereign wealth fund for Botswana. While the Pula Fund
has played an important stabilization role (see further discussion in Section 5.3) it is less clear whether it is
intended to be used for inter-generational savings. In any case, the overall level savings available in the Pula
Fund, particularly following the recent global economic crisis, is far from sufficient to play the role of
intergenerational savings. Having started the 2000s at around 100 percent of GDP, the Pula Fund is now just 40
percent of GDP (Figure 85). Recent estimates suggest that after 30 years and several hundred billion Pula of
minerals revenues, less than 1 percent has been saved in the form of net financial assets142.




141 All of the results presented here are dependent on the coal price, which it is assumed is marginally above current, relatively low levels

The issue of savings also becomes relevant in the context of increasing concerns over the quality of public
investments – i.e. are these investments actually delivering sufficiently productive assets? The issues of low
productivity, poor educational and health outcomes, skills gaps, and infrastructure shortfalls suggest there may
already be a serious gap between outputs and outcomes as a result of investment quantity not being matched
by quality. This raises further questions over the capacity of public sector to deliver sustained high levels of
investment, and of the economy to absorb it. In this context, with government investments delivering relatively
strong nominal returns (estimated around 12 percent annually over the past decade – see Figure 86), it may be
argued that a greater shift toward savings over investment might be a more prudent strategy. The
announcement in September 2014 of a newly-proposed fiscal rule that would put 40 percent of mineral revenues
into an inter-generational savings fund, suggests that government is indeed committing itself to greater long-
term savings.

Given the current level of savings, rebuilding fiscal buffers will require the government to generate fiscal
surpluses in the coming years. With the stated intention to save more – for the purposes of building an
intergenerational savings fund or simply because the relative returns to saving are higher than for investing –
even larger surpluses will be needed. This implies the greater attention to fiscal consolidation.

Fiscal burdens and the need to reduce the size of government
Achieving fiscal sustainability and rebuilding buffers will depend on reducing ongoing fiscal liabilities.
Government expenditure remains at 35-36 percent of GDP, far below the 30 percent target set out in NDP 10
(Figure 87). But reducing expenditures in an environment where the government plays a critical role in poverty
reduction, employment, and growth, and where substantial investments in physical and human capacity are still
needed, is no easy task.

The distribution of expenditure has been remarkably consistent over two decades. The notable exception is the
health budget, which more than doubled as a share of spending, from just 5 percent in 1995-99 to more than 11
percent in the most recent period. This is primarily a function of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has not squeezed
out spending on other priorities in the short term, but more importantly set in place a long-term fiscal burden
(see Box 13), aggravated further by declining donor funding to the HIV/AIDS program. With an additional 5
percent of government revenues going into healthcare, finding ways to reduce the overall spending envelope is
made all the more challenging. The biggest spending category for government is education. As discussed
previously, outcomes in the sector have been relatively poor given the level investment put in. But the education

                                                                                                                73
share of expenditure has already declined in recent years, and further cuts may be counterproductive given the
improvements required.

 Box 13: The fiscal burden of HIV/AIDS
 While Botswana has one of the most progressive anti-retroviral (ARV) programs in the world, HIV prevalence remains
 extremely high (at 24% of the adult population) and constitutes a major source of vulnerability for the country . Indeed,
 the free ARV program is itself a source of fiscal vulnerability, as it has contributed to a huge rise in healthcare spending
 (per capita health spending in Botswana rose 12 percent per year between 1995 and 2012).

 Recent economic analysis143 estimates that the fiscal costs of HIV/AIDS will rise from the already high level of 10.8
 percent of government revenues in 2013 to 12.2 percent by 2021. The same analysis estimates the overall fiscal burden
 (net present value of all future costs144) to be equivalent to almost two times Botswana’s current GPD. About half of this
 comes from the fiscal burden of supporting those individuals who have already contracted the disease, reflecting the
 long-term fiscal costs of the ARV program. But it also demonstrates the large potential reduction of the fiscal burden
 that could result from improved prevention of future infections.

 At the same time that the ARV program represents a long-term fiscal burden, it is also of course, fundamental to
 addressing the huge negative impacts (including macro and fiscal) on Botswana. Looking simply from a productivity
 perspective, the impact is significant – evidence shows that absenteeism rates in the diamond mines declined rapidly
 after the ARV initiation and remained low over 2-4 years145. But while Botswana has an extensive and generous ARV
 program with high initial take-up rates (212,000 were on ARVs in 2012146), longer-term retention is lower than might be
 expected – around 86 percent at 12 months but falling to around 67 percent at 60 months. Thus, without a stronger
 program for prevention and retention, it is likely prevalence rates will remain high and sickness levels may rise over
 time, hitting productivity and while also raising further the healthcare costs.

 Beyond addressing prevention and retention, further technical and implementation efficiency gains also will be critical
 to managing the fiscal liability. There are a number of areas in which technical efficiencies could be explored, including
 through better integration with other services, improving management and coordination, and identifying efficient links
 into community systems to support prevention and treatment response.

An obvious and much-discussed target for improving fiscal sustainability is reducing the government wage bill.
This has indeed been stated policy since at least 2009. But again, implementation has been a challenge, as
illustrated in Figure 88 and Figure 91. While the nominal wage bill has continued to grow, its rate of growth has
halved since 2009. Moreover, in real terms (discounted by CPI) the wage bill is flat since 2008. Yet, as a share of
the government budget, wages have continued to rise, reaching nearly 36 percent in 2012-13 – more than 10
percentage points higher than they were in 2003-04. Thus, wages are increasingly squeezing out the available
space for other spending in the government budget. What these figures suggest is that while government has
managed to restrain wage inflation, it has failed to make headway in reducing the size of the civil service.
Government has indicated plans to start outsourcing and privatizing activities, although little has yet transpired.
Speeding up these efforts will be critical to achieving targeted reductions in the size of government and reducing
overall spending. And while privatization of the large parastatals may not be relevant for the wage bill
specifically147, many of them are heavily subsidized and represent significant fiscal burdens on government.

Overall, however, while savings can surely be found across the board through downsizing or eliminating
ineffective programs and projects (including the many moribund ones that never have their plug pulled) and
through headcount reductions, achieving cost and efficiency savings while also improving outcomes is not likely
to be achievable through any short-term program or piecemeal efforts. Instead, a comprehensive and
sustainable answer can probably only be found in a thorough modernization and reshaping of the public sector
(see section 5.4), one that aims not just to reduce costs but ensure improved value. This will involve some of the
outsourcing and privatizations noted above, but will need to go much further in order to change the way
government does business, and to improve its effectiveness and accountability.

5.4.         Public sector management: at the heart of Botswana’s challenge
Declining government effectiveness
Governments obviously play a critical role in the process of converting natural endowments to productive,
sustainable assets, through the investments they make, the policy and regulatory environment they establish,
and the institutions they oversee and shape. The role of government is all the more central in resource rich
countries, where the rents earned from natural endowments come almost exclusively in the form of taxes,
royalties, and dividends channeled to the central government. Botswana’s government and its institutions have
developed in this environment, with a primary role to distribute the gains of natural resources wealth. As
discussed, they have been very successful in many respects and over many years. Moreover, Botswana continues
to be rated well in in terms of governance. Botswana is regularly rates among the best in Africa on global
indicators of governance (e.g. Ibrahim Index of African Governance; Transparency International Corruption
Perceptions Index) (Figure 89). Effective checks and balances exist in government, and institutions on the whole
remain robust, inclusive, and transparent.

Yet, questions are increasingly being asked as to whether the approach to government that served Botswana so
well in the past, when the emphasis was on state-building and broad service delivery, still appropriate in an
environment where the role for government is more as a facilitator, and where efficiency and effectiveness are
paramount. Indeed, governance (broadly defined), but more specifically public sector management, is perceived
increasingly as a source of potential weakness rather than strength for Botswana, raising risks for the
sustainability of growth and poverty elimination objectives. This seems to be recognized, too, in some
international ratings - Figure 90 shows that Botswana trails non-regional peers in the World Governance

Public investment management and public financial management in the spotlight, but problems deeper
The performance shortfalls in public sector management have been most notable in public investment over
recent years. Morupule B project stands out in the public’s mind. But the examples of poor project planning and
mismanagement pervade the recent public sector landscape: the airport and stadium projects that not only
failed to meet the target to be ready for World Cup 2010 in South Africa, but remained incomplete by the time
the 2014 World Cup came around; the Fengyue glass project that almost brought down Botswana’s most
profitable parastatal; and delays and cost overruns in school, road, and other projects. In addition, many high
profile projects that have been under discussion for up to a decade have not moved beyond paper to become
policy or “shovel-ready” projects (or indeed, be killed off because they are deemed not to be feasible or
appropriate) – including Special Economic Zones, the Zambezi Integrated Agricultural Development Program,
and to some extent the Trans-Kalahari Rail.

Although limited forensic analysis of these projects has yet been carried out, the problems that plague public
investment management appear to be comprehensive, from planning through procurement, management, and
monitoring and evaluation. The World Bank’s Public Expenditure Review148 highlighted this concern clearly:

“Botswana has in the past been seen as a best-practice leader in terms of its programming of public investment,
but discipline appears to have been lost gradually over time. The historic abundance of resources appears to have
weakened the attention paid to cost-benefit analysis of projects. This is apparent in the emergence over the years
of project delays and increasing costs. Problems that should be identified at the screening and appraisal stages
of projects are not. Deterioration in project performance has ensued. With poor ex ante scrutiny of economic
benefits, ex post returns from public investment have fallen, even if this has not been accurately measured. Poor
planning, including poor financial management and procurement planning, is evidenced by constant delays in
project implementation.”

And while many contend that Botswana has many good strategies but simply has an implementation problem,

76                                                                                                                                 76
there is also an argument that implementation failure is partly a function of poorly designed policies, strategies,
and projects, inadequate prioritization, and failure of accountability.

                  KNOWLEDGE GAPS: PLANNING, PROCUREMENT, AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
 While public expenditure reviews have been carried out on the national and sector level in Botswana, there has
 been little research undertaken to understand the practices and procedures that are involved in project planning,
 in procurement, and project management, in order to understand better the factors shaping decision-making and
 the impacts this has, both in terms of fiscal management as well as project and program outcomes.

Linked to the problems in public investment are issues of public financial management, including the lack of a
medium-term expenditure framework (although the MTEF is now being piloted) and weak links between the
macro framework of the national development plans and the budget plans of its individual components149. These
problems go beyond capital projects, though, and appear to affect all aspects of the link between financial
planning and implementation. One of the outcomes of this situation is the chronic underspending in the
development budget, as delays shift planned spending into subsequent fiscal years. In fact, the gap between
budgeted and actual spending (as well as revenue) is significant across many parts of the government budget
and has increased in recent years (Figure 91), as noted in the most recent PEFA report150. And beyond high profile
public investment, the poor outcomes in education and skills, SME development and diversification, agricultural
productivity and to some degree health, suggest that similar problems of planning and implementation may also
be hitting long-term, programmatic activities, and smaller-scale projects as well.

The challenges outlined above go beyond public investment and public financial management, and beyond
project management to encompass design and delivery of programs as well. As discussed throughout this note,
efficiency and outcomes of key government programs and services – including education, health, and social
protection among others – suffer from outcomes that fall short of expectations, particularly given the high level
of resources they consume.

Contributing factors to the public sector challenges
Why effectiveness of public service delivery appears to be suffering in Botswana, a country renowned for good
governance and a strong civil service is difficult to identify clearly. At a broad level the delivery challenges appear
to coincide with a shift in the role of government from broad institution building (laying down the ‘hardware’ of
the nation) to more specific, targeted, and technical delivery (the ‘software’). While the first era was about blunt
coverage of infrastructure and services, the current era is more about efficiency and quality of service delivery.
The nature, structure, and culture of government required to deliver in that first era is unlikely to be the same
as the one required to deliver in the current one; yet this adaptation does not appear to have taken place.

Linked in part of this shifting requirement on the role of government, capacity is likely to play at least some role.
While the government of Botswana has a strong overall civil service, the reality in a small country like Botswana
is that the human resources available for increasingly complex, sophisticated, and highly specific technical tasks
(in water, energy, health, education, etc.) is necessarily limited.

Failure to adopt modern technologies (including ICT systems) and approaches is another factor that has been
identified across many areas of service delivery. In the area of social protection, for example, the information
systems used to manage the program are outmoded; more advanced systems are now routinely used by

governments throughout Africa, including many in low income economies. A similar picture emerges at Statistics
Botswana (see below) and across many other ministries and agencies.

Finally, lack of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of projects and programs across the board represents a serious
gap that handicaps policy and program planning in the future, as it makes it impossible for government to
understand whether or not they are meeting their objectives and to evaluate the reasons for it. The National
Strategy Office (NSO) is leading efforts to put in place a comprehensive M&E system for government. To deliver
in this will, however, require addressing accountability, which has been a long-running one in Botswana and is
linked with the previously discussed issue of work ethic. Efforts have been made to raise accountability in
government through the implementation of performance monitoring systems. In practice, however, these
systems have been difficult to manage and have had little impact. Improving accountability is part of the NSO’s
work on M&E, and most likely will require changes in culture as well as in the performance contracts agreed in
the civil service, both at the individual level and between institutions (e.g. introducing enforceable service level
agreements between government departments and agencies).

Weak statistical capacity
Behind the M&E and accountability problem is a serious weakness in statistical capacity, which hinders evidence-
based policymaking and undermines the potential to monitor the performance and impact of government
policies and programs. Figure 92 shows that Botswana’s statistical capacity trails well behind peers and
experienced a major deterioration over the past decade.

One reason for the declining performance may be the transition of Statistics Botswana (SB), which became an
independent agency in 2010. A new National Statistical Development Strategy is underway, covering nine main
areas of statistics, and support is being provided by UNDP and other donors and development agencies. But
significant attention and resources are still required to ensure that the national statistical system collects and
analysis data on a more frequent basis. At the moment, Botswana lacks frequent social, labor, and industrial
indicators. The main household survey has been conducted only twice over the last 13 years (2002/03 and
2009/10) and a labor force survey has only been conducted once in the last ten years (2008; the next is planned
for 2017). Moreover, the last household survey results were published only three years after their collection
and, as of November 2014, the detailed results of the 2011 Census have yet to be published. Such low frequency
data collection and delays in dissemination impede evidence based policymaking, and the implementation of
programs designed to address employment, poverty, and growth. Implementation of an ongoing multi-topic
household survey as a core instrument for data collection is one important step that should be taken to address
statistical shortcomings.

But lack of data is also a function of a mindset in government that has perhaps paid too little attention to costs
and outcomes. For example, one of the reasons why the pace privatization and outsourcing is so slow is that no
data exists to allow for a proper pricing of government service delivery: for example, how much does it cost to
treat a patient for TB? to provide vocational training to an out-of-work adult? of delivering electricity to a rural
village? Without an understanding of such costs it is impossible to judge the trade-offs of private supply, and the
efficiency of public supply.

5.5.    Sustainability: brief summary of main messages and key challenges identified
This chapter argued that Botswana success has been built around its effective conversion of natural assets to
built capital and human capital, through effective financial management and good public sector governance. But
the effectiveness and efficiency of that conversion is increasingly being called into question and Botswana faces
a future of much greater uncertainty in terms of natural and fiscal resources. This will require much greater
cognizance of the trade-offs inherent in using natural resources for growth, as well as more effective practices
to manage natural resources to contribute to growth and sustainability, most critically in the water sector, but
also with respect to energy and biodiversity.

Botswana’s macro-fiscal situation, while much stronger than in many countries, also faces considerable
vulnerabilities in the context of declining diamonds output. This will require greater focus on (re-)building buffers
to manage fiscal and external risks, which in turn will require government to make hard choices in delivering on
fiscal consolidation. Indeed, this is likely to require a fundamental rethinking of the scope and role of government
in the economy. It will also require a change of mindset of action in the government to adopt a more modern,
efficiency-driven, and accountability minded approach to service delivery.

Improving human development outcomes and ensuring that individuals can more effectively contribute to
growth and competitiveness of the economy will require improving overall outcomes in health, where the
impacts of HIV remain significant, and where childhood malnutrition is a major blight. It will also require
improving both broad quality and equity in education and skills development and closing gaps in access to key
infrastructure in rural areas, particularly in sanitation but also in access to electricity. In addition, improvements
are needed in the functioning of key markets, including financial markets, labor markets, and land and housing,
to ensure greater inclusion of vulnerable groups, particularly women and youth. Table 8 summarizes these issues
and identifies the channel through which they impact the twin goals – this is analyzed in further detail in Chapter
6 and Annex 1:

6. Prioritizing the challenges
Botswana does many things well, but it also faces many constraints to achieving the goals of sustainable poverty
elimination and shared prosperity: constraints to achieving jobs-intensive, private sector driven growth; to
ensuring that all Batswana can contribute to and share in the gains from growth; and to balancing competing
demands to ensure sustainability of natural, financial, and institutional resources. Prioritizing from among these
constraints is not simple, but by assessing potential impact, complementarities, and sequencing, a set of 7
broadly-defined priorities are identified for implementation. These include: i) Facilitating a competitive, export-
oriented private sector by aligning incentives and improving connectivity; ii) Increasing the returns to self-
employment by raising productivity of smallholders and microenterprises; iii) Improving health and education
outcomes by reducing the disease burden, and raising and aligning skills; iv) Ensuring improved access to water
and sanitation; v) Reforming social protection to reduce fragmentation and improve targeting, efficiency, and
linkages; vi) Modernizing the public sector through improved technology, management, and systems of
accountability; and, vii) Mainstreaming the management of scarce natural resources

6.1.    Introduction and summary of the challenges
The analysis presented in this note shows that while Botswana has made substantial progress in poverty
reduction over the past decade, both poverty and inequality remain extremely high for a country of its income
level. Fundamentally, this is because the nature of growth in Botswana has not been conducive to reducing
poverty and inequality in a sustainable way. Therefore, at the heart of the challenge Botswana faces is the
need for a new growth model, one that is employment-intensive and driven by a competitive and export-
oriented private sector.

As chapters 3-5 of this note describe in detail, Botswana faces a broad range of constraints to achieving the
transition to this new growth model, and subsequently to making continued, rapid progress toward eliminating
poverty and delivering shared prosperity. Table 9 summarizes the 30 broad challenges identified in chapters 3-
5 of this note. They are organized along the main chapters– specifically, around three pathways:
    1. Establishing an environment for private sector-led, job-creating growth
    2. Ensuring inclusion by strengthening individual and community assets
    3. Ensuring the sustainability of growth and inclusion through effective management of resources

6.2.       Description of prioritization process
Each of the challenges in Table 9 was then assessed within a ‘theory of change’ framework, shown in Annex 1
(Table 10), identifying: i) the desired results that would hope to be achieved by removing these constraints; and
ii) the logical links of how removal of the constraints would ultimately impact the twin goals of poverty
elimination and shared prosperity via the three broad pathways. For example, the high-level desired results of
addressing the challenge of ‘smallholder productivity’ is ‘improved productivity of agriculture and livestock
smallholders through adoption of appropriate technologies and methods and mitigation of risks’; achieving this
desired result would be expected to support achievement of the twin goals through the following links: ‘Supports
sustainability of extreme poverty elimination; raises farm incomes which contribute to supporting growth of the
non-agricultural rural sector’. By mapping the pathway, this approach helps to highlight key complementarities
across the challenges as well as the degree to which addressing certain challenges may be pre-requisites to
unlock others.

In order to identify priorities, each of these challenges was then assessed against a set of criteria, outlined in Box
14. A quantitative score was given for each, with the assessment of impact on achieving the twin goals weighted
heaviest. See Annex 1 for a detailed description of the quantitative assessment process; results are shown in
Table 11 of Annex 1.

 Box 14: Criteria for prioritization
 Following were the criteria used in scoring the challenges as part of the prioritization exercise. Each of the categories
           Impact on the goal of eliminating extreme poverty: To what degree would resolving the constraint (or exploiting
            the opportunity) have a direct impact on eliminating extreme poverty?
           Impact on the goal of delivering sustainable welfare improvements to the less well off : To what degree would
            resolving the constraint (or exploiting the opportunity) have a direct impact on supporting sustainable incomes
            and livelihoods of the bottom 40 percent of the population? The emphasis here is on interventions that will
            support sustainable, job-creating growth.
           Time horizon of impacts: Over what timeframe will the impact be realized? While the focus of the CPF is a 5 to
            7 year period, some of the priority issues will necessarily be longer term in nature. This is particularly true in
            Botswana, where many of the challenges are structural in nature and are focused on preparing the country for
            a more challenging environment in the medium-to-long term. The assessment, therefore, attempts to balance
            short and longer-term impacts.
           Complementarities: To what degree does the issue have influence across different domains (growth, inequality,
            sustainability) and/or would magnify the positive impact of addressing other constraints? As with the
            assessment of ‘pre-conditions’, all issues have some complementarity. Here, the assessment rated more highly
            those issues that had clear impacts across more than one pathway.
           Evidence-base: Based on the quality of the evidence, how confident are we in the identification of the issue as
            a priority? In many cases, the evidence base in Botswana – through statistics, strategies and reports – is
            relatively solid, despite the fact that data is often weak. That said, however, much of the evidence in several
            cases remains anecdotal and/or difficult to quantify (for example, the state of public sector effectiveness and
            the factors contributing to it). In these cases, issues were rated as having a lower evidence base to support the
            assessment.

                                                                                                                             83
                                                                                                                              83
             Adequacy of existing interventions: The intention of the SCD is not to identify issues that have somehow been
              completely passed over by policymakers. This is unrealistic, and indeed it would be concerning if such issues
              were identified. In fact, all of the challenges identified here are being addressed in some form (with greater or
              lesser priority and effectiveness) by the Government of Botswana. This criterion aims to identify areas where
              significant additional public intervention is warranted.


Overall, the desk analysis resulted in identifying 15 of the 30 challenges as ‘highest’ and ‘high’ priority (see Annex
1, Table 11 and Table 12). There were a variety of reasons why other identified challenges did not rank among
the top 15. Most commonly it was because either: i) they had a long pathway to impacting poverty elimination
and shared prosperity; and / or ii) there was already a fairly effective intervention in place to address the
challenge.

To complement and enrich the desk assessment, consultations were held with key stakeholders. This included a
workshop within the World Bank, soliciting input from across the global technical practices, and 3 workshops in
Botswana, with government, private sector and civil society, and development partners. Details on the
consultations throughout the SCD process are presented in Annex 2. During the consultation sessions, the
analysis from chapters 3-5 of this note was presented, along with the logic leading to the identification of
challenges and priorities. This was followed by discussion on the analysis and identification of priorities. While
overall the consultations underlined broad support for the analysis and priorities identified, the consultations
impacted the prioritization process in several ways:
            Recognizing the limitations of quantitative rankings: As expected, individuals and organizations with
             vested interests in certain sectoral and technical areas that were not identified as priorities in the desk
             analysis often made strong arguments to the contrary, and with strong technical expertise in the area,
             these arguments were of course fairly effective. This underlined the contestability of quantitative ratings
             and the importance of leaving scope for flexibility in the CPF process, by grouping together some
             identified priorities into broader categories.
            Highlighting the critical role of improving government effectiveness: Consultation sessions, particularly
             in Botswana, put strong emphasis on the priority of addressing issues related to government
             effectiveness, with many stakeholders pointing to this as the single most important priority.
            Linkages and complementarities: The consultation sessions were particularly helpful in further
             identifying the linkages and complementarities across challenges, which again support the idea of
             grouping together some identified priorities into broader categories.
            Status of ongoing interventions: The consultations were particularly helpful in providing additional
             details on the nature and status of existing interventions (by government, development partners, etc.)
             to address many of the challenges identified.

6.3.         Prioritization: final results
Pulling together the results from the prioritization exercise, Figure 93 provides an overview of the challenges
and priority interventions identified. These are shown with their links to the three pathways highlighted
throughout this note and, ultimately, to the twin goals. It is important to note here, that prioritization of some
challenges does not suggest ignoring others. All the issues discussed in this note are important to ensuring
sustainable, inclusive growth and poverty reduction in Botswana. And to some degree, government will need to
put time and resources into all of them. The purpose of the SCD prioritization is to identify those challenges that
are likely to have the greatest bearing on eliminating absolute poverty and on improving the welfare of the less-
well-off in the medium term. Thus, they are proposing an emphasis rather than a sole focus.

the population will require a fundamental shift to a new growth model, one that creates sufficient, broad-based
employment. This will require the development of a competitive and export-oriented private sector:
       Facilitating an export-oriented private sector by aligning incentives and improving connectivity: The
        need to develop a more competitive private sector is well understood in Botswana and efforts have long
        been made to support it. The question is what is holding this back? Fundamentally, it is a question of
        the relative returns available to entrepreneurs to invest in tradables. As such, the SCD focuses on two
        specific issues within the private sector development agenda:
           i.    Establishing the incentives to support an outward-oriented private sector, including trade,
                 competition, and immigration policies that ensure access to competitively priced inputs and
                 skills, and incentives to compete in tradable sectors. Skilled and talented Batswana have long
                 faced an environment where the most attractive career choice has been to join the public sector.
                 And for those looking to become entrepreneurs, the easiest and highest returns could be found
                 by focusing on domestic non-tradables and government contracts. But with a small domestic
                 market, building competitive, productive firms capable of generating significant employment,
                 firms must be looking instead to export markets. This will require a rethink of a wide range of
                 trade and industrial policies that promote national champions, localization, and ‘citizen
                 empowerment’ through protection.
          ii.    Improving connectivity: The returns to export-oriented activities in Botswana are relatively low
                 due to a variety of factors. Some of them are structural (e.g. lack of scale) and others policy
                 induced (high input costs, low productivity). While high input costs can be partly addressed
                 through the incentive environment discussed above and productivity addressed through
                 improvements in human capital (discussed below), helping to close Botswana’s connectivity gap
                 – thus increasing market access and lowering costs – is critical to competitiveness. This will
                 require a focus more on soft than hard infrastructure, including: i) improving national and
                                                                                                             85
                                                                                                              85
                 regional trade facilitation to support integration into regional and global value chains; ii)
                 improving air connectivity to open up opportunities in key sectors; and iii) improving the speed,
                 quality, and cost effectiveness of ICT infrastructure (especially broadband). From an industrial
                 policy perspective, it may also necessitate a stronger focus on sectors and activities where
                 Botswana is less constrained by geography, most notably in modern commercial services and
                 tourism.
But developing a competitive private sector capable of generating broad-based employment will take time. The
reality is that the process of structural change will take 10-20 years to achieve. During this time a large share of
the population (at least in rural areas) will still rely on farming. And even for those in the urban villages and
outside of the agricultural sector, Botswana’s formal labor market is not likely to provide sufficient income -
earning opportunities for all Batswana. Many of the poor and ‘near-poor’ that fall outside the formal labor
market will continue to face risks of falling back into poverty. For this reason, there is a need to focus on
increasing the opportunities and returns to self-employment by raising productivity of smallholders and
microenterprises:
        Raising productivity of smallholders and microenterprises: As noted above, many of the poor and non-
         poor reliant on agriculture remain highly vulnerable. Recent expansion of subsistence agriculture
         appears to have played a fundamental role in reducing poverty and inequality over the past decade. But
         it relies heavily on government subsidies and is vulnerable to a variable climate and water availability
         (especially for livestock). Unless productivity improvements can be made, smallholder agriculture may
         not be sustainable, and tens of thousands of households will remain at risk of falling back into poverty.
         By contrast improving productivity and increasing agricultural incomes is the key to developing a more
         vibrant rural economy, which will in turn create non-farm employment opportunities. The agenda for
         raising smallholder productivity will focus on establishing the right incentives for smallholders to adopt
         more appropriate technologies and methods to improve yields and mitigate risks and strengthen the
         extension system. Outside of agriculture, interventions will promote a more dynamic microenterprise
         sector, both in rural and urban areas, with a focus not only on entry into self-employment and the SMME
         sector but improving productivity within the sector through capacity building and access to services.
         Given the relatively limited existing knowledge of the sector, a starting point will be deepening the
         knowledge based to ensure that interventions are informed by a strong evidence base.

Developing a new growth model will also require a step-change in the productivity of Botswana’s firms, which is
dependent on substantial improvements in human capital:
        Human capital for employment, productivity, and human development: Botswana’s private sector
         requires a workforce with better, more appropriate skills and with a much-improved work ethic; this will
         be the key to improving firm-level productivity and driving competitiveness in diversified sectors. But it
         also requires a much-improved health environment, to ensure that all individuals have the capacity to
         contribute to productivity and are in the position to enjoy adequate human development outcomes.
         This requires a specific focus on elements of both education and heath:
             i.  Education: Raising the quality of education, with a specific focus on aligning skills with labor
                 market needs will equip Batswana, especially its youth, to participate productively in the
                 economy, whether through formal employment or microenterprises. The focus will be on
                 increasing the relevance of skills and improving intangible skills like communication and, most
                 importantly, work ethic.
            ii.  Health: This will focus on the health barriers to skills acquisition and labor market participation,
                 in particular childhood malnutrition, and the impact of disease (especially HIV) on female
                 participation in income-earning activities. Intensifying efforts to improve outcomes in HIV
                 prevention is likely to be critical over the medium term.


86                                                                                                                86
Ensuring sustainable growth of formal commercial activities, sustainable livelihoods, and quality human
development outcomes in the future will increasingly require focus on infrastructure and policies for water and
sanitation:
       Water and sanitation for growth, security, and human development: None of Botswana’s growth
        opportunities will be achievable over the long term if sustainable sources of water are not made
        available, if new technologies are not adopted, and if pricing policies are not reformed to ensure its
        efficient use. Moreover, addressing the major gaps in access to sanitation is likely to be critical to
        ensuring improved livelihoods and reducing incidence of disease and malnutrition. Interventions in this
        area are expected to focus on infrastructure development, support for regional integration of water
        resources, adoption of recycling and other technologies, and introduction of policies to ensuring water
        pricing reflects true value (and opportunity costs).

But even with greater job creation and self-employment, improved human capital, and access to resources, a
relatively small minority Batswana will fall not be in a position to participate. With a focus on reforming social
protection, Botswana has a unique opportunity to eliminate extreme poverty within the next 5-7 years:
       Reforming social protection: Not only is Botswana close to reaching the goal of poverty elimination, but
        it has a social protection system which has the scale and breadth to deliver it. Indeed, as discussed in
        this note, Botswana’s social protection system has the potential of virtually eliminating extreme poverty
        without additional resource implications. Beyond this, it has the potential to build an effective bridge to
        addressing many other aspects of the inclusion challenge, including health, education, and labor
        markets. In this sense, prioritizing social protection reform in the short term seems an obvious first step
        to addressing the twin goals. Among the priorities for the reform of social protection include adopting
        technologies and processes to improve targeting efficiency, consolidating the fragmented programs and
        introducing a single household-level grant as ‘last resort’ protection, introducing conditional
        interventions to promote behavioral changes, and more effectively linking social protection with public
        works and active labor market programs.

None of the priority interventions outlined above will deliver rapid and sustainable progress on the twin goals
without addressing fundamental enablers, including a major modernization of the public sector and improved
management of increasingly-scarce natural resources:
       Public sector modernization for effectiveness and sustainability: Delivering on any of the interventions
        discussed in this SCD requires a substantial, if not leading, role from the public sector. Improving public
        investment management, project management, and program delivery through adopting modern
        technologies, systems, and processes, and putting in place systematic and meaningful processes for
        monitoring and accountability will be fundamental to addressing the above challenges and maintaining
        sustainability.
       Natural resources management to support sustainable growth and livelihoods: Botswana’s natural
        resources will remain at the heart of the country’s success. But they are highly constrained, fragile, and
        face many competing demands. Putting in place effective systems for planning that take clear account
        of the (often irreversible) implications on critical resources will be critical to maintain sustainability over
        the medium term.


6.4.    Implementation of the priority interventions
Concerns over declining public sector effectiveness aside, Botswana overall has a capable and committed civil
service which is in a good position to implement the package of priority interventions outlined in this note.
Indeed, as discussed, virtually all of these issues have already been identified in government policy and strategy
documents and interventions are already underway in the majority of them. In some cases – for example related

                                                                                                                   87
                                                                                                                    87
to employment creation (National Employment Strategy), educational quality and skills development (National
Education and Skills Development Strategy), natural resources (Biodiversity Plan), and poverty (New Poverty
Eradication Framework) – major new policies and strategies are in the process of being launched. In other areas
(e.g. health, water, exports, etc.) masterplans and strategies have long been in place. Specific programs are in
place to target many of the issues identified in the SCD.

But the fact that strategies, policies, and programs have been in place to address what are still identified as
priority challenges suggests they have not been fully effective, and raises some questions on implementation
potential. Figure 94 provides a broad assessment of implementation potential across the 7 priority areas – it
considers both capacity and political will.

Overall, social protection reform and water sector interventions are deemed to have the best potential for
implementation in the next 5-7 years. By contrast public sector modernization and interventions to support an
export-oriented private sector are deemed to have the lowest implementation potential among the 7 priorities.
This is a function of capacity, political will, and the relative difficulty in having an impact. With regard to public
sector modernization, there no settled position in government on what is behind the problem and how it should
be addressed. On private sector development, while some aspects of the agenda are uncontroversial and easily
implementable, others may clash with goals of supporting citizen empowerment and localization through active
trade and industrial policy interventions. In areas like human capital development, there is strong political will
to support priority interventions, but achieving results can be difficult, and some capacity limitations exist.

Annex 1: Detailed description and results of prioritization process
In order to define priority interventions, each of 30 challenges identified in this note was assessed against a set
of 6 criteria shown in Box 14 of Chapter 6. For each challenge, each criterion was scored on a 1-3 basis (low to
high, in terms of importance of priority). Impact on the twin goals was separated to assess each independently:
first, assessing the impact of eliminating extreme poverty; and second, assessing the impact of the issue in
supporting sustainable growth, focused specifically around generating sustainable income and employment
opportunities for the bottom 40 percent of the population. The reason for separating the assessment of impact
into these two issues is that Botswana’s levels of absolute poverty are relatively low and may be addressed
effectively through a set of interventions that may well be different than those that are required to ensure
sustainable improvements of livelihoods. They are also likely to be shorter-term in nature.
In scoring, impact on each of the twin goals was accorded twice the weight of the other criteria.

The result was a raw score that was then converted into a rank. Where two challenges received the same raw
score, they were given a common ranking – this was the case across many of the challenges. Table 11 summarizes
the results of the desk prioritization assessment. Overall, the desk analysis resulted in converting the 30
challenges to 8 ranked sets of priorities. Those that achieved a ranking among the top 3 were marked as ‘highest’
priority; those ranked in the range of 4-5 were marked as ‘high’ priority; and those ranked 6-8 were marked as
‘secondary’ priority151. Those marked ‘highest’ and ‘high’ priority in Table 11 are highlighted and listed in Table
12. This results in a prioritization of 15 of the 30 challenges identified – 5 across each of the three main pathways.

To give a sense of the reasons why others challenges were identified as among the top priorities, Table 11
provides some very brief explanations. In most cases it came down to particularly long pathways to impacting
the twin goals (both in terms of time and the degree to which they were removed from other challenges and/or
several stages downstream) and the degree to which there was already a strong intervention in place to address
the challenge. In addition, many of the challenges, particularly in the pathway of job-creating growth were
expected to have a limited impact on elimination of extreme poverty, as the nature of the challenge often is
disconnected from the extreme poor. Finally, several potentially important challenges lacked sufficiently strong
supporting evidence.

To give a sense of the reasons why others challenges were identified as among the top priorities, Table 13
provides some very brief explanations. In most cases it came down to particularly long pathways to impacting
the twin goals (both in terms of time and the degree to which they were removed from other challenges and/or
several stages downstream) and the degree to which there was already a strong intervention in place to address
the challenge. In addition, many of the challenges, particularly in the pathway of job-creating growth were
expected to have a limited impact on elimination of extreme poverty, as the nature of the challenge often is
disconnected from the extreme poor. Finally, several potentially important challenges lacked sufficiently strong
supporting evidence.

Finally, Table 14 maps the 15 identified high priority challenges to the set of 7 priority interventions shown in
Figure 93 of Chapter 6. In some cases, challenges mapped to more than one intervention.




151 This rating of ‘highest’, ‘high’, ‘secondary’ was chosen to highlight the fact that none of these challeng es should be considered low

priority. By definition, the analysis in this note was designed to identify the most important challenges facing the country in addressing
the twin goals. Therefore, all the challenges identified here should be considered important.

Annex 2: Summary of consultations
Consultations on the SCD in Botswana were carried out over three periods: i) in development and review of the
initial concept, between March and May, 2014; ii) as part of the analytical stage, between June and August,
2014; and iii) in reviewing the draft report and selecting priorities, between August and September, 2014. The
table below provides an overview of the consultations carried out in Botswana as well as internally at the World
Bank over each of these stages.

Annex 3: Assessment of key knowledge gaps
Throughout this note key knowledge gaps have been identified. These are topics that are critical to
understanding the challenges facing Botswana, but where we have limited quantitative and qualitative evidence
to enable taking a clear position on the degree to which the issue is a priority and/or on the interventions
required to address it. Below is a summary of these key knowledge gaps. It can be viewed as a set of research
priorities for the Government of Botswana, development partners, academics, and research institutions over
the next few years.

 Knowledge gap               Description
 The informal economy        While subsistence agriculture is large and growing in Botswana, informal activities
                             outside the agricultural sector appear to be relatively small in size lacking dynamism,
                             particularly in light of limited employment creation in the formal sector. Labor market
                             surveys that cover the informal economy come out only infrequently (every 5-7 years)
                             and provide only a broad snapshot of those earning incomes in informal activities.
                             Beyond this little is known about the Botswana’s informal economy: the nature of
                             activities; the factors which contribute to informal participation; the constraints to
                             formality and to operating informally; and perhaps most importantly, the potential of
                             home-based enterprises and other informal activity in absorbing labor, supporting
                             household incomes, and moving people out of poverty. Moreover, the degree to which
                             the formal and informal economy operate as complements or substitutes (and what
                             potential there is for this to change in the future) is poorly understood
 Relative cost of capital,   While there is much speculation and anecdotal discussion in Botswana on the challenge
 access to finance, and      of SME access to finance, there have been no comprehensive surveys to understand the
 contribution of the         nature of finance demand and provision in Botswana. Moreover, there have been few
 financial sector            analysis to assess the degree to which interest rates over time have been a barrier to
                             firm take-up. More broadly, the remains very little understanding of the degree to which
                             Botswana’s financial sector is supporting or constraining investment, particularly from
                             the domestic private sector. Similarly there is limited understanding of the role of access
                             to finance in constraining development of the non-farm self-employment and
                             microenterprise sector. At minimum, there is a need to carry out a baseline survey on
                             SME access to finance and the contribution of bank finance to investment in key sectors
 Childhood                   The problem of malnutrition in children is deep and widespread in Botswana. It is also
 malnutrition: causes        puzzling given the relative quantity and quality of financial and nutritional support
 and impacts                 provided to poor (and even non-poor) households. It is also not clear how extensive is
                             the impact of malnutrition. Given the potential importance of malnutrition on long term
                             outcomes, further research on these issues should be a priority.
 Climate change              While Botswana is in the process of developing a climate change strategy, there is still
 impacts                     relatively limited understanding of how climate change is likely to impact key resources,
                             how these changes may affect vulnerable rural communities, and what implications this
                             may have on migration and urbanization.
 Planning,                   While public expenditure reviews have been carried out on the national and sector level
 procurement, and            in Botswana, there has been little research undertaken to understand the practices and
 public management:          procedures that are involved in project planning, in procurement, and project
 underlying factors of       management, in order to understand better the factors shaping decision-making and the
 declining public sector     impacts this has, both in terms of fiscal management as well as project and program
 effectiveness               outcomes. This analysis may be used as a case example to generalize on the wider issue
                             of (apparently) declining public sector effectiveness.

Annex 4: Assessment of data availability and gaps
The table below provides a brief overview of data availability and quality in Botswana, as identified during the
process of carrying out the SCD analysis.

           Broad area                    Assessment of data availability and quality
           Macroeconomic and trade       Generally good and up to date, although some important gaps
                                         (e.g. in distinguishing between public and private investment);
                                         increasing challenges with trade data in the context of rapidly
                                         growing diamonds re-exports; services trade data limited and
                                         highly unreliable
           Fiscal and debt               Generally sufficient, although less frequently updated;
                                         projections broadly sufficient but not highly reliable, particularly
                                         at the sectoral level
           Employment                    Very weak; twice annual survey of formal sector, but household
                                         surveys (capturing informal sector) carried out very infrequently
                                         (1994, 2003, 2010); data quality may also be an issue (e.g. income
                                         data limited and unreliable for non wage-earning households)
           Poverty and social            As above
           Industry, private sector      Very weak : industrial census or other firm-level data available
           Health (HIV)                  Generally good; new HIV survey (BAIS IV) released in May 2014
           Environmental                 Limited, but good data available on some aspects through the
                                         Bank’s WAVES program (natural capital accounting)
