Overview

The pathway to shared prosperity in Poland is built around growth, inclusion, and sustainability
objectives, but success will ultimately depend on a more strategic, effective, and accountable state.
Poland has done remarkably well, boasting strong growth over three decades. Looking forward, this
Systemic Country Diagnostic (SCD) argues that a new level of sophistication is required to meet the
challenges of a rapidly aging population and evolving global economy. This includes developing a more
strategic, effective, and accountable state that can facilitate a strong consensus around consistent policies
to foster growth, inclusion, and sustainability (Figure O.1). Continued productivity growth will depend on
Poland’s ability to transition to an innovation-led growth model. This transition, in turn, will require
improved consistency and commitment to sound policies, as well as improved coordination between the
public and private sectors. Demographic trends make it critical for Poland to invest in its people, ensuring
that everyone can participate and benefit from growth. To that end, policies must be consistent—both
across sectors and between local and national government institutions—such that every person has equal
opportunity, participates in the labor market, and is able to move to where they are most productive. To
grow sustainably, a new social consensus will be needed to confront difficult trade-offs between the needs
of an aging population and the associated fiscal costs. Similarly, Poland will need to weigh the fiscal and
economic costs of transitioning to a low-emissions economy against the social and environmental costs
associated with business as usual. Consensus will be needed to ensure consistency of policies around
agreed-upon principles, commitment to staying the course, coordination across all stakeholders, and
cooperation from the private sector based on trust in government.

      Progress and Both New and Persistent Challenges
      Poland is in many respects a development success story: broad-based productivity growth over the
      past decade has translated into remarkable progress in poverty reduction and shared prosperity.
      Real gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016 was 2.5 times what it was in 1990, implying average annual
      real growth of 3.6 percent. Fast and stable growth, driven by productivity increases, was accompanied by
      the establishment and strengthening of pro-competitive institutions, market-oriented upgrading of human
      capital, and sound macroeconomic management. Moreover, Poland’s economic growth has been inclusive
      in the past decade, as evidenced by growing employment and earnings for all income groups, which led to
      a substantial reduction in poverty and stronger-than-average growth of the bottom 40 percent of the
      distribution (Figure O.2 and Figure O.3). Poland has moved from a society in which citizens were
      assumed to be equal before the law and facing nominally equal opportunities to one in which these
      assumptions have become, to a large extent, reality. Also, Poland’s economic success has been associated
      with the decentralization and public administration reforms, which led to an increased role for subnational
      governments in the country’s development and improved provision of public services.

      The future prospects for Poland require addressing the underlying constraints to shared prosperity
      and sustainable economic growth. Although extreme poverty has been nearly eradicated in Poland, the
      goal of shared prosperity continues to be challenging. First, despite improvements in employment and
      earnings, recent growth for the bottom of the distribution comes on the heels of a period when growth was
      not inclusive. Real wage gains for average workers have been slower than increases in productivity while



                                                                                      2
       the returns to labor have been growing more slowly than the returns to capital, potentially signaling
       pressures that can lead to rising inequality. Moreover, to the extent that the aspirations of the population
       are for faster convergence of incomes with the levels of Germany, perception of improvements in welfare
       differ from objective measures of well-being (Figure O.4). Poland’s ability to meet these aspirations
       quickly is limited by fiscal constraints. Poland has had a persistent fiscal deficit, and the public debt-to-
       GDP ratio has continued to rise over the past decade despite strong growth. Although public debt remains
       sustainable and its profile resilient to macro-fiscal shocks over the medium term, long-term fiscal
       sustainability has recently been weakened by the rollback in the statutory retirement age, as the number of
       people relying on the subsidized minimum pension is expected to increase given the decline in the
       replacement rates. Finally, Poland has made only slow progress on environmental challenges and faces
       significant challenges in transitioning to a low-emissions economy (Figure O.5).

advanced countries. In this context, efforts to guard against social exclusion will be needed given the
remaining disparities between regions and between local communities in access to high-quality education,
health, and other services. Finally, increasing urbanization will challenge the sustainable management of
natural resources, including water and air quality management.
Success will depend on the quality of institutions to implement sound policies in a strategic,
effective, and accountable manner. This is critical if Poland would like to move to an innovation-led
growth model, but it is also key for human capital investments so people can participate where they are
most productive as well as to guarantee fiscal, social, and environmental sustainability. Improved
consistency, commitment, coordination, and cooperation would strengthen Poland’s institutions, making
them more strategic, effective, and accountable in delivering shared prosperity.

the associated productivity gains across
sectors declined. In contrast, the contribution to productivity from firm turnover has so far remained
small. Although further improvements within and across sectors are still possible, as Poland converges
with high-income standards, continued productivity growth will be difficult to achieve unless it can foster
innovation-led growth in which more-productive firms survive while lower-productivity firms are
allowed to exit. The next five years provide a window of opportunity to prepare for this transition, during
a period when the country still benefits from generous European Union (EU) support. Enhanced
competition, removing barriers to entrepreneurship, and allocating scarce resources to maximize
entrepreneurs’ potential will require institutional changes, and commitment to such policies could
potentially disrupt the status quo.

foreign direct investment (FDI) and led to large
improvements in productivity in the past. However, mounting overregulation or increased policy
uncertainty could discourage new investors in the future. More generally, improving the consistency and
predictability of regulations should help to limit uncertainty, an increasingly important concern for
businesses.
Removing barriers to entrepreneurship and investment will also support productivity growth. Four
areas which pose barriers to entrepreneurship and investment are recognized in the report. First, Poland’s
regulatory environment suffers from discrepancies between the laws on the books and the performance of
laws in practice—largely because of the lags in judiciary proceedings. Second, there are broader
implementation gaps, including late payments to private suppliers, slow administration proceedings,
excessive reporting requirements, and frequent changes in regulations. Although these issues are present
throughout the country, there is significant variation in regulatory performance across regions that will
need to be addressed to ensure continued convergence between leading and lagging regions. Third, more
attention needs to be given to safeguarding recent advances by insulating the regulatory process from
capture by interest groups. Poland has one of the shortest comment periods for regulatory proposals of all
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, and the length of public
consultations compares unfavorably with many middle-income countries outside the OECD. Public
hearings in parliament are rare, as parliament usually decides upon laws quickly, which limits the ability
of stakeholders to inform and participate in lawmaking. Finally, there is need for greater diversification of
the capital market for financing entrepreneurial ventures. Poland’s financial sector depth is in line with its
income level, and the country performs better than its peers in access to finance for firms. Although
capital markets play a minor role in small and medium enterprise (SME) financing (as small enterprises
prefer to use their own funds), an innovation-led growth strategy requires further diversification of the
financial sector through capital market development or venture capital. Public sector facilitation that



                                                      5
would allow this type of financing, and a clear regulatory framework, will be needed to ensure
consistency of policies and coordination with the private sector. All of these challenges point to the need
for strengthened institutions, improved consistency of policies, and enhanced coordination within and
outside of government to make government more effective and accountable.

Strategic Public Investment
To address the challenge of reconciling growth with budgetary discipline, Poland must become
more strategic in terms of its public investment policy and make the best use of EU funds. Given
finite fiscal resources and an aging population, public investment will need to be more strategic, focusing
on a limited number of growth-enhancing areas with high potential and positive externalities. In
particular, the quality of trade and transport infrastructure remains still a constraint to Poland’s
infrastructure connectivity and to private sector investment. A long-term life-cycle approach to managing
and financing transport and information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure will help to
improve spending efficiency, prepare for the likely phasing-out of EU financing, and reduce the overall
infrastructure gap, including the digitalization agenda. To improve the efficiency of EU funds, increased
use of revolving financial instruments (instead of grants), private sector participation, and innovative
instruments that “lengthen” the availability of EU funds could prove effective.
An important element of a more strategic state is         Map O.1 Total Volume of Exports in Poland, by
ensuring that resources devoted to less-                                  County, 2013
developed regions are effective in reducing
differences in development outcomes. Growth has
not been evenly spread across space, with economic
activity concentrated in some cities and regions
(Map O.1). Arguably, growing disparities between
leading and lagging regions can be interpreted as a
natural result of rapid development. However,
Poland also faces differences in opportunities
across regions, with persistent differences in health
and education outcomes. For instance urban-rural
differences in math, reading, and science scores
through the Program for International Student
Assessment (PISA) were large relative to the rest of
the EU, surpassed only by Bulgaria, Hungary,
Lithuania, and the Slovak Republic. Similarly,
access to health care depends on place of residence,

businesses face important different environments in
terms of the ease of conducting business because of differences in services, regulations, access to the
judiciary, and to access to finance. It is up to the state to reduce these differences, ensuring that
individuals have equal opportunities regardless of where they were born, and ensuring businesses can
thrive based on their productive potential and not as a consequence of regulatory differences.
The focus on investments in lagging areas could focus more on building the capacity of local actors.
Although less-developed regions have so far been the beneficiaries of most EU funding, the evidence




                                                    6
shows that more urbanized and developed municipalities and counties have received a larger share of EU
funds than the rest. Continued investments in less-developed areas, could focus on improving education
and health outcomes and on promoting private sector development policies that start with building the
capacity of local actors. In general, place-based policies have not worked—and, when they have, it was
because they had broad-based coalitions of actors and rather sophisticated, capable governments. This
experience suggests that place-based policies should be driven by empowered local actors and
implemented only if coordination of multiple actors and their capacity for joint prioritization of
investments can be demonstrated. More generally, the coordination function of the government through
strengthened institutions will be critical to promote common expectations and investments of both the
public and the private sectors across regions, counties, and municipalities.
Finally, there is scope for a more        Figure O.9. R&D Spending in EU Countries as a Share of GDP,

research and development (R&D)
from its current low levels (Figure O.9), the country needs a more strategic approach to R&D policy,
streamlining the fragmented system of enterprise innovation support and focusing the existing resources
on basic research and on spurring greater cooperation between science and industry.

Sound Macro-Fiscal Policies
Finally, continued improvements in growth will depend on commitment to a sound macroeconomic
environment and greater certainty around government policies. Prudent financial supervision and
countercyclical monetary and fiscal policy are sine qua non conditions to boost productivity. Fiscal rules
have contributed to the stability of Polish public finance, and their credibility needs to be preserved. In
light of expected weaker inflows of foreign investments and the prospects of lower inflows of EU funds
after 2020, higher domestic savings will be necessary. Given the demographic trends, it becomes more
critical for the public sector to play an exemplary role in maintaining budget discipline and generating
savings in good times. Finally, strengthening budget institutions and upgrading the country’s tax system
to ensure higher-quality public finance, on both the public spending and revenue sides, will be important
to ensure public trust. Critical to this task will be the consistency of policies across levels of government

and ensuring trust and cooperation in their implementation from private agents, again pointing to the
fundamental role of strong institutions.


Enhancing Inclusion

To ensure that growth is inclusive, Poland needs to strengthen the capacity of households to
diversify their assets base and to engage productively. Despite improvements in shared prosperity over
the past 15 years, demographic changes will reduce the available labor force and strain existing health and
social protection systems. Although income inequality is low and has been declining, Poland is not
immune to skill-biased technological improvements across the globe, which could lead to a polarization
of incomes. To guard against increases in inequality resulting from skill-biased technological change,
Poland will need to improve the quality of its labor force to ensure that incomes can continue to rise
across the population. In addition, Poland continues to face exclusion of some groups, with high
economic costs for society, including the unemployed or precariously employed, rural populations, the
elderly, the disabled, women, and youth. To ensure inclusive growth, the challenge is to expand high-
productivity employment across the population, while at the same time improving the efficiency and
sustainability of the social protection system to ensure that no one is left behind. Facing these challenges
will require a more strategic, effective, and accountable state.

Skills
First, continued investment in education and training will be critical for inclusion, but it will also be
a determinant of innovation-led growth. It is difficult to achieve inclusive growth when there is still
work to be done to ensure equal opportunities in education. Beginning at the earliest stages in life, access
to early childhood education is low and unequal. Although Poland performs well in PISA scores, recent
results show that socioeconomic background and location still matter for performance in primary and
secondary education. Worryingly, planned reforms to secondary education may undermine previous
success in improving learning performance, and there are equity concerns related to the
underrepresentation of certain groups in higher education. A more effective state will be needed to face
the skills divide, coordinating interventions at the local, regional, and national levels to ensure equality of
opportunities through quality education, regardless of the place of residence, and to be vigilant of
reversals through rigorous evaluations of new initiatives.
At the same time, innovation-led growth will require frontier researchers and good universities.
Poland witnessed a substantial increase in the proportion of university graduates (Figure O.10), but
declining birth rates have induced a continuous decrease in student enrollment and a change in sector
composition. Research funding has become more competitive, but further efforts are needed to improve
the quality of tertiary education. This will require coordinated and concerted efforts by education
providers, the private sector, and the government. Such initiatives could be particularly relevant for
companies from the more innovative and faster-developing sectors of the economy, for which skill
shortages are a particular concern, including for larger firms that benefit from international
(technological) exposure through substantial FDI. Looking ahead, increased demand for skills driven by
technological change could aggravate the existing skills divide to the extent that jobs in Poland
increasingly require cognitive tasks. To ensure that this strategy is inclusive, adults will need to continue
to adopt new skills to keep up with technology and demographic changes. Unfortunately, adult learning
opportunities remain scarce in Poland, where a larger proportion of the adult population lacks basic skills
by comparison with other OECD countries (Figure O.11). Reducing the existing skills divide, and

 improving the quality and relevance of education provision and adult learning possibilities will be needed,
 alongside a strategy to improve the quality of tertiary education to ensure shared prosperity going
 forward. Government institutions will need to lead the way, coordinating approaches with academia, the
 private sector, and other stakeholders and strategically aligning its scarce resources toward the objective
 of achieving an environment where research and innovation can flourish.

long-term care within families.
Improving the quality and availability of child and elderly care has the potential to boost the low levels of
labor market participation of women in Poland, allowing them to participate and benefit from growth—
something that will become more urgent in the face of demographic changes. In addition, increased labor
force participation will require consistent activation policies regarding old-age and family benefits, which
currently provide disincentives to work. In particular, more can be done to reduce labor market
disincentives. With the introduction of the Family 500+ program and recent improvements to the
progressivity of the personal income tax, the redistributive and poverty-reducing impact of tax and benefit
policies has improved in Poland. However, the social assistance system remains complex, and the Family
500+ program may create disincentives to workforce entry (Figure O.13Figure O.3).

Worker Mobility

Fourth, reducing labor market barriers through more flexible labor contracts, better worker
protection, and improved mobility will be difficult to achieve without more strategic, effective, and
accountable institutions. Encouraging people to work is not enough to ensure inclusive growth if
workers cannot find good jobs. The nature of the labor market has been changing in Poland, with
temporary contracts (as opposed to part-time employment) as the main source for labor market flexibility
over the past decade (Figure O.14). Increased labor market flexibility has helped Poland to weather the
crisis better than other countries in the region. However, the ease of hiring temporary workers at a lower
cost for business has also led to labor market segmentation and little or no worker protection for those
unable to find permanent employment, particularly among lower-skilled workers. What is now needed are
flexible work arrangements, including part-time employment, and a reduction in administrative burdens
and implicit costs associated with permanent labor contracts. Aligning the tax and social contribution
burden for different types of employment contracts and strengthening unemployment assistance would
improve the flexibility of employment contracts while at the same time enhancing worker protection. An

agriculture for a large share of the
rural population continues to be a challenge. Poland continues to have high share of employment in
agriculture compared with other EU countries, and although it decreased since 2008, there is still large
potential for increasing productivity in that sector and reallocating labor to more productive sectors,
leading to higher incomes and broader inclusion. EU accession has greatly benefited the agriculture and

rural sector in Poland, and the country is often seen as one of the most successful new member states in
terms of taking advantage of the opportunities of EU membership. However, EU integration has not
benefited all farmers equally. The agriculture sector is still characterized by a pronounced duality and
high inequality across farmers, with 54 percent of all agricultural holdings being smaller than 5 hectares
(Eurostat 2013 data). Small farms operate on 13 percent of the agricultural land and take up 42 percent of
the total labor force in agriculture (measured in total agricultural work units) but produce only 17 percent
of the total standard output. On the other hand, good preparation prior to EU membership turned the
development of the food industry in Poland into a “success story”: above all, Poland was able to take
advantage more fully of growing export markets, particularly in the EU. Although more research is
needed, to the extent that EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments are not based on how much a
farmer produces, but rather on how much land farmers use and how they use it, CAP payments could
provide incentives to remain in agriculture.

towns and regional centers in Eastern and
North-Western regions could substantially
enhance mobility and access to labor markets.
With the top standard highway and railway systems
already significantly developed, further investments
are likely to deliver only marginal travel-time
savings at much higher cost and will be unlikely to
significantly improve the competitive potential of
businesses in less developed regions. Eurostat data
(based on the Labour Force Survey [LFS]) show
that the number of commuters in Poland has
increased by 20 percent since 2004. However, there
is limited connectivity between towns to regional
centers, particularly in Eastern and North-Western
part of Poland (Map O.2). The availability, level of
integration, convenience, and cost of access to
public transit in metropolitan functional areas and
between rural locations and regional and
subregional socioeconomic centers is still limited in
many regions. Policy reforms and further                   Source: Komornicki et al. 2015. ©Institute of

revitalization of road infrastructure connecting towns and regional centers—are therefore needed to make
it a more attractive alternative to private cars. Given the likely decrease in EU funding beyond 2020,
strategic spending on safety, maintenance, and improvements of road and rail infrastructure will largely
depend on increasing transport revenues and the effectiveness of the specialized state administrations and
state-controlled companies.

Ensuring Sustainability
A new social consensus is needed to ensure fiscal, social, and environmental sustainability.
Removing constraints on productivity growth will contribute to a more competitive economy. At the same
time, if individuals enjoy equal opportunities, the resulting higher productivity will mean new and more
productive jobs that generate higher incomes for all, ultimately increasing shared prosperity. However,
these gains cannot be achieved in the absence of consistent policies to address fiscal, social, and
environmental sustainability. Ensuring sustainability necessarily requires facing difficult trade-offs that
are often highly debated in the public arena. For instance, under the current rules, efforts to guarantee the
fiscal sustainability of the pension system run counter to the objective of ensuring that all citizens enjoy
their twilight years with dignity, because the expected benefit amounts will be low. Similarly, moving to a
low-emissions economy carries with it economic costs, but failure to face these costs could bring even
higher costs in terms of health and other risks. It is impossible for any government to make decisions on
how to face these challenges without a social consensus that would lay out a clear direction to guarantee
long-term fiscal, social, and environmental sustainability.

Adequate Pensions

The future of old-age pensions in the context of an aging population will have long-term fiscal and
social sustainability implications and will be determined by the state’s effectiveness in reaching a
social consensus. Age-related spending in the next decades is expected to remain broadly stable, mostly
because pension spending is expected to go down and offset increases in health care and long-term care
spending. This is largely because the stability of the pension spending is embedded in the nature of the
actuarially balanced pension system. However, the projected trends cannot be regarded as socially
sustainable because of a dramatic decline in future replacement rates, particularly for women. Based on
simulations over the 2015–60 period, the rollback in retirement ages that will take effect in October 2017
will have a negative impact on the size of labor markets, the size and adequacy of expected pension
benefits, and the size of required government transfers to the pension system.

gross salary to reach the replacement rates that were expected prior to the reform, but as much as 17–18
percent additional savings per year would be needed to ensure a 60 percent replacement rate. Such a high
level of voluntary savings may be unrealistic. In addition, within the next few years disability benefits
will be higher than old-age pensions, providing an incentive for each successive generation of workers to
seek disability pensions rather than old-age pensions in order to maximize their lifetime pension income.
These estimates highlight the fact that Poland faces a trade-off between ensuring fiscal sustainability
under the current rules and confronting the fact that the resulting pension benefits may be too low to be
socially sustainable. Working toward a new social consensus could effectively reset the current trajectory
toward one that is truly in line with shared prosperity—and prevent an escalation of tensions.

essential to minimizing fatalities and
economic damage. The dual challenges for Poland are likely to be increased severity of weather and
reduced water availability, imposing the greatest harm on the agriculture sector and requiring reforms and
investments in both water and agriculture.

Governance and Institutions for Shared Prosperity

Managing the transition toward innovation-led inclusive and sustainable growth will require
institutional adaptation, within a renewed consensus around a more strategic, effective, and
accountable state. Policies are effective if they can sustain consensus over time, generate common
expectations among actors, and foster compliance. This requires commitment to consistent and
predictable policies, coordinated effort of the different state and nonstate actors in the economy, and
cooperation toward a common goal in the society. During the recent past decades, the process of EU
accession and then EU membership provided a clear coordination mechanism that helped the country’s
accelerated development. Today, a coordinated approach to competition, labor market flexibility, and
sound macro policies is critical to establish an innovation-led growth strategy. Coordinated efforts and
strategic government interventions will be needed to undertake research and development that leads to
innovations; provide better health service delivery; and adopt cleaner energy sources. In each area,
ensuring society’s trust and cooperation through transparency and accountability is critical to the
successful implementation of policies.
Commitment to laws and their implementation are necessary to secure a safe regulatory
environment for investors. This will require a more efficient judiciary system. Although the judiciary
system in Poland is independent and effective, it is affected by issues such as delays in adjudicating cases,
lengthy pretrial detention periods, slow corruption investigations, and difficulties confronting private
businesses that want to challenge government actions or regulations through the legal system. These
problems hinder growth because they weaken the commitment function of institutions: securing a safe
environment for investors by sustaining agreements and their implementation over time requires



                                                     15
    resolutions through efficient, timely litigation. Moreover, the inefficiencies in the judiciary system are
    more salient at the local level, and the courts’ performance varies widely from one city to another despite
    having the same national legal framework. For instance, starting a new business takes on average one
    month, but it can take as long as 42 days in Szczecin, or just 8 days in Poznań (as opposed to an EU
    average of 11.6 days). Tackling corruption is another priority to improve the efficiency of the market. As
    an economy advances, corruption becomes costlier because it restricts the functioning of the market
    (World Bank 2017b). Still, perception of corruption in Poland has been consistently higher than the
    average for EU and OECD countries. Regional differences are also important in this respect: 29 percent
    of firms in the South-West region think they are expected to give gifts to secure government contracts, as
    opposed to 0 percent in the Eastern region. Similarly, 26 percent of firms in the Central region believe
    they are expected to give gifts to public officials “to get things done,” as opposed to just 6.7 percent in the
    South-West region.
    To the extent that actors affected by policies are excluded from their design or that specific groups
    benefit disproportionately, this will weaken trust in institutions, possibly leading to a breakdown of
    cooperation. Delivering public services of good quality is the prerequisite to ensure compliance. A
    recurring finding in different chapters of this SCD is that the responsiveness of the state is not
    homogeneous across regions of the country. Building trust is essential to increase the efficiency of the
    state and the economic institutions supporting growth, equity, and environmental sustainability—and is
    particularly important in Poland, where data show lower levels of trust in national institutions than in
    other EU countries (                Figure O.19). Institutional trust can be built by repeatedly delivering on
    commitments, such as providing quality public services. If not addressed, low levels of trust may lead to a
    breakdown of cooperation and compliance, in turn hindering the state’s capacity to provide quality public
    service, starting a vicious circle.

Citizen engagement is needed for legitimacy. Civil participation, in its different forms, has a critical
role in driving the process of societal transformation and institutional change. What policies are chosen is
as important as the policy process that is followed, to ensure the buy-in of different actors and avoid lack
of compliance. The number of civil society organizations has grown exponentially over 25 years in
Poland, but the level of civic participation is not high. According to the OECD, Poland ranks 34th out of
38 countries on voter turnout—better than 37th-place Chile (with a voter turnout of 49.3 percent) but
worse than countries like France, Germany, or Italy (where voter turnout is above 70 percent). Making
information available through transparency initiatives is an important first step toward increasing
accountability, which can help to create a new political consensus on the need for continued reforms.
Poland scores poorly with respect to transparency of government policy making (World Economic Forum
2017 data), with the government of Poland providing limited opportunities for the public to engage in the
budget process. A “Citizens Budget” (as advanced by the International Budget Partnership) could foster
greater understanding of how public money is being managed—a key factor to improve accountability of
governments—but transparency is not enough. Information needs also to be accessible and actionable to
promote accountability (World Bank 2017b). International actors, such as the EU, are also important
influences on the efficient functioning of the domestic decision process.


Priority Areas and Links to Shared Prosperity

Shared prosperity requires progress on productivity, equity, and sustainability. The objective of the
“shared prosperity” goal is to raise the well-being of the poorer segments of every society in every period,
which requires a dynamic process of economic growth that is inclusive of the poor and promotes
sustainability. The ways to achieve shared prosperity for Poland include (a) increasing productivity
through an innovation-led growth model; (b) investing in people, ensuring that they can engage
productively, and guaranteeing their mobility; and (c) ensuring the fiscal, environmental, and social
sustainability of policies. This report argues that a more strategic, effective, and accountable state is a
necessary condition to succeed in each of the priority areas.
The report proposes nine priority areas. The priorities have been chosen based on the following
criteria:

   Their potential impact on the twin goals of reducing poverty and increasing the welfare of the bottom
    40 percent

   The possible time frame for realizing the expected impact

   The degree to which an identified opportunity in one area has complementary positive impacts on
    other areas

   The existing evidence base
Table O.1 sets out the priority areas and articulates how advances in these areas are expected to affect
progress toward shared prosperity and poverty reduction in a sustainable way in the next five years.
During this period, the implementation of policy priorities is expected to set the course for progress,
although not all objectives will necessarily be accomplished within the five-year time frame. This
prioritization exercise also acknowledges that although the full impact of these interventions would be
achieved over the longer term, these measures are urgently needed now if Poland is to maintain its
progress toward shared prosperity and economic growth and meet the demands of the future.

Priorities to Boost Productivity Growth

1. Enhance competition by reducing state control, opening to trade and investment, and removing
   barriers to entrepreneurship and private sector investment. This will require fostering an
   enabling regulatory environment; improving the efficiency of the judiciary; and ensuring the
   predictability, consistency, and transparency of policies. Improving the predictability of regulations
   should also help to limit uncertainty, an increasingly important concern for businesses. A more
   efficient judiciary system is of utmost importance to secure a safe environment for investors and
   sustain growth. Bolstering innovation will also require balancing the need for greater labor market
   flexibility and strategic openness to migration with improved job security. Finally, financing
   innovation will require diversification of the financial sector through capital markets development
   and development of venture capital.

2. Shift to a more strategic public investment policy, improving the efficiency of EU funds and
   enhancing R&D policy. This will require investing in growth-enhancing sectors, including
   universities and research centers, and using a long-term life-cycle approach to managing and
   financing transport and ICT infrastructure. It will also require using financial instruments (instead of
   grants) to improve efficiency of EU funds, thus enabling reinvestment, leveraging private resources,
   and providing incentives for better performance. Finally, R&D policy should be streamlined, and the
   focus of investment should be on basic research.

3. Ensure sound macro policies to reduce uncertainty, including through rule-based fiscal
   consolidation aimed at increasing domestic savings, a simplified and upgraded tax system, and
   more efficient public spending. Sound fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies, along with
   prudent financial supervision, are sine qua non conditions to boost investment. Fiscal rules have
   contributed to the stability of Polish public finance, and their credibility needs to be preserved. In
   light of expected weaker inflows of foreign investments and the prospects of lower inflows of EU
   funds after 2020, higher domestic savings will be necessary, and the public sector could play an
   exemplary role. Moreover, Poland has room to strengthen its budget institutions and fiscal
   management to assure higher quality of public finance, on both the public spending and revenue
   sides.


Priorities to Enhance Inclusion

4. Improve skills of the workforce—ensuring equal opportunities across income deciles and
   regions—and enhance the quality and relevance of education and training throughout the life
   cycle. Reducing the existing skills divide, and improving the quality and relevance of education
   provision and adult learning possibilities, will be needed to ensure shared prosperity. This effort will
   require promoting early childhood education and ensuring equal access throughout the country.
   Moreover, given increased demand for skills driven by technological change, there is a need for the
   educational systems to adapt, fostering the skills required to perform nonroutine tasks as well as
   socioemotional and higher-order cognitive skills. Given demographic changes, the high concentration
   of older workers in routine jobs, and the overall growing importance of continuous skill acquisition of
   individuals in an innovating economy, shared prosperity will also depend on greater efforts to make
   lifelong and on-the-job training more accessible and relevant. This will require concerted efforts by



                                                    19
    education providers, the private sector, and the government. Higher education institutions could play
    a stronger role in collaborating with the private sector and the government to ensure increased access
    to demand-responsive training, expanding access to a more diverse student population, and adapting
    support services to the needs and living conditions of learners. Strong engagement from the private
    sector is required to ensure that programs are aligned with employers’ skill demand. Public sector
    facilitation of such processes will be required, establishing framework conditions that promote the
    higher education institutions’ engagement in adult education and cooperation among key
    stakeholders, as well as providing targeted support to higher education institutions. This includes
    advancing the legislative framework and designing key components of the higher education sector
    accordingly—namely, quality assurance approaches including accreditation, academic promotion
    systems, and funding schemes.

5. Improve access and quality of health care services. Poland needs to do more to boost health
   outcomes to prepare for the aging of its population. Poland already faces higher mortality and
   morbidity rates than its peers, low affordability due to expensive drugs, and access to care that still
   depends on individual circumstances. Long waiting times result from poor coordination,
   fragmentation, and low and inefficient spending. Given the expected increase in health care costs due
   to population aging, policies and investments are needed to promote improved health outcomes while
   containing costs. This will require improving coordination and reducing fragmentation of
   responsibilities and accountability across levels of government, increasing human and financial
   resources devoted to health, and improving the efficiency of spending through regional and national
   strategic planning. It will also require capacity building for physicians, nurses, and medical personnel
   as well as for health system managers. Finally, improved health outcomes will require strengthening
   prevention and health promotion.

6. Increase labor force participation through improved quality and availability of child and
   elderly care services. This will require ensuring that people are not unwillingly excluded from the
   labor market, but more importantly it will require that cross-sectoral policies are well coordinated to
   provide strong incentives to work, particularly for women, including through concerted efforts to
   increase the availability of child and long-term care. Moreover, it will require that social protection
   policies are consistent with this objective by reducing labor disincentive effects. Extended outreach
   and employment promotion is necessary to reach those who are inactive and far from labor markets.
   Formalizing and operationalizing coordination among agencies that provide services to vulnerable
   populations is critical to ensure delivery of a package of integrated services to improve their chances
   of getting and keeping a job.

7. Reduce labor market barriers by simplifying labor regulations, improving the management of
   road and rail infrastructure, and ensuring affordable housing. To reduce labor market
   segmentation while at the same time guaranteeing labor market flexibility, a reduction in
   administrative burdens and implicit costs associated with permanent labor contracts will be needed.
   Labor market segmentation could be reduced by aligning the tax and social contribution burden for
   different types of employment contracts, simplifying and better communicating labor regulations,
   streamlining legal dismissal procedures, limiting the use of temporary contracts, and strengthening
   social protection. Notably, an individualized type of targeted job and social assistance program could
   help to include those who may otherwise be left out. In addition, judicial and regulatory barriers
   should be addressed that could prevent mobility by restricting land use and potentially limiting the
   sale of farm property. A systematic review of the range of housing policy instruments and barriers to



                                                    20
    transferring land could be helpful in identifying regulations that are inconsistent with improving
    internal mobility. Similarly, improvements in the management of regional road and rail infrastructure
    could substantially enhance mobility and access to labor markets. In particular, structural reforms are
    needed to rebalance existing EU funding toward regional and local networks and improve the
    capacity, safety, and sustainability of the current system by securing additional revenues for road and

8. Fiscal and social sustainability of the pensions system will require promotion of private pension
   savings and longer working lives, particularly for women. The recent decision to roll back the
   retirement age will have negative impacts on labor force participation, pension adequacy, and budget
   expenditures. Promoting longer working lives (particularly for women), fostering private pension
   savings, and equalizing the retirement age for women and men at 65 could all help. A new social
   consensus, based on the evidence of the existing trade-offs, will be needed.

9. Environmental sustainability requires managing the transition to a low-emissions economy and
   strengthening water management. Meeting these challenges will require developing and
   implementing a comprehensive and coherent long-term energy sector strategy that is consistent with
   the overarching environmental sustainability goals, balances the mix of domestic energy resources
   and diverse imports, and firmly supports end-use energy efficiency improvement. Adapting to a
   changing climate requires dealing with substantial uncertainty, but the dual challenges for Poland are
   likely to be increased severity of weather and reduced water availability. Managing these risks will
   require continued investments in flood management and an improved governance and institutional
   framework as well as investments in modernizing and rehabilitating existing water systems and
   promotion of high-efficiency systems.

Chapter 1: Macroeconomic and Shared Prosperity Trends

Introduction

1. Poland is in many respects a development success story, making tremendous progress toward
   European Union (EU) income levels over the past 25 years. Real gross domestic product (GDP) in
   2016 was 2.5 times what it was in 1990, implying average annual real growth of 3.6 percent. Poland’s
   growth was fast and stable, driven by productivity increases (within and between firms), accompanied
   by the establishment and strengthening of pro-competitive institutions and market-oriented upgrading
   of human capital, and underpinned by reasonably good macroeconomic management (low external
   imbalances, persistent but still manageable fiscal deficit, growing but still sustainable debt levels). In
   addition, Poland’s economic growth pattern has been inclusive, witnessing growing earnings for all
   income groups, and leading to a substantial reduction in poverty and stronger than average growth of
   the bottom 40 percent of the distribution over the past decade, mainly because of increases in
   employment and labor incomes. Poland has moved from a society in which citizens were assumed to
   be equal before the law and facing nominally equal opportunities, toward a society in which these
   assumptions have become, to a large extent, reality. Equality of opportunity, competitive markets, and
   solid institutions have combined to produce Poland’s success. Moreover, Poland significantly
   improved its environmental performance, and economic growth has been decoupled from greenhouse
   gas emissions, energy and water use, and some health-damaging pollutants.

2. However, there are signs of underlying problems for further gains going forward while, at the
   same time, people’s expectations have increased. Despite strong growth, Poland has had a
   persistent fiscal deficit, and the public debt-to-GDP ratio has continued to rise over the past decade.
   Although public debt remains sustainable over the medium term, long-term fiscal sustainability has
   been weakened by the rollback in the statutory retirement age. Poland has made only slow progress
   on environmental challenges and faces significant challenges in transitioning to a low-emissions
   economy. Moreover, despite improvements in employment and earnings, strong growth for the
   bottom of the distribution comes on the heels of a period when growth was not inclusive. If citizens
   perceive the society as unfair, this undermines social trust in institutions. If not addressed, these
   perceptions can lead to public discontent and pressure to reverse policies that have successfully
   delivered growth and shared prosperity in the past. Citizens may decide to opt out or exit the existing
   political processes, leading to a weakening of cooperation and ultimately a weakening of the state—
   even in the context of effective policies (World Bank 2017b).

3. Moreover, Poland faces new challenges that will require new strategies going forward. First,
   demographic changes will lead to increased dependency on a shrinking labor force, pose fiscal
   sustainability challenges, and place a strain on social services. Second, recent global developments
   suggest low potential productivity improvements and a slowdown in innovation in the medium term.
   Third, given continued changes in technology favoring high-skilled, nonroutine tasks, polarization of
   incomes could increase. In this context, bigger efforts to guard against social exclusion, particularly in
   rural areas, will be needed. Finally, sustainable management of natural resources remains a challenge
   going forward.

4. This Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) seeks to provide an assessment of where Poland
   stands in terms of poverty reduction and shared prosperity as well as how progress toward
   these goals can be achieved. The intrinsic idea of the “shared prosperity” goal is to raise the well-
   being of the poorer segments of every society in every period, which requires a dynamic process of
   economic growth that is inclusive and can sustainably promote mobility and equal opportunities.
   Progressing toward these goals requires an environmentally, socially, and fiscally sustainable growth
   process within the unique context of Poland (Figure 1.1). This chapter sets the context for where
   things stand for each of these pillars and then discusses the challenges to achieving shared prosperity.
   The rest of the report discusses each pillar in more depth and concludes with a prioritization of areas
   where attention is most critically needed.

Growth Trends in Poland, 2005–16, and the Economic Outlook to 2019

5. Poland’s growth over the past decade was structurally grounded in productivity gains within
   firms and improved allocative efficiency between them. Resources moved from relatively lower-
   productivity sectors to higher-productivity sectors (Figure 1.2). This process was accompanied by a
   process of strengthening of pro-competition institutions and upgrading of human capital. The
   combination of integration into the global marketplace, domestic reforms conducive to increased
   competition, and macroeconomic and policy stability were at the core of the growth process that the
   economy experienced. Economic policies were growth-enhancing and predictable, anchored in
   deepening integration with the EU, and had a free-floating exchange rate regime acting as shock
   absorber, as well as monetary policy based on inflation targeting. As described in chapter 2, changes
   within sectors were more important in driving productivity growth than changes between sectors as
   firms invest in new technologies, expand, reorganize, upgrade management, and innovate.

6. Technological progress was transferred through imports of investment goods and foreign direct
   investment (FDI), which enabled innovation through imitation and increased the export
   potential of the economy. The imitation-driven growth model was largely funded from foreign
   savings, quite natural for the catching-up phase, supported by non-debt external inflows including
   significant net inflow of FDI and EU funds. Foreign investments were attracted largely by low-cost
   skilled workers and dynamically growing trade with the EU—the biggest internal market in the
   world. Poland became strongly connected with the European, and in particular German, markets and

    global value chains (Aldaz-Carroll, Skrok, and Van Den Brink 2017). Polish exporters expanded to
    all markets during the past decade and became sizable subcontractors in the EU market. Despite these
    gains, the productivity gap between Poland and the EU remains large (Figure 1.3).

7. Following accession to the EU in 2004, all regions of the country grew, but regional centers such
   as Dolnoslaskie (Wrocław) or Mazowieckie (Warsaw) drove reallocation of resources in the
   country and attracted migrants from the East (Figure 1.4 and Map 1.1). At the same time, free
   movement of capital and labor in the EU enabled outward migration, particularly in the early years
   after EU accession. Out of a population of 38 million, about 2 million Poles (or 5 percent) left the
   country in the mid-2000s, while about 1 million migrants (2.6 percent) arrived in Poland from the
   East, in particular from Ukraine, in the mid-2010s. If compared with the working-age population
   (26.8 million ages 15–64 years on average in 2005–16), these ratios would be half as much again.

 8. Productivity growth was accompanied by impressive progress in stabilizing the economy by
    reducing external imbalances. The country moved from underutilized labor endowments and
    external imbalances to full employment and external balance. In particular, in 2005, the economy had
    an unemployment rate of about 20 percent and a current account deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP, both
    of which improved significantly in the following years (Figure 1.5 and Figure 1.6). By 2016, the
    unemployment rate had fallen to less than 6 percent, and the current account deficit was close to zero
    (a current account deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP in 2016). This was mainly driven by a services trade
    surplus, particularly in information and communication technology (ICT) and business services.
    Strong merchandise exports and a fall in energy commodity prices translated into a surplus in the
    foreign trade balance. The diminishing current account gap was comfortably funded from stable
    sources, such as FDI or net inflow of EU funds.

12. Economic growth was broad-based, driven
    by consumption on the demand side and by growth in manufacturing and services on the
    supply side. The growth pattern from the demand side was largely driven by private consumption,
    along with strong investment (2005–08 and 2014–15) and net exports (2009 and 2012–13) (Figure
    1.8). Final consumption contributed strongly to growth in the second half of 2000s and also more
    recently in light of weak private and public investment. From the supply side, Poland’s services have
    been dynamically catching up, and the industry base has been strengthened (Figure 1.9).

13. Despite strong economic growth, some concerns remain, beginning with a persistent fiscal
    deficit, which has led to a rise in the public debt-to-GDP ratio over the past decade. Poland had
    entered the global financial crisis with a large structural fiscal deficit, additionally worsened by cuts
    in personal income tax (PIT) and social contributions introduced in 2007–09. Together with the
    negative impact of the cycle and a rise in the value added tax (VAT) gap, this drove headline deficits
    above 7 percent of GDP in 2010–11 (Figure 1.10 and Figure 1.11). In the recent decade, the public
    debt-to-GDP ratio kept rising, excluding the one-off effect from the 2014 pension reform (Figure
    1.12).1 The ratio of public foreign debt-to-GDP almost doubled, from slightly above 15 percent in
    2008 to around 30 percent in 2016.

    As of February 2014, 51.5 percent of the assets of the open pension funds, composed predominantly of Polish
    Treasury securities, were transferred to the Social Security Institution (ZUS). The state Treasury bonds were
    immediately redeemed (cancelled), which resulted in the reduction of the public debt by 7.6 percent of GDP. The
    consolidation of other bonds issued by general government units translated into further direct debt reduction by 0.9
    percent of GDP.

              15. Public expenditure and revenue trends have been broadly countercyclical, as reflected by the
                  fiscal response to the global financial crisis and other exogenous shocks in recent years. Public
                  spending grew to a peak of 46 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2010, largely boosted by public
                  investments and social transfers, gradually declining to 41 percent in 2016 (Figure 1.15). At the same
                  time, revenue bottomed out at 38 percent of GDP in 2009, reflecting lower economic growth and the
                  elimination of the upper PIT bracket and a reduction in the lower PIT rate from 19 percent to 18
                  percent. In 2007–08, a significant cut in the social security (disability) contribution rate was
                  introduced. As the economy recovered, the standard VAT rate was increased from 22 percent to 23
                  percent in 2011. Annual changes in overall revenues since then have been smaller than 1 percent of
                  GDP (Figure 1.16).

                        years (Table 1.1). By contrast, long-term fiscal risks have increased in light of the rollback in the
                        statutory retirement age because of lost revenues from those who would have remained in the
                        workforce, leading to higher deficits over the long run (see details in Chapter 4).

      Poverty and Shared Prosperity Trends, 2005–16

      17. Improvements in growth and productivity over the past decade have translated into
          remarkable progress in poverty reduction in Poland. The at-risk-of-poverty (AROP) rate
          (measured using a threshold of 60 percent of median equivalized income after social transfers in
          2005, and fixed thereafter) declined from 16 percent in 2005 to 5 percent in 2014 (Figure 1.18). Most
          of this progress took place in the years leading up to the global financial crisis. Although the pace of
          poverty reduction has slowed down since then, the incomes of those at the bottom of the distribution
          continued to make steady improvements. The steep fall in poverty was among the fastest in the EU
          and continued throughout the crisis years. As a result, Poland’s $5-a-day poverty rate in 2012 was
          significantly lower than most regional comparators such as Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, and Romania
          (Figure 1.19).

       18. Moreover, strong and stable growth translated into increases in disposable incomes across the
           income distribution in the past decade, but especially for the bottom 40 percent, thus boosting
           shared prosperity. The per capita income of the bottom 40 percent grew at an annualized rate of 4.4
           percent over 2004–15 compared with 3.6 percent growth among the top 60 percent (Figure 1.20,
           panel a). Most of this improvement happened between 2004 and 2008, when the bottom 40 percent
           grew at an annualized rate of 8.3 percent, and then slowed to an annual growth of 1.9 percent between
           2010 and 2015. Still, this is a commendable outcome given that Poland is one of only a few countries
           (including Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay) to have achieved both positive income growth and shared
           prosperity during this period (Figure 1.20, panel b).
       19. Strong growth in labor income was the main contributor to poverty reduction, driven mainly
           by broad-based improvements in education, increasing returns to labor, and overall
           productivity gains. Labor income growth accounts for most of the reduction in poverty over the past
           decade in Poland, while the reduction in the real value of pensions relative to earnings resulted in
           increased relative poverty among the elderly (Aldaz-Carroll, Skrok, and Van Den Brink 2017). Labor
           income led to poverty reduction in Poland mostly on account of improvements in the level of
           education and in the returns to individual characteristics, reflecting productivity increases as well as
           increases in the minimum wage (Aldaz-Carroll, Skrok, and Van Den Brink 2017). The statutory
           minimum wage increased in real terms nearly twice as fast as the average wage between 2005 and
           2014, effectively helping workers at the lower end of the earnings distribution (Figure 1.21, panel a).

20. Increases in employment were also an important factor in poverty reduction. The overall
    employment rate was 7.7 percentage points higher in 2015 than in 2006, underpinned by growing
    labor force participation of older workers (Figure 1.21, panel b). This can partly be explained by
    changes in the rules concerning early retirement implemented in 2008 and the lagged impact of the
    retirement reforms implemented in 1999 (Aldaz-Carroll, Skrok, and Van Den Brink 2017).

    2005–14 period of fast economic
    growth, largely because of an
    increasing share of tertiary educated
    workers along with a declining
    educational premium (Aldaz-Carroll,
    Skrok, and Van Den Brink 2017).          Source: Eurostat.
    However, inequality decreased mainly in urban areas while staying more or less constant in rural

       areas, and increasing among farmers (Central Statistical Office [GUS] 2016c data). Moreover, wage
       inequality remains very high by international standards. Eurostat reports that Poland has the highest
       inequalities in gross hourly earnings measured as D9/D1 interdecile ratio.2 The ratio between gross
       hourly earnings of highest and lowest deciles ranges between 2.1 in Sweden to as much as 4.7 in
       Poland. This high level of inequality in hourly wages is related to the labor market segmentation,
       which persists despite recent improvements.
22. The decline in labor income inequality was complemented by redistributive fiscal and social
    policies. About 44 percent of the decline in disposable income inequality between 2005 and 2014 is
    attributed to redistributive direct taxes and transfers (Myck 2016), but until recently the redistributive
    impact of Polish direct taxes and transfers was low compared with other countries, particularly when
    indirect taxes are considered, with both the VAT and excise taxes being regressive, unequalizing, and
    poverty-increasing (Goraus and Inchauste 2016). However, the introduction of Poland’s Family 500+
    program has substantially reduced poverty and inequality across the population (see Chapter 4).
23. Despite improvements in objective measures of welfare, anxiety and pessimism color
    perceptions about well-being. Qualitative evidence from perception surveys shows that although
    households in 2016 perceive themselves to be better off than they were four years ago, there is some
    pessimism concerning the recent improvements in welfare and the prospects going forward. For
    instance, 36 percent of Poles in 2016 believed they are not better off than their parents, a higher share
    than in 2010 (Figure 1.23, panel a). Similarly, the share of respondents who believe that children born
    today will have a better life than themselves was smaller in 2016 than in 2010. Moreover, despite the
    improvements in employment indicators, when asked how their personal job situation has fared in the
    past decade, 61 percent believe things are the same, while 14 percent believe things have gotten
    worse, a rate much higher than most EU countries (Figure 1.23, panel b). Why the pessimism? There
    are both objective and subjective reasons that could explain these trends.

    there is some evidence that labor
    productivity outpaced
    compensation for workers (Figure              Eurostat and OECD - Real labour productivity per hour worked
    1.25). However, Polish wages                  OECD - Labor compensation per hour worked
    remain at the lower end in the EU,            Polish CSO - Average monthly real gross wage in national economy

    six of all EU-28 countries.3
    Combined with the fact that Poland has fourth highest proportion of low-wage earners in the EU
    (Eurostat 2014 data),4 many workers receive low remuneration for their work by both national and
    international standards.
26. In fact, the returns to labor have been growing more slowly than the returns to capital. The
    share of labor compensation in total income ranged from 41 percent in 2000 to 37 percent in 2015,
    while the share of operating surplus ranged from 47 percent to 51.5 percent over the same period—a
    historic high (Aldaz-Carroll, Skrok, and Van Den Brink 2017). By EU standards, the share of workers
    with relatively low skills remains high, and many of these workers have temporary contracts with low
    bargaining power. At the same time, the strong growth in the supply of higher-educated workers
    reduced the skills premium. The result has been that the returns to labor have been lower than the
    returns to capital (Aldaz-Carroll, Skrok, and Van Den Brink 2017).
27. Third, although wealth inequality is relatively low, there are some signs that it has been
    increasing, in line with strong returns to capital. Poland’s level of wealth inequality is relatively
    low but has been increasing. As in most countries, Poland’s wealth inequality is higher than its
    income inequality but not as high as in most euro area countries, as evidenced by a lower Gini
    coefficient (Figure 1.26) (NBP 2015). This stems mainly from the fact that a vast majority of Poles
    own their homes (76.4 percent compared with 44.2 percent in Germany). This is true across the
    distribution, with over 80 percent of households owning their homes beginning in the third and fourth

    Mean hourly wages were 10.13 purchasing power standard (PPS) in Poland compared with 15.35 PPS for the EU-
    28 (in both euros and PPS). By this measure, Poland had the 10th-lowest wages among the EU-28 countries. PPS
    is Eurostat’s purchasing power standard.

    Eurostat defines low-wage earners as employees earning two-thirds or less of the national median gross hourly
    earnings. This statistic is estimated with Eurostat’s Structure of Earnings Survey.




                                                                       36
      decile, and 95 percent in the 5th–10th deciles. This is often not the case in many European countries.
      Poland is also distinctive in that a relatively high percentage of respondents declare possession of
      business assets (18.8 percent versus 11.1 percent in the euro area), and the value of these assets is
      higher than in the rest of the region.5 However, there is some evidence of an increase in wealth
      inequality between 2010 and 2015, with the wealth Gini increasing from 66.8 to 75.6 points
      compared with the average increase in the EU from 67 to 70 points (CSRI 2010, 2015). This increase
      is in line with the increase in the number of billionaires in Poland and their net worth (Figure 1.27). In
      particular, much of the net worth of Polish billionaires comes from sectors prone to capture and rent
      seeking, including the communication and financial and insurance industries.6

    Note that the level of inequality reported in these surveys may be underestimated, because they are not
    representative of the wealthiest individuals despite efforts to oversample the top of the distribution.

    As underlined in World Bank (2017b), high concentration of wealth may result in undue ability to influence the
    policy process by those at the very top of the distribution and in an inefficient allocation of resources, which
    further entrenches existing inequalities over time.

    perceptions of welfare (Hirschman and
    Rothschild 1973). For instance, comparing themselves with the median EU citizen, to the extent that
    Poles mainly pay attention to wages, their assessment of inequality and the distance to the wage levels
    in comparator countries will be much larger (Figure 1.28). This is important because Poles tend to
    compare themselves with Germans and also tend to have higher perceptions about living conditions in
    Germany than other EU countries (University of Geneva 2016).


Key Environmental Trends in Poland, 2005–16

29. Progress toward shared prosperity has also involved improvements in environmental
    sustainability. Over the past three decades, Poland significantly improved environmental
    performance and management, and these advances were reinforced by EU accession in 2004. EU
    membership not only stimulated the economy but also supported improved environmental
    management and enhanced the quality of life of Poland’s citizens. Supported by EU funds, increased
    investment in infrastructure has extended access to water services, sanitation, and other
    environmental services and helped to reduce pollution (OECD 2015d). Greenhouse gas (GHG)
    emissions, waste generation, water withdrawal, and emissions of several air pollutants have
    decoupled from economic growth. Between 2005 and 2014, Poland’s real GDP increased by around
    45 percent, while GHG emissions declined by around 5 percent (Figure 1.29). To some extent, this
    was a positive side effect of economic restructuring. Also, the international Environmental
    Performance Index (EPI) shows how Poland advanced on environmental performance relative to
    other countries (Figure 1.30).7 Despite continued improvement over the past decade, the same index
    demonstrates the large distance between Poland and the EU frontiers in this regard.

    The EPI is a composite indicator, covering more than 20 indicators, and ranks countries in two areas: protection of
    human health and protection of ecosystems. Within these two policy objectives, the EPI scores national
    performance in nine issue areas comprising more than 20 indicators. EPI indicators measure country proximity to

                   30. Productivity improvements in Poland’s economy were also reflected in more efficient use of
                       energy and water, even though the distance to the best EU performers remains large. Poland has
                       made considerable advances in energy efficiency in the past decade, though it still lags behind (high)
                       Western European standards. Poland’s economy is still more than twice as energy-intensive as the EU
                       average per unit of GDP (Figure 1.31). Although consumption of energy per euro of GDP has fallen
                       by 29 percent in the past decade—from 322 kilograms to 227 kilograms of oil equivalent required for
                       every €1,000 of output between 2005 and 2015—Poland still stood at 1.9 times above EU average
                       energy intensity in 2015. In this EU ranking, only three countries are more energy-intensive:
                       Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Estonia. Relative to the mid-2000s, water productivity also
                       increased significantly, though—again—Poland remains one of the least water-efficient countries in
                       the EU (Figure 1.32). With water resources of about 1,600 cubic meters available per capita annually,
                       Poland is among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries
                       with the most limited freshwater resources.

    dependence of the power sector on coal
    and lignite. Around 85 percent of electricity in Poland is generated from coal and lignite—the highest
    share in the EU, leaving Poland an outlier both in Europe and globally (Figure 1.33). Poland has no
    energy generated by nuclear power plants. This heavy reliance on coal leaves the Polish economy
    among the most carbon-intensive in the EU.
32. Moreover, the average concentrations of health-damaging air pollutants are among the highest
    in the EU and OECD. In 2012, sulphur oxide (SOX) emissions per unit of GDP were triple the
    OECD Europe average, and nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions were double, despite significant declines
    in emissions of these pollutants in the previous decade. However, emissions of PM2.5 and PM10 were

       unchanged,8 while emissions of non-methane volatile organic pollutants (NMVOCs) increased by 10
       percent, and carbon monoxide (CO) by 6 percent. In fact, Poland has recorded one of the highest
       levels of average concentrations of PM2.5 in Europe in recent years (Figure 1.34). Small-scale
       combustion of coal and biomass and concentrated local pollution (particularly during the heating
       season) are the main factors in these compliance issues (EC 2013). Also, Poland ranks low for several
       other air quality measures, such as concentrations of arsenic, mercury, benzene, and benzo(a)pyrene
       (OECD 2015d).

Structural Trends and Challenges to Shared Prosperity

34. Beyond the underlying issues challenging shared prosperity noted above, there are long-term
    structural challenges. In addition to persistent fiscal deficits, low perceptions of welfare, and
    environmental challenges, there are additional structural changes that Poland will need to face going
    forward. The most important has to do with rapid and deep demographic change, which will pose
    labor market and fiscal challenges and place pressure on the health care and pension systems. Second,
    recent global developments suggest low potential productivity improvements and a slowdown in
    innovation in frontier markets and adoption in converging markets such as Poland. Poland may be
    unable to sustain continued increases in productivity based on the current growth model. Third,

       technology will change the nature of labor markets, affecting relative returns to skills and capital.
       Poland faces a world in which labor incomes of low-skilled workers may be limited given
       technological improvements across the globe, potentially further increasing the precariousness of
       low-skilled workers. Moreover, should economic dynamics worsen, horizontal inequalities would
       become more salient, given lingering disparities in access to opportunities and the labor market as
       well as social exclusion among vulnerable groups. Finally, agglomeration and income growth put
       pressure on natural resource management, posing challenges to improving air quality and water
       management and to meeting global targets on GHG emissions. These four challenges interact with
       each other. For example, productivity growth is perhaps the lone remedy for demographic decline;
       without it, growth, inclusiveness, and sustainability would be at risk. Each of these challenges is
       described briefly below and addressed more fully in the rest of this volume.


Rapid Aging

35. First, demographic changes will lead to increased dependency on a shrinking labor force.
    Poland is one of the fastest-aging countries in the EU, in part because of low fertility rates. Fertility
    rates have been well below the simple replacement rate for long, falling to 1.3 in 2013.9 The
    demographic outlook is also adversely affected by migration flows, in particular persistently high
    outward migration.10 The forecasted Polish dependency ratio will be one of the highest in the EU, and
    is expected to increase from 22 percent to 56 percent by 2050 for the population over age 65 years,
    and from 6 percent to 18 percent by 2050 for the population over age 80 years (Figure 1.35, panel a).
    Importantly, future generations will face a situation in which a much smaller labor force will need to
    shoulder a larger number of elderly adults (Figure 1.35, panel b). In fact, Kiełczewska and
    Lewandowski (2017) demonstrate that if the current participation patterns persist, in 2050 the labor
    supply in Poland will be 30 percent smaller than in 2015, mostly as a result of an increase in the share
    of people over age 50 years who exhibit low labor force participation.

    The fertility rate, computed by Eurostat, is defined as the mean number of children that would be born alive to a
    woman during her lifetime if she were to pass through her childbearing years conforming to the fertility rates by
    age of a given year, and surviving.

      It is estimated that nearly 1.2 million people emigrated from Poland between 2009 and 2013, including 280,000
     people in 2013 alone, the fourth largest in the EU in 2013 (EC 2016a). At the same time, inflows of migrants are
     increasing exponentially (from 10,000 immigrants in 2006 to 220,000 in 2013), and are set to play an important
     role for the labor market in the future.

36.      Demographic changes will pose fiscal sustainability challenges and place a strain on the
health care and pension systems, thus posing both fiscal and inclusion challenges. The number of
years over the life cycle when labor incomes are higher than consumption is currently one of the lowest in
Europe (Chłoń-Domińczak 2017). Thus, population aging in Poland not only will lead to lower
employment, GDP, and incomes but also will undermine the welfare state that finances the consumption
of older people. Fiscal sustainability challenges might emerge, despite far less generous replacement rates
than in other EU countries, if labor force participation remains relatively low and current younger
generations do not mobilize adequate pension savings. As detailed in Chapter 4, the recent reduction in
the retirement age will aggravate the problem because it will slash future pension benefits, increasing the
incidence of minimum pension and the associated fiscal costs (Malec and Tyrowicz 2017). At the same
time, the long-term care system in Poland is underdeveloped, fragmented, and not prepared to deliver
adequate care to the growing senior population (Błędowski 2017). Moreover, old-age dependency has a
strong regional aspect (Map 1.2).11 Given the low mobility of older people in Poland, there will be
significant regional imbalances in demand for age-related services (health care, long-term care), putting
stress on regional infrastructure. Given differences in life expectancy, most of the elderly over age 75 in
Poland are expected to be women, but many also experience poor health, high dependency, and frailty in
their elderly years (see Chapter 3).

37. Second, Poland may be unable to sustain
    continued productivity gains amid a global
    slowdown in innovation. Global productivity
    growth fell sharply and widely following the
    global financial crisis, adding to structural
    headwinds in place before the crisis, leaving
    productivity prospects highly uncertain (Adler
    et al. 2017). Spillovers from productivity shocks
    at the technological frontier could translate into
    a productivity shock for a country with high
    trade exposure to the frontier. For a country
    such as Poland, Western Europe remains a
    frontier market, and a persistent productivity
    slack there would limit adoption of new
    technologies and further productivity gains in
    Poland.

    growth has become less diversified.

    long-term challenges facing the economy
    in the next decades—namely, the
    demographic trends, lower FDI, and
    lower EU structural funds (Figure 1.36).
    Also, there are external challenges
    associated with Brexit, changes to global
    trade deals, euro-area volatility, and
    regional problems with the Russian
    Federation. Growth driven by private
    consumption has been fueled in part by
    rising incomes but also by strong and
    partly foreign-financed credit growth. At
    the same time, businesses have become
    reliant on EU-15 countries for exports      Source: World Bank, based on Eurostat data.

Technological Change and Labor Market Implications

39. Third, technological improvements around the world favor nonroutine cognitive tasks, and
    although this has not been an issue so far, polarization of incomes could increase as income
    levels in Poland converge with advanced-country levels. There is a fundamental shift in the nature
    of work in Europe and other high-income economies, with the task content of jobs shifting toward

       nonroutine cognitive tasks, while manual tasks have decreased (Górka et al. 2017; Hardy, Keister,
       and Lewandowski 2016), as illustrated in Figure 1.37, panel a. In line with the growth in cognitive
       nonroutine tasks, employment rates among individuals with primary or secondary education lost
       ground relative to those with higher levels of education (Figure 1.37, panel b). Poland is not immune
       to these changes, which are driven by technological progress and may lead to fewer jobs and
       increased uncertainty about job stability and the prospects for achieving a middle-class lifestyle for
       those with limited educational attainment. In this context, Poland will need to deal with a small, weak
       research and development (R&D) sector while at the same time having to strengthen its education and
       social protection systems.

 40. Technological change could further exacerbate precarious and volatile employment based on
     atypical contracts among low-skilled workers. Much of the increase in employment over the past
     15 years was driven by the growth of nonstandard contracts (Figure 1.38). By 2016, temporary
     workers made up 27.5 percent of all self-employed and temporary employees, one of the highest
     shares among EU countries (Aldaz-Carroll, Skrok, and Van Den Brink 2017). Some temporary
     employees have civil law contracts,12 which are characterized by limited social protection.13 The


12
     The Polish Central Statistical Office (GUS) estimates that 1.3 million persons had signed civil law contracts in
     2015, who did not have labor code employment contracts elsewhere and were not pensioners (GUS 2017).
13
      Temporary employment in Poland encompasses both fixed-term labor code contracts (FTLCs) and civil law
     contracts (CCs). FTLCs provide benefits similar to those of indefinite-duration labor code contracts (IDLCs)
     except for different termination rules. In contrast, CCs—flexible forms of employment not regulated by the Labor
     Code—provide a narrow set of benefits, no protection against dismissal, and limited or no accrual of pension
     rights. There are two main forms of CCs: commission contracts (pol. umowa zlecenia), and contracts of result (pol.

     the highest in the EU. Although accelerating internal mobility could speed up poverty reduction, for
     rural municipalities (gminas), depopulation, including international migration, represents a key
     challenge to improving living standards. Broad measures of well-being at the regional level find that
     Poland’s regions perform better than when just focusing on monetary measures such as GDP or
     income (Figure 1.39). However, there are large differences across regions in terms of employment
     opportunities, safety, and community.

 42. In particular, rural families are among those most affected by poverty and in-work poverty.
     Poverty is concentrated in rural areas in regions characterized by a large share of agricultural
     workers (Map 1.3). The determinants of rural poverty and social exclusion are many, including
     aging, remoteness, education, household structure, and other factors. About 50 percent of the rural
     poor are connected with farming, and, in particular, are associated with small and inefficient
     agricultural operations. At the same time, Poland remains one of the countries with the highest share
     of work in agriculture relative to its GDP and one with the lowest rates of internal mobility. Ensuring
     shared prosperity will require loosening barriers to mobility and enhancing income-generating
     opportunities for rural households within and outside agriculture.

   Rising Pressure on Use of Natural Resources

    43. Finally, economic growth and agglomeration will further challenge the sustainable
        management of natural resources, including water and air quality management. Most
        importantly, moving to lower GHG emissions across the economy in the context of the EU’s climate
        action will require vigorous and coordinated action across sectors. Although the energy sector
        currently dominates Poland’s emissions profile, emissions from transport have been growing at a
        high rate, while those from industry and agriculture at slightly slower rates. Transport and
        agriculture, while constituting about 15 percent of overall GHG emissions, are a major part of less-
        energy-intensive sectors that are supposed to cut emissions in 2030 relative to 2005 levels as part of
        the EU’s plan for climate action through 2030 (Figure 1.40). Poland’s share of renewable energy
        (about 10 percent of gross final energy consumption) (Figure 1.41) is also expected to contribute to
        EU-wide climate action. The combined effects of large energy and carbon efficiency gaps in Poland;
        huge investment requirements in energy, infrastructure, and housing; and poor air quality suggest
        there is substantial scope for climate-smart policy choices (World Bank 2011).

    44. In addition, Poland needs to consider adaptation to a changing climate, making sensible
        investments today in infrastructure and key sectors such as agriculture that will need to endure more
        variable and extreme weather conditions and ensure sufficient water quantity in the decades to come
        (see Chapter 4). Although extraction levels of freshwater are relatively low, Poland’s freshwater
        resources are under medium to high stress already today, and this situation is likely to worsen with a
        changing climate in the future.

Conclusion

45. The rest of the report describes how the challenges discussed above will affect each of the
    pillars of shared prosperity—growth, inclusion, and sustainability—with the aim of then
    prioritizing key areas for action. What will it take to ensure continued economic growth that is
    inclusive and sustainable going forward? How can Poland adjust its labor markets and fiscal and
    social policies to meet the challenges of an aging population? How can it ensure continued increases
    in productivity while at the same time ensuring that all citizens are able to benefit from growth?
    How can it adjust its energy use to ensure environmental sustainability without impinging on growth
    and sustainability? As discussed in the next three chapters, the set of priorities to meet these
    challenges include (a) boosting Poland’s productivity through an innovation-led growth strategy, (b)
    investing in people and their mobility, and (c) ensuring the fiscal, environmental, and social
    sustainability of policies.
46. Managing the transition toward innovation-led, inclusive, and sustainable growth will require
    a more strategic, effective, and accountable state and a renewed social consensus. Policies are
    effective if they can sustain consensus over time, generate common expectations among actors, and
    foster compliance. This requires commitment to consistent and predictable policies, coordinated
    efforts from the different state and nonstate actors in the economy, and cooperation toward a
    common goal in the society. During the recent decades, the process of EU accession and then EU
    membership provided a clear coordination device that helped the country’s fast development. Today,
    a new consensus and coordination effort is needed. Strong commitment to competition, labor market
    flexibility, and sound macro policies will be critical to establish an innovation-led growth strategy.
    Coordinated efforts and strategic government interventions will be needed to reduce the existing
    skills divide, promote higher education, and undertake research and development that leads to
    innovations. Similarly, coordinated efforts will be required to provide better health service delivery
    and adopt cleaner energy sources. In each area, ensuring society’s trust and cooperation will be
    critical to the successful implementation of policies.

Chapter 2: Boosting Poland’s Growth Potential

Poland can realize its potential for growth driven by innovation by keeping its product markets
competitive; making labor markets flexible; orienting its tertiary education toward research; and
creating an environment for a more risk-friendly, equity-based finance. The state needs to play a more
strategic role, beyond its service delivery and regulatory function, by making sound public investment
and research and development (R&D) policy decisions as well as by using European Union (EU) funding
more efficiently. Countercyclical monetary and fiscal policy and managing public finances effectively
remain prerequisites for growth.


Introduction

47. Two and a half decades of fast and stable growth, grounded in robust productivity gains, drove
    incomes in Poland to converge toward the EU average. In 2016, Poland produced 2.5 times more
    goods and services than it did in 1990. In real terms, this expansion implied an average growth rate
    of 3.6 percent per annum over two and half decades. Growth was grounded in efficiency gains
    (measured by the contribution to growth because of total factor productivity [TFP]) and
    accompanied by the setting up and strengthening of pro-competitive institutions and upgrading of
    human capital. From 2000–14, TFP gains explained a third of gross domestic product (GDP) growth,
    corresponding to about 1.2 percentage points’ contribution to growth (Figure 2.1). This is high
    relative to regional peers and was a key driver in Poland’s real convergence toward EU average
    income.

      Note: MICs = middle-income countries. HICs = high-income countries. ICT = information and
      communication technology. TFP = total factor productivity. “Trapped MICs” refers to countries that
      have remained in the upper-middle-income range for decades. “New HICs” refers to countries that
      have ascended to high-income status since 2000. “Established HICs” refers to countries that have
      been high-income for a considerable period.

 48. In addition to TFP, accumulation of capital was also significant in explaining growth in Poland
     during 2000–14, while the contribution of labor was relatively small. Information and
     communication technology (ICT) and non-ICT capital accumulation accounted for 21 percent and 38
     percent of growth, respectively. The strong gains in capital accumulation and TFP are likely linked,
     as growth in the latter raised the quality of and returns to investments. Improvements in labor quality
     accounted for 5 percent of growth and increased labor quantities for 2 percent. The huge
     improvement in the composition of employees by educational attainment explained changes in TFP
     growth in the past (Gradzewicz et al. 2014). Labor quality improvements were likely driven by an
     education boom that started in the mid-1990s. Although, in the early 1990s, only 10 percent of
     young Poles continued education at the university level, 25years later, about 50 percent are doing so
     (Aldaz-Carroll, Skrok, and Van Den Brink 2017).

49. Structural reallocation of production factors drove productivity advances in the past.
    Productivity growth in Poland was driven by three simultaneous processes in the recent decade:
    structural transformation, within-sector reallocation, and within-firm improvements. Focusing on
    sectoral and firm dynamics, recent analysis has shown the following (Aldaz-Carroll, Skrok, and Van
    Den Brink 2017):
     The structural transformation process in Poland was efficiency-enhancing, as resources moved
        from relatively lower-productivity sectors to higher-productivity sectors.
     Within sectors, resources were reallocated away from low- to high-productivity firms.
     Within firms, substantial efficiency gains were achieved as firms expanded, reorganized, and
        upgraded human resources (HR) management and marketing strategies.

50. More recently, structural reallocation has been diminishing, while within-sector productivity
    gains have been rising as more-productive firms gain market share. Appendix B shows that the
    role of structural transformation declined after 2009, while within-sector productivity gains have been
    rising.14 In terms of increases in productivity within firms, detailed analysis of manufacturing firms
    finds that productivity growth in 2005–13 is attributed mainly to market-share gains among more-
    productive firms and to within-firm productivity gains rather than to firm entry and exit (Figure 2.2).
    For instance, the largest increase in productivity experienced by the computer and electronic sector
    was due to both an increase in firm productivity (60 percent) and a market reallocation toward the
    most-productive firms (40 percent). The TFP increase in in leather and the decrease in basic metals
    are extreme examples of sectors changing their TFP entirely by gaining or losing market shares,
    respectively. On the other extreme, TFP gains in the paper, electrical equipment, or machinery
    sectors were largely explained by existing firms’ increases in productivity.

     Because labor productivity analysis does not separate the capital contribution from the labor contribution, the
       labor productivity gains can be also attributed to some extent to capital accumulation. It is worthwhile to add,
       however, that such sectoral analysis does not capture the productivity improvements resulting from the
       reallocation of labor between firms in the same sector.

     contribution (Figure 2.3). Further productivity advances will be more difficult to achieve as Poland’s
     income levels converge with that of advanced economies.

 52. Similarly, the contribution of capital to Poland’s potential growth has also diminished over
     time. The contribution of capital to potential growth has declined from 2 percentage points in 2011
     to 1.7 percentage points in 2015 and—possibly temporarily—1.3 percentage points in 2016 (Figure
     2.4), signaling the need for further efforts to increase investment. Declines in private investment
     following the financial crisis were largely offset by record-high public investment, benefiting from

                     external trends and domestic policies, Poland experienced a relatively low contribution from
                     investment to GDP growth in the aftermath of the crisis (2011–16) despite record-low interest rates
                     and high capacity utilization. However, this contribution has been relatively stable (Bank Pekao
                     2017). Given that the investment rate reached 20.3 percent on average in 2005–16 (and 18.1 percent
                     in 2016), the official 25 percent investment target by 2030 appears ambitious.

  53. In this context, further increases in productivity will require a transition to an innovation-led
      growth model. Although Poland can continue to make advances across and within sectors, as it
      converges with high-income country standards, productivity gains based on “catching up” to
      advanced economies will be exhausted. Moreover, given the demographic challenges it faces,
      Poland will need to ensure that each worker is as productive as possible. An innovation-led growth
      model would allow for continued increases in productivity and would allow the country to face the
      demographic challenge head on. However, the transition to an innovation-led model will not be
      automatic. The next five years provide a crucial window of opportunity to prepare for this transition
      while still enjoying the benefit of ample EU support and robust growth.


Characterizing an Innovation-Led Growth Model

  54. Innovation-led growth differs substantially from imitation-led growth and will be challenging
      for Poland. The main features of the imitation-led model include (a) technology transfers and
      imitation (Keller 2004), (b) a reallocation of factors toward more-efficient sectors and firms (Hsieh
      and Klenow 2009), and (c) improvement of management practices (Bloom and Van Reenen 2010).
      Poland has made productivity improvements based on each of these factors, as discussed above.
      However, product and labor market flexibility is a sine qua non for an innovation-growth model,
      while it mattered less for an imitation-led model (Acemoglu, Aghion, and Zilibotti 2006). While
      bank finance fulfills the needs of imitative firms, equity financing and venture capital are more
      adequate for innovative firms (Koch 2014). Similarly, although good general education is adequate




                                                                                                    53
    for an economy catching up to the technology frontier, tertiary education and high-quality research
    are required for growth based on frontier innovations (Aghion, Askenazy, et al. 2009).

55. Following a Schumpeterian endogenous growth model, long-run productivity growth relies on
    process, product, or organizational innovations (Aghion and Howitt 1992, 1998) result from
    investments in R&D, skills, and search for new markets. Under this paradigm, faster growth
    generally implies a higher rate of firm turnover, because the process of creative destruction generates
    entry of new innovators and exit of former innovators. Innovations generate positive spillovers,
    which firms do not internalize fully so they underinvest in R&D. Such a situation justifies a role for
    the state to (co-) invest public funds in infrastructure or other innovation-enhancing projects and to
    design R&D policies in a manner allowing for higher overall R&D and achieving an adequate
    proportion of basic and applied research.

56. An innovation-led growth model will require a new set of policies and institutions. Inspired by a
    Schumpeterian perspective, Aghion and Akcigit (2015) identified the following four pillars of
    innovation-led growth in advanced countries: product market competition, labor market flexibility,
    higher education and research, and capital market-based finance. To reconcile the need to invest in
    the main levers of innovation-led growth with the need to maintain budget discipline, governments
    must become more strategic. They need to depart from policies that foster growth through
    indiscriminate public spending and become more selective as to where public funds should be spent.
    With this in mind, the state could be more strategic in terms of its public investment policy, R&D
    policy, and efficiency of EU funds. Finally, the key foundations for innovation-based growth include
    countercyclical fiscal and monetary policy and effective public finances. Each element of the
    framework is illustrated in Figure 2.6.

57. A renewed consensus will be needed to strategically align policies toward an innovation-
    enhancing growth model to ensure continued improvements in productivity. Thanks to almost
    three decades of uninterrupted economic growth, supported by a road map to and membership in the
    European Union in 2004, Poland has undergone deep, broad-based structural reforms. However,
    when measured against where Poland needs to position itself to ensure continued improvements in
    productivity, it is clear that there is much more to be done. The main thread throughout the
    forthcoming analysis is that transforming the economy toward an innovation-led growth model will
    require clear consistency of policies, enhanced coordination, and a strategic vision that allows for
    cooperation between public and private sectors. For this to take place, a renewed social consensus
    will likely be needed to strategically align policies, adapt existing institutions, and enable the
    transition to an innovation-based growth model. As discussed in more detail in Chapter 4, broader
    improvements in governance will be required to make this transition feasible (World Bank 2017b).

58. The remainder of this chapter provides evidence on where Poland stands today with respect to
    the framework above and proposes policy measures to bridge the existing gaps to an
    innovation-led model. The next section discusses Poland’s performance in terms of the four pillars
    for innovation-led growth. This is followed by a section on the strategic interventions that can
    enhance innovation based on the Schumpeterian growth model. The last section discusses Poland’s
    performance with respect to the foundational requirements of sound macroeconomic policy and
    effective public finances. The final section summarizes the priorities for innovation-based growth in
    Poland.


Pillars of Innovation-Led Growth

59. In the innovation-led growth model, product market flexibility goes hand in hand with flexible
    labor markets, high-quality higher education and R&D, and a market-based financial system.
    Aghion, Blundell, et al. (2009) show that competition and more flexible labor markets facilitate the
    process of creative destruction and foster productivity growth. This process is supported by better
    schools and universities and market-based based or equity financing. Poland’s achievements in
    establishing each of these pillars is presented below.


Product Market Competition

60. Competition is the first and foremost element of an innovation-led growth framework.
    Competition here refers to a broad-based set of policies regulating product market competition, and
    is reflected well by economywide product market regulation (PMR). This is a comprehensive and
    internationally comparable set of indicators that measure the degree to which policies promote or
    inhibit competition in areas of the product market where competition is viable. (For further details,
    see Koske et al. [2015].) The PMR can be decomposed into three broad subcategories—state control,
    barriers to entrepreneurship, and barriers to trade and investment—that inhibit competition in a
    country.

    economywide PMR index between
    2003 and 2013 (Figure 2.7). Nonetheless—given that almost all OECD countries improved their
    performance during this period—Poland’s low ranking relative to other countries in this group has
    remained broadly unchanged.

62. Product market regulations largely determine the speed and efficiency of firm turnover
    because they govern entry and exit market rules for incumbent and new firms, including
    foreign ones. High entry barriers become increasingly more detrimental to growth as the country
    approaches the frontier (Acemoglu, Aghion, and Zilibotti 2006). The same applies to increasing the
    rule of law: average firm size increases where the rule of law is stronger because it enables creative
    destruction and smoother reallocation among firms within economies (Aghion and Akcigit 2015). A
    stronger rule of law calls for regulations and policies supporting structural change and level-playing-
    field competition on the product markets. Openness to foreign trade—including building tighter
    links within the global value chains or improving physical infrastructure—also contribute to
    reallocation of production factors across sectors and countries, within sectors, and finally across
    firms and within firms. To better understand the barriers to competition in Poland, the main
    components of PMR are discussed below state control, barriers to trade and investment, and barriers
    to entrepreneurship. Overcoming the barriers to competition will require commitment to competition
    and consistency of policies.

State Control

63. Product markets in Poland                   Figure 2.8. Constraints to Competition in Poland and Other

    features such as state control and
    restrictions in professional
    services and retail trade. The
    2013 PMR indicators are the latest
    available and show a higher degree
    of state control and more restrictive
    regulation of professional services
    and retail trade in Poland than in
    other OECD countries (Figure 2.8).
    However, recent improvements
    were made as Poland undertook
    serious reforms since 2013: the
    government reduced restrictions in
    professional services for 250
    professions and canceled them for

    (about 1 million people). The range
    of professions affected varied from low-skill, popular jobs (such as taxi drivers) to high-skill, niche
    employment (such as actuaries). Also, the liberalization of the gas sector is under way though gas
    prices are regulated. However, a monopolistic market structure exists in the public ownership of
    airlines and gas production, importation, transmission, distribution, and supply. In retail trade, the
    restrictions include registration and licensing requirements; special regulations of large outlets;
    protection of existing firms (including local or national legal monopolies); regulations of shop
    opening hours; price controls of selected products (for example, gasoline, tobacco, and
    pharmaceuticals); and rules for promotions and discounts. In this context, a Sunday trading ban has
    been under consideration in parliament for a long time and was endorsed by the government in 2017.

64. The single most important unresolved challenge weighing on product markets concerns the
    state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Although the number of SOEs has shrunk, they still represent an
    important share of the economy. The State Treasury owns stakes in half of the largest 20 companies
    in the stock market, and SOEs account for almost half of all revenues of the biggest enterprises in
    Poland, compared with around 10–20 percent in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia. The
    largest SOEs are considered “strategic assets,” and their privatization is constrained by law. An
    effective corporate governance framework in SOEs is still pending while some SOEs can generate
    fiscal risks. The continued strong role of the state remains a challenge that cuts across several sectors
    and constrains a greater role for the private sector in the economy.

65. Similar to SOEs in other countries in the region, most of Poland’s SOEs are in energy and
    include a gas monopolist, a mining conglomerate, and electricity producers and distributors.
    But unlike the other three Visegrád Group states (the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia), the
    mix of SOEs in Poland also includes companies in the financial sector. The state bought back shares

                  in the second largest bank, Bank Pekao, and holds on to shares in insurance giant PZU as well as
                  PKO BP, the biggest bank in the country. The state has also a track record of decisions infringing on
                  minority investor rights—for example, reducing dividend payments that would benefit all
                  shareholders and generating tax income by increasing the capital of listed firms.

Barriers to Trade and Investment

66. Over the past decade, Poland has opened up its economy. Its trade account—merchandise and
    services—has expanded faster than the rest of the economy, raising the trade-to-GDP ratio from
    about 70 percent of GDP in 2005 to about 100 percent of GDP in 2016 (Figure 2.9). Over the past
    decade, Poland has systematically gained a bigger market share, in contrast to the shrinking market
    share of the euro area, albeit from a very low base (Figure 2.10). Also, Poland increased the number
    of destination markets and products exported—thus reducing its vulnerability to external shocks—
    and improved the quality of its exports to a level on a par with its high-income peers in terms of
    country reach and product scope. This successful export diversification is now responsible for more
    than one-third of export growth, up from a sixth of export growth in mid-2000s.

67. The country has also achieved a greater quality of exports and substantial diversification.
    Within narrowly defined product varieties, Polish firms manage to fetch higher prices in
    international markets, which attests to higher export quality (World Bank 2016). Competition on
    international markets drives quality and productivity improvements as firms deal better with the
    fixed costs associated with searching for clients abroad, learn the tastes of new customers, and
    comply with quality or safety standards abroad. This is evidence of learning-by-exporting, whereby
    exporting improves technical efficiency (Atkin, Khandelwal, and Osman 2014). As for
    diversification, in the early 2010s Poland’s exports spanned more than 3,700 products and reached
    more than 200 markets, with the machinery sector reaching the highest number of destinations. This
    placed Poland's diversification performance on a par with Spain’s. In addition, competitiveness is
    not restricted to a handful of products or sectors. Diversification is important for export growth and



                                                                                                           58

    reorienting exports following a demand shock (Albinowski et al. 2015).

    2012–13 was responsible for more than one-third of export growth, up from one-sixth in 2005–07

    Polish firms increasing from about 32,000 in 2005 to 44,000 in 2013. An examination of Poland’s
    export sophistication also suggests a steady increase in quality and sophistication (Aldaz-Carroll,

    concentrations of foreign assets, such as the financial or retail trade sectors—could suggest more
    testing conditions for FDI than in the past.

70. Openness to trade and FDI will continue to offer Poland the chance to move to higher-value-
    added tasks. Poland has greatly benefited from absorbing technology from more-advanced
    economies through trade, FDI spillovers, and technology transfers. However, so far, Poland attracted
    investors mainly because of low labor costs. For example, Poland has become the third-biggest
    center for outsourcing in the world (after China and India), with over 650 business service centers
    employing over 150,000 accountants. Similarly, banks operating in Poland are offering online
    accounting services. Going forward, more gains can be reaped both from the adoption and diffusion
    of existing innovations among firms as well as from frontier innovations. Moving to a higher-value-
    added growth model that focuses on innovations as opposed to low labor cost as the driver of
    competitiveness will continue to rely on a competitive environment bolstered by openness to trade
    and FDI.

Barriers to Entrepreneurship

71. In 2016, Poland ranked 24th among 190 economies in the ease of doing business, higher than
    the EU average, having achieved more progress since 2007 in the World Bank’s annual Doing
    Business index than all other high-income countries. Poland owes this success to systematic,
    continuous improvements in all stages of a firm’s life cycle and in every year since 2007: Poland
    made all transactions easier, faster, and cheaper. However, Poland’s Doing Business performance is
    uneven, with half of all indicators below the averages for OECD high-income countries (World
    Bank 2017a). Poland scores well on measures of regulatory quality; in terms of the laws and
    procedures on the books (Figure 2.13), it is close to the global regulatory frontier on at least three out
    of the seven dimensions of regulatory quality covered by Doing Business (resolving insolvency [in
    spite of a lengthy procedure], protecting minority investors, getting electricity). Poland has also
    made great strides to reduce the complexity of its regulations (Figure 2.14). As a result, it takes the
    same number (or fewer) procedures to start a business, get electricity, pay taxes, and deal with
    construction permits in Warsaw than in an average OECD capital. Property registration is the only
    transaction that remains more cumbersome than in comparator countries. Moreover, Poland needs to
    reduce delays encountered by firms. In particular, the performance of the courts remains the
    Achilles’ heel of Poland’s regulatory environment (Figure 2.15). Good contract enforcement is
    important for investment and will become more relevant for Poland as its firms become more
    sophisticated in international production networks.

 72. However, Poland’s business environment is more mixed if benchmarked to other countries
     based on data on the ease of business transactions, competition, or regulatory policy. According
     to firms, Poland’s business environment differentiates itself from that of other OECD countries with
     high tax rates, burdensome tax administration, and onerous regulations (Figure 2.16). In addition,
     access to finance, labor regulations, and political instability were important considerations for about

 73. Late payments, slow administration proceedings, excessive reporting requirements, and
     frequent changes in regulations also surface in surveys of Polish businesses. In 2016, 82 percent
     of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) identified late payments as an important obstacle to
     business (Millward Brown 2016). Three in five firms indicated that late payments are common,
     suggesting a coordination failure. Credit bureau representatives frequently describe late payments as
     “contagious,” citing that about 70 percent of payers in arrears attribute their behavior to not
     receiving payments on time themselves. Business associations frequently indicate the complexity of
     tax regulations, excessive reporting requirements, frequent changes to regulations, delays in
     administrative proceedings (for example, dealing with construction permits), and other red tape as
     major obstacles. To some extent, this might be linked to limitations of perceptions-based
     measurement of business environment.

 74. Moreover, redundant regulations and enforcement place burdens on firms that are not
     tracked in international comparisons. For instance, firms in Poland are required to keep for 50
     years records related to employment (such as payrolls, work contracts, and so on). In Germany firms
     keep such records generally for 6–10 years, in the United Kingdom for 6 years, and in the United
     States for 3–4 years. Apart from redundant provisions in the country’s regulations, Polish businesses
     also face challenges linked to regulatory enforcement. Poland has over 20 institutions that regularly
     inspect businesses. Inspections in Poland have overlapping mandates, inspect businesses frequently,
     rely on sanctions and fines in lieu of guidance, and enforce redundant requirements. Most of these
     institutions have local structures at voivodeship or county (powiat) level that add to overlap and
     duplication. Also, SMEs are overburdened with both tax and financial reporting, which increases the
     cost of doing business.



                                                                      62
75. In addition, discrepancies between laws on the books and the performance of laws in practice
    limit the effectiveness of institutions in preventing coordination failures. For instance, although
    business legislation often follows best practice, Poland does not have an efficient judiciary system
    that can implement insolvency rulings, enforce contracts promptly, protect property rights, and
    register business partnerships (registration of limited liability companies is the remit of courts in
    Poland). Spatial plans, an important tool to coordinate investments and generate spillovers through
    clustering, are mandatory but only cover less than half of Poland’s urban areas. In addition, the
    significant presence of SOEs in some sectors affects how the rules of the game are enforced,
    consequently disadvantaging minority investors, distracting from investments, and making it harder
    to create a level playing field for all businesses.

76. Further, more attention needs to be given to safeguarding advances by insulating the
    regulatory process from capture by interest groups. Ensuring transparency, adequate public
    consultations, and ex ante impact analysis are ways to prevent undue influence (World Bank 2017b).
    Poland has put in place central databases listing regulatory plans, while draft and final regulations
    have been set up by the national government. However, the extent, length, and depth of public
    consultations are insufficient. Poland has one of the shortest comment periods for regulatory
    proposals of all OECD countries, and the length of public consultations compares unfavorably with
    many middle-income countries outside the OECD (for example, Brazil and Romania). Public
    hearings in parliament are rare, as parliament usually decides upon laws quickly, which limits the
    ability of stakeholders to inform and participate in lawmaking. Finally, regulatory impact
    assessments should be used in parliament and not be limited to the executive branch.
77. Indeed, some economic actors                Figure 2.17. Drivers of EU Funds Allocation from the

78. Moreover, there is significant variation in regulatory performance across regions. The latest
    within-country Doing Business study suggests that, a common nationwide legal framework
    notwithstanding, the performance of institutions varies across the country, and regional differences
    could constrain equality of opportunity (Box 2.1). Similarly, the presence of SOEs affects how the
    rules of the game are enforced.

   Despite being a unitary state and applying business regulations across regions, Poland exhibits significant in-
   country variation in regulatory performance. A 2015 subnational report of the World Bank’s Doing Business
   series, found that the time to obtain construction permits in Poland can vary by up to 80 days between the best-
   and worst-performing cities in the country, with the top city hall beating the OECD average, as shown in Figure
   B2.1.1. However, the worst performers are trailing behind the OECD average.

79. Finally, the lack of predictability of regulations leads to regulatory uncertainty, an increasingly
    important concern for businesses. According to the theoretical literature, increased uncertainty
    depresses investment (Dixit and Pindyck 1994). Empirically, the links between policy uncertainty
    and investment and growth have been confirmed both cross-country (Aizenman and Marion 1993)
    and for individual states (Arza 2006). Bearing in mind recent and expected economic policy swings
    globally and in the EU, Poland should aim to stabilize its policies as much as possible and avoid
    falling into a spiral of constant changes, as experienced in Argentina over recent decades. In the
    World Economic Forum’s most recent Global Competitiveness Report, regulatory uncertainty
    advanced from the sixth to the third most important challenge to doing business cited by Polish
    executives (Schwab 2016). Policy instability has been also noted as a factor of concern in the
    European Commission’s most recent country assessment conducted as part of the European
    Semester, the EU’s annual cycle of policy surveillance and guidance launched in the aftermath of the
    European debt crisis (EC 2017a).


Flexible Labor Markets

80. Flexible labor markets facilitate the process of creative destruction and therefore foster
    productivity growth in more-advanced countries (Aghion, Askenazy, et al. 2009). They lift
    restrictions to the efficient allocation of labor, thus fostering improvements in productivity. Poland’s
    labor market regulations are moderately flexible in comparison with other OECD countries. The



                                                                                                      64
       OECD indicators of employment protection legislation (EPL) are synthetic indicators of the
       strictness of regulation in three categories: (a) protection of permanent workers against individual
       dismissal, (b) specific requirements for collective dismissal, and (c) regulation on temporary forms
       of employment. By these standards, Poland had greater protection of permanent workers and more
       regulations on temporary forms of employment than the OECD average (Figure 2.18 and Figure
       2.19) but fewer requirements for collective dismissal.

 81. Strong employment growth in Poland over the past decade helped to boost shared prosperity,
     but the high share of temporary contracts remains a concern. Between 2000 and 2016, the
     number of workers hired through temporary contracts increased by 3 million (Eurostat 2016 data). A
     portion of those contracts represent employment arrangements based on civil law, which are
     characterized by limited social protection (Figure 2.20). Permanent contracts decreased by 2 million
     between 2000 and 2004, and then increased by 1.5 million between 2005 and 2016. Overall,
     temporary employment represents the net employment growth since 2000, with the bulk of these
     jobs created between 2001 and 2007 (Figure 2.21). Survey data shows that most of the employment
     on temporary contracts is involuntary, with the exception of freelance professionals (who prefer civil
     law contracts for taxation reasons and because they are providing service to several clients) and
     older workers. As discussed in Chapter 3, the recent increase in labor costs of civil law contracts has
     some potential to reduce their appeal among employers, but given that the stock of such contracts
     remains high, labor market duality and different rules for permanent and temporary workers remain
     issues.

         82. In contrast, part-time jobs in Poland do not serve as an instrument for labor market flexibility.
             In 2015, only 7 percent of employment was part-time, compared with a 20 percent average in the
             EU-28 (Figure 2.22), and the share of part-time jobs has been decreasing. Moreover, most of the
             part-time employees in Poland claim that such arrangements are related to inability to find full-time
             jobs. In fact, Poland remains one of the countries with highest number of annual average hours
             worked per worker among OECD countries, and among EU countries it ranks second after Greece
             (Figure 2.23).

 83. A better balance between labor market flexibility and worker protection is needed. Flexible
     work arrangements should include greater flexibility to find part-time work and a reduction in
     administrative burdens and implicit costs associated with permanent labor contracts. As discussed in
     Chapter 3, segmentation of the labor market could be reduced by making all contracts subject to the
     same tax and social contributions regime, simplifying and better communicating labor regulations,
     streamlining legal dismissal procedures, limiting the use of temporary contracts, and strengthening
     unemployment assistance. Notably, an individualized type of targeted job and social assistance
     program could help to include the unemployed who may otherwise be left out. In addition to these
     efforts, a more strategic approach to migration may help to reduce labor shortages and add labor
     market flexibility, as discussed below.

 84. Focused and strategic openness to migration could assist with labor shortages and contribute
     to labor market flexibility as well as to the higher-productivity, technology-intensive economy
     needed for sustained growth. Appendix C summarizes recent migration patterns and the existing
     arrangements for immigrants. Poland’s working-age population is projected to shrink by 40 percent
     between 2015 and 2060, and migration at its current level is not sufficient to mitigate the sharp
     decline (Brandt 2016). As labor shortages are starting to emerge (Brandt 2016; EC 2017a; OECD
     2016e), it is most important to boost labor force participation (especially for women) and to enhance
     efficiency by removing barriers to internal labor mobility (OECD 2014b).15 Although priority should
     be placed on maximizing the productive capacity of the population and resolving structural issues in
     the labor market, a well-designed immigration policy that is based on a comprehensive assessment
     of the labor market can help address short-run labor shortages. A system that is flexible enough to
     quickly respond to labor shortages, yet transparent and efficient in its process of admitting and
     managing immigrants, can go a long way toward meeting the labor demands of a more dynamic
     economy. At the same time, it is also important to make better use of the skills of existing migrants.
     A recent survey indicates that 24 percent of immigrant workers claimed to have qualifications higher
     than required by the current work they do, which is higher than the 20 percent reported for Polish
     citizens (GUS 2015a).


Solid Skills and High-Quality Tertiary Education

 85. Innovation requires frontier researchers and thus good universities and research centers,
     whereas good undergraduate education is sufficient for imitation. For instance, Aghion,
     Blundell, et al. (2009) find that research and development enhances productivity growth the most in
     frontier U.S. states (such as California and Massachusetts), where a higher fraction of firms are
     "frontier firms"—that is, firms whose productivity is close to the best practice in the corresponding
     sector. On the other hand, two-year college education is what enhances productivity growth more in
     less-advanced states (such as Alabama and Mississippi), where imitation (that is, catch-up growth) is
     the main source of technological progress, and good undergraduate education enhances imitation.
     Similarly, Vandenbussche, Aghion, and Meghir (2006) find that higher (and especially graduate)
     education enhances productivity growth more in countries with higher per capita GDP.

      Low labor mobility is attributed to several factors: regional variation in the generosity of unemployment benefits;
     a uniform minimum wage despite differences in cost of living across regions; an underdeveloped railway system,
     restricting accessibility to job opportunities; and the lack of housing supply in the urban rental market, combined
     with the high share of owner occupancy (OECD 2014b; also see Chapter 3).

 86. Poland has shown success in expanding tertiary education.16 Poland witnessed a substantial
     increase in the proportion of university graduates among its cohorts of workers: in the mid-2010s, 25
     percent of individuals, ages 15–64 years, had tertiary education compared with around 12.6 percent
     in the mid-2000s (Figure 2.24). Strong increases in tertiary education (Figure 2.25) and high-skilled,
     high-paying jobs suggest that Poland’s investments in higher education over the past two decades
     have paid off.

 87. However, declining birth rates, complemented by various other factors,17 have induced a
     continuous decrease in student enrollment and a change in sector composition. The number of
     students increased from 0.40 million in the academic year 1990/91 to a peak of 1.95 million in
     2005/06 (GUS 2016a). With declining births, student numbers have declined by more than 25
     percent, to 1.41 million in 2015/16 (GUS 2016a)—the 10th consecutive year with a decline in
     student numbers. This has resulted in a reduced number of higher education institutions (HEIs) and a
     shift toward public higher education provision as private sector provision has contracted since 2006,
     partly because of a constant number of publicly sponsored, non-fee-paying students in public
     institutions despite lower enrollment numbers (Arnhold and Püttmann 2017).

 88. Poland needs to improve the quality of its public research. Poland’s research performance is
     below many of its EU peers, as evidenced by its research system rankings in the 2016 European
     Innovation Scoreboard. For example, it ranks near the bottom of the EU in international scientific

16
     “Higher education” and “tertiary education” are used interchangeably throughout the document.
17
      Among those factors are the vanishing effect of a rapidly increasing enrollment of nontraditional (older) students
     who seized the chance to study that opened up after the political changes in 1989/90; reduced incentives to
     postpone labor market entry via higher education enrollment due to less-critical economic circumstances; and
     labor migration of Polish youth following Poland’s EU acc ession in 2004 (Socrates Institute 2011, 25–26).




                                                                                               68
        copublications18 as well as in scientific publications that are among the top 10 percent most cited.19
        The Polish research output is also less internationally oriented, with only about one-third of
        publications copublished internationally (the lowest value among all EU-28 member states), because
        the current evaluation system incentivizes quantity rather than quality of publications. Poland
        benefited in total from only 1.1 percent of all FP720 funding allocated to beneficiaries from the EU-
        28 and has even lower results in the first calls of Horizon 2020 (EC 2017a). Poland also
        underperforms OECD averages in terms of public R&D expenditure (per GDP), top 500 universities
        (per GDP), and publications in the top journals (per GDP), as shown in Figure 2.26.

 89. Research funding for HEIs has become increasingly competitive, potentially helping to
     improve the performance of Polish science and innovation. Research funding was long
     characterized by the importance of institution-based funding. This changed with the establishment of
     two independent research councils: the National Science Center (NCN), which distributes state
     funding for basic research, and the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR), which
     distributes state funding and EU Structural Funds resources for applied research and university-
     business links.21 The introduction of those two councils increased the importance of competition-
     based funding in the field of research. It is envisaged that from 2020 onward at least 50 percent of all
     research funding will be allocated on a competitive basis. The new mode of research funding has the
     potential to improve the research performance of HEIs and, thereby, the Polish science and
     innovation system’s overall performance—an important objective in the face of comparatively low
     performance (OECD 2016f), as illustrated in Figure 2.26. However, the new funding modalities
     induced a vertical stratification within the research sector. Of all NCN grants, more than 40 percent
     were awarded to the 10 best-performing institutions in 2014 (NCN n.d.). Those institutions that have
     a strong research base are at a systematic advantage concerning the acquisition of research funding,
     leading to a self-reinforcing stratification over time.


 90. The situation of higher education funding is furthermore affected by the Institutes of the
     Polish Academy of Sciences. These institutes employ around 3,700 research staff members and are
     responsible for a relevant share of publications (PAS 2016), therefore constituting a considerable
     part of the Polish science system. They furthermore receive a significant share of public research
     funding, which diverts funding away from HEIs. This overall situation has induced discussions on
     their future as separate institutions. One option considered is to merge them with universities;
     another is to consolidate them into a single university that offers education at all three program
     levels (bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, and doctoral levels).

     Poland has 251 scientific publications with at least one coauthor based abroad (per million population), compared
     with 661 in the Czech Republic and 2067 in Denmark.
19
     Poland has 5 percent of scientific publications (as a percentage of total scientific publications of the country)
     among the top 10 percent most-cited publications worldwide, compared with 7 percent in the Czech Republic and
     15 percent in the Netherlands.

91. Focusing on the core challenges ahead, two broad tasks for the Polish government and the
    higher education sector stand out: finding the right response to the effects of the demographic
    developments, and taking further reform efforts to improve the quality of tertiary education.
    In the face of the far-reaching impact of the decline in student numbers, there is a need for a
    comprehensive vision for the Polish higher education sector. Such a vision would, among other




                                                                         70
    motivations, be required as the basis for strategic sector steering. The issues that a new vision would
    have to address include the changing composition of the sector, particularly the relation between
    public and private provision; the inevitable consolidation process of institutions; and the future
    landscape of the sector more generally and its diversity, including diversity of regional coverage
    (Socrates Institute 2011).

92. Implementing quality higher education will require coordination and concerted efforts by
    education providers, the private sector, and the government. HEIs appear well placed to (a)
    increase the relevance and quality of their training offerings by devising programs and courses in
    line with skill demand; and (b) expand access to a more diverse student population by offering
    various modes of delivery (for example, including e-learning possibilities) and adapting support
    services to the needs and living conditions of learners. Strong engagement from the private sector is
    required to ensure that programs are aligned with employers’ skill demands. The needed engagement
    includes, among other things, private sector involvement in designing and implementing training
    programs and activating groups of learners currently underrepresented in adult education (as detailed
    in Chapter 3). Such initiatives could be particularly relevant for companies from the more innovative
    and faster-developing sectors of the economy, for which skill shortages are a particular concern,
    including for larger firms that benefit from international (technological) exposure through substantial
    FDI. Public sector facilitation of such processes will be required to ensure coordination and clear
    framework going forward, as discussed in Chapter 3.


Equity-Based Financing

93. The fourth pillar for innovation-led productivity growth is equity-based financing. A bank-
    based financial system enhances productivity growth more in less-advanced countries, whereas a
    more market-based financial system enhances productivity growth more in countries that are more at
    the frontier (Koch 2014). This is because frontier innovation entails a higher level of risk than
    imitation activities, which are already well defined. However, outside financiers involved in frontier
    innovation will demand a higher share of upside revenues and higher control rights, hence the role of
    equity in financing frontier innovation.

94. Poland’s financial system has been expanding rapidly and remains dominated by banks.
    Poland’s financial sector depth is in line with its income level and the country performs better than
    its peers in access to finance for firms. The banking sector is liquid and well capitalized amid
    declining profits due to narrowing interest margins and higher administrative costs, including the
    bank asset tax and additional contributions to the Bank Guarantee Fund. The country has room for
    further financial development to support stable economic growth (Sahay et al. 2015) (Figure 2.27,
    Figure 2.28).

     The banking sector is more
     focused on extending loans to the household segment, with household loans making up 28 percent of
     total loans in 2015 compared with the EU average of 18 percent. The equity market is heavily used
     by the financial sector firms, and the market capitalization (29 percent of GDP in 2015) is below the
     EU average (53 percent of GDP). Bond markets are liquid—but dominated by T-bonds—while
     nonfinancial corporations’ share in total debt issuance amounted to only around 10 percent in 2016.
     Also, the quality of corporate sector financial reporting needs to be improved, along with the
     transposition of the EU audit legislation into the national law order. The European Commission’s
     “Capital Markets Union” framework23 provides a good anchor in this regard to implement
     institutional reforms and upgrade infrastructure.

    schemes, partly thanks to the EU
    programs. However, it lags significantly behind OECD and other countries in venture capital
    investments (Figure 2.31) and needs to prioritize addressing challenges in this area to support
    innovation-led growth. Public sector facilitation will be needed to ensure consistency of policies and
    coordination with the private sector.


Strategic Interventions to Enhance Productivity Growth

98. To reconcile the need to invest in the main levers of innovation-led growth with that of
    maintaining budget discipline, governments must become more strategic. In the transition to
    innovation-led growth, the state needs to accompany the process of creative destruction by
    implementing sectoral policies that are competition-friendly. However, the existence of knowledge
    externalities (reinforced by the existence of credit constraints) implies that the state cannot
    completely withdraw from the economy. To address the challenge of reconciling growth with
    budgetary discipline, governments and states must become strategic (Aghion and Roulet 2011) in
    terms of their public investment policy; improving the efficiency of EU funds, and R&D policy.


Strategic Public Investment Policy

99. Investment in Poland is comparable to the EU average, supported by buoyant public
    investment and less salient private investment. Investment averaged 20 percent of GDP during
    2002–16—very close to the EU average but substantially lower than top performers such as the
    Czech Republic, Estonia, or Romania (Figure 2.32). Although the private sector has dominated
    Poland’s growth, private investments remain substantially below those for the EU as a whole (Figure
    2.33). This is even more evident if compared with peer countries, such as the other three Visegrád
    Group countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia) or other new member states of the EU. In

       contrast, public investment remained strong throughout the cycle, averaging 4.1 percent of GDP in
       the past 15 years.

 100. Private sector investment has been weak in Poland and has not managed to maintain the
     same pace as the overall output. The private sector in 2016 invested somewhat less than 15 percent
     of GDP in capital stock, which puts Poland at the lower end of all EU countries. In addition, Poland
     differs from the EU average in terms of composition of total investment. Construction is lower than
     the EU average, while equipment investment is above the EU average (reflecting the high share of
     industry and continuous technological catching-up), and investment in intangible assets (such as
     intellectual property rights and R&D) is particularly low in comparison with the EU average. Given
     the extent of state involvement in the economy, public-private partnerships (PPPs) as well as private
     concessions, particularly in infrastructure, remain underdeveloped in Poland.

 101. This strong performance of public investment is highly connected with the availability of
     EU funds. Around one quarter of total public investment is funded by EU funds. Poland has fully
     used the available funding for the 2007–13 EU budget period. At €68 billion, the EU Cohesion Fund
     transfers to Poland were among the largest in the EU, amounting to, on average, around 2.2 percent
     of GDP per year. The importance of reliance on EU funding was confirmed in 2016 when
     investment activity declined significantly because of low utilization of the EU funds at the local
     government level. The EU funds, which on average represented a third of the overall local
     government investment, collapsed to around one-tenth of their overall investment in 2016.

 102. Investment is a key channel for innovation and adoption as new capital vintages embed
     technological progress. Upgraded capital stock enables the development of new products,

    processes, production or marketing techniques, and finally output expansion. However, there is also
    a feedback loop between weak investment in physical capital and productivity, which materialized
    during the latest global crisis. In reaction to the crisis, vulnerable firms reduced their R&D expenses
    and slowed down the adoption of new technologies, which in turn translated into lower productivity
    gains (Aghion et al. 2012; Adler et al. 2017). R&D expenditure becomes procyclical as weaker
    balance sheets led to a reduction in investment in intangible assets. Then, weaker productivity gains
    led to even weaker demand and investment.

    Diminishing returns to assets in
    Poland over time may be linked to projects that are important from the social but not necessarily
    economic perspective (such as stadiums, swimming pools, regional airports, and others).

104. The state has an active role to play in innovation-led growth provided it is more strategic in
    its public investment policies. A strategic state manages to reconcile growth with budget discipline,
    and instead of Keynesian policies to foster growth through indiscriminate public spending, it
    becomes selective in public investment management (Aghion and Roulet 2011). Strategic
    governments focus public investments on a limited number of growth-enhancing areas such as
    education and universities (as previously discussed); sectors with high growth potential and positive
    externalities (such as infrastructure investments in transportation, energy, and broadband networks);
    and R&D efforts. In this subsection, we focus on infrastructure investments in transportation and the
    ICT network. The next subsection focuses on improving the efficiency of EU funds to stimulate
    private investment, and the following subsection addresses R&D policies.

105. In particular, the quality of trade and transport infrastructure remains a constraint to
    Poland’s infrastructure connectivity and to private sector investment. A long-term life-cycle
    approach to managing and financing transport and ICT infrastructure will help to improve spending
    efficiency, prepare for the likely phasing-out of EU financing, and reduce the overall infrastructure

        gap. Great progress was achieved particularly in road infrastructure, thanks to significant
        expenditures from the state budget and sizable EU funds: in 2004, Poland had only 470 kilometers of
        highways and about 200 kilometers of express roads; in late 2016, their total lengths increased to
        1,632 kilometers and 1,532 kilometers, respectively. Still, this network seems largely incomplete if
        compared with the 2030 plans of the road administration (Map 2.1) or with advanced EU countries.
        In particular, improvements in rail infrastructure lagged behind ambitious plans, which led to a loss
        of railway transport’s share in modal split.24 The lack of coordination of transport investment
        programs across all transport modes and the limited number of modern intermodal terminals resulted
        in limited complementarity of the different transport modes and suboptimal use of the existing
        infrastructure. Progress in rehabilitating road and railway networks, beyond the major transit
        corridors, was limited, and the number of bottlenecks remains significant. This is particularly
        noticeable for “last mile” infrastructure, usually managed by local governments. Efficiency and the
        degree of integration of urban, metropolitan, and regional passenger transport systems is limited, and
        although intelligent transport systems have been developed by many municipalities, they are often
        fragmented and have limited impact. The availability of long-term financing for infrastructure
        remains limited in Poland.

 106. Similarly, the use of ICT services and ICT-enabled services, particularly those based on
     most innovative technologies, are a constraint to innovation. Polish firm-level preparedness to
     integrate new ICT and technologies (such as cloud computing, 3-D printing, and other online buyer-
     seller platforms) is seemingly weak. Firms in Poland have been slow to adopt the latest available
     digital technologies. In fact, more-advanced digital technologies have not yet spread widely (Figure
     2.35). Although firms in Poland are relatively advanced in using supply chain management software,
     they lag most European countries in e-commerce, pointing to untapped opportunities for Polish
     services firms to raise their productivity. Firms in Poland also lag their European peers in using cost-

 107. Poland can improve access for consumers and businesses to digital goods and services
     through cross-border e-commerce, enforcing consumer protection, speeding up product
     delivery, enforcing competition and copyright laws, and reducing the administrative burden of
     doing business online. Poland can also improve conditions for digital networks and innovative
     services by incentivizing investment into high-speed broadband; supporting new business models for
     content distribution; developing cross-sectoral online platforms designed to increase the
     transparency and availability of information (for example, assuring online access to audited financial
     statements of companies); and building trust and security in the handling of personal data. Finally,
     Poland can maximize the growth of its digital economy by ensuring that its citizens have the right
     skills to take advantage of economic opportunities (including jobs, e-commerce, and e-learning)
     provided by digital markets.

     supply, waste and wastewater disposal, and
     energy generation. Significant shifts in EU funds from year to year largely affected the dynamics of
     total investment in Poland.25 For example, in 2016, a substantial decrease in EU funds contributed to
     the decline in total investment and outweighed the impact of other investment growth, which was
     positive, according to National Bank of Poland (NBP) estimates (Figure 2.36). More efficient use of
     EU funds could become transformative in increasing product market competition to the local market.

 109. Utilizing financial instruments (instead of grants) could increase the efficiency of EU funds
     and hence prepare for the lower EU budget after 2020. Given their revolving nature, financial
     instruments enable reinvestment, leverage private resources, and provide incentives to better
     performance. So far, the bulk of EU funds have been used in the form of grants. Committed financial
     instruments (loans, microcredit, or other instruments used to capitalize guarantees and equity)
     constituted less than 2 percent of the total funds envelope for 2007–13 in Poland compared with the
     EU average of 4.6 percent. However, as EU policy shifts from pure grant financing to an approach
     with greater private sector leverage, Poland will need innovative financing and greater efficiency of
     infrastructure spending. This calls for improved infrastructure planning and financing structures that
     combine private, EU, and public financing. Developing innovative financial instruments would
     effectively “lengthen” the availability of EU funds along with use of the current EU-level funding
     options such as European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI).

    capacity largely determines the efficiency and
    value added of investments.

111. In terms of ensuring the efficiency of use of EU funds across regions, it is important to
    remember that growth is not evenly spread across space, and economic activity tends to
    concentrate in the most productive areas. The experiences of countries that went through phases
    of rapid growth (like Poland in recent decades) show that spatial disparity of development and
    emergence of lagging regions are a common side effect (Map 2.2). Arguably, growing disparities
    between leading and lagging regions can be interpreted as a natural result of rapid development.
    Economic growth and development are largely driven by a concentration of people and resources in
    the most productive areas of the country, which gradually spreads to other areas, including lagging
    regions, as major cities become more connected and expansive. Those lagging regions, typically
    located in peripheral areas, have poorer access to markets and infrastructure as well as weaker
    institutions. However, Poland also faces differences in opportunities across regions, with persistent
    differences in health and education outcomes (see Chapter 3). Moreover, businesses face important
    different environments in terms of the ease of conducting business because of differences in
    services, regulations, access to the judiciary, and to access to finance. It is up to the state to reduce
    these differences, ensuring that individuals have equal opportunities regardless of where they were
    born, and ensuring businesses can thrive based on their productive potential and not as a
    consequence of regulatory differences.

 112. In Poland, less-developed regions were the beneficiaries of most EU funding, but the spatial
     allocation of EU funding within regions was uneven. Less-developed regions (defined as regions
     achieving less than 75 percent of EU average GDP per capita in purchasing power standard (PPS)
     have been the major benefactors of EU cohesion policies in recent decades. For the 2007–13
     programming period, lagging regions accounted for 82 percent of funding allocated to Poland
     through EU Structural Funds (Sivaev 2017). However, the spatial allocation of EU funding within
     the regions was not even. The more urbanized and developed municipalities and counties received a
     larger share of EU funds than the rest. The provincial capitals and their functional areas absorbed an
     especially large share of funds. For instance, among all Polish regions, the biggest funding gap
     between a capital and the rest of its territory was observed in Podkarpackie (Map 2.3). The
     agglomeration of Rzeszów received Zl 1,753 (about US$450) more funding per capita than the rest
     of the province. Further analysis of the existing regional transfer formulas would be useful, including
     whether it would make sense to condition regional EU funds on performance and on ways to further
     interconnect administrative regions.
 113. Going forward, the focus of investments in lagging areas should be on education and health.
     International development experience shows that basic infrastructure and services (along with basic
     institutional conditions) have the most significant impact at low levels of development, while at
     latter stages of development, human capital plays a critical role. Recent World Bank analysis of



                                                       81
    growth patterns in 750 of the world’s largest cities showed that human capital and innovation are
    important determinants of growth for cities of upper-middle and high income but not at the low-
    income level (Kilroy, Mukim, and Negri 2015). At current levels of development of lagging regions,
    further growth and transition to high-income status will require innovation. Thus, greater attention
    should be given to investments in education, health care, and other forms of human capital
    development and innovation infrastructure.

114. Moreover, place-based private sector development policies should start with building the
    capacity of local actors. Generally, place-based policies do not work, though there are cases when
    they do. Cities that have managed to turn themselves around despite adversity were characterized by
    an inclusive and well-informed approach to policy making at a local level. They often had broad-
    based coalitions of actors as well as rather sophisticated and capable governments. This suggests
    that, to potentially succeed, place-based policies should be driven by local actors and only
    implemented if coordination of multiple actors and their capacity for joint prioritization of
    investments can be demonstrated. But first, the investments should focus on building the capacity of
    local actors to design and implement economic development initiatives in an inclusive manner. This
    effort may include supporting development of formal public-private dialogue structures, technical
    trainings, improving planning and budgeting practices, increasing transparency and accountability of
    governing bodies, and optimizing organizational structures to promote focus on implementation.

    patent applications, and patents
    issued). On the input side, Poland

    R&D activities or implement
    innovations (NBP 2016). The most innovative countries show high levels of R&D expenditure (up to
    nearly 3 percent or more of GDP), in particular from private sources. In Poland, private-source
    spending on R&D amounts to only about 0.5 percent of GDP (Figure 2.38). Moreover, innovative
    companies are concentrated in a small number of manufacturing sectors, have predominantly foreign
    ownership, and are export-oriented (although their investment in new technologies is usually in the




                                                               82
        form of purchasing new machinery and equipment—suggesting a process of technology adoption
        rather than strictly defined innovation).

 116. As a result, Poland performs poorly in a number of measures of frontier innovation. On the
     output side, Poland underperforms in international rankings, with a low level of patent applications
     (Figure 2.39). Poland also stands low in international rankings in terms of technology intensity or
     export sophistication. In spite of significant increases in trade in the recent decade, the share of high-
     tech exports in manufactured exports is still below 10 percent (Figure 2.40). Map 2.4 highlights
     Poland’s position toward the low end of most measures of innovation within the EU—Poland is
     placed in the “moderate innovators’ grouped and ranked sixth from the bottom on the EU’s
     European Innovation Scoreboard for 2016.26 Although Poland has been relatively successful in
     imitating and adapting existing technologies, it will increasingly need to rely more on frontier
     innovations. A 2016 NBP analysis notes that Poland’s innovative potential is moderate because of
     relatively low levels of human and social capital, barriers to entrepreneurship, and focus on price
     competitiveness, as discussed earlier (NBP 2016). However, low R&D spending by companies; only
     sporadic cooperation between companies and scientific institutes; and lack of transparency in the
     system of innovation support, both in terms of its strategy and institutions involved, also play a role.

      The European Innovation Scoreboard rates the innovation performance of EU member states, distinguishing
     between three main types of indicators and eight innovation dimensions, capturing 25 different indicators in all.
     The “enablers” capture the main drivers of innovation performance external to the firm, covering Human
     Resources; Open, Excellent, and Attractive Research Systems; and Finance and Support. “Firm activities” capture
     the innovation efforts at the level of the firm, grouped into Firm Investments; Linkages & Entrepreneurship; and
     Intellectual Assets. “Outputs” cover the effects of firms’ innovation activities in two innovation dimensions:
     Innovators and Economic Effects.

117. Cooperation between science and industry needs to be strengthened to foster frontier
    innovation. As mentioned above, research excellence is a critical building block of innovation-led
    growth. Research then needs to be translated to enterprises through science-industry cooperation,
    including joint research, technology transfer, and commercialization initiatives. However, weak links
    between business and public science organizations continue to be a challenge in Poland. The bulk of
    business expenditures in recent years was for the acquisition and absorption of industrially available
    technologies (supported both by the previous system of tax incentives and by the EU Structural
    Funds in 2007–13). On the supply side, commercialization of R&D results is not a significant part of
    the performance evaluations of researchers or criteria for their academic promotion. Until recently,
    universities and research institutes were not incentivized to acquire external sources of financing.
    The number of research projects carried out by public universities and research organizations that
    were contracted by industry remains low. Business funding of research performed by academia was
    0.02 percent of GDP in 2015, one of the lowest levels in the EU-28. Of the innovative Polish
    companies, 10.6 percent cooperate with higher education institutions, compared with 12.2 percent in
    the Czech Republic and 20.4 percent in Belgium. Joint patent applications and copublications
    between science and industry are also low. In 2014, Poland had only 4 public-private copublications
    per million population, compared with 14 in the Czech Republic and 34 for the EU-28 (EC 2017a).

118. The Polish government has recently                   Map 2.4. General Country Classifications, 2016
    taken several steps to improve the                              EU Innovation Scoreboard
    coordination and governance of the
    research and innovation system. These
    include creation of the interministerial
    Council for Innovativeness; the
    “#StartInPoland” framework targeting start-
    ups; the Plan and Strategy for Responsible
    Development (including a review of Smart
    Specialization Strategies); the White Paper on
    Innovation; the Strategy for Scientific
    Excellence, Modern Higher Education,
    Partnership with Business and Responsible
    Research; an ordinance on distributing state
    subsidies for public and nonpublic higher
    education institutions; and the First Act on
    Innovativeness.

    the right direction. One example is a
    rigorous evaluation of NCBR’s In-Tech program, which provides grants to projects carried out by
    consortia of firms and research entities. In-Tech provides grants based on peer reviewer ratings:
    applications with a score above a threshold are offered funding. The evaluation found that projects
    supported by In-Tech would not otherwise get funded by other agencies or by the consortia
    themselves. It also found positive impacts on science-industry collaboration, innovation outputs, and
    product commercialization (Bruhn and McKenzie 2017). See Box 2.2 for more details.



                                                     84
120. Yet, the innovation support system remains fragmented, and there is scope for a more
    coordinated, strategic approach to R&D policy. Poland has hundreds of innovation support
    programs, funded by both the government and the EU and implemented by NCBR, the Polish
    Agency for Enterprise Development (PARP), the Ministry of Economic Development, regional
    (voivodeship) government agencies, and others. These are largely in the form of grants but also
    include loans, guarantees, and tax incentives. Risk aversion often steers funding toward low-risk
    capital expenditures and away from the critical high-risk early stages of the innovation process
    (Kapil et al. 2013). This dispersion of initiatives leads to duplication of objectives, higher
    administrative costs for the public sector as well as beneficiaries, and lack of strategic focus.

121. Based on a Schumpeterian endogenous growth model, the design of R&D policy should be
    streamlined. Fiscal instruments such as R&D subsidies and taxes affect firm survival and resource
    reallocation between incumbent and entrant firms. These instruments can be an effective way of
    providing innovation incentives to firms while also leveraging the selection margin in the economy
    (Acemoglu et al. 2013; Aghion and Akcigit 2015; Criscuolo et al. 2012). International evidence
    suggests that large incumbents are typically better than smaller ones at obtaining government
    subsidies (Criscuolo et al. 2012). Therefore, one can argue that R&D subsidies to incumbents might
    be preventing the entry of new firms and thus slowing down the replacement of inefficient
    incumbents by more-productive new entrants. In fact, Acemoglu et al. (2013) find that subsidizing
    incumbents reduces the equilibrium growth rate, and welfare decreases because it prevents low-
    ability incumbents from exiting, thereby inhibiting the entry of high-ability firms.

122. Moreover, the focus should be on basic research given the cross-industry spillovers it can
    generate. Basic research generates fundamental technological innovations and creates within and
    across industries spillovers that affect subsequent applied innovations and can lead to breakthrough
    technological advances. In a competitive market economy, there is underinvestment in basic research
    and overinvestment in applied research (Akcigit, Hanley, and Serrano-Velarde 2014). This is
    because a large fraction of spillovers from basic research across industries are not internalized. The
    overinvestment in applied research results from product market competition. As a result, there is a
    dynamic misallocation of research efforts, which reduces welfare significantly. Akcigit, Hanley, and
    Serrano-Velarde (2014) show that a uniform research subsidy has limited welfare improvements
    unless the policy maker is able to discriminate between types of research projects.

123. More generally, there is a need to shift Polish innovation policy toward frontier-pushing
    activities using new instruments under the EU funds and attracting R&D-intensive FDI.
    Although there is still scope for catching up by closing the gaps in technology adoption, these
    reserves may be exhausted at some point. Polish innovation policy needs to channel more resources
    into basic R&D and adopt the toolkit of financing instruments in line with trends in advanced
    economies, gradually switching from nonreimbursable grants to revolving instruments. The new
    growth strategy needs to encourage entrepreneurship and to support small businesses and start-ups—
    especially in the tech area—through a mixture of grants, loans, and venture capital as well as
    technical advice, mentoring, networking and incubation, greater internationalization of domestic
    firms, and attracting R&D-intensive FDI (Kapil et al. 2013). Critical to this task will be the capacity
    of the state to coordinate actions across the public and private sector.

                                        Program
The In-Tech program provides grants to consortia of research entities and firms for proposed research projects.
Applications receive a score based on peer reviewer ratings: applications with a score above a threshold are offered
funding. Based on this funding rule, Bruhn and McKenzie (2017) used a regression discontinuity (RD) design to
estimate the effects of receiving In-Tech funding for applicants to the 2012 and 2013 calls for proposals. Data from
In-Tech application forms show that applicants above and below the cutoff have similar characteristics, suggesting
that the RD approach is valid.
                                                            Figure B2.2.1 Impact of In-Tech on Research and
Looking at innovation outputs, they find that                                 Innovation
receiving In-Tech funding increases the
probability that the consortium applied for a
patent related to their proposed project (from
about 15 percent to 60 percent) and there is no
effect on applying for a patent for another project
(Figure B2.2.1). Most of the patent applications
have been to the Polish patent office, with no
significant increase in applications to the
European office. Similarly, members of a
consortium that received In-Tech funding are
more likely to publish a paper related to their
proposed project, with no significant effect on
publications related to other projects (Figure
B2.2.1).

Finally, for commercialization, they find that
receiving In-Tech funding leads to about a 20
percentage point higher probability of a product
related to the proposed project being ready for
sale or currently being sold in Poland. However,
these products currently only account for about 1
percent of firm sales.

Countercyclical Monetary and Fiscal Policies and Effective Public Finance as
Fundamental for Innovation

124. Countercyclical policy and effective public finance also belong to the suite of instruments of
    a strategic state. They can be treated as foundations for an innovation-led growth model and are
    complementary to its four policy pillars discussed above: product market competition, labor market
    flexibility, higher education and research, and capital market-based finance. Countercyclical
    monetary and fiscal policies contribute to encouraging firms to invest more in R&D and innovation.
    This is because they enhance growth as they help maintain aggregate consumption and therefore
    firms’ market size over the economic cycle (Aghion and Howitt 2009). Through stabilization of
    aggregate demand in the economy, more flexible fiscal and monetary policies can help credit-
    constrained firms to maintain R&D and other types of innovation-enhancing investments over the
    business cycle. Against this backdrop, debt and deficit targets should be formulated in structural
    terms and corrected for cyclical variations. Effective public finances contribute to stable and
    predictable conditions, which are beneficial for doing business and innovation.

125. Sound fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies along with prudent financial supervision
    are sine qua non conditions to boost investment and enhance productivity. Over the recent past
    decades, commitment to a strong macroeconomic policy mix enabled Poland to achieve
    macroeconomic stability and support growth. First, a credible inflation-targeting regime managed by
    an independent central bank reduced inflation to low and stable levels, while an open capital account
    and limited exchange rate intervention ensured an appropriate real exchange rate driven by market
    forces. In addition, strong fiscal rules helped contain debt and deficits of central and local
    governments. In the financial sector, a bank privatization program based on diversified investors’
    base during the transition, combined with effective regulation and supervision, established a sound,
    resilient financial system (Aldaz-Carroll, Skrok, and Van Den Brink 2017). Commitment to stability
    and consistency of policies will continue to be needed to reduce uncertainty.

126. With regard to financial sector stability, cooperative banks and credit unions could pose
    risks even though they are not systemically significant. Shares of cooperative banks and credit
    unions in total assets are relatively low, at 7 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. Although the
    headline indicators for the cooperative banks are relatively stable, larger cooperative banks face
    significant credit and liquidity risks stemming mostly from aggressive growth strategies and higher
    sectoral credit concentration (as evidenced by the failure of the largest cooperative bank at the end of
    2015). The credit unions continue to record losses, and their capital adequacy stands well below the
    minimum level of 5 percent, with seven credit unions going bankrupt in 2014–16. The total cost of
    these bankruptcies and payouts related to two cooperative bank insolvencies to the Bank Guarantee
    Fund were estimated to be around €1.5 billion in 2014–16, causing banks’ contributions to increase.
    Failures of these institutions signaled challenges to the supervisory framework of these sectors—
    including a need for high-quality financial reporting—and showed that the cost of a relatively small
    financial institution failure could be significant for the whole sector.

127. Moreover, the tax on financial sector assets imposes an additional burden on the banking
    sector along with the uncertainty over the foreign exchange (FX) mortgage conversion. In early
    2016 the government introduced a tax at the monthly rate of 0.0366 percent (0.44 percent
    annualized) on financial sector assets (except the purchase of government bonds). The asset tax



                                                    87
    reduces banks’ profitability and constrains their ability to increase prudential buffers in accordance
    with the EU’s Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).
    In the long run, the asset tax can increase the cost of credit, decrease the credit supply in favor of
    increased purchase of government bonds, raise in cross-border lending, and increase off-balance-
    sheet transactions. Other European countries that introduced similar asset taxes (including Finland,
    Hungary, and Slovenia) either fully canceled or lowered the tax in the short term to avoid these
    challenges. Polish authorities should also consider replacing the asset tax with a tax on profits.
    Uncertainty over the FX mortgage conversion is another factor posing risks to the financial sector
    stability. Any restructuring of the FX mortgages needs to ensure the soundness and stability of the
    banking sector, in line with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Committee on the
    restructuring of the FX housing loans from January 2017.

128. Fiscal rules have contributed to stability of Polish public finance, and their credibility needs
    to be preserved and supported by higher-quality public finance to boost productivity. The
    constitutional ceiling on public sector debt (60 percent of GDP) and the lower precautionary debt
    thresholds in the Public Finance Act as well as legally mandated limits on public sector spending,
    have restrained fiscal deficits. But the quality of public finance could be improved. Genuine public
    finance reform could provide for more transparent, efficient public expenditures through modernized
    and integrated budget classification and charts of accounts in the public sector. It could also result in
    a higher performance orientation, more vigorous review of spending proposals, or elimination of the
    least productive programs to broaden fiscal space for investments in the most productive areas—all
    in line with the strategic and selective management of public investments.

129. Poland has room to strengthen budget institutions and fiscal management to ensure higher-
    quality public spending and the best use of the available EU funds. Poland made important
    progress in bolstering the public planning, control, and compliance systems required to access and
    account for EU funds, becoming one of the most successful countries in utilizing EU cohesion funds
    (World Bank 2016). However, there is room for further progress. For instance, the government
    disseminates regular, cash-based financial information on the state budget, but that process lacks
    transparency and is insufficient for monitoring, decision making, or communication with citizens.
    Accrual-based financial reporting in the public sector is weak: Poland does not produce any set of
    consolidated financial statements, even for the central government. Also missing are a more
    comprehensive quantified statement of fiscal risks and contingent liabilities as well as information
    on nonfinancial assets and asset-related risks. Public investment needs to be better managed and
    coordinated with the absorption of EU funds, while key aspects for budget management include a
    narrower scope for automatic indexation of spending, a medium-term framework for the budget, and
    regular spending reviews to ensure that fiscal policy is appropriate for the stage of the economic
    cycle.

130. In light of expected weaker inflows of foreign investments and prospects of lower inflows of
    EU funds after 2020, higher domestic savings will be necessary, and the public sector could
    play an exemplary role. Higher savings would enable Poland to reduce its net negative investment
    position and its dependence on external debt, including volatile portfolio flows. This is because
    foreign financing is likely to decline, population aging will place increasingly greater burdens on the
    pension system, and productivity growth will slow as Poland catches up with productivity in other
    countries. There is scope for an increase in domestic saving from the private sector, particularly by
    households. Chapter 4 discusses the role of voluntary pension spending in this regard.



                                                    88
131. Finally, Poland’s tax policy and tax administration reform agenda is comprehensive.
    Reform requires addressing the existing tax gaps—particularly in the value added tax (VAT) and
    corporate income tax (CIT)—and harmonizing the labor tax wedge between regular contracts based
    on the labor code and atypical ones based on civil law. These interventions are about ensuring a level
    playing field and limiting possible abuse and unfair competition. There is scope to make taxes in
    Poland simpler, more efficient and progressive, and more predictable at least over the medium term.
    In general, upgrading the tax system can boost productivity by minimizing differentiated tax
    treatments across assets and financing; by reducing the unfair cost advantage enjoyed by firms they
    underreport their sales to the tax authorities; and by reducing compliance costs of small firms (IMF
    2017b). There is scope for improvement in Poland in all of these areas.


Priorities for Growth

132. Poland has experienced nearly three decades of fast and stable growth, grounded by robust
    productivity gains, but further increases in productivity will depend on Poland’s ability to
    transition to an innovation-led growth model. Capital accumulation was also significant in
    explaining growth in Poland, while the contribution of labor was relatively small. However, recent
    estimates of Poland’s potential output and its drivers suggest a markedly diminishing role of
    productivity, as productivity increases resulting from structural reallocation have declined and the
    contribution of firm turnover is still small. As Poland converges with other high-income countries, it
    will no longer be able to grow based on low labor costs and will need to transition toward an
    innovation-led growth model. The next five years provide a window of opportunity for Poland to
    prepare for this transition while still enjoying the benefit of ample EU funding and continued
    growth.

133. Only a more strategic, effective and accountable state can successfully manage the
    transition toward innovation-led growth, because it will require commitment, coordination,
    and cooperation. A capable and accountable state can build consensus across actors that can cement
    trust and ensure private sector cooperation. Otherwise, existing market inefficiencies or negative
    externalities (such as incumbent firms’ privileged position, underinvestment in R&D, and pollution)
    could be replaced by state failures.

134. Such a change will require competition and improvements in product-market regulations.
    More intense competition and free entry enhances innovation and growth as the country approaches
    the technological frontier. State control, barriers to trade and investment, and barriers to
    entrepreneurship restrict competition in product markets. The single most important unresolved
    challenge weighing on product markets is state control and the significant role of SOEs, which
    account for almost half the revenues of the biggest enterprises listed on the stock market. As for
    barriers to trade and investment, Poland has a strong track record of liberalized foreign trade and has
    attracted sizable FDIs, but mounting overregulation or increased policy uncertainty might have
    discouraged new investors. Regarding barriers to entrepreneurship, Poland’s regulatory environment
    suffers from discrepancies between the laws on the books and the performance of those laws in
    practice. Late payments, slow administration proceedings, excessive reporting requirements, and
    frequent changes in regulations also surface in surveys of Polish businesses. Moreover, there are
    significant variations in regulatory performance across regions. Going forward, more attention needs



                                                   89
    to be given to safeguarding advances by insulating the regulatory process from capture by interest
    groups. Finally, improving the predictability of regulations should help to limit uncertainty—an
    increasingly important concern for businesses. The state will need to demonstrate continued and
    credible commitment to competition, which will inevitably require a new consensus to removing the
    remaining barriers.

135. Labor market flexibility and strategic openness to migration would also improve
    productivity. Poland’s labor regulations flexibility is moderate relative to other OECD countries,
    with the increasing share of temporary contracts having been the main source of flexibility over the
    past decade. In contrast, part-time jobs are typically not available as a source for greater flexibility.
    Needed now are flexible work arrangements, including greater flexibility to find part-time work, and
    a reduction in administrative burdens and implicit costs associated with permanent labor contracts.
    Segmentation of the labor market could be reduced by making all contracts subject to the same tax
    and social contributions regime, limiting the use of temporary contracts, and strengthening
    unemployment assistance. An effective immigration policy could be complementary to these efforts
    and help Poland cope with the challenge of a shrinking workforce and an aging population. Again, a
    consensus will be needed to better balance labor market flexibility and greater job security.

136. Innovation will require frontier researchers and good universities and research centers.
    Poland witnessed a substantial increase in the proportion of university graduates, but declining birth
    rates have induced a continuous decrease in student enrollment and a change in sector composition.
    Research funding has become more competitive, but further efforts are needed to improve the
    quality of tertiary education and research. Implementing quality higher education will require
    concerted efforts by education providers, the private sector, and the government. Strong engagement
    from the private sector is required to ensure that programs are aligned with employers’ skill
    demands. Such initiatives could be particularly relevant for companies from the more innovative and
    faster-developing sectors of the economy, for which skill shortages are a particular concern,
    including for larger firms that benefit from international (technological) exposure through substantial
    FDI. Public sector facilitation of such processes will be required to ensure coordination and a clear
    framework.

137. Financing innovation will require a greater reliance on capital markets. Poland’s financial
    sector depth is in line with its income level, and the country performs better than its peers in access
    to finance for firms. However, there is need for further diversification of the financial sector through
    capital markets development or venture capital investment, in line with the innovation-led growth
    strategy. To take advantage of an increased supply of venture capital, efforts to increase dealflow
    and investment readiness of firms will also be needed. Again, public sector facilitation, a clear
    regulatory framework, the development of alternative long-term funding instruments, and mobilizing
    a wider investor base will be needed to ensure consistency of policies and coordination with the
    private sector.

138. To address the challenge of reconciling growth with budgetary discipline, Poland must
    become strategic in terms of its public investment policy, improving the efficiency of EU funds
    to stimulate private investment, and streamlining and better targeting its R&D policy. Strategic
    states focus public investments on a limited number of growth-enhancing areas with high growth
    potential and positive externalities. In addition to education, a long-term life-cycle approach to
    managing and financing transport and ICT infrastructure will help to improve spending efficiency,



                                                    90
    prepare for the likely reduction of EU financing, and gradually bridge the overall infrastructure gap,
    including in the digitalization agenda. In terms of improving the efficiency of EU funds, utilizing
    revolving financial instruments (instead of grants) could prove effective. The focus on investments
    in lagging areas could focus more on education and health as well as building the capacity of local
    actors. R&D spending is low, the enterprise innovation support system in Poland is fragmented, and
    the country lacks a strategic approach to R&D policy. Going forward, the design of R&D policy
    should be streamlined and focused on basic research. Also, better-targeted and more effective
    innovation support programs will be especially critical if the level of EU funding for innovation falls
    after the current EU’s funding cycle. Also on this front, the capacity of the state will be critical to
    coordinate actions across the public and private sector.

139. Finally, investment and growth will depend on commitment to sound macroeconomic
    policies and low uncertainty. Prudent financial supervision and countercyclical monetary and fiscal
    policy are sine qua non conditions to boost productivity. Fiscal rules have contributed to stability of
    the Polish public finance and their credibility needs to be preserved. In light of expected weaker
    inflows of foreign investments and the prospects of lower inflows of EU funds after 2020, higher
    domestic savings will be necessary, and the public sector could play an exemplary role. Finally,
    Poland should strengthen budget institutions and upgrade its tax system to improve accountability of
    public finance on both the public spending and revenue sides. Critical to this task will be the
    consistency of policies across government levels, and ensuring trust and cooperation from private
    agents in their implementation.



    Box 2.3. Knowledge Gaps Affecting Poland’s Growth Potential
    Critical knowledge gaps identified in this chapter include
         • Economywide impact of reducing labor market duality;
         • Mechanisms to smooth shifts in public investment and EU funds absorption;
         • Diagnostic of labor shortages where migrants could play an important role;
         • Regional transfer formulas, including whether it would make sense to condition regional
           EU funds on performance and ways to further interconnect administrative regions; and
         • Analysis of the composition, effectiveness, and efficiency of R&D and innovation support
           measures.

Chapter 3: Enhancing Inclusion
Ensuring that growth is inclusive will require continued increases in labor incomes, which will depend on
equitable access to high-quality health and education services, activating the labor force, minimizing
labor market exclusion, and reducing barriers to mobility. The redistributive impact of fiscal and social
policies will need to complement the increase in labor incomes and address the needs of the most
vulnerable. This agenda will require consistent policies, enhanced coordination and cooperation between
public and private sectors, and a more effective state.


Introduction

 140. Demographic and technological changes will pose important challenges going forward. As
     discussed in Chapter 1, despite recent reductions in poverty and improvements in shared prosperity
     over the past 15 years, important challenges remain. The most important challenge has to do with the
     demographic change and what this will mean for shared prosperity. Second, Poland will increasingly
     have to adjust to technological improvements across the globe by improving the quality of its labor
     force to ensure that incomes can continue to rise across the population. Third, Poland continues to
     face exclusion of some groups, with high economic costs for society, including the unemployed or
     precariously employed, rural populations, the elderly, the disabled, women, and youth. These
     challenges will inevitably require a more effective state.


141. Poland needs to strengthen households’ capacity to diversify their assets base and to engage
    productively—improving access to high-quality health and education services, promoting
    activation, reducing barriers to mobility, and addressing the needs of the most vulnerable.
    Economic growth, changes in poverty, and changes in inequality are jointly determined (Ferreira
    2010). This chapter relies on an assets-based framework to identify the contributors to these changes
    and the capacity of households to contribute more actively to economic growth. Following Bussolo
    and López-Calva (2014), the potential for labor income growth depends on the accumulation of
    assets in the form of human, physical, financial, and social capital; the intensity of use of those
    assets; and the returns to those assets. Fiscal and social policies can complement labor incomes
    through net taxes and social transfers by redistributing incomes and protecting the most vulnerable
    (Figure 3.1).

142. The rest of the chapter is structured following the assets approach. Regarding labor income,
    the initial focus is on the accumulation of human capital, and the analysis suggests that Poland will
    need greater efforts to ensure equality of opportunity in education and health. The analysis on the
    intensity of use is focused on the need to increase labor force participation, particularly for women.
    To improve the returns to labor, the focus is on minimizing labor market segmentation and
    improving mobility. Finally, the focus on nonlabor income highlights the extent to which taxes and
    social assistance offset or reinforce the pattern generated through markets. The last section
    summarizes the priorities, policy implications, and recommendations presented in this chapter.


Meeting the Human Capital Challenge to Increase Asset Accumulation

143. This section explores the opportunities individuals have to build up their human capital,
    focusing on education and health. There are normative and instrumental reasons to be concerned
    about inequality of opportunities. From a normative perspective, a basic notion of justice and equity
    would dictate that access to key goods and services should not be determined by circumstances
    outside one’s control, such as one’s gender or the education level achieved by one’s parents. A
    principle of equality of opportunity would require that an individual’s probability of accessing such
    opportunities is independent of their circumstances at birth. Most societies agree with such a
    principle, believing that opportunities should not be assigned based on gender, ethnicity, parental
    background, religion, or other circumstances beyond their control. Recent analysis for Europe finds
    that gender, age, family background, and country of origin explain about two-fifths of labor income
    inequality and points to the challenge in reducing inequality of opportunities (Brzezinski 2015;
    Checchi, Peragine, and Serlenga 2016). In the case of Poland, inequality of opportunity is higher
    than in all other eastern European countries with the exception of Romania and explains 38 percent
    of labor income inequality (Figure 3.2).
144. On the instrumental                   Figure 3.2. Inequality of Opportunity as a Factor in Total
    aspects, inequality of                         Income Inequality, EU-28 Countries, 2011

    workers. However, the race between skills and technology continues. To face this challenge,
    concerted efforts to provide high–quality, relevant education and training throughout the life cycle
    will be needed. Similarly, despite tremendous progress, access to high-quality health care still
    depends on individual circumstances such as socioeconomic status and location. Poland will need to
    improve access through greater and more effective allocation of resources if it hopes to meet the
    needs of a growing elderly population with low skills and activity levels, for whom unequal access
    to quality services could turn into powerful forces that could increase income inequality.


Needed Efforts to Ensure Equal Opportunities in Education

145. Despite enormous strides toward improving access to high-quality education in Poland,
    challenges remain. Skill formation is cumulative and shaped along the life course. Therefore, it is
    important to strive for skill formation beginning with the earliest years all the way through mature
    adulthood. As detailed below, the results of the analysis show that socioeconomic background still
    matters in primary and secondary education, as measured by school performance among 15-year-
    olds, with differences in learning outcomes between children of low and high socioeconomic
    background equivalent to three years of schooling. There are also important regional differences,
    with learning outcomes in rural areas falling behind urban areas by the equivalent of one year of
    schooling. Similarly, there are equity concerns related to the underrepresentation of certain groups in
    higher education and in terms of access to training for older adults.

146. The race between skills and technology continues. Globalization and structural changes could
    lead to important changes in the demand for skills. Moreover, to the extent that technological change
    drives the demand for skills, the skills divide could increase. The evidence for Poland suggests that
    educational systems need to foster development of skills required to perform nonroutine tasks,
    particularly because young, unskilled workers who enter more routine-intensive occupations face a
    relatively high unemployment risk (Hardy, Keister, and Lewandowski 2016). Older workers have so
    far been less affected by occupational changes than younger workers. However, given the high
    concentration of older workers in routine jobs, they may be disproportionately affected if the shift
    away from routine work intensifies in the future, which calls for the need for lifelong and on-the-job
    training (Lewandowski et al. 2017).

The “Skills Divide” among Different Population Groups

147. Beginning at the earliest stages in life, access to early childhood education is low and
    unequal. The potential benefits from supporting early childhood development have been
    documented extensively, ranging from healthy development to greater capacity to learn while in
    school and increased productivity in adulthood. For instance, a 30-year follow-up study of children
    in the United States showed that high-quality birth-to-five programs for disadvantaged children can
    deliver a 13 percent per year return on investment (Garcia et al. 2016; Heckman, Pinto, and Savelyev
    2013). From an education perspective, early gaps in cognitive, linguistic, and socioemotional skills
    jeopardize a child’s capacity and motivation to learn upon entering primary school. The availability
    of preschool education facilities in Poland is quite varied across regions, with some counties
    (powiats) covering less than 60 percent of children ages 3–5 years, while others covering 100 percent
    of children (Map 3.1). Access to childcare is also generally low in Poland, which is discussed in
    more detail later in this chapter. The government of Poland is emphasizing early childhood

    financial constraints on formal and informal
    ECD investments. The first opinion polls show
    that these new resources are being spent on
    children’s extracurricular activities, travelling
    with parents, or educational materials—all of
    which support the educational development of
    children. However, the effect on inequality is
    hard to predict. It would be important to verify
    whether children from all socioeconomic
    backgrounds receive increased (formal or
    informal) early childhood education, and to
    potentially implement programs that would
    support some groups of parents in this role.

    improved significantly over the past 15

        average and remained high in the country rankings, but the deterioration of its relative position was
        substantial. Compared with 25 other European Union (EU) countries that participated in both PISA
        2012 and 2015 waves, Poland’s ranking fell from 4th to 8th in math, from 3rd to 5th in reading, and
        from 3rd to 10th in science.27

 150. The recent results continue to show that socioeconomic background and location still
     matter for performance in primary and secondary education. Despite improvements in
     educational equity in Poland over the 2000–15 period, the differences between students with low and
     high socioeconomic backgrounds are still equivalent to three years of schooling. According to PISA
     2015, the difference between top and bottom Index of Economic, Social, and Cultural Status (ESCS)
     quantiles in Poland were equal to 87 points in math, 90 points in reading, and 95 points in science,
     with around 30 points being equivalent to one year of schooling. Although the differences in scores
     between students with different backgrounds are large in Poland, similar or even larger differences
     are observed in other EU countries. Overall, Poland’s school system at the lower-secondary level is
     less stratified than in other EU countries by socioeconomic background, and relatively little of the
     variation in overall performance can be explained by the variation in performance between schools.
     However, the differences between rural and urban students are relatively large from a cross-country
     perspective. In comparison with the rest of the EU in 2015, urban-rural differences in math, reading,
     and science were larger only in Lithuania, the Slovak Republic, Hungary, and Bulgaria (Figure 3.4).
     Moreover, since PISA captures the performance of students during their last year of comprehensive
     lower secondary school, the survey does not capture potential performance gaps between students in
     vocational and general education schools. However, PISA assessments for older students in upper-
     secondary education in 2006, 2009, and 2012 found that performance gaps existed between students
     in vocational and general schools, with those in vocational schools trailing their peers in general
     education (World Bank 2015c). Developing a policy response to the performance difference of
     upper-secondary schools of different types would ideally be based on in-depth analysis of, among
     other things, the drivers of student selection into different schools as well as those aspects of
     education in vocational schools that impede the acquisition of the skills measured by PISA. Poland
     also exhibits important differences in learning outcomes across regions (Figure 3.5).




27
     Note that the 2015 PISA was entirely performed on computers for the first time; thus comparisons to earlier waves
     should be treated with caution. Multiple European countries faced deterioration of results relative to 2012 (IBE
     2015).

  151. Moreover, planned reforms to the education system may reverse previous efforts to
      improve performance. Poland pursued a comprehensive series of education reforms since the early
      1990s, including the introduction of standardized examinations, curriculum reform, decentralization,
      and investment in teachers’ professional development. Most fundamental perhaps was the
      introduction of the comprehensive lower-secondary gymnasium, which delayed selection between
      the general and vocational tracks and effectively added one year of exposure to the general
      curriculum for students entering vocational school. This change has been rigorously evaluated and
      shown to have had a significant positive effect on student performance, with students from poor and
      well-off socioeconomic backgrounds (who disproportionately tend to go into vocational training)
      having performance improvements (World Bank 2015c). This is important, because an unusually
      high share of youth who are not in employment, education, or training (NEET) have vocational
      training compared with the EU, potentially pointing to weaknesses in vocational training programs
      in Poland.28 However, the reform separating lower-secondary gymnasiums from primary schools is
      to be reversed beginning September 2017. An important implication of the reform will be that
      students will spend one year less in comprehensive schools, and one year more in either vocational
      or general education. Since the delay in student tracking has earlier been shown to have promoted
      equity in performance, it is unclear what the impact will be of the announced reforms on equity. In
      addition, the reforms pose multiple challenges for schools and local governments, because the




28
         For instance, in 2016, 16.8 percent of Polish youth ages 20 –24 years were NEET, and more than half of them (53
         percent) had previously attained vocational education. In the EU-28 on average, the NEET rate among youth ages
         20–24 years was similar to the rate in Poland (16.7 percent), but only 35 percent of them had previously attained
         vocational education (Eurostat data). The NEET rates among youth with previously completed vocational
         education are overall much higher than among those with general education.

        infrastructure, curricula, and teachers’ working places must be adjusted within a very limited time.29
        Similarly, previous reforms had changed the school entrance age from 7 years to 6 years to allow for
        a more homogeneous preschool education, but this change was reversed in 2016.30 Although several
        opinion surveys found strong support for the change in the school structure, the reforms had limited
        social consultations, and teacher and local government organizations have officially opposed the
        plan to abolish gymnasiums.31

     underrepresentation of certain groups
     in higher education. Higher-education
     attainment among those ages 25–34 years
     is 45 percent in Poland, slightly higher
     than the OECD average of 42 percent
     (OECD 2016b). Nevertheless, parents’
     educational background still has a strong
     influence        on        higher-education
     participation: 81 percent of those ages 25–
     34 years who had parents with higher
     education also attained higher education,
     while only 16 percent of those with
     parents with education below the upper-
     secondary level did so (OECD 2016b).
     Moreover, to the extent that individuals
     from lower socioeconomic backgrounds
     had a disadvantage in quality primary and
     secondary education, they had more
     difficulty in competing for acceptance in Source: Sivaev 2017, based on Central Statistical Office

     fee-paying institutions, even while
     handling the related costs is a particularly severe challenge for this group. Thus, there is still a “skills
     divide” across socioeconomic groups, and to some extent, this is also reflected by the wide variation
     in tertiary education across regions (Map 3.2).

29
     In particular, during the next two years, two cohorts will still be in gymnasium (and provision of classes must be
     ensured there), while the next two cohorts will be first to stay for the seventh and eighth grades in primary schools,
     which are in many cases too small to accommodate them.

      There is one year of obligatory preschool education in Poland so that after increasing the school entrance age from
     6 years to 7 years, preschool will no longer be obligatory for 5-year-olds but only for 6-year-olds. However, efforts
     to improve preschool access for younger children started in 2013, and those efforts have continued. Since
     September 2015, every child at the age of 4 has a right to a place in the kindergarten, and children at the age of 3
     will have such right beginning in September 2017.

      A general teacher’s strike took place March 31, 2017. Moreover, almost 1 million people signed a proposal for a
     referendum on the educational reform.

153. Despite a decrease in returns to higher education in recent years, higher education still
    leads to sizable benefits for individuals. Among these benefits is a reduced risk of unemployment.
    For those ages 25–64 years in 2015, unemployment of higher-education graduates was 3.5 percent,
    compared with 7.2 percent for individuals with upper-secondary education and postsecondary
    nontertiary education, and 15.5 percent for individuals with education below the upper-secondary
    level (according to Eurostat data). Higher-education graduates also enjoy significant earning
    premiums. Comparing the earnings of the full-time employed in the 25- to 64-year age group—using
    the earnings of individuals with upper-secondary education as a reference value of 100—individuals
    with less than upper-secondary education reached a value of 84, whereas the value for higher-
    education graduates was 162 (OECD 2016b). This premium is higher than the OECD average (155)
    for higher-education graduates. That the positive outcomes of higher education can still be observed
    implies that an inflation of higher education credentials cannot be diagnosed for Poland (Arnhold
    and Püttmann 2017).

154. In terms of gender inclusion, there are important differences in fields of study across
    genders. The share of female graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
    (STEM) fields is only 36 percent in the case of engineering and manufacturing, and 46 percent in the
    case of science, math, and computing (Figure 3.6), and although gender segregation among the fields
    of study is less pronounced in Poland than the EU-average, including in the STEM fields, there is
    gender segregation of employment across sectors. This is problematic to the extent that job
    opportunities and wages associated with those fields are greater. Women dominate in “health and
    social work” and education,” which are “typically female” sectors (Figure 3.7), with more than 70
    percent of tertiary graduates in the fields of education, teacher training, humanities, arts, and health
    being women. In contrast, the representation of women in the traditionally male-dominated sectors
    of construction, transportation, and manufacturing is low, though in line with the EU average. In
    addition to the differences in skills, there is a 20 percent gender wage gap in Poland, which cannot
    be explained by different characteristics and occupations of men and women (Posadas and Hallward-
    Driemeier 2017).

Adjusting Education and Training to Changing Skill Demand

155. Increased demand for skills driven by technological change could aggravate the skills
    divide, affecting not only the intensity of use of existing human capital assets, but also the
    returns to these assets. Technology-induced job deroutinization is happening across advanced
    countries, resulting in an increased share of abstract-task-intensive jobs requiring high levels of
    cognitive and interpersonal skills. There is a growing literature on the polarization of jobs and the
    hollowing-out of middle-skilled, routine employment (Autor, Levy, and Murnane 2003; Goos,
    Manning, and Salomons 2014; Michaels, Natraj, and Van Reenen 2014). For instance, Arntz,
    Gregory, and Zierahn (2016) find that workers with less than upper-secondary education will bear
    most of the cost of displacement from automatization (around 9 percent of jobs, on average, for
    OECD countries). This long-term trend is being partially offset by strong wage-compressing labor
    policies in the EU (see Broecke et al. 2016 for a comparison with the United States) and the credit
    bubble during the 2000s (which artificially inflated some low-skill sectors like construction in some
    EU countries).

    156. Poland will need to confront this challenge, because jobs in Poland increasingly require
        cognitive tasks. Although this trend has not yet affected Poland, there has been an increase in the
        intensity of cognitive tasks—both those considered routine, thus often done by low-skilled workers,
        and those that are nonroutine, reflecting a shift in the employment structure between occupations
        (Hardy, Keister, and Lewandowski 2016). At the same time, the intensity of all manual tasks
        declined, particularly manual routine tasks. Younger cohorts are experiencing this change more
        strongly than older cohorts: cohorts born after 1970 contributed most to the overall change in the
        task content of jobs, while almost no adjustments occurred in cohorts born before 1970.
        Consequently, younger generations may be increasingly likely to work in computerized jobs, while
        workers born between 1950 and 1969 have experienced barely any change in their jobs since the
        middle of the 1990s. However, for those without advanced skills, things have gotten tougher, with
        unemployment among youth who previously performed routine tasks being more likely and the risk
        of unemployment in these tasks growing over time, not only in Poland but across countries in the EU
        (Lewandowski et al. 2017).

    157. Socioemotional and cognitive skills are lacking in the workforce. An investigation of human
        capital in Poland revealed that, in contrast to vocational or technical skills, general competencies are



                                                                                                                                                                                         100
                 the major concern for employers (Górniak 2015). These competencies include social and
                 communication, analytical, self-organization, and entrepreneurial skills; attitudes toward the self and
                 work; and the ability to learn. A comparison of competencies sought after by employers with the
                 related self-assessments of job seekers confirmed this picture. Discrepancies were greatest for self-
                 organization and interpersonal skills (Czarnik and Kocór 2015). Deficits of this type are a particular
                 concern for companies in the more innovative and faster-developing sectors of the economy
                 (Arnhold and Püttmann 2017).

      158. Moreover, increased innovation will depend on creativity and problem-solving skills, where
          there is substantial scope for improvement. While it is hard to relate the specific PISA scores with
          innovativeness, relatively low scores of Polish youth in problem solving indicate the need for greater
          focus. A special 2012 assessment of problem-solving skills shed light on both Poland’s relatively
          low scores on problem solving and the striking differences in Poland between scores in numeracy,
          literacy, and science and those obtained for problem solving (Figure 3.8). This emphasizes the point
          that, based on the changing nature of the task content of jobs, educational systems will need to adapt
          to foster the development of the skills required to perform nonroutine tasks (Lewandowski et al.
          2017).

          knowledge-based economy, higher levels of formal education are required in Poland. The
          groups of occupations where employers faced the largest recruitment difficulties during 2010–14
          were professionals, skilled workers, and operators, whereas the opposite was true for elementary
          workers (Czarnik and Kocór 2015). These findings point toward labor market supply shortages being
          particularly prevalent among higher-skilled individuals (Górniak 2015).

     adopt new skills. Older workers have so far been less affected than younger workers by
     occupational changes but may be disproportionately affected if the shift away from routine work
     intensifies in the future (Lewandowski et al. 2017). Although Poland is one of the countries with the
     highest PISA scores for youth, the level of cognitive skills among adults remains an important issue.
     In fact, Poland started its fast improvement of youth’s skills only recently—the PISA 2000 results
     implied that Poland was below the OECD average. This is reflected in the International Assessment
     of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) results, which tests literacy, numeracy, and proficiency in problem
     solving among those ages 16–65 years, where Poland ranks below the OECD average (Figure 3.9).
     As a result, there is a significant gap between the skills of the younger generation (ages 16–49 years)
     and that of older workers (ages 50–64 years). Indeed, Poland is an exceptional case, with one of the
     highest literacy and numeracy scores in PISA but relatively low performance in PIAAC. The Polish
     labor force consists mainly of cohorts currently ages 25–65 years. Those ages 25–30 years
     participated in PISA waves 2000–06, when Poland’s PISA scores were rather low (in 2000) or
     medium (in 2003–06). Those ages 30–65 years did not participate in PISA, but according to PIAAC,
     their skills are low relative to international standards. This applies in particular to those ages 40–65
     years. This highlights the fact that intergenerational differences in skills are more profound in Poland
       than in other EU countries,                  Figure 3.9. Percentage of Low-Performing Adults in Basic

      The ELLI index shows the conditions for lifelong learning across different learning environments (taken from the

163. The evidence suggests that reducing the existing skills divide and improving the quality and
    relevance of education provision and adult learning possibilities are priorities to enhance
    inclusion and increase productivity. Reducing differences in school performance across
    socioeconomic backgrounds, regions, and gender would improve equality of opportunity. Moreover,
    there is a need for the educational systems to adapt, fostering skills required to perform nonroutine
    tasks as well as socioemotional and higher-order cognitive skills. Given demographic changes, the
    high concentration of older workers in routine jobs and the overall growing importance of
    continuous skill acquisition among individuals in an innovating economy, shared prosperity will also
    depend on making lifelong and on-the-job training more accessible and relevant through a
    comprehensive, viable lifelong learning system that reaches all groups of potential learners and
    orients itself toward the skill demands of its various clienteles and the private sector.

164. Implementing quality education throughout the life cycle will require concerted efforts by
    education and training providers, the private sector, and the government. While various public
    and private actors are engaged in these efforts, higher education institutions can be envisaged to play
    a particularly important role in these efforts. For instance, reforms in higher education governance,
    quality assurance, and financing during 2009–12 have introduced a new steering model based on the
    autonomy of higher education institutions, complemented by an increased accountability toward the
    state. Those reforms are likely to be pursued further with a new wave of probably even more
    comprehensive reforms that are currently under discussion. To address the critical state of adult
    education in Poland, higher education institutions in particular can be envisaged playing a stronger
    role in collaborating with the private sector and the government to ensure increased access to
    demand-responsive training (Arnhold and Püttmann 2017). Higher education institutions appear well
    placed to (a) increase the relevance and quality of their training offerings by devising programs and
    courses in line with skill demand; and (b) expand access to a more diverse student population by
    offering various modes of delivery (for example, including e-learning possibilities) and adapting
    support services to the needs and living conditions of learners. Strong engagement from the private
    sector is required to ensure that programs are aligned with employers’ skill demand. This
    engagement includes private sector involvement in designing and implementing training programs,
    as well as activating groups of learners currently underrepresented in adult education. Such
    initiatives could be particularly relevant for companies from the more innovative and faster-
    developing sectors of the economy, for which skill shortages are a particular concern, including for
    larger firms that benefit from international (technological) exposure through substantial foreign
    direct investments. Public sector facilitation of such processes will be required; in particular, in the
    current discussions on higher education sector reforms, sufficient importance would need to be
    attached to promoting lifelong learning. This public sector leadership could establish framework
    conditions that promote the higher education institutions’ engagement in adult education and
    cooperation among key stakeholders, as well as providing targeted support to higher education
    institutions. Public sector leadership will also include advancing the legislative framework and
    designing key components of the higher education sector accordingly—namely, quality assurance
    approaches including accreditation, academic promotion systems, and funding schemes.

High-Quality Health Care Service Delivery: A Challenge to Shared Prosperity

165. As in the case of education, access to high-quality health services is an important
    determinant of equality of opportunity and also affects productivity. Poland has made major
    progress in health system outcomes such as on quality of care, equity, and financial protection since
    1990. However, there is significant room for improvement, especially as health system reform
    becomes more pressing with an aging population. The 2016 Life in Transition Survey (LiTS) found
    that 43 percent of Polish individuals cite health as the most important problem, a share almost three
    times higher than the average of European and Central Asian countries included in LiTS.

166. Poland is still plagued by mortality and morbidity rates above the EU average and by large
    inequalities in life expectancy. In 2014, average life expectancy from birth was 73.8 years for men
    and 81.6 years for women (NIPH-NIH 2016), lower than the average among all EU countries (78.1
    years for men and 83.6 years for women) despite significant improvements since 1991. Despite a
    steady decrease in smoking prevalence, a quarter of the population still smokes in Poland. High male
    mortality is associated with prevalence of risk factors such as smoking and alcohol-related causes
    (followed by road traffic injuries) as well as late disease-screening practices (Muszyńska 2011). The
    prevalence of overweight (36.4 percent) is above the OECD average (34.6 percent) (OECD 2014a)
    and is increasing, being partly responsible for the high mortality rates in non-communicable
    diseases.

167. Moreover, disproportions in                          Figure 3.13 Self-Perceived Health in Population

     orthopedic) per 1,000
     population varying from 9.1 to 30 across Polish regions in 2014 (PwC 2015). Similarly, wait time
     for cataract surgery could be up to two years, with over 500,000 patients waiting with significant
     regional differences (Figure 3.14): in eight regions, the average waiting time exceeds two years
     except in one region, where it remained below one year (Oct/Nov 2016 WHC Barometer, Watch
     Health Care Foundation).33 The Polish health care system could be one of the least accessible
     systems among the EU-28 countries. In terms of “unmet need,” only Latvia has a lower score than
     Poland. On average, while only 6 percent of EU citizens reported having been unable to access
     medical care, the proportion was 13 percent in Poland (OECD 2012).

 169. Given the deficiencies in service delivery, the responsiveness of the health care system is
     considered weak by Polish citizens. Several surveys (the European Commission’s Eurobarometer,
     LiTS 2016, and Puchta [2014]) point to increasing dissatisfaction with health care service delivery,
     particularly when it comes to long waiting times (Figure 3.15). Poland has the longest waiting lists in
     Europe when considering any of the three usual indicators for waiting lists (access to cataract
     surgery, knee replacement, and hip replacement) (OECD 2016d). Despite recent (2014–15)
     corrective policy actions, several waiting lists are growing, reflecting the key problems faced by the
     Polish health care system. As detailed below, the reasons for deficiencies in health care delivery
     include low and inefficient health spending, insufficient human resources, poor coordination, and
     fragmentation of responsibilities and accountability.

33
     To shorten the waiting time, patients who can afford it migrate between regions, pay for surgery in the private
     sector, or go abroad for treatment, with costs subsequently reimbursed by the National Health Fund (NFZ) (as
     envisaged in EU Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients’ rights in cross -border health care). Cataract
     surgery was the treatment most often claimed for cost reimbursement (64 percent out of 4,872 of claims in 2015).
     The countries most often visited for cataract surgery are the Czech Republic and Germany (Oct/Nov 2016 WHC
     Barometer, Watch Health Care Foundation, http://www.korektorzdrowia.pl/en/).

     are reimbursable, in part, because public health spending is low. Since the 1990s, total health care
     spending has increased sixfold, but it remains one of the lowest in the EU as a share of gross
     domestic product (GDP) or spending per capita (Figure 3.16). A ranking of primary health care

    care needs among the regional

    regions. Compounding the problem
    are technical inefficiencies, as exemplified by the low utilization of computerized tomography (CT)
    scans. Similarly, hospital efficiency remains weak. For instance, admissions for asthma and



                                                   108
        uncontrolled diabetes, both of which are “avoidable hospitalizations,” are increasing and are
        significantly above EU averages. Similarly, relative to other EU countries, the number of hospital
        beds is still one of the highest in the EU. More worryingly, the share of inpatient care within total
        health expenditures has continued to increase over the years, climbing from 27 percent in 2004 to 36
        percent in 2012 (OECD 2014a). In practice, the main health risk pooling mechanism (the NFZ)
        offers reduced financial coverage of key health services and goods.

 173. Although pressure for efficiency and quality is in place in individual hospitals, it is still
     lacking at higher levels (voivodeships, NFZ, and ministry). Experience from other countries
     clearly shows that a more holistic (regional or national) approach is needed to achieve high
     efficiency and quality of care. Maps of national and regional health care needs for hospital care, 30
     disease groups, cardiovascular diseases, and malignant tumors have been produced to identify risk
     groups, improve preventive measures, and investment planning. In addition, a new health care
     proposal evaluation instrument was introduced in 2016. However, greater coordination and
     continued strategic planning at the regional and national levels is needed, which requires (a)
     strengthened strategic management capacities (at the voivodeship, Ministry of Health [MoH], and
     NFZ levels); (b) adequate tools and mechanisms; and (c) relevant planning and benchmarking data.

 174. In addition to financial resources, human resources are insufficient in Poland’s care system.
     Within the EU, Poland reports the lowest number of physicians as measured by the ratio of
     physicians per 1,000 people. The country reported 2.3 physicians per 1,000 people, compared with
     an EU-28 average of 3.5 per 1,000 people in 2014 (OECD 2016d). This trend continues through
     general medical professionals. A similar problem exists in the number of nurses, recorded at 5.2 per
     1,000 compared with the EU-28 average of 8.4 per 1,000 (OECD 2016d).

 175. Poland’s health system challenges could be explained, to some extent, by poor coordination.
     Poor coordination includes misalignments between accountability lines, funding flows, and
     management capacities, as well as limited coordination across settings in clinical care. A first
     component in the continuum of care that suffers from poor coordination is the ambulatory specialist
     care subsector. 34 The primary care subsector should be a strong player, given its “gatekeeping”
     function. But this function is severely hampered by too few general practitioners (GPs) (OECD
     2012) and the fact that GPs are paid only through capitation (regardless of the quality of provided
     services), which incentivizes them to refer most of their cases, even simple ones that could be taken
     care of at the primary health care level.

 176. Moreover, overall health system stewardship is hampered by the fragmentation of
     responsibilities and accountability within the system. The problem lies in the diversity of
     institutions to which providers are accountable (MoH, NFZ, voivodeships, powiats [counties], and
     gminas [municipalities]). Since 1999, self-governments (voivodeships, powiats, and gminas) operate
     their own facilities but have very limited direct control over the resources required to finance the
     facilities, as funding is provided by NFZ. Purchasing practices by NFZ remain focused on short-term
     perspectives, without much strategic planning (or output-based financing, which influences the
     quality of care). The regulatory role of the MoH is not clearly defined (Pieprzyk 2013), and no
     institution controls (through regulation, planning, and funding) either the entire health delivery
34
      “Continuum of care” refers to the whole range of health care services, from primary health care to acute and long-
     term care.

        system or the quality of care delivered across sectors. According to an OECD study (Joumard et al.
        2010), Poland has suffered from one of the least consistent allocations of responsibilities (regarding
        health care) across levels of government.35 This fragmentation has major implications for the
        delivery of health services.

 177. Poland needs to do more to boost health outcomes to prepare for the aging of its population.
     A World Bank study of the financial impact of aging on Poland’s total health expenditures estimated
     that these expenditures could triple by 2050 (Golinowska, Kocot, and Sowa 2014). Poland already
     faces higher mortality and morbidity rates than its peers, low affordability due to expensive drugs,
     and equity concerns to the extent that access to care still depends on individual circumstances. Long
     waiting times result from poor coordination, fragmentation, and low and inefficient spending.
     Clearly, adequate policies and investments are needed for promoting improved health outcomes
     while containing costs. That effort includes broad-based initiatives of capacity building for
     physicians, nurses, and medical personnel but also for health system managers. Strengthening
     prevention and health promotion and aligning those objectives strongly to the general health system
     performance would bring additional benefits to society.


Fostering Higher Labor Participation and Reducing Exclusion to Increase
Intensity of Use

 178. Improvements in education and health will be insufficient to ensure shared prosperity if
     people do not participate in the labor market. Using the assets-based framework proposed by
     Bussolo and López-Calva (2014), individual income growth depends not only on human capital
     endowments but also on the intensity of use of those assets. In the case of Poland, the most critical
     constraint to using its assets intensively is the fact that a large share of its labor force does not
     participate in the labor market. To remedy this situation will require ensuring that people are not
     unwillingly excluded from the labor market, but more importantly it will require that cross-sectoral
     policies are well coordinated to provide strong incentives to work.


Coordinated Policies for Increased Labor Force Participation

 179. Sustained economic growth has led to a strong labor market, but low labor force
     participation limits employment. Labor market conditions continue to improve as employment
     increases; unemployment reached record low levels (5.6 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2016. Still,
     employment rates in Poland continue to be lower than EU-28 averages for the youngest (ages 20–24
     years) and oldest workers (ages 50 years and older). This is particularly the case among young and
     older women, whose gap in employment with EU-28 averages is around 10 percentage points.

 180. Illness and disability drive inactivity among men. For men not in education, inactivity is
     driven by illness or disability (28 percent) more than in the rest of the EU-28 (19 percent). The

35
      Consistency in allocation of responsibilities will be low when several levels of government are involved in key
     health care decisions (such as major investments) or when this diversity of decision makers generates inadequate
     incentives (for instance, when one entity is funding hospital operations, while another one is funding hospital
     maintenance).




                                                           110
        importance of illness and disability among men relates both to higher accessibility of disability
        pensions (particularly in the past) and to less effective policies than in other EU countries that can
        enable those with poor health to participate in the labor force. Moreover, as discussed in detail in
        Chapter 4, given the difference in the benefit formula between disability pensions and old-age
        pensions, it is now expected that with the recent rollback in the retirement age, there will be an
        increasing incentive to obtain disability benefits, because the old-age benefits will be lower than
        disability benefits.

 181. For women, inactivity is driven by early retirement; lack of care services for children and
     sick or elderly dependents; and legal, regulatory, and social constraints. Female labor force
     participation (62 percent) is significantly lower than male participation (75.7 percent) despite higher
     tertiary education rates among women than men in Poland.36 Three reasons for this low rate of labor
     force participation follow:
          Retirement. Twenty-two percent of inactive women are retired, compared with 14 percent in the
           EU-28 (Figure 3.19). The gender gap in retirement age stands in contrast to a much higher life
           expectancy for women. Inactivity among older Polish women (and men) is likely to be amplified
           by the recent reversal of the reform that increased retirement age for both women and men to 67
           years of age.

           28 countries, while
           it is gaining importance in Poland, which is potentially related to the growing number of elderly
           who require care. Moreover, mothers work fewer hours and get lower wages, whereas fathers
           work longer hours and receive higher pay. In fact, mothers receive lower earnings than childless
           women, even after controlling for unobserved factors and adjustments in working hours
           (Cukrowska-Torzewska 2015).

          Legal, regulatory, and social constraints. On the regulatory side, Poland still restricts women’s
           access to some occupations deemed hazardous or not adequate for women.37 In terms of social
           constraints, barriers to entering the labor market reported by women during recent qualitative
           research included the perception of discrimination of employers against mothers, the cost and
           lack of access to transportation to better-paying jobs, and rigid gender norms that confine women
           to household and childcare activities (World Bank 2015f).

 182. Mothers or grandmothers are almost exclusively the providers of care in Poland. The
     coverage of children with institutionalized care in Poland is well below the EU-28 average. Only 4.2
     percent of children under 3 years of age attended 30 hours or more of formal childcare in 2015,
     compared with an EU average of 15.7 percent (Eurostat). Moreover, only 1.1 percent of children
     ages 0–3 years were in part-time care (less than 30 hours) compared with the 14.8 percent average in
     the EU (Eurostat data). Women who seek reemployment after childbirth have very limited
     opportunities to find formal childcare for young children, particularly in some regions of the country
     (Figure 3.20).

        program has stayed constant for 2017.38 There are waitlists in three out of four nurseries, and 30
        percent of parents often wait more than a year (Pieńkosz and Matejczuk 2015).

 184. In addition to limited supply          Map 3.3. Share of Children Ages 0–2 Years Attending Care
     of childcare facilities, there is                    Facilities in Poland, by Poviat, 2015
     also low trust and low demand
     for institutionalized child care.
     A survey conducted in six
     powiats shows that even in the
     powiats with very little supply,
     the demand was largely satisfied
     (Pieńkosz and Matejczuk 2015).
     This can be traced back to
     multigenerational households,
     where child care needs are often
     met within the family.
     Nonetheless, these results vary
     strongly in big cities, where
     extended families do not cohabit
     or even live in the vicinity. In
     some big cities, institutionalized
     care demand reaches up to 90
     percent (Pieńkosz and Matejczuk
     2015), as shown in Map 3.3.
     Despite an unsatisfied demand
     for child care, families prefer
     other forms of care before
     choosing institutional care. The
     main reasons against                  Source: ©World Bank, based on Central Statistical Office (GUS)

     institutionalized childcare were
     general mistrust, a perceived lack of competences of the personnel, and a traditional view that
     childcare should be provided by the mother or a family member. In addition, researchers pointed out
     that the unpaid “extended upbringing leave,” which secures a job held before childbirth, may also
     lower the demand for institutional care arrangements for children ages 0–3 years.

 185. Similarly, access to long-term care facilities remains low, and there is strong preference to
     provide LTC within families. Only 1 percent of people ages 65 years and older receive formal
     institutional care in Poland (OECD 2013). Within the OECD countries, Poland has the lowest LTC
     coverage (Figure 3.21, panel a). Moreover, the support provided is mostly for the sick, with little to
     no funding to create support systems for families and communities. Families are estimated to
     provide 80 percent of LTC at home (Golinowska, Kocot, and Sowa 2014). In fact, there is a strong
     perception that support to the elderly should be provided within the family—and to higher extent by
     daughters than sons (Figure 3.21, panel b).

 186. Childcare has also had a negative impact on labor force participation in the 50+ age group,
     particularly among women. After retirement, providing care to family members is the second
     most-cited reason for inactive women in Poland (Eurostat, data for 2016). Women ages 50 years and
     older in Poland are less often employed then men, and more often provide regular or occasional care
     to grandchildren, another person in the household, or both (Survey of Health, Ageing, and
     Retirement in Europe [SHARE], wave 4 data). Indeed, most women ages 50–59 years who have at
     least one grandchild up to the age of 16 provide regular care. Among grandmothers ages 60–69
     years, more than 60 percent are providing care, and 95 percent are not employed. As in many
     countries with an aging population and inadequate LTC, hospitals end up providing LTC as well,
     which is both inefficient and expensive. Although the number of nurses in LTC institutions has
     almost doubled since 2004 alongside a strong increase among doctors, physiotherapists,
     psychologists, social/medical workers, and auxiliary personnel, these trends are still moderate.39

 187. Improving the quality and availability of care has the potential to boost labor market
     participation of women and fertility in Poland. Strengthening the supply of quality care
     services—both for children and the elderly—can relax constraints on entering employment for
     women. In addition, the availability of quality care has been linked to higher fertility rates, which
     could partly offset the ongoing demographic changes. For example, Nordic countries have directed
     their family policies to supporting working parents of small children through expansion of childcare
     facilities and reliance on short but generously paid parental leave, including quotas to encourage

    since the mid-1980s (Ronsen 2004). Similarly, in richer East Asian countries, the emerging practice
    is to have bundled packages of measures that aim to stimulate female labor force participation,
    especially after childbirth (World Bank 2015b).

    with tertiary education. Individuals with
    no more than a lower-secondary
    education degree represented 53.6
    percent of total unemployed in 2016           Source: Eurostat Labor Force Survey (LFS) data.
    (GUS 2016b).

189. Youth unemployment is moderate by EU standards, but there is scope to increase youth
    activity. The crisis has particularly affected youth, with unemployment increasing by 10 percentage
    points from 2008 (17.3 percent) to 2013 (27.3 percent) for those of ages 15–24 years. Since 2013,
    however, youth unemployment has decreased to 17.7 percent, for the first time placing Poland below
    the EU-28 average. Nonetheless, labor force participation rates for both male (39.8 percent) and
    female (28.9 percent) youth remain below the EU average of 44 percent for males and 38.9 percent
    for females. Although this disparity stems from a higher share of Polish youth in tertiary schooling,
    there is scope to increase youth part-time employment that can be combined with education, and to
    activate those who are excluded: every 10th person ages 15–24 years in Poland is in the NEET
    category (Eurostat 2016 data).

190. Cluster analysis to profile the most disadvantaged groups in the labor market in Poland
    suggests that geography and gender are critical dimensions of labor market exclusion. The
    population that is either persistently out of work or with weak labor attachment (in unstable jobs,
    with involuntary part-time work or zero income) represents 39 percent of the working-age
    population. About half of these are inactive women with no recent work experience and often with
    care responsibilities. Middle-aged and young men in precarious jobs and with low work experience
    (Figure 3.23) constituting another 16 percent of those facing labor market exclusion. Geography also
    plays a role, with rural women making up 7 percent of the vulnerable. People with disabilities and
    those with high social benefits are also excluded from the labor market.

 191. Care responsibilities, health, and geography emerge as the main characteristics of labor
     market exclusion compared with other countries. In Poland, the population excluded from the
     labor market includes relatively high shares of individuals with care responsibilities (15 percent) and
     with health limitations (30 percent). Low education and experience is less of a constraint than in
     other countries (19 percent). However, more than 50 percent of vulnerable individuals across the
     seven groups shown in figure 3.23 live in rural areas, which is disproportionally higher than the
     average workforce. This means that relative to other countries, labor market exclusion in Poland
     depends on broader intersectoral issues such as activation of the disabled, disincentives to work from
     benefits and pensions, care services, mobility, and employment creation (or lack thereof) in rural
     settings.

 192. Extended outreach and employment promotion is necessary to reach inactive women and
     youth who live in remote and rural areas. Making information and counseling available to those
     who are inactive and far from labor markets is a necessary first step, as these individuals are not
     fully engaged in the labor market because of multiple and overlapping constraints. This step will
     ensure that individuals who are “inactive” register with the employment offices and also that those
     who are actively looking for a job receive support. The extension in outreach and job assistance
     cannot be achieved through employment offices alone; rather, it will require multiple channels
     including social welfare offices and mobile units that set up periodically at community centers or
     alternative locations. Both employment offices and social welfare offices have recognized capacity
     constraints.40 Therefore, they will need to be reinforced with additional staff, increased online
     services, or both to be able to handle an increased volume of beneficiaries.


40
      The administrative budget per unemployed person is low by EU standards, leading to difficulty in managing
     customer flow. Moreover, as many as 31 percent of those registered are not active job seekers. A partial
     explanation for this is the requirement to register at the labor office to access several benefits —above all, health
     insurance. Such a workload takes away resources from those who are genuinely motivated to find a job.




                                                               116
193. Formalizing and operationalizing coordination among agencies that provide services to
    vulnerable populations is critical. Addressing multiple barriers faced by the most vulnerable who
    are out of work and those with weak labor market attachment will require further investments in
    administrative systems to ensure data exchange, joint outreach, assessment of individuals’ situations,
    and delivery of a package of integrated services to improve their chances of getting and keeping a
    job. In addition, strengthening the monitoring and evaluation of active labor market programs
    (ALMPs) is essential. Redirecting the focus of labor offices from statistics indicating how many
    clients successfully found employment to measures of the net effectiveness of ALMPs—on a group
    exposed to an ALMP, compared with a group that was not exposed—can shift the incentives toward
    focusing on the “hard to serve,” that is, those with whom the public intervention has the highest
    potential. In particular, the operational programs of the 2014–20 European Structural Funds require
    evaluations of public interventions using counterfactual methods wherever possible. Similarly, it
    would be useful to improve the transparency of spending on labor market policies, because funding
    at different levels of government is available, but the overall picture of funding and how it compares
    with other benchmark countries is unknown.


Removing Labor Market Barriers to Increase the Returns to Assets

194. Improving education and health and improving labor force participation will be insufficient
    to ensure shared prosperity if people face labor market barriers that limit the returns to their
    labor. Using the assets-based framework proposed by Bussolo and López-Calva (2014), as noted
    earlier, individual income growth depends on human capital endowments, the intensity of use of
    those assets, and the returns to those endowments. To the extent that workers face labor market
    restrictions, they will not be able to maximize the returns to their human capital endowments, thus
    reducing their earnings potential. In the case of Poland, the main labor market restrictions are
    policies that have led to segmentation. In addition, there are barriers to mobility, including
    agricultural policies, access to and affordability of housing, and other regulatory restrictions.


Low Returns to Labor from Policies that Have Segmented the Labor Market

195. Civil law contracts increased labor market flexibility, but they also segmented the labor
    market, being more prevalent in poorer regions and outside big cities and usually concentrated
    among young, poorly educated, and low-skilled workers, especially women. High duality in the
    labor market has a cost for workers and society. First, temporary labor contracts could explain why
    workers have continued to accept low real wage increases relative to productivity growth.
    Econometric analysis found clear wage gaps between permanent and temporary employment even
    for workers with similar profiles (Gatti et al. 2014). Second, temporary contracts are often not a
    stepping-stone for permanent jobs (Gatti et al. 2014). Third, they do not provide adequate savings for
    old age, leading to projected increases in public pension deficits in the future (see chapter 4). Finally,
    there is some international evidence that, in the medium-term, temporary employment is detrimental
    to workers’ development because firms train them less (Gatti et al. 2014; Palczyńska 2016), as
    illustrated earlier in Figure 3.12.

196. The recent increase in labor costs of civil law contracts has some potential to reduce their
    appeal among employers, but the fundamental drivers of labor market duality remain

        unaddressed. Reducing labor market
        duality requires a multipronged strategy         Map 3.4. Share of Workers Earning Minimum Wage
        that not only increases the cost of using                      in Poland, by Region, 2015
        civil law contracts but also reduces the
        cost and complexity associated with both
        permanent and temporary labor contracts
        and strengthens worker protection during
        transitions. Since 2016, new legislation
        has been put in place to mandate minimum
        social insurance and health contributions.
        In addition, since 2017, a new hourly
        minimum wage has been put in place for
        civil law commission contracts (which are
        the most common).41 However, the labor
        code continues to be more costly and
        complex to apply in firms than the civil
        law code, and the distinction of the
        applicability between the two is neither
        sufficiently clear in the law nor enforced.
        Permanent labor contracts are perceived
        by firms to be marred by uncertainty:
        although the restrictiveness of Poland’s
        employment protection legislation appears
        to be average in international                  Source: ©World Bank, based on Central Statistical Office
        comparisons, employers claim that the           (GUS) data. Permission required for reuse.
        lengthy judicial review for “just cause” dismissal discourages the use of permanent contracts (Gatti
        et al. 2014). The current labor code codification commission is an important government initiative
        that aims to simplify the labor code and increase flexibility for firms and workers to bargain
        collectively for working conditions.

 197. Moreover, continued increases in minimum wages could lower employment and foster
     informality. Minimum wages in Poland have been growing faster than median or average wages.
     Currently, the ratio of minimum to median wages is beyond 50 percent, and the ratio to mean wage,
     beyond 40 percent. Although minimum-wage coverage for all workers reduces labor market duality,
     it could also lead to lower employment, more informality, and more frequent use of contracts for
     results. For instance, between 2007 and 2013, growing minimum wages resulted in negative effects
     on employment, in particular among temporary, young, and female workers (Kamińska and
     Lewandowski 2015). The groups most affected by declining job retention due to increases in the
     minimum wage are young (ages 18–29 years) and poorly educated workers, particularly low-skilled
     women. The effects have been stronger in poorer regions and outside big cities (Baranowska-Rataj
     and Magda 2015). In fact, civil code contracts were more often used in regions with a high
     minimum-to-median wage ratio to get around minimum-wage laws. Thus, a larger impact is to be
     expected in voivodeships such as Świętokrzyskie or Łódzkie, where 17 percent of employees receive
     the minimum wage, than in Mazowieckie, where only 10 percent of employees do (Map 3.4).
41
      The government recently abolished sub-minimum wages for the youth and introduced an hourly minimum wage
     for people on Civil Law commission contracts and for self-employed workers personally providing services.

198. At the same time, the minimum wage has limited potential to reduce poverty in Poland. A
    minimum-wage increase will benefit some of the poor, but it mostly benefits nonpoor families. This
    is because most poor adults are out of work. In addition, only half of the working poor are in wage
    employment. Moreover, low-paid workers are often secondary earners in nonpoor families, further
    pointing at only limited poverty-reducing effects of an increase in minimum wages.

199. A better balance between worker protection and labor market flexibility is needed.
    Currently, the government of Poland is working on a new labor code. Although it is not clear what
    the result will be, a reduction in administrative burdens and implicit costs associated with permanent
    labor contracts is needed to reduce firms’ incentives to prefer temporary contracts. Segmentation of
    the labor market could be reduced by making all contracts subject to the same tax and social
    contributions regime, simplifying and better communicating labor regulations, streamlining legal
    dismissal procedures, limiting the use of temporary contracts, and strengthening social protection.
    Notably, an individualized type of targeted job and social assistance program could help to include
    those who may otherwise be left out.

    since the previous year, ranking
    Poland as the fourth lowest country
    on internal migration in the EU

    important feature of the internal
    migration in Poland is that most regions are net outflow areas that supply a small number of
    destination regions. In 2015 net internal migration was positive for only five voivodeships
    (Dolnośląskie, Małopolskie, Mazowieckie, Pomorskie, and Wielkopolskie), while the remaining 12
    regions were supplying migrants. A recent opinion survey found that 53 percent of respondents
    would be willing to commute if they could get a (better) job, with 28 percent being willing to move
    to another town, and 26 percent being willing to move abroad. Among the barriers for migration, 39
    percent of respondents mentioned high costs of renting, buying, or building house or flat, while 35
    percent cited the proximity of family in their current location (CBOS 2010). Potential barriers to
    mobility include agricultural and social policies, housing, and other bottlenecks.

      201. Despite the large benefits for farming from EU accession and policies, the agricultural
          sector continues to face a number of underlying challenges; structural duality is one of the
          most prominent. Poland continues to have a high share of employment in agriculture (10.4 percent
          in 2016) compared with other EU countries (Figure 3.25), and while it decreased by 3 percentage
          points since 2008, there is still large potential for increasing productivity in that sector and
          reallocating labor to more-productive sectors, leading to higher incomes and broader inclusion (Map
          3.5). However, this process is potentially slowed down because of the incentive structure in the
          social security system available to farmers, which offers access to more generous health insurance
          and pensions and reinforces low mobility. EU accession has greatly benefited the agricultural and
          rural sector in Poland, and the country is often seen as one of the most successful new member states
          in terms of taking advantage of the opportunities of EU membership. However, EU integration has
          not benefited all farmers equally. The agriculture sector is still characterized by a pronounced duality
          and high inequality across farmers, with 54 percent of all agricultural holdings being smaller than 5
          hectares (Eurostat 2013 data). Small farms operate on 13 percent of the agricultural land and take up
          42 percent of the total labor force in agriculture (measured in total agricultural work units) but
          produce only 17 percent of the total standard output. More importantly, in economic terms, 57
          percent of all holdings generate less than €2,000 in standard output per year, and 40 percent consume
          more than half of their production—which suggests that they fall in the (semi-) subsistence farm
          category and are faced with low productivity levels. On the other hand, good preparation prior to EU
          membership turned the development of the food industry in Poland into a “success story”: above all,
          Poland was able to take advantage more fully of growing export markets, particularly in the EU.
          What prevents the mobility of low-income farmers toward more lucrative and productive
          employment?

        three types of support: direct payments to farmers, market support measures, and rural development
        programs to support the wider rural economy. Direct payments are made annually to help stabilize
        farm revenues in the face of volatile market prices, unpredictable weather conditions, and variable
        input costs. To benefit from these payments, farmers must respect rules and practices concerning
        environmental standards, animal welfare, food safety, and traceability. Payments are not based on
        how much farmers produce, but on how much land they use and how they use it. These payments are
        in the range between Zl 1,700 and Zl 4,600 per year, potentially providing incentives to remain in
        agriculture; however, additional evidence is needed to make any firm conclusion about this.

     replacement ratios (the benefit received at retirement as a percentage of preretirement salary) are
     expected to continue to decline, and the percentage of pensioners who will receive the minimum

        farmers with one or more hectares of land. Most KRUS contributors pay a contribution equal to 30
        percent of the minimum ZUS pension each quarter (10 percent per month) because their land
        holdings are under 50 hectares, family members do not work in agriculture, and they have no
        nonagricultural income. In return, they receive a pension at age 65 (males) or age 60 (females) equal
        to 115–125 percent of the ZUS minimum pension per month for life. The plan also pays disability
        and survivor benefits. Contributions made by farmers generally cover about 10 percent of the total
        cost of the plan, with the remainder paid from the government budget, so the program is heavily
        subsidized by the government. Unlike ZUS, the KRUS contributions and benefits for farmers are not
        based on actual income because measuring income for farmers would be administratively complex.
        Farmers with land holdings of less than 1 hectare may voluntarily join and pay the same 10 percent
        contribution to get the same highly subsidized pension benefit.45 Despite a recent reduction in the
        number of farmers insured under KRUS in 2016, the differences in the benefit amounts and types of
        schemes could pose disincentive effects.46

 204. Similarly, although all workers have a right to exactly the same health services, there are
     significant differences in the cost associated with getting health insurance. Farmers pay only Zl
     1 (€0.25) per hectare of land for every insured person. Given that the average farm size is of around
     10 hectares, this translates to a symbolic payment of Zl 10 (€2.5) per month. Moreover, the
     contribution is paid by the state for owners of farms below 6 hectares. In contrast, health insurance
     contributions are 9 percent of wage-income for other workers.47 Although a large part of health
     insurance contributions can be deducted from personal income taxes, the contributions of nonfarm
     workers are much higher.48 Given the preferential conditions for farmers and farm household
     members to receive health and social security insurance, there are restrictions regarding overlaps of
     insurance titles that do not allow households to combine farm and nonfarm employment. Taken
     together, these parallel systems may provide disincentives to obtain legal employment outside of
     agriculture, increasing the size of the gray economy and potentially slowing the transitions to more-
     productive nonfarm employment.




     average wage); followed by the self-employed, who pay lump-sum contribution as if they were earning 60 percent
     of average wage; and then civil code commission contract wage-workers, who pay contributions from the
     minimum wage.
45
     Farmers and farmers’ household members pay a small lump -sum contribution (Zl 129 [€32]) in 2017.

     See the chart, “Number of Persons Insured by KRUS, 1991–2014” on the KRUS website:

     _1991_2014.png.
47
     Imbalances also exist among nonfarm workers, particularly between wage and self-employed workers (the latter
     pay health insurance as 9 percent from 75 percent of the average wage).
48
      In 2016 the cost of social security contributions and health insurance contributions for an average-size farm owner
     (farm household member) was equivalent to around 20 percent (10 percent) of the contributions paid for a
     minimum (average) wage earner. This is not balanced by, for example, higher farm taxes as compared with
     nonfarm income taxes, because the farm tax for the average farm (in monthly terms) is similar to income tax paid
     by a minimum wage earner. It is also worth noting that farm tax is paid only by the land owner, while several
     household members might be insured through KRUS.

         205. Eliminating barriers to mobility between the farm and nonfarm sectors could go a long way
             toward improving labor incomes in rural areas and fostering structural transformation. KRUS
             and CAP were designed with other social and environmental policy goals; however, as in much of
             policy making, there could be unintended effects. Although more research is needed, there is some
             indication that the combination of agricultural and social protection policies could reduce incentives
             for farmers to move to formal nonfarm employment, thus reducing their lifetime earnings potential.
             To the extent that these incentives also preclude improvements in productivity and national growth,
             further analysis may be warranted.

         206. Another important barrier to mobility is access to affordable housing. The Polish housing
             market mostly focuses on owner occupancy, as the vast majority of Poles live in houses or flats that
             they own, with the rental sector by private landlords developed mostly in Poland’s largest cities and
             resort towns (Figure 3.27, panel a). At the same time, the overcrowding rate in Poland is the second
             worst in the EU (Figure 3.27, panel b). The share of households living in overcrowded dwellings and
             the share of housing of poor quality remain large relative to other European countries, indicating a
             lack of affordable housing alternatives. At the same time, housing has a regional dimension and is
             related to aging, with greater availability of housing in areas where aging is most visible (Map 3.6).
             This could have the consequence that the value of these houses will be low, and older people could
             have difficulties selling their assets in case they want to supplement their income.

    reducing the housing deficit
    and improving housing quality,
    housing affordability and
    limited diversity of the housing
    stock remain important policy
    challenges. The National
    Housing Program, adopted in
    2016, was an important step in
    this direction as it contains a
    systematic review of former
    housing policies as well as
    objectives, priorities, and
    implementation instruments of
    current housing policy. This

    market, investment and
    construction process, and the supply of public land. It remains to be seen whether the proposed
    review of regulatory policies will lead to increased availability of affordable housing and lower
    restrictions on the supply of rental housing in Poland (Glocker and Plouin 2016).

208. Barriers to transferring land also pose limits to mobility. Although Poland has a
    nondiscriminatory legal system that protects and facilitates acquisition and disposition of all property
    rights, including land, buildings, and mortgages, investors complain that the judicial system is slow
    in adjudicating property rights cases (U.S. Department of Commerce 2016). Moreover, widespread
    nationalization of property during and after World War II has complicated the ability to establish
    clear title to land, especially in major municipalities, because there is no general statute of
    limitations regarding the filing or litigation of private property restitution claims. In addition, two
    new land use laws, in force as of April 2016, restrict the free purchase of land by investors. The
    agricultural land law suspends the sale of Agricultural Property Agency (APA) (state-owned)
    farmland for five years unless it is being allocated for industrial parks, business centers, special
    economic zones, residential premises, or small agricultural properties. The APA manages real
    properties of the Agricultural Property Stock of the State Treasury, first of all, by leasing or selling
    real properties to enlarge or create family farms. State-owned farmland will be available only under
    long-term lease to farmers who want to enlarge their farms, to a maximum of 300 hectares (new and
    old land combined size). The agricultural land law also imposes restrictions on sale of privately
    owned farmland and gives the APA preemptive right to purchase in case of land sales by a private
    owner. The APA is obliged to offer market rate compensation under the law. Agricultural firms
    currently on the Polish market express concern that the 300 hectares limitation gives large,

    established farms a competitive advantage over smaller farms that wish to expand. The Law on
    Forest land similarly prevents Polish and foreign investors from purchasing privately held forests
    and gives the state-owned forestry agency the preemptive right to buy privately held forests (U.S.
    Department of Commerce 2016).

    North-Western regions could substantially
    enhance mobility and access to labor
    markets. Major road and rail investment
    projects have substantially improved
    connectivity of the regions in recent years.
    From Krakow, it takes two hours to drive from
    Rzeszow, four hours to get to Warsaw or
    Wroclaw, 7 hours to Berlin, and around 10 to
    Hanover and Hamburg. With the top standard
    highway and railway systems already
    significantly developed, further investments
    are likely to deliver only marginal travel-time
    savings at a very high cost and will be unlikely
    to significantly improve the competitive
    potential of businesses in lagging regions.
    More importantly, there is limited connectivity
    between towns to regional centers particularly
    in Eastern and North-Western part of Poland
    (Map 3.7). The average access time to the
    regional centers located in these regions is          Source: Komornicki et al. 2015. ©Institute of

    (ESPON 2013). The availability, level of
    integration, convenience, and cost of access to public transit (buses, trams, and railway) in
    metropolitan functional areas and between rural locations and regional and subregional
    socioeconomic centers is still limited in many regions. Recent studies show that public transport in
    urban and metropolitan areas is losing passengers and is noncompetitive in regional transport both in
    central and peripheral rural zones (ESPON 2013). This severely affects accessibility to work places
    and basic services. Even the Warsaw region, the largest metropolitan area in Poland, still has
    deficiencies in public transport, particularly in relation to integration of urban transport (buses and
    trams) to suburban and regional railway connections. Accessibility within its metropolitan area
    remains within 60 minutes’ travel access time to the city center, and its level is practically
    unchanged since 2004 despite significant transport investment projects implemented after accession
    of Poland into the EU (Komornicki et al. 2015). Although noticeable investments have been made in
    public passenger transport (railway rolling stock, buses, trams, and urban road infrastructure), urban
    transport in most cities is still dominated by private cars. Policy reforms and further improvements in
    operations, tariff structure, intermodal integration, modernization of ticketing systems, and
    investments in public transport in metropolitan and peripheral areas—along with revitalization of




                                                   125
    road infrastructure connecting towns and regional centers—are therefore needed to make it a more
    attractive alternative to private cars.

210. Given the likely decrease in EU funding beyond 2020, safety, maintenance, and
    improvements of road and rail infrastructure will largely depend on increasing transport
    revenues and the effectiveness of the specialized state administrations and state-controlled
    companies. Significant investments will continue as a result of the EU 2014–2020 Structural Funds,
    with an increased focus on rail and urban transport. For this funding to be effective, multistakeholder
    coordination and institutional capacity at the government and local levels are needed to improve road
    and railway safety and efficiently manage the infrastructure project cycle. To ensure the
    sustainability and further development of transport system beyond 2020, policy changes and
    improvements in the legal and funding framework are necessary. Structural reforms are needed to
    secure additional revenues for maintenance and further modernization aimed at improving networks’
    capacity and safety. Several mechanisms based on “users and polluters pay” principles can be
    considered for ensuring the sustainability of funding for transport, including fuel charges, road
    tolling, track access charges, and passenger tariffs for railways. Additional resources should be also
    used to rebalance the infrastructure funding system so that more funds are secured for the regional
    and local road networks to improve intra-country connectivity, access to public services, and local
    access to trade links. Additionally, improvements in transport planning and organization of transport
    services should accompany better corporate governance and efficiency of government and
    government-owned companies, including rail and urban transport companies. Constraints on the
    competitiveness of public transport include the following:
       Institutional aspects that result in urban and metropolitan transport planning that is constrained
        by administrative borders rather than covering functional metropolitan areas
       Lack of interoperability of automatic fare collection, which impedes fare integration across
        modes, thus reducing the attractiveness of public transport to users
       A fare discount policy that is too generous and not well targeted to the poor and other vulnerable
        groups
       The absence of national legislation to encourage multimodal urban transport across functional
        urban areas


Improving Nonlabor Income and Redistribution

211. Tax and benefit policies need to complement labor incomes to enhance shared prosperity.
    The assets framework followed so far has focused on the opportunities that individuals have to build
    and use their skills and talents through the job market to be able to participate in growth and
    prosperity in Poland through increases in labor incomes. Fiscal and social policies that could
    complement labor incomes through redistributive and social assistance policies are considered
    below.

212. The overall redistributive power of fiscal policy in Poland has been low compared with that
    of other EU countries. Most direct taxes are progressive and equalizing with the exception of
    agricultural taxes and farmer contributions, which depend on land size rather than on income
    generation. However, direct taxes and contributions are also poverty-increasing since most
    contributions do not have a minimum threshold, thus posing a burden on poor households.



                                                   126
        Moreover, indirect taxes are regressive and contribute to poverty and inequality (Goraus and
        Inchauste 2016). Direct transfers are progressive and equalizing, particularly family benefit and
        social assistance programs, which are pro-poor. Contributory benefit programs make up a large share
        of the incomes of the poor, but they are not pro-poor, because most of the benefits go to individuals
        at the top of the distribution who have contributed more. In fact, until 2016, noncontributory family
        benefits and social assistance were low compared with other high-income countries, which led to a
        low level of redistribution and a negative net cash position after taxes and transfers for many low-
        income households. Spending on health and education is progressive and equalizing. Therefore, until
        2015, the Polish fiscal system had the capacity to redistribute but weak capacity to reduce poverty
        given its resources disposal, particularly for families with children.

 213. With the introduction of the Family 500+ program and recent improvements to the
     progressivity of the personal income tax, the redistributive and poverty-reducing impact of tax
     and benefit policies has improved. Historically, the social assistance system was highly targeted,
     not very generous, and because of the complexity of the systems’ setup and aims, had coverage gaps.
     The Family 500+ program, introduced in April 2016, revolutionized the social assistance and family
     support system by reducing coverage gaps and increasing social expenditure. The new benefit is
     expected to cost 1.3 percent of GDP compared with all other noncontributory transfers, which
     cumulatively amounted to 0.7 percent of GDP in 2013. It will significantly reduce poverty,
     particularly child poverty, as well as inequality (Goraus and Inchauste 2016).49 In addition to the
     new family benefit program, the government also enhanced the progressivity of the personal income
     tax by increasing the tax allowance for very low-income earners while reducing the allowance for
     higher-income earners. The total cost of this move amounted to about 0.1 percent of GDP, but the
     resulting balance of tax and benefits is expected to have both redistributive and poverty-reducing
     effects (Figure 3.28, panel a). The impact of direct taxes and transfers on disposable income is
     comparable to other countries in the region such as Croatia and the Czech Republic, but still lower
     that the impacts observed in Belgium, Austria, and Germany (Figure 3.28, panel b).

 214. However, the social assistance system in Poland remains complex. Generally, social assistance
     benefits can be separated into having aims for poverty and risk reduction, human capital (including
     fertility), or disability/old age and its combinations. Poland has transitioned from a country with one
     of the lowest support to families to a country with family support exceeding 3 percent of GDP—a
     characteristic of just a few EU countries with much larger welfare states. The Family 500+ program
     considerably increased the coverage of the poorest, with 80 percent of the poorest quintile now
     receiving at least one social assistance benefit compared with only 58 percent in 2012. However, the
     500+ program has contributed to reducing the efficiency of the overall social assistance system.
     Although it covers 74 percent of those in the poorest quintile, as much as 26 percent of the relatively
     well-off families (those living in the top 60 percent of the income distribution) also benefit from the
     program. Altogether, while social assistance in the past was very well targeted to the poor, albeit
     inadequately, today more than a third of households in the top two income quintiles are estimated to
     receive noncontributory transfers. Moreover, the 500+ program was introduced as an overlapping
     benefit (by law, not affecting eligibility to any other) in an already complex social assistance and
     family support system characterized by a multiplicity of different stakeholders, benefits, and aims.

     According to the information of the Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy, poverty decreased by 48
     percent and extreme poverty by 98 percent as of March 2017: https://www.mpips.gov.pl/aktualnosci-

        The design of each of the benefits includes a multiplicity of thresholds for eligibility, resulting in
        multiple overlapping benefits that require different administrations.

 215. Moreover, the 500+ program could create disincentives to enter the workforce for families
     in Poland. Recent simulations show that this program could reduce labor supply among families
     with children by about 240,000 individuals, principally mothers in small towns and villages (Myck
     2016). Although the effect exists for every family type examined, it is especially pronounced for
     second earners in families with one child and single mothers with one child. For instance, a married
     couple with one child where one spouse earns the minimum wage will find that if the other spouse
     works, the household will no longer receive any social benefit while their total household income
     would increase by only about 25 percent. If one were to account for childcare costs,50 the increase in
     household income would only be about 10 percent (Figure 3.29) before taking into account transport
     costs. Similarly, if a single mother was to work for minimum wage and send her child to a care
     facility, her income would increase by less than 16 percent once childcare is taken into account. In
     fact, 10 percent of people living in families with children are “trapped” in the sense that they earn Zl

                           216. There are several ways this system could be reformed to remove disincentives to enter the
                               labor force. The main challenge is to reform the system of support for families with children to
                               improve its effectiveness, address the related work incentives, reduce fragmentation, and unify key
                               definitions (such as who is a child) while at the same time ensuring consistency with respect to
                               households with special characteristics such as lone parenthood, disability, and so on. There may be
                               some scope to improve efficiency of the 500+ program, without losing coverage of the poor and the
                               middle class, through a combination of measures such as placing a cap on the eligibility for the
                               500+. Similarly, consolidation of processes and benefits for the 500+ and family benefits would
                               reduce administrative costs on the state and on families alike. Smaller reforms to the Family 500+
                               program could include the introduction of a taper instead of an instant withdrawal for the first child,
                               as was recently done with the family benefit. Alternative options include the introduction an income
                               disregard for the first child, which makes work pay at every level of earning above zero, or the
                               conversion of the child tax credit into a childcare tax credit.

    remains an outstanding gap.


Priorities for Inclusion

218. Shared prosperity will continue to be a challenge in the face of demographic changes and
    technological improvements. To ensure shared prosperity going forward, Poland will need to
    improve individual assets, ensure equality of opportunity in education and health, and ensure
    utilization of those assets, particularly through increased labor force participation. To improve the
    returns to those assets, barriers to mobility will need to be removed, while fiscal and social policies
    will need to continue to complement labor incomes through policies that address the needs of the
    most vulnerable and, at the same time, providing incentives for activation and productivity
    improvements. This agenda will require consistent policies, enhanced coordination and cooperation
    between the public and private sectors, and a more effective state.

219. Reducing the existing skills divide and improving the quality and relevance of education
    provision and adult learning possibilities will be needed to ensure shared prosperity. Reducing
    differences in school performance across socioeconomic backgrounds, regions, and gender would
    improve equality of opportunity. Moreover, given increased demand for skills driven by
    technological change, there is a need for the educational systems to adapt, fostering the skills
    required to perform nonroutine tasks and socioemotional and higher-order cognitive skills. Given
    demographic changes, the high concentration of older workers in routine jobs, and the overall
    growing importance of continuous skill acquisition among individuals in an innovating economy,
    shared prosperity will also depend on greater efforts to make lifelong and on-the-job training more
    accessible and relevant.




                                                   130
220. Similarly, Poland needs to do more to boost health outcomes to prepare for the aging of its
    population. Poland already faces higher mortality and morbidity rates than its peers, low
    affordability due to expensive drugs, and access to care that still depends on individual
    circumstances. Long waiting times result from poor coordination, fragmentation, and low and
    inefficient spending. Given the expected increase in healthcare costs due to population aging,
    policies and investments are needed for promoting improved health outcomes while also containing
    costs.

221. Beyond improving human capital, policies across the range of government involvement
    must promote labor force participation through coordinated and consistent policies.
    Improvements in education and health will be insufficient to ensure shared prosperity if people do
    not participate in the labor market. In the case of Poland, the most critical constraint on intensive use
    of its assets is the fact that a large share of its labor force does not participate in the labor market.
    Easing this constraint will require ensuring that people are not unwillingly excluded from the labor
    market, but more importantly it will require that cross-sectoral policies are well coordinated to
    provide strong incentives to work, particularly for women, including through concerted efforts to
    increase the availability of childcare and long-term care and to reduce labor disincentive effects.
    Moreover, extended outreach and employment promotion is necessary to reach inactive women and
    youth who live in remote and rural areas. Formalizing and operationalizing coordination among
    agencies that provide services to vulnerable populations is critical to ensure delivery of a package of
    integrated services to improve their chances of getting and keeping a job.

222. Improving the returns to labor will require lifting barriers that segment the labor market.
    A reduction in administrative burdens and implicit costs associated with permanent labor contracts
    will be needed to reduce firms’ incentives to prefer temporary contracts. Moreover, labor market
    segmentation could be reduced by making all contracts subject to the same tax and social
    contributions regime, simplifying and better communicating labor regulations, streamlining legal
    dismissal procedures, limiting the use of temporary contracts, and strengthening social protection.
    Notably, an individualized type of targeted job and social assistance program could help to include
    those who may otherwise be left out.

223. Eliminating barriers to mobility could also go a long way toward improving the returns to
    labor, particularly in rural areas. Potential barriers to mobility include the lack of access to
    affordable housing (and the associated rate of overcrowding) as well as agricultural and social
    policies that provide incentives for farmers to remain in the agricultural sector. In addition, judicial
    and regulatory barriers could prevent mobility by restricting land use and potentially limiting the sale
    of farm property. Similarly, improvements in regional road and rail infrastructure management could
    also substantially enhance mobility and access to labor markets. In particular, structural reforms are
    needed to rebalance existing EU funding toward regional and local networks and improve the
    capacity, safety, and sustainability of the current system by securing additional revenues for road and
    rail maintenance beyond 2020.

224. Tax and benefit policies have become more equalizing and poverty-reducing, but more can
    be done to reduce labor market disincentives and improve the social assistance system. With



                                                    131
    the introduction of the Family 500+ program and recent improvements to the progressivity of the
    personal income tax, the redistributive and poverty-reducing impact of tax and benefit policies has
    improved. However, the social assistance system in Poland remains complex, and there are
    important questions about the labor incentives of existing programs. The main challenge is to reform
    the system of support for families with children to improve its effectiveness, address work
    incentives, and reduce fragmentation, while at the same time ensuring consistency with respect to
    households with special characteristics. Placing a cap on the eligibility for Family 500+ could
    improve its efficiency without losing coverage of the poor and the middle class, while streamlining
    benefits could reduce administrative costs on the state and on families alike. Beyond family benefits,
    the main social exclusion challenge is related to improving the housing situation of the poor and
    improving last-resort social assistance to single and socially excluded adults.

225. This agenda will require consistent policies, enhanced coordination and cooperation
    between public and private sectors, and overall a more effective and accountable state. This is
    true both to ensure equality of opportunity in the formation of skills and to access quality health care
    services, but it is also true to ensure consistent policies to foster labor force participation and to
    reduce barriers to mobility and greater entry into the labor market. Redistributive tax and benefit
    policies will also require coordination across government and cooperation from the private sector.

Chapter 4: Requisites: Fiscal Sustainability, Better Natural
Resource Management, and Governance and Trust in Institutions

The requisites for sustainable development include fiscal, social, and environmental sustainability, and
governance for growth and equity. Given the demographic trends, long-term fiscal and social
sustainability will depend on reaching a consensus around the future of the pension system. Poland’s
environmental sustainability challenges are dominated by the need to move to a low-emissions economy,
which overlaps with other objectives such as cleaner air, better water management, and adapting to
climate change. More generally, policies to promote growth, inclusion, and sustainability will be effective
only if they can sustain a consensus, generate common expectations among actors, and foster compliance.


Introduction

 226. Beyond growth and inclusion, the requisites for sustainable development include fiscal,
     social, and environmental sustainability, and governance for growth and equity. The diagnostic
     has described two pathways toward shared prosperity so far: (a) increasing productivity through an
     innovation-led growth model, and (b) enhancing inclusion by improving the skills and health of the
     population (ensuring that they can engage productively) and by guaranteeing access to labor markets
     (which maximizes each person’s potential by eliminating barriers to mobility). These pathways are
     complex and mutually reinforcing. Removing constraints on productivity growth will contribute to a
     more competitive economy. At the same time, if individuals enjoy equal opportunities, higher
     productivity will mean new and more productive jobs that generate higher incomes for all, ultimately
     increasing shared prosperity. However, these pathways cannot be achieved in the absence of
     prerequisites that guarantee the sustainability of policies.

 227. Long-term fiscal and social sustainability are interlinked in the context of demographic
     changes through the social protection system. Although the public debt remains sustainable in the
     short and medium term (see Appendix A), in the long run Poland faces a trade-off between ensuring
     fiscal sustainability with the current level of pension benefits and confronting the fact that the
     resulting pension benefits may be too low to be socially sustainable. Even if workers were to
     increase their individual savings by 4–7 percent of gross earnings per year, the resulting pension
     benefits would force many to rely on the subsidized minimum pension. This would not only be a
     fiscal burden but also would likely be too low for many of the elderly, and particularly for women,
     who will have retired with insufficient savings.

 228. Ensuring environmental sustainability would also help to sustain growth and foster
     inclusion. Poland’s environmental sustainability challenges are dominated by the need to move to a
     low-emissions economy, a goal that overlaps with other environmental objectives such as cleaner
     air, better water management, and adapting to a changing climate. Transitioning gradually away
     from coal in power generation and in household consumption would not only help reduce
     greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and diversify energy sources but could also substantially improve
     air quality and reduce elevated health risks, especially among low-income households that burn coal
     for heating. Similarly, modernizing transport and making it more efficient will contribute to multiple




                                                   133
        goals. Finally, improved water management would help to mitigate the effects of climate change,
        which are expected to be more severe in rural areas and in agriculture.

 229. More generally, a key requisite to confront the growth, inclusion, and sustainability
     challenges presented throughout this diagnostic is governance. In particular, policies in all of the
     areas discussed so far will be effective in promoting growth and enhancing equity only if they are
     able to sustain consensus over time, generate common expectations among actors, and foster
     compliance. Using the World Development Report 2017 framework (World Bank 2017b), this
     diagnostic has highlighted (a) the need to ensure commitment to laws and their implementation; (b)
     the need for a new coordination effort beyond the EU integration process to encourage investments
     in new technologies that will allow the country to move up global value chains; and (c) the need to
     improve trust through improved accountability and service delivery in health, education, transport,
     and other basic services to ensure cooperation and compliance. This chapter aims to synthesize these
     cross-cutting themes.


Fiscal Sustainability in the Medium and Long Term

 230. Public debt remains sustainable in the short and medium term. As shown in Appendix A,
     public debt remains sustainable and is expected to remain below the standard risk thresholds in the
     medium term. The public debt profile is resilient to interest rate, foreign currency, and fiscal risks in
     the short to medium term. Recent increases in government spending through the introduction of the
     Family 500+ program led to some sustainability concerns, but some of this will be mitigated through
     indirect effects through a variety of sectors and markets. For instance, a fiscal computable general
     equilibrium (CGE) model finds that a Zl 1 billion increase in government transfers to households
     would increase the deficit by only Zl 830 million, since the stimulus is expected to translate into
     higher indirect tax revenues.

 231. Nevertheless, there is a trade-off between ensuring fiscal sustainability with the current
     level of benefits and the desire to continue to invest. Financing expenditures to strengthen
     transport infrastructure, provide quality health and education services, expand the safety net, and
     offer adequate salaries to attract and retain competent staff in public administration will be difficult.
     Tax rates can rise to some extent as income levels increase, but excessive taxes can discourage
     innovation and risk taking, behavior that is essential for rapid gains in productivity. Increased
     borrowing may be appropriate at times, but it is not a sustainable solution to a permanent increase in
     expenditures. Increase of revenues for infrastructure, introduction of modern asset management
     techniques based on the infrastructure life cycle, and increased administrative efficiency—coupled
     with greater involvement of the private sector in the provision of public goods, particularly
     infrastructure and services—can make an important contribution to stretching the fiscal envelope,
     provided governance is strengthened in the public sector.

 232. In the long term, fiscal and social sustainability will largely be determined by the pensions
     system, recently aggravated by the rollback in the statutory retirement age. Current
     demographic changes pose fiscal and social sustainability challenges to the pension system. The old-
     age pension system dependency ratio is projected to increase,51 while the replacement rate is

51
     The old-age pension system dependency ratio is the number of old-age pensioners to the number of contributors.



                                                         134
        expected to decline.52 Both processes will be exacerbated by the recent rollback in the statutory
        retirement age, with the replacement rate declining particularly strongly for women. In the absence
        of voluntary savings, the resulting pensions will be very low, the number of people expected to rely
        on the subsidized minimum pension will increase, and a growing number of people will be at risk of
        poverty in their old age.

 233. As a solution to a shrinking population, there is a need to expand the workforce through
     widened participation, improved mobility, and better regulation, complemented by smart
     immigration policies. Immigration can further serve to fill short-term labor shortages and hence
     support growth and, indirectly, fiscal balances, as discussed in Chapter 2. Immigrants can serve a
     focused but vital role. Poland’s aging population will not only put pressure on fiscal balances but
     also on government service delivery as demand for elderly care and health care soars. Foreign
     workers can help fill many of these gaps. To some extent, this would also contain wage pressures
     and help manage a rising public sector wage bill. Rising pressure on wages in the service sector is
     expected to be driven by so-called Balassa-Samuelson effects. In a converging economy,
     productivity improvements are driven by tradable sectors (manufacturing), while prices of services
     grow faster than prices of goods. This phenomenon is expected to translate into higher prices of
     public services in the long run.

 234. The rising pressure on age-related public spending in Poland will focus particularly on
     health, long-term care, and future pension adequacy. According to a recent analysis by the
     European Commission, age-related spending in the next decades is expected to remain broadly stable
     (20 percent of gross domestic product [GDP] in 2040 and 22 percent in 2060), mostly because
     pension spending is expected to go down despite rapid aging and to offset increases in health care
     and long-term care spending (Table 4.1). This is largely because the stability of the pension spending
     is embedded in the nature of the actuarially balanced notional defined contribution (NDC) pension
     system. However, the projected trends cannot be regarded as socially sustainable, because of a
     dramatic decline in future replacement rates, particularly for women. The next section details these
     effects based on a Pension Reform Options Simulation Toolkit (PROST) model for Poland.

 235. Abstracting from pension growth, there is still a risk that future public spending would be
     higher than indicated by long-term estimates. For example, in a long-term scenario in which total
     factor productivity (TFP) is lower than currently envisaged, pension spending in 2060 would be
     around 0.4 percent of GDP higher than in the reference case (EC 2015). In an EU-28 cost
     convergence scenario, health and long-term care spending in 2060 would be 1.7 percent and 1.2
     percent of GDP higher, respectively, than in the baseline case. These pressures will need to be
     matched either by increases in revenue, through tax policy changes or improved tax administration,
     or by expenditure cuts elsewhere. However, from the perspective of shared prosperity, future
     pensions are the main concern.

     The replacement rate is the average pension benefit divided by the average wage of contributors.

Fiscal and Social Sustainability Challenges from Rollback in Statutory Retirement Age

 236. Demographic changes were already expected to lead to low replacement rates before the
     recent changes in the retirement age. The 1999 pension reform introduced an NDC system in lieu
     of a defined benefit scheme, but the system remains a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system.53 The NDC
     benefit formula was designed to automatically reduce pension benefits in response to increases in
     life expectancy and reductions in covered wages. Rising life expectancy will increase the number of

53
      Benefits under the NDC formula are based on the value of an accumulated hypothetical account balance, divided
     by a life expectancy factor at retirement age. The “interest rate” earned on the NDC account is tied in part to the
     increase in the total wage fund of all members of the general pension program, and in part to a five-year average of
     GDP growth rates. As Poland’s population continues to age, the “investment earnings” on the account will
     decrease from year to year. Compounding the problem, the life expectancy factors used to convert the hypothetical
     account balance into an annuity will continue to increase, and this will further decrease monthly annuity benefits.




                                                            136
    years that people will depend on a pension relative to the years they have contributed to the system,
    so that if the retirement age is constant, the value of pensions would decline on average, and one
    would expect an increase in the number of pensioners on low incomes. Rising life expectancy was
    already expected to result in an increasing number of pensioners with very low incomes, with many
    pensioners’ private savings inadequate to avoid an impoverished retirement.

237. The government’s decision to roll back the recent rise in the retirement age would increase
    fiscal pressures, limit labor resources, and increase poverty among future pensioners. Based on
    World Bank PROST model simulations over the 2015–60 period, the rollback in retirement ages that
    will take effect in October 2017 will have a negative impact on the size of labor markets, the size
    and adequacy of expected pension benefits, and the size of required government transfers to the
    pension system relative to the current system. In all cases, the impact on women is more severe than
    the impact on men because male retirement ages were scheduled to increase from 65 to 67 (a two-
    year increase), while female retirement ages were expected to increase from 60 to 67 (a seven-year
    increase).

238. First, earlier retirement ages will result in lower labor force participation, particularly
    among women. The expected decline in labor force participation relative to the pension program
    prior to the rollback is expected to be more severe for women than for men (Figure 4.1). Under the
    reform scenario, the labor supply of women is 15 percent lower than the baseline in 2045, which
    equals more than 800,000 employees. Figure 4.2 shows the impact of the rollback on the pension
    system dependency ratio. This is the ratio of the number of old-age pensioners to the number of
    contributors. A higher number indicates that each contributor must support a greater number of
    pensioners. To ensure that the system remains in balance, a reduction in benefits, an increase in
    worker contributions, or an increase in state budget transfers will be required.

239. Second, earlier retirement ages will reduce pensions and increase fiscal spending in the
    future. The NDC benefit formula is designed to automatically reduce pension benefits in response to
    changes in the growth rate of covered wages and increases in life expectancy, even if retirement ages

    remain the same. This tendency will be even further exacerbated by the rollback in the effective
    retirement age, because this will lead to shorter working careers, lower account balances, and higher
    life expectancy at retirement and, therefore, lower pensions. In addition, the fiscal impact of
    individuals having access to the subsidized minimum pension will be even greater following the
    rollback, as NDC replacement ratios will be lower and more participants will qualify for the
    minimum benefit. The precise impact of the minimum pension will depend on how the government
    sets the minimum pension in the future, as the method of indexing is not specified in the law.

240. The reform has a much larger impact on the projected replacement rates of women. Figure
    4.3 shows the impact of the rollback on replacement ratios. In the baseline scenario, in 2040, the
    projected replacement rate is equal to 48 percent, while under the reform this projected replacement
    ratio falls to an estimated 30 percent. At some point, the NDC formula benefit may become lower
    than the poverty level or the minimum consumption basket, and the majority of participants may
    receive the minimum benefit rather than the benefit under the NDC formula. If this happens, the plan
    becomes close to a flat benefit plan, and the justification for basing contributions on wages may
    become difficult to support.

    change, Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) revenues were expected to remain about constant as a
    percentage of GDP until 2060. The negative effect of the shrinking labor force was expected to be
    mitigated by the planned increase in the statutory retirement age. However, following the rollback,
    this is no longer true, with ZUS’s revenue declining by about 0.6 percent of GDP (10 percent of total
    revenues) on average compared with the baseline between 2040 and 2060. This reduction in revenue
    will be not matched by a corresponding reduction in ZUS expenditures. In fact, expenditures will
    increase slightly in the middle years of the projection period, and will be slightly lower in the last
    few years of the projection period. Consequently, the pension system deficit, and the amount that
    must be transferred from the state budget, will also increase (Figure 4.4). The impact of the reform

Incentives to Claim Disability Pensions Due to a Projected Lower Old-Age Pension

 243. A robust pension system should encourage workers to remain in the labor force until
     reaching the system’s standard retirement age, and should encourage those who are disabled
     to receive rehabilitation or remain in the workforce in some capacity. Some pension systems
     provide disability benefits only to those who are judged to be totally and permanently disabled. But
     most of the time, disability pensions are based on the same or a similar formula to the one used to
     calculate old-age pensions. Typically, the disability pension is designed to be less than what the
     worker would have received if he or she had continued to work until the standard retirement age. To
     guard the fiscal sustainability and benefit adequacy of national pension systems, countries often raise
     retirement ages. As this occurs, workers may look to qualify for disability pensions as an alternate
     way of retiring earlier than the standard retirement age.

 244. In Poland, the benefit formula for disability and survivor pensions is totally different from
     the old-age pension formula. This occurred in the context of the 1999 redesign of the pension
     system. Before 1999, old-age, disability, and survivor pensions and survivor benefits were based on
     the same formula. Disability benefits were based on the old-age formula, including projected service
     to the standard retirement age. However, two factors made disability benefits lower than old-age
     benefits: First, accrued plus projected years of service was limited to a maximum of 25 years.
     Second, the projected years were based on an accrual rate of 0.7 percent rather than the 1.3 percent
     applied to years when contributions were made. This combination helped keep a proper relationship
     between disability and old-age pensions.

 245. In 1999, when Poland moved to a multipillar pension system, the formula for disability and
     survivor benefits was not changed. Until now, this has not created a problem. At the start of the
     NDC system, benefits earned under the pre-1999 formula were converted to an initial account
     balance in the system on favorable terms. Consequently, the old-age benefits just after the change

    were as good as or better than they were under the old system. Also, in the first few years of the
    NDC system, Poland had a rapidly growing economy, and population aging was not yet as severe as
    it is today. Consequently, old-age benefits remained higher than disability benefits and are still
    higher today.

    system. The estimated replacement
    ratios for new old-age and disability pensions for men and women between now and 2060 are shown
    in Figure 4.5. At present, both male and female old-age benefits exceed disability benefits. However,
    old-age replacement ratios decline steadily for each new generation of old-age retirees. For men,
    new old-age benefits are lower than disability benefits beginning in 2022, and for women, the
    crossover occurs in 2019. Consequently, there is urgency for Poland to address this issue now. The
    change in this relationship will create moral hazard and could reverse Poland’s hard-won gains in
    reducing overall pension expenses.

247. Against this backdrop, there are incentives for each successive generation of workers to
    seek disability pensions rather than old-age pensions to maximize their lifetime pension
    income. Without pension program changes, soon it will be far more profitable to seek disability
    pensions than old-age retirement benefits. Because the relationship between old-age and disability
    pensions is close and still favors old-age pensions, now is the appropriate time to start calculating
    disability benefits using the NDC formula rather than the pre-1999 benefit formula. If the
    government waits longer to make this change, it will result in a sharp drop in the replacement ratios
    for new disability pensioners—which will make it very hard to implement—while if the change is
    made in the near future, there will be much less objection.


Mobilizing Voluntary Private Pension Savings: Necessary but Insufficient

248. The 1999 pension reform in Poland strengthened the link between funds paid into the
    system throughout an individual’s career and that individual’s pension benefits, but as life
    expectancy has increased, this has meant lower replacement rates, particularly for women.



                                                   140
       Under the previous PAYG pension system, this link was not strong, and the benefit amount was
       calculated using a complicated formula based on work tenure and previous salaries. Under the new
       system, the capital accrued throughout the career (both real [accrued on the pension funds accounts]
       and virtual [accumulated on ZUS NDC accounts]) and the expected value of payments were directly
       linked. The benefit amount is calculated by dividing the total balance on the accounts by the life
       expectancy in months at retirement age (average for population as a whole). Consequently, increases
       in life expectancy at retirement (Figure 4.6) lead to inescapable decreases in replacement rates,
       which will cause strains in the pension system and may lead to social conflict. Even with the higher
       retirement ages of 67 years, the reduction in replacement rates would have been substantial—from
       the current 65 percent to about 50 percent in 2040 and 37–50 percent in 2060. Reversal of the 2014
       reform led to even greater expected fall in replacement rates, to about 31 percent for females and 49
       percent for males already by 2040 (Figure 4.7). The gender gap in the expected replacement rates is
       expected to widen significantly.

249. Given the expected decline in replacement rates, the government is proposing alternative
    solutions. In the first mechanism—proposed by the Ministry of Economic Development (2016) in its
    “Strategy for Responsible Development”—assets accrued in the Open Pension Funds would be
    transferred to Individual Pension Accounts. Another proposed change is the introduction of an
    Employee Pension Capital Plan to support voluntary savings. Although no concrete solutions were
    described in the strategy document, in the proposal that followed, employees were supposed to
    transfer 2 percent of their wages (with the possibility to increase the contribution by another 2
    percentage points), of which 1.5 percent would be paid by employers (with an option to increase by

        contributions would equal 4–7 percent of wages.55

 250. The impact of alternative contribution rates to the private pillar on future replacement
     rates for men and women were analyzed. Because the additional part of the pension system is
     private defined contribution, it will have no direct impact on the state budget. Indirectly, this would
     be of course beneficial for fiscal sustainability because higher payments from the multipillar
     pensions would translate into lower public payments as state-guaranteed minimum pensions or from
     social assistance. The following four scenarios were analyzed:
    Baseline: no additional private savings
    Additional private savings of 4 percent: the minimum proposed in the “Strategy for Responsible
        Development”
    Additional private savings of 7 percent: the maximum proposed in the Strategy
    Additional private savings of 11 percent: the level required to make the replacement rate for men
        comparable with today’s levels

 251. For men, additional savings in private defined contribution funds can to some extent make
     up for falling replacement rates. Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.9 present the expected replacement rates
     under the different scenarios, with an additional line for a scenario with a retirement age of 67 years.
     Even in the most conservative scenario, additional savings increase the baseline replacement ratios
     in 2050 by almost 8 percentage points; with 11 percent in additional savings, the ratios increase by
     21 percentage points. This elevates the replacement ratio to 64 percent, which is quite close to what
     it would have been prior to the retirement age rollback. Moreover, even the lowest amount of

     Another incentive (under consideration) for older workers to postpone the exit from the labor market was to make
     one-time lump-sum payments of Zl 5,000 for those who decided to stay for at least two additional years of activity.




                                                                                                                       142
    assumed additional private savings outweighs the negative impact of the retirement age rollback by
    about 2025. Therefore, for males, additional private savings as proposed in the “Strategy for
    Responsible Development” can be an effective measure to counteract the negative effects of the
    retirement age rollback.

252. For women, the situation is dramatically worse. The gap between the retirement age before the
    rollback and now is too wide to be filled by additional private savings. In all scenarios, the
    replacement rate in 2060 is still well below the replacement rate today. After the rollback in the
    statutory retirement age, to assure a 60 percent replacement rate at retirement at the age of 60 in
    2050, females would need to contribute about 17–18 percentage points more to the pension system
    than they do now.

253. Summing up, the medium-term fall in replacement rates is unavoidable, and private
    pension savings have to be mobilized now to avoid sustainability problems in the future.
    Retirees who will retire 10–15 years from now do not have enough time to accumulate enough funds
    in their private pension accounts to sustain the current generous replacement rates. In the long term
    for males, it is possible to make up for declining replacement ratios with additional contributions to
    private pension funds. It would require saving additionally about 7 percent of wages throughout the
    worker’s whole career. If that goal is to be achieved sooner—say, by about 2050—the contribution
    rate has to be much higher (an additional 11 percent). Moreover, to compensate for the negative
    impact of the cut in the statutory retirement age, even the smallest change analyzed (that is, an
    additional 4 percent) would be sufficient because the difference in retirement ages before and after
    the rollback for males is only two years. The situation for females is much worse: 11 percent in
    additional savings would be needed just to compensate for the retirement age rollback by 2060, but
    17–18 percent in additional savings would be needed to assure a 60 percent replacement rate. Given
    that this may be too much to tolerate, retirement ages for women will have to increase to assure
    adequate replacement rates in the future.


Environmental Sustainability

254. Poland’s environmental sustainability challenges are dominated by the need to move to a
    low-emissions economy, a goal that overlaps with other environmental objectives such as
    cleaner air, better water management, and adapting to a changing climate through improved
    resilience. The existing coal-based energy mix, fast-rising transport emissions, and insufficient
    energy efficiency are the main challenges for lowering GHG emissions in line with European Union
    (EU) obligations. As global and EU climate action becomes more pronounced, the transition to a
    low-emissions economy poses the risks of (a) stranded public assets if carbon prices move (or
    regulations tighten) faster than infrastructure can be retrofitted or replaced, (b) power shortages if
    generation is insufficient for demand, and (c) diminished energy affordability for the bottom income
    deciles. To mitigate these risks, energy infrastructure modernization and investments in thermal
    retrofit, development of cleaner energy supplies, and balancing energy security with climate actions
    need to be undertaken. The necessary restructuring of the coal sector should be managed to ensure a
    smooth transition while mitigating the social impact. Moreover, Poland retains potential for
    significant energy efficiency gains, especially in residential buildings. Rising transport emissions
    need to be moderated, via more rail and electrification of road vehicles. In addition, air quality is not
    yet at European norms, and moving to lower emissions will also help to reduce air pollution, in



                                                    143
        particular by encouraging energy efficiency and switching from coal to natural gas for heating.
        Adapting to a changing climate requires dealing with substantial uncertainty, but the dual challenges
        for Poland are likely to be increased severity of weather and reduced water availability, imposing the
        greatest harm on the agriculture sector. Water is already scarce in Poland, and a changing climate
        will undermine water availability in some regions, further emphasizing the need for improved sector
        management. The agriculture sector—dependent on water availability and weather conditions—will
        need to address risks to farmers, especially small landholders, by implementing a comprehensive
        risk management framework as well as investment in irrigation. Changes in agricultural water
        management practices also will be needed for better water retention, water drainage, water storage in
        soil, techniques limiting water evaporation from soil, appropriate fertilization, and protection against
        weeds.

     different target for each
     member state, still to be finalized.56 Renewable energy is expected to constitute at least 27 percent of
     EU final energy consumption in 2030 (but with no mandatory targets for individual member states).
     Similarly, the energy efficiency target to reduce energy demand by 27 percent (vis-à-vis projected
     business-as-usual demand in 2030) is indicative only. Additional rules and regulations on energy and
     climate are being added, for example, through proposals in the November 2016 “Winter Package,”
     aiming to accelerate the transition to clean energy and low emissions across the EU by completing
     the internal market for electricity.

     The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is a carbon market covering large energy suppliers and industrial
     emitters (equivalent to energy-intensive economic sectors). Non-ETS entities include small energy or industrial
     emitters; the transport, agriculture, and services sectors; and residential and commercial buildings.




                                                                  144
256. Despite progress in reducing GHG emissions and improving the emissions intensity of
    production, Poland’s main efforts in the transition to a low-emissions economy lie in
    addressing the energy sector’s reliance on coal. Poland’s emissions are predominantly from the
    energy sector (Figure 4.10), and energy is dominated by coal, which accounts for half of primary
    energy supply. Coal-fired power plants dominate power generation, and a large part of this capacity
    is more than 40 years old, yielding a power infrastructure that is among the oldest in the EU (Figure
    4.11). Despite substantial declines in recent decades in the primary energy intensity of GDP—
    largely because of structural changes and energy sector reforms—Poland remains among the five
    most energy-intensive EU economies because of (a) its relatively high shares of industry in value
    added, and (b) inefficiencies in energy supply infrastructure and end-use consumption, particularly
    in heavy industry and space heating. Moreover, Poland’s historical reliance on domestic coal for
    power generation and space heating has been seen as central to national energy security, a critical
    issue given Poland’s geopolitical location. Nevertheless, in light of the Paris Agreement on global
    climate action and the EU’s ambitious 2030 targets, the coal-based energy mix and an aging power
    infrastructure need to transition toward lower-carbon energy options with diversified fuel sources
    and higher efficiency. Overcoming these challenges will require deliberate actions to diversify away
    from coal, modernize energy supply infrastructure, scale up investment in end-use energy efficiency
    (in particular in the residential sector), strengthen the safety net for the poor to reduce energy
    poverty, and shift from a national approach to energy security to an EU-wide approach focused on a
    well-functioning, fully integrated internal energy market.

257. Challenges in the coal sector are significant. Poland needs to consider some of the risks facing
    the energy sector as it moves to reduce GHG emissions. If carbon prices (in the ETS system) rise or
    regulations tighten faster than infrastructure can be retrofitted or replaced, then public assets (such as
    publicly owned utilities) may become stranded. If power generation is not expanded to meet growing
    demand, within the emissions constraints of EU rules, then power shortages may materialize, and
    electricity prices may rise sharply, undermining energy affordability for the bottom income deciles.



                                                          145
        To mitigate these risks, the existing evidence points to specific activities such as energy
        infrastructure modernization and investments in thermal retrofit, development of cleaner energy
        supplies, and reshaping of energy security. The necessary restructuring of the coal sector should be
        managed to ensure a smooth transition and mitigate social impact. One of the main constraints is
        political willingness and policy readiness to address the issues associated with mining of costly, low-
        quality coal. Even though hard coal production and employment have been declining for many years,
        Poland remains the second largest producer of coal in the EU, with production of about 70 million
        tons per year and employment of nearly 83,000 workers. Polish underground mines are extracting
        coal of decreasing quality from deeper and deeper levels, putting upward pressure on production
        costs. Closure of loss-making coal mines will require (a) support to address the additional
        transportation costs needed for younger workers being transferred to lower-cost mines at other
        locations; (b) severance packages for miners approaching retirement age, as has been done in the
        past; and (c) retraining for workers ready to leave the mining industry and seek employment in other
        sectors. Moving away from coal will not weaken national energy security if done with careful
        planning and steady execution.
 258. The transition to lower emissions from the energy sector is demanding for Poland. First,
     Poland’s geography, climate, and agricultural structure are not conducive to renewable energy, with
     the exception of wind power, for which local conditions are moderate. With few mountains and
     limited water resources, Poland is not suited for further development of large-scale hydropower.
     Biogas and biomass are still expensive technologies because Polish agriculture has few large farms
     (over 100 hectares) and because biomass combustion after 2020 will be allowed under EU rules only
     in high-efficiency installations, which are not yet available in Poland. As in other EU countries,
     subsidies for solar and wind installations are being reduced, but in addition, onshore wind in Poland
     faces recent new restrictive regulations. Second, nuclear technology could help in transformation of
     an energy mix dominated by coal. However, this technology would be completely new for Poland,
     making it more expensive and requiring public support for bringing nuclear power to Poland. Third,
     higher prices of carbon dioxide (CO2) allowances starting in 2020, mainly because of the market
     stability reserve scheme, could contribute to higher energy prices for customers, which consequently
     may undercut the competitiveness of Polish industry and make energy less affordable for the poor.
     Together, these limitations pose challenges for Poland that must be addressed in the country’s
     National Plan for Energy and Climate 2020–30, scheduled to be finalized in 2017.
 259. A further challenge for the electricity sector in Poland is the still limited capacity of cross-
     border connections. Poland is one of the least interconnected EU countries, with cross-border
     connections representing less than 7 percent of installed generation capacity, while the EU target for
     2020 is 10 percent.57 Poland is not benefiting from the integrated Northwestern European pricing
     zone and the flexibility in the system that interconnections and market coupling bring. In fact,
     Poland is facing unplanned electricity loop flows (from Germany and Austria, due partly to
     intermittent renewable power overproduction and market coupling between countries. Austria,
     Germany, and 11 other European countries have coupled their power prices in the Northwestern
     Europe region, enabling a more efficient use of electricity flows through a common pricing
     mechanism. A proactive assessment of regional integration with power systems of neighboring EU
57
     The European Council of October 2014 called for all EU member states to achieve interconnection of at least 10
     percent of their installed electricity production capacity by 2020, meaning that each member state should have in
     place electricity cables that allow at least 10 percent of the electricity it produces to be transported across its
     borders. The target for 2030 is 15 percent.




                                                            146
    countries could help identify solutions to the increasing stress on the Polish grid caused by loop
    flows while bring in lower-cost, cleaner electricity (IEA 2017).
260. Scaling up energy efficiency investment requires government interventions to unlock
    financially viable energy savings in industries and commercial businesses and provide
    incentives for economically sensible improvements in residential buildings. Poland’s White
    Certificate program has been aimed at leveraging commercial financing in industries and businesses,
    and the government has taken important steps to simplify the system and reduce large transaction
    costs that prevent building owners and operators from undertaking otherwise profitable investments.
    Most of the buildings constructed before active enforcement of energy-efficient building codes
    remain a major source of energy waste owing to lack of thermal insulation, with a large share of
    houses being poorly insulated.
261. As in power generation, space heating is predominantly coal-based, contributing heavily to
    air pollution and requiring policy incentives for a shift toward cleaner fuels. Poland’s district
    heating sector was among its earliest reform success stories with rapid adoption of consumption-
    based billing and cost-recovery tariffs in the 1990s. These policy actions led to a proliferation of
    efficient, customer-oriented, and profitable district heating companies, which many local authorities
    were able to successfully sell to the private sector. Today, although combined heat and power plants
    produce about 65 percent of the heat supply, small district heating systems relying on heat-only,
    coal-fired boilers and individual stoves using solid fuels are still popular in smaller cities and even in
    some agglomerations, such as Krakow and Silesia. Overall, district heating is 76 percent fueled by
    coal. Fuel switching of small district heating systems (to natural gas, biogas, or geothermal),
    cogeneration, and consolidation of small boilers and stoves (into larger systems) would help reduce
    GHG emissions and alleviate air pollution. The country has achieved significant success in scaling
    up thermal retrofit in multifamily buildings through efficient power and heat pricing and grant
    incentives provided by the thermal modernization program and a system of environmental funds, but
    challenges in the single-family segment remain. About half of the Polish population live in single-
    family houses, most of which lack thermal insulation and are heated by individual boilers consuming
    unabated coal and other types of solid fuels including coal waste, household waste, and firewood.
    This use of solid fuel has been identified as a major contributor to local air pollution, a critical issue
    in several regions in Poland. Following the success stories of some West European cities (for
    example, London), some Polish agglomerations are considering a ban on solid fuels in individual
    stoves and small boilers without pollution control equipment. A pivot toward supporting heating
    system upgrades, fuel switching, and thermal retrofit in single-family homes would help address
    both air pollution and energy affordability issues.
262. Energy affordability needs to be supported with targeted actions to contain the impact on
    poorer households of actions to cut emissions. About 17 percent of the Polish population is
    considered energy-poor (defined as households spending more than 10 percent of income on
    energy), mainly occupants of detached houses, inhabitants of rural areas, households living on
    nonearned income, single parents, and married couples with at least two children. Regional variation
    of fuel poverty in Poland is significant, with a concentration in the eastern part of the country (Lis,
    Miazga, and Sałach 2016). Targeted support to these households within existing social safety net
    arrangements can ensure energy affordability without undermining incentives to use energy
    efficiently. Energy saving or energy service companies could also help with mobilization of private
    capital, especially if accompanied by information and educational campaigns aimed at changing
    behaviors.

 263. Transport emissions in Poland remain a source of concern, as emissions and energy
     consumption from transport have risen sharply in recent years. Poland has one of the oldest
     passenger car fleets in Europe, heightening the need to make a decisive shift from road to rail for
     within-city and intercity connections. Such a shift would also make good use of available EU
     resources for low-carbon development. The switch from road to rail and a switch to cleaner fuels in
     conjunction with improvements in transport could together help to improve sustainability via
     reductions in carbon emissions and air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and PM2.5, while
     also strengthening the social integrity of communities currently suffering from poor transport
     connections.
 264. Going forward, Poland needs to develop and implement a comprehensive long-term
     strategy to transition to a low-emissions economy, starting with Poland’s National Plan for
     Energy and Climate, due in 2017–18. A long-term strategy is needed, focusing on energy supply,
     energy efficiency, and the transport sector. In the energy sector, Poland needs to construct a strategy
     that is consistent with overarching environmental sustainability goals, that balances the mix of
     domestic resources and diverse imports, and that firmly supports end-use energy efficiency
     improvement. A deeper integration with EU electricity and gas markets would bring competitive
     pressure to improve efficiency of national energy companies and mitigate potential risks to
     consumers. Market-based energy efficiency measures as well as deployment of renewable energy
     installations need to be facilitated from the regulatory side in terms of spatial planning, building
     standards, construction permits, and taxation. Recently initiated renewable auctions need to facilitate
     a level playing field between different renewable technologies and project sizes. Parallel programs to
     protect disadvantaged social groups from rising energy prices need to be in place.

     Particulate matter (PM) is a collective name for suspended fine solid or liquid particles added to the atmosphere
     by processes at the earth's surface. PM includes dust, smoke, soot, pollen, and soil particles. PM2.5 refers to
     particles with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less, and PM 10 to those smaller than 10 microns in diameter.

        several parts of the country have consistently exceeded the EU limit (Figure 4.12).59 Most
        agglomerations have seen improvements, with an average 5 percent drop in pollution between 2012
        and 2015. Out of 154 cities that were monitored, almost one-quarter were above the PM10 limit, and
        almost half were out of compliance with the PM2.5 target.

 266. Households in poorer urban
     areas are exposed to worse air
     pollution, while the associated
     premature deaths for the
     country as a whole remain
     high. The highest measurements
     of PM2.5 air pollution in Poland
     are recorded in urban areas and
     southern provinces, particularly
     in the Upper Silesian Industrial
     Region, where high levels of
     industrial plants and car use
     release most of the pollutants
     (Map 4.2). Poorer urban areas
     (population greater than 5,000
     and population density higher
     than 300 people per square
     kilometer) suffer from relatively
     higher levels of pollution, a
     correlation that also holds for
     other air pollutants (such as
     sulfur dioxide, black carbon, or      Source: EEA 2016. ©European Environment Agency (EEA).

     particularly aggravated by the        where PM10 exceeded the EU daily limit value of 50 micrograms per
     use of low-quality heaters in low- cubic meter (µg/m3) for more than 35 days during 2014. PM10 is
     income households. For the            particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microns in diameter.
     country as a whole, it is
     important to note that despite the decline in PM pollution, Poland has the highest mortality rate due
     to ambient PM pollution and household air pollution (from solid fuels) among new EU member
     states (Figure 4.13).60



59
     A target value for PM2.5 of 25 µg/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter) averaged over the year has been in place in the
     EU since 2010. Poland currently maintains a limit value of 25, with an obligation to comply with a newer EU
     Directive and phase down to 20 by 2020, based on a rolling three-year average concentration. See “Air Quality
     Standards” on the EC website: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/standards.htm.
60
      The health effects of inhalable PM are well documented, and PM 2.5 is more harmful than PM10. The harm comes
     from short- and long-term exposure and includes respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity (such as aggravation of
     asthma, respiratory symptoms, and an increase in hospital admissions) and mortality from cardiovascular and
     respiratory diseases and from lung cancer (WHO 2013).

 267. The health impacts of Poland’s air pollution translate into substantial economic costs.
     Premature deaths (or additional mortality) and additional disability due to air pollution can be
     aggregated into years of life lost (YLLs) or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs, that is, years lost
     due to ill health, disability, or early death). Poland loses the equivalent of over a half million life-
     years annually from exposure to ambient PM pollution and another half million from household air
     pollution. More than 95 percent of total YLLs come from lives cut short (premature death) rather
     than the burden of disability. These YLLs are typically valued by the lifetime earnings of an
     individual (using the value of a statistical life adjusted for GDP per capita). The calculated cost to
     Poland of indoor and outdoor air pollution exceeds US$100 million, using this technique and data
     for 2010. This cost rose between 2005 and 2010 (by about 10 percent) despite the fall in premature
     mortality because rising per capita GDP made each lost year more valuable.61 Alternatively, the cost
     of air pollution in YLLs was the equivalent of 13 percent of GDP in 2010, a significant economic
     cost to the country.

      For 2005, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) base value of a statistical life—
     US$3 million in lifetime earnings—was adjusted for differences in per capita GDP at purchasing power parity
     (PPP), with an income elasticity of 0.8, resulting in a Poland-specific value of a statistical life of US$1.6 million.
     For 2010, the value was adjusted for post-2005 income growth and inflation, resulting in a Poland-specific value
     of US$2.1 million.

 268. Apart from lost life-years, air pollution brings additional significant financial and economic
     consequences. Air pollution generates harm not only in terms of the societal cost of mortality and
     morbidity, but also to household, hospital, and public budgets and therefore to decision making
     within and outside of the health sector. These impacts also carry implications for social equity both
     within and between countries. Moreover, the deleterious impact of air pollution is not confined to
     human health. Many other impacts are worthy of consideration—those on the built environment, on
     animal and plant health (with further consequential impacts on the productivity of agricultural and
     forestry resources), and on larger ecological systems.
 269. Poland’s lagging air quality is driven by coal dependence, inadequate energy efficiency, and
     transport that is too road-based. The country’s air pollution can be explained most simply by the
     country’s heavy dependence on coal. Space heating, fueled mostly by coal, generates pollution
     especially in smaller, poorer cities with inefficient district heating and in poorly insulated single-
     family homes of poorer households. Small-scale combustion of coal and biomass as well as
     concentrated local pollution (particularly during the heating season) are the main factors in these
     compliance issues. A separate but important source of poor air quality is the transport sector, in
     which an aging passenger vehicle fleet aggravates pollution and a shift from road to rail is needed. It
     is important to keep in mind that air quality is intertwined with other policy objectives: addressing
     air pollution can generate significant co-benefits for other objectives, while air quality may
     simultaneously benefit from interventions that pursue other priorities, especially GHG emissions
     reduction. For example, heating system upgrades and thermal retrofit in single-family homes and
     switching from coal to gas for heating will reduce carbon emissions, alleviate air pollution, and
     bolster energy affordability. Moving away from coal, electrifying transport, and improving energy
     efficiency are broad sector policies that aim as a primary goal to reduce GHG emissions but bring a
     co-benefit of cleaner air.


Climate Change Adaptation Needed to Reduce Risks despite Modest Projected Harm

 270. Poland is not among the countries or regions expected to be worst-affected by a changing
     climate, and only modest harm is projected for Poland. An analysis by the Ministry of
     Environment based on climate forecasts concludes that by 2030, climate change will have a mostly
     negative impact on the economy and society (MoE 2013a).62 Higher average air temperature will
     exert some positive effects, including extension of the growing season in agriculture, a reduction in
     the winter heating season, and extension of the tourist season. However, expected negative effects
     dominate. The climate in Poland may not change much on average, but variability will rise, resulting
     in longer rainless periods, punctuated by torrential rains (Map 4.3 and Map 4.4). The groundwater
     level will decrease, which will harm biodiversity and ecosystems, particularly reservoirs and
     wetlands. In winter, the duration and depth of snow cover will be reduced and evaporation will
     increase, together reducing overall water resources. Further, climate change is likely to increase the
     frequency of extreme weather events and disasters, which will have a significant impact on
     vulnerable areas and the national economy. Torrential rains involving a risk of floods, flooding, and

62
     Climate change scenarios for Poland were prepared using regional simulations from the EU’s ENSEMBLES
     project and observation data from the E-OBS gridded dataset. The ENSEMBLES project, which ended in 2009,
     was run by the United Kingdom’s Met Office (national weather service) and used global cl imate models applying
     a moderate Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenario, A1B. E-OBS is a daily gridded
     observational dataset for precipitation, temperature, and sea level pressure in Europe since 1950.




                                                         151
        landslides—mainly in mountain and upland areas but also on slopes of river valleys and cliffs along
        the seashore—will be of main importance. Strong winds, hurricanes, and tornadoes will be more
        frequent, which is likely to impose damages on the construction sector and energy and transport
        infrastructure. Last, warmer temperatures in summer will lead to more eutrophication in inland and
        coastal waters; increased threat to life and health as a result of thermal stress and increased air
        pollution; greater demand for electricity in summer; and reduced cooling potential of water for
        power plants, undermining production capacity (MoE 2013a).63
 271. Adaptation measures are most critical in the water and agriculture sectors, but transport,
     construction, and coastal areas also will require further resilience, while forestry has few
     adaptation options. Projected changes in climate will reduce available resources in the water sector,
     which is already in need of reform to manage limited resources, augmenting the needed policy
     response. Less available water will, in turn, place stress on agriculture, which also requires ongoing
     reforms, in particular to improve risk management and agricultural water management practices.
     Transport is vulnerable to strong winds, heavy rain and storms, flooding and landslides, snow and
     ice, extreme temperatures, and lack of visibility. Road transport—both roads and vehicles—is
     particularly vulnerable to many of these climate phenomena because of its diffused spatial location.
     Rail and air transport will be less vulnerable but still affected. Sea transport will need to address sea
     level rise and coastal surges at ports. In response, transport infrastructure design standards that take
     account of climate change need to be developed, and retrofitting of existing infrastructure must be
     assessed. The construction sector will need to revise technical standards as the climate shifts,
     changing the design of foundations, load-bearing elements, and drainage systems. Coastal zones will
     need to address the likely increase in number and intensity of storms in the Baltic Sea. Coastal
     erosion is expected to increase, and low-lying areas may suffer from salinization of groundwater. To
     adapt coastal zones, monitoring of the flood protection system should be strengthened, degradation
     of shorelines should be prevented, and coastal zone monitoring should be developed. Last, the
     forestry sector is expected to face significant impacts on stand composition and types of trees.
     Mountain ecosystems will likely be the most vulnerable to a changing climate, with losses projected
     at up to 60 percent of species. Fire risk will rise, and a changing climate will be conducive to disease
     and pests, including invasive species, while weakened trees will be more vulnerable to wind damage.
     Further improvements in sustainable forest management may provide some amelioration (MoE
     2013a).

Improved Management of Scarce Water Needed to Face a Changing Climate

 272. Water management requires improvement to be able to address a multiplicity of challenges.
     Low water endowment per capita combined with vulnerability to water-related events (floods and
     droughts) call for increased emphasis on integrated management of water resources in the context of
     the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), as well as efforts to improve the efficiency of municipal
     water and sanitation utilities (to address poor operations and maintenance [O&M] and a high level of
     leaks). The need for additional energy supply calls for increased emphasis on integrated management
     of water resources in the context of the EU WFD as well as efforts to improve the efficiency of
     municipal water and sanitation utilities.
 273. Poland ranks among the most water-stressed countries in the EU. The country’s renewable
     freshwater per capita stands at only about 1,800 cubic meters per year (while in most EU countries
     this figure stands at or above 5,000 cubic meters). The country depends heavily on surface water,
     which is characterized by major spatial and seasonal variability, yet the total capacity of reservoirs
     does not exceed 6 percent of total annual water drainage. As a consequence, Poland has significant
     vulnerability to flood and droughts. Therefore, careful management with respect to early-warning
     preparedness for water-related disasters (such as floods and droughts) and rapid disaster response are
     essential to minimize fatalities and economic damage as well as being important to both poverty
     reduction and shared prosperity. For example, the flood episodes of 1997, 2006, and 2010
     highlighted the vulnerability of the large manufacturing, commercial, and tourist centers of Poland
     that provide jobs and contribute most to the national economy. Many of these centers are located
     along transport corridors and, effectively, are in former floodplains and in Poland’s most productive
     agricultural area, with high value added from orchards and horticulture. The floods forced the
     shutdown of these industrial centers and much of the related transport corridors for several weeks to
     months, first to allow the water to drain away and then to repair production equipment and other
     assets. The risk of such events adds uncertainty to industrial and agricultural output and harms the
     investment climate. Moreover, subregions that are most affected by floods typically have higher than



                                                    153
    average poverty rates and at-risk populations above 20 percent (for example, the subregions of Nysa
    Kłodzka in the Upper Odra, several counties along the Lower Odra, and most of the central and
    eastern parts of the Upper Vistula basin).
274. A changing climate will place further pressures on the water sector. Poland has relatively few
    water resources, and the efficiency of their use is low. Some regions already have periodic problems
    with water supply. The risk of various types of floods is expected to rise in all parts of the country.
    The damage from flooding will be augmented by the existence of buildings in the flood zones of
    rivers and the insufficient retention capacity of natural and artificial reservoirs. The increasingly
    probable flash floods caused by heavy precipitation are likely to cause flooding of these built-up
    areas. Further, Poland’s total water resources are sensitive to annual snow cover. Forecasts predict
    that its duration by the middle of the 21st century may be 28 days shorter than it is now. The
    decrease in the water content in snow cover will reduce the probability of snowmelt floods.
    However, the more important impact is likely to be shortages of water, which will affect mainly
    agriculture, where water needs, according to the forecasts, will increase by 25–30 percent. Water
    shortages will be worse in some voivodeships, in particular Mazowieckie (Map 4.5).
275. The overall governance framework for water management stands in need of reform. Water
    plays an important role in economic growth in Poland, touching on key productive sectors including
    energy, transport, drinking water, agriculture, health, and environment (water quality and ecosystem
    services). As a result, its efficient provision and sustainable management are critical to protecting
    vulnerable populations and ensuring shared prosperity. The current division of responsibility across
    various ministries is accompanied by fragmentation of funding sources. Water supply system (WSS)
    service providers at municipal government levels suffer from extreme fragmentation, with about
    1,800 WSS utilities nationwide. This fragmentation can pose a challenge to proper integrated
    management and planning. In the absence of a national WSS regulator, tariffs have largely been
    driven by the political process at the municipal levels. Ensuring that tariffs are in line with
    affordability, equity, and efficiency principles has also been a major challenge. In addition, actions
    are needed within the legislative and institutional framework to be fully compliant with EU norms
    (including cost recovery policies and commitments made in the EU accession treaty for meeting the
    acquis communautaire). A new Water Law is currently in process that attempts to streamline the
    water management administrative structure and update a number of regulatory features—for
    example, on the preparation of the river basin management plans—while other discussions related to
    water reforms are still ongoing, such as over the need to establish a national regulator for WSS
    services. Significant work, in terms of both reform and institutional strengthening, remains to be
    done to ensure that the EU WFD as well as other water regulations are properly implemented.

 276. High fragmentation of WSS providers leads to inefficient O&M and wide tariff disparities.
     Since the liberalization and decentralization reforms that took place in the late 1990s, provision of
     WSS services in Poland has been the responsibility of municipalities. Considerable investments have
     been carried out over the past 15 years to rehabilitate deteriorated infrastructure and foster
     compliance with the EU environmental acquis (especially in wastewater treatment), with financial
     support from the national budget as well as EU grants. Even so, a significant portion of rural
     dwellers still rely on private wells, and the gap is even wider for access to sewage collection
     systems—raising the issue of equity of access to WSS services. The current extreme fragmentation
     of WSS provision has led to widespread problems of inefficient O&M (with a high rate of water
     losses), poor capacity to implement large investments (such as for new wastewater treatment plants),
     and wide disparities in tariff level for the population (which are set by local municipal councils).
     With more investments expected in the near future to improve access and promote full compliance
     with EU directives, ensuring that WSS utilities are operated efficiently and that tariff increases can
     be maintained within acceptable affordability thresholds is becoming increasingly important to
     maintain progress on poverty reduction and shared prosperity.
 277. Continued investment in flood management and reforms to management and an improved
     institutional framework are needed. First, continued investment is needed in flood management
     infrastructure (both hardware and especially software approaches) to build the needed resilience to




                                                    155
    current water-related risks and future ones emanating from climate change. Second, reforms to the
    overall governance framework for water management are essential, along with changes to the legal
    and economic instruments available to meet the objectives of achieving a robust level of water
    security. Last, reforms of the WSS institutional framework are needed to

      Promote consolidation of WSS service providers to reduce O&M costs, improve operational
       capacity, reduce tariff disparities, and ensure compliance with EU water regulations in a more
       cost-efficient manner;
      Promote national benchmarking of WSS providers to identify best performers and disseminate
       best practices;
      Improve the tariff adjustment process to foster performance incentives and reduce political
       capture at the municipal level (one option to consider being the establishment of a national
       regulator); and
      Optimize the implementation of future investments for expanding access in rural areas, and
       ensure that tariff increases are kept within thresholds of affordability for the poor.


Contributions of Climate Adaptation to Safer, Cleaner, Less-Risky Agriculture

278. Poland’s agriculture sector has modernized and intensified since accession to the EU and
    implementation of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy. In particular, farmers have turned to
    intensive use of commercial fertilizer to improve yields. This use has soared, pushing Poland to
    among the most intensive fertilizer use within the OECD. Between 2002 and 2012, use of
    nitrogenous and phosphorous fertilizer increased relatively fast, albeit from a very low base.
    Combined with the decrease in the area of agricultural land, this trend brought Poland to be among
    the top 10 OECD countries with the highest intensity of commercial fertilizer use (OECD 2015d).
279. The risk of a changing climate will likely have a significant economic impact on agriculture
    and livestock, centering on future water availability. The agriculture sector in Poland is likely to
    be most affected by more frequent and more severe droughts in the future (an incidence three times
    higher in the next three decades than in the past three decades), with the worst effects in
    Wielkopolskie voivodeship, Kujawy, and Central Poland. Other projected impacts on agriculture are
    changes in cropping seasons and incidence of more severe weather events. Livestock may face
    shortages of feed in holdings and a rise in prices while the increase in very hot days will increase the
    risk of heat stress, reducing productivity. Small farmers are particularly vulnerable. Poland is
    currently lacking a comprehensive risk and water management framework in agriculture, to help
    farmers build resilience and address risks. Insurance subsidy is the main tool used, but insurance
    coverage is low (10–12 percent of agricultural producers and 25 percent of croplands) despite its
    mandatory nature for farmers receiving direct payments under the EU’s Common Agricultural
    Policy (because penalties are not strictly enforced). These low insurance coverages might increase in
    the future following the law amendments in 2016–17. Such compensation can complement public
    response in case of catastrophic risks or disasters occurring in agriculture. Beyond an improved
    safety net for farmers, the challenge of climate change may require investments to modernize and
    rehabilitate existing irrigation systems and promote water-efficient agriculture and high-efficiency
    irrigation systems. Such investments will also contribute to rural development and poverty
    alleviation. Though the economy is gradually moving away from agriculture, the sector remains
    important for employment and will remain so for some years, ensuring that adaptation to a changing
    climate will continue to be important for the rural poor in the foreseeable future.

Governance for Growth and Equity

280. A key requisite to confront the growth, inclusion, and sustainability challenges presented
    throughout this diagnostic is governance. In particular, policies in all of the areas discussed so far
    will be effective in promoting growth and enhancing equity only if they are able to sustain consensus
    over time, generate common expectations among actors, and foster compliance. One of the three
    main goals set in the recently adopted “Responsible Development Strategy” is an “Efficient state and
    economic institutions supporting growth and social and economic inclusion” (Ministry of Economic
    Development 2016). To sustain growth over time, policies need to create an environment where
    individuals and firms feel secure to invest their assets in productive activities and have the incentives
    to use them efficiently. Also, policies should help coordinate investments decisions to prevent
    underdevelopment, by clearly pointing to a common objective. To improve on social and economic
    inclusion, policies should foster citizens’ willingness to cooperate and contribute to public goods
    (such as through taxation), which is essential to being able to provide high-quality services, such as
    health, education, or connectivity, and to ensure access to economic opportunities. Moreover, for
    individuals to realize the returns of such investment, they need access to economic opportunities in
    adulthood, especially access to opportunities that allow them to use the human capital that they
    acquired.

    implementation over time requires litigation resolution that is efficient and timely.

282. Inefficiencies in the judiciary system are more salient at the local level, and the courts’
    performance varies widely in different cities, despite having the same national legal
    framework. Lower courts are widely considered to work inefficiently. In particular, the subnational
    Doing Business in Poland report points out the wide regional variation in the efficiency of local
    courts for starting a new business, registering properties, and resolving disputes (World Bank
    2015a). Starting a new business takes on average one month, but it can take as long as 42 days in
    Szczecin, or just 8 days in Poznań (as opposed to an EU average of 11.6 days). Compared with the
    EU average of 4.45 percent of property value, Poland is inexpensive when it comes to registering
    property, but the time it takes to do so varies widely. For example, registering property in Białystok
    takes only 18 days and costs 0.35 percent of property value. On the other hand, it can take as long as
    51 days in Wrocław.

283. Tackling corruption is another priority to improve the efficiency of the market. As an
    economy advances, corruption becomes costlier because it restricts the functioning of the market
    (World Bank 2017b). According to estimates from Freedom House’s 2016 Nations in Transit (NIT)
    report, corruption and nepotism remain important issues in Polish public life (Freedom House 2016).
    A September 2016 NIT poll revealed that 67 percent of Poles believe corruption is a serious
    problem, although 83 percent had not heard about any incidents in their local environments in 2015.
    According to respondents, the most corrupt occupations are doctors (65 percent), referees (59
    percent), ministers of parliament (56 percent), and self-government council members and local
    government officials at various levels (55 percent). Least likely to be corrupt in the public eye are
    teachers (31 percent) and bank clerks (35 percent). According to the Gallup World Poll, perception
    of corruption in government in Poland has decreased from 78 percent to 61 percent between 2014
    and 2016, but it has been consistently higher than the averages for EU (60 percent) and OECD
    countries (62 percent) since 2006. Similarly, the perception of corruption within business has
    decreased from 77 percent to 65 percent between 2014 and 2016, but it has been consistently higher
    than the averages for EU (61 percent) and OECD countries (60 percent). Regional differences are
    important also in this respect: 29.2 percent of firms in the South-Western region think they are
    expected to give gifts to secure government contract, as opposed to 0 percent in the Eastern region.
    Also, 25.9 percent of firms in the Central region believe they are expected to give gifts to public
    officials “to get things done,” as opposed to just 6.7 percent in South-Western region.


New Coordination Effort Needed to Encourage Investments

284. The process of EU accession provided a clear coordination device that helped the country’s
    fast development during the past decade. EU membership increases the attractiveness of
    countries, because it signals their political and economic maturity and—given the predictability and
    of EU law and regulations—their adequacy to EU standards. In fact, EU accession supported foreign
    direct investment (FDI) inflows and meant a sizable inflow of EU Structural Funds, linked to
    predictable development strategies under the acquis communautaire.

285. Today, a new coordination effort is needed to encourage investments in advanced
    technologies that will enable the country to move up in global value chains and to comply with
    international targets. As the World Development Report 2017 underlines (World Bank 2017b), the
    creation of new institutions needed to transition to higher income levels may be stymied by vested
    interests, who gained during the previous stages of development enough power to block changes that



                                                  158
    may threaten their position. For entrepreneurs to be interested in transition toward the model of
    creating competitive advantages based on the improved products, services, and processes (Republic
    of Poland 2016, 24), institutions need to generate common expectations among all actors.
    Nevertheless, corresponding with a unitary vision and growth strategy at the national level (well
    epitomized by the Responsible Development Strategy or in the National Reform Program) must be
    (a) a limited coordination effort at lower levels of the administration and between ministries, and (b)
    the prevalence of a culture of departmentalism (Bertelsmann Stiftung 2016, 23). For instance, the
    level of engagement of local and regional authorities in national policy dialogue remains limited.
    This disconnect risks generating confusion and bewildering firms and investors in general.

286. The broad adoption of renewable energy sources will require coordinated efforts, but it
    could enhance the innovation potential of Polish firms and steer growth toward a more
    sustainable model. “Green growth” is about making growth processes resource-efficient, cleaner,
    and more resilient, and its advantages have been documented in terms of preventing environmental
    degradation, correcting market failures, and improving individual well-being. Nevertheless, as
    stressed by the World Development Report 2017, switching to greener growth strategies could
    impose short-term costs on some groups in society (World Bank 2017b). Such groups may have an
    oversize influence in the policy decision process and might be able to block reforms and undermine
    commitment. This is because the costs of a potential reform are concentrated, while the benefits
    from cleaner technologies are intangible and disperse. As discussed in this chapter, Poland relies on
    coal as a primary source of energy, which delivers guarantees low energy prices and independence
    from importing natural gas or oil from other countries. Changing to a green growth path would
    therefore require commitment from the government and the creation of a broad consensus among
    citizens.


Improving Trust to Ensure Cooperation and Compliance

287. To the extent that actors affected by policies are excluded from their design or that specific
    groups benefit disproportionately, trust in institutions will be weakened, possibly leading to a
    breakdown of cooperation and regional differences. Poland has some way to go in terms of
    building trust and enhancing the performance of its public services. Delivering public services of
    good quality is the prerequisite to ensure compliance. Low quality of services, on the other hand,
    prompts the upper middle class to demand private services, which in turn weakens their willingness
    to fiscally cooperate and contribute to the provision of public goods. A recurring finding in various
    chapters of this Systematic Country Diagnostic, is that the responsiveness of the state is not
    homogeneous across regions in the country (see Box 4.1).

Map B4.1.1 shows the different levels of state presence, as measured in terms of the quality of public
services provided in each region. In particular, we focus here on health, education, and sewerage (as a
proxy for service delivery). Quality of health services is approximated by the incidence of death caused
by ischemic heart diseases. Notice that it is renown that after a heart attack, the fastest the medical
attention the better the probability of survival (see, for example, Perkins et al. 2015). Quality of the
education system is approximated by the incidence of early leavers from education and training.
Quality of service delivery is approximated by the share of population connected to wastewater
collection and treatment systems.

 288. Building trust is key to increasing the efficiency of the state and the economic institutions
     supporting growth and equity. Trust is related to positive outcomes in terms of economic growth
     as well as government performance (World Bank 2017b). It may refer to trust among individuals
     (interpersonal trust) or trust in organizations, rules, and the mechanisms to enforce them
     (institutional trust). Different sources of data show that Poland is characterized by a low level of
     both interpersonal and institutional trust. According the latest available data from the World Values
     Survey, only one in four individuals in Poland believe that most people can be trusted, as opposed to
     more than 50 percent of individuals in Chile or 45 percent of respondents in Germany (Figure
     4.15).64 The country experienced a sharp decline in interpersonal trust during the mid-1990s but has
     improved more recently, with the share of respondents saying that most people can be trusted
     increasing by 4 percentage points since the second half of the 2000s. As for institutional trust,
     Poland had a remarkable lack of trust in the national parliament by comparison with both the EU-28
     countries and the other benchmark countries chosen for this analysis (Figure 4.16). Notice, however,
     that this low level of trust in the national parliament or government accompanies higher confidence
     in the EU than that of other EU-28 countries.

    But to continue delivering
    health and education services, as well as all other public functions, the government needs to create
    an environment of trust to prevent citizens from opting out from public services and exiting—
    reducing their tax compliance and switching to private service providers.


Citizen Engagement Needed for Legitimacy

291. Civil participation, in its different forms, has a critical role in driving the process of societal
    transformation and institutional change. What policies are chosen is as important as the policy
    process that is followed, to ensure the buy-in of different actors and avoid lack of compliance.
    Traditions of civil society are strong in Poland. The emergence of a true civil society had much to do
    with the events surrounding the founding and consolidation of the Solidarity trade union during
    1980–81. The democratic transition provided impetus for the development and mushrooming of civil
    society organizations: the number of organizations has grown exponentially over 25 years in Poland.
    However, the level of civic participation is not high: only 32 percent of Poles are actively involved,
    whereas, according to the Eurobarometer survey of all EU member states, almost half of all
    respondents (45 percent) reported membership in civil society organizations in 2013. In addition,
    civil engagement through voting is low. In the most recent parliamentary elections (October 2015),
    only 50.9 percent of the 30,629,150 registered voters cast their ballots. In previous elections (2011
    and 2007), voter turnout was, respectively, 48 percent and 53 percent. According to the OECD,
    Poland ranks 34th out of 38 countries on voter turnout—better than 37th-place Chile (with a turnout
    of 49.3 percent) but worse than countries like France, Germany, or Italy (where turnout is above 70
    percent).

    have a strong effect on the development priorities of regional governments. Most large-scale projects
    are funded by the EU, and local and regional governments predominantly consider investments that
    fit within the EU framework. Overall, European funds reach the lagging regions in the country
    (Figure 4.20)—although, as mentioned in Chapter 2, companies seem to have a substantial influence
    on allocation from the regional to the municipal level. Adjusting priorities and requirements to
    comply with EU funding disbursement has a major effect on investments and regional development
    policies. A good example is the Cohesion Fund policy investments that prioritize lagging regions.
    For instance, in Podkarpackie and Świętokrzyskie, most of the EU investments went into transport
    infrastructure and innovation and entrepreneurship support, which were priority areas defined by the
    EU (Sivaev 2017). However there has been only a limited amount of EU investment in skills and
    education, which appear to be instead an important focus in the lagging regions.


Priorities for Sustainability

294. The requisites for sustainable development include fiscal, social, and environmental
    sustainability as well as governance for growth and equity. This Diagnostic has described two
    pathways toward shared prosperity so far: transitioning to an innovation-led growth model and
    ensuring access to income-generating opportunities. Ensuring fiscal, social, and environmental
    sustainability is a prerequisite to shared prosperity and sustainable development. Achieving these
    objectives depends on effective policies that sustain a consensus over time, generate common
    expectations among actors, and foster compliance.

295. Long-term fiscal and social sustainability will depend on the consensus that can be reached
    around the social protection system going forward. In particular, the recent decision to roll back
    the retirement age will have negative impacts on labor force participation, pension adequacy, and
    budget expenditures. As a consequence of low replacement rates, projected pensions are projected to
    be low enough that people will have an incentive to claim disability pensions, with impacts on labor
    force participation and creation of additional fiscal pressures. Moreover, the proposed increases in
    voluntary savings will be insufficient to mitigate these impacts. For men, additional savings of about
    7 percent of wages throughout the worker’s whole career would be needed to achieve replacement
    rates similar to those expected before the change in the retirement age. The situation for women is
    much worse: 11 percent additional savings would be needed just to compensate for the retirement
    age rollback by 2060, but 17–18 percent in savings would be needed to ensure a 60 percent
    replacement rate. Given this may be too much to tolerate, retirement ages for women will have to
    increase to ensure adequate replacement rates in the future.

296. Poland’s main environmental sustainability challenge is the need to transition to a low-
    emissions economy—a goal intertwined with other environmental objectives such as cleaner
    air, better water management, and adaptation to a changing climate through improved
    resilience. The existing coal-based energy mix, fast-rising transport emissions, and insufficient
    energy efficiency are the main challenges to lowering GHG emissions in line with EU obligations. In
    addition, air quality is not yet at European norms, and moving to lower emissions will also assist
    with reducing air pollution. Adapting to a changing climate will require dealing with substantial
    uncertainty, but the dual challenges for Poland are likely to be increased severity of weather and
    reduced water availability, imposing the greatest harm on the agriculture sector and requiring
    reforms and investments in both water and agriculture.



                                                  165
297. Policies are effective in promoting growth and enhancing equity if they sustain consensus
    over time, generate common expectations among actors, and foster compliance. A more
    efficient judiciary system is of utmost importance to secure a safe environment for investors and
    sustain growth. Although the process of EU integration provided a clear coordination device, a new
    coordination effort is needed to encourage investments in new technologies that will enable the
    country to move up global value chains and to comply with international targets. Exclusion from
    policy design or disproportionate benefits for specific groups will weaken trust in institutions. If not
    addressed, low levels of trust may lead to a breakdown of cooperation and compliance, in turn
    hindering the capacity of the state to provide quality service and starting a vicious circle. Making
    information available through transparency initiatives is an important first step toward increasing
    accountability, which can help to create a new political consensus on the need for continued reforms
    and foster civic engagement.

Chapter 5: Policy Priorities and Actions

Introduction

298. Poland is in many respects a development success story, making tremendous progress
    toward EU income levels. Poland’s growth was fast and stable—driven by productivity increases;
    accompanied by the establishment and strengthening of pro-competitive institutions and market-
    oriented upgrading of human capital; and underpinned by reasonably good macroeconomic
    management. In addition, Poland’s economic growth pattern has been inclusive, leading to a
    substantial reduction in poverty and stronger-than-average income growth for the bottom 40 percent
    of the distribution. Equality of opportunity, competitive markets, and solid institutions have
    combined to produce Poland’s success. Moreover, Poland significantly improved its environmental
    performance, and economic growth has been decoupled from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
    energy and water use, and some health-damaging pollutants.

299. However, Poland now faces new challenges. The most important structural change has to do
    with the very rapid and deep demographic change, which will pose labor market and fiscal
    challenges while straining the health care and pension systems and overall fiscal and social
    sustainability. Second, recent global developments suggest low potential for productivity
    improvements as well as a slowdown in innovation and adoption in converging markets such as
    Poland. Third, technological improvements are likely to change the nature of labor markets,
    affecting relative returns to skills and capital and thus potentially leading to a polarization of
    incomes. If, in addition to this structural trend, there is a downturn in economic dynamics, horizontal
    inequalities would become more salient given the lingering disparities in access to opportunities and
    labor market and social exclusion among vulnerable groups. Finally, agglomeration and income
    growth put pressure on natural resource management and overall environmental sustainability.

300. These challenges will affect each of the pillars of shared prosperity: growth, inclusion, and
    sustainability. Confronting them—while at the same time making progress on shared
    prosperity—will require a more strategic, effective, and accountable state. The intrinsic idea of
    the “shared prosperity” goal is to raise the well-being of the poorer segments of every society in
    every period, which requires a dynamic process of economic growth that is inclusive of the poor and
    promotes sustainability. The pathways discussed include (a) increasing productivity through an
    innovation-led growth model and an enabling environment; (b) investing in people, ensuring that
    they can engage productively, and guaranteeing their mobility; and (c) ensuring the fiscal,
    environmental, and social sustainability of policies. This chapter aims to summarize the key
    priorities and lay out some of the crucial areas for policy action.


Identifying Priority Areas

301. The set of priorities through which Poland can be expected to have the biggest impact in
    accelerating progress toward the twin goals have been chosen using the following criteria:




                                                   167
          Impact on goals over the medium term: This will assess the potential impact on the twin goals of
           reducing poverty and increasing the welfare of the bottom 40 percent.
          Time horizon of impacts: This will assess the possible time frame for realizing the expected
           impact, identifying low-hanging fruits, and striking a balance between short- and long-term
           impacts.
          Complementarities: This would look at the degree to which an identified opportunity in one area
           will have possible positive impacts on other constraints.
          Evidence base: More weight will be given to areas where the evidence base is stronger.

    302. A three-step process was used to determine policy priorities and actions. First, the country
        team proposed a long list of constraints on progress toward inclusive growth and poverty reduction.
        Second, the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) core team identified the top three policy priorities
        for each pathway by applying filters to the list of constraints to take into account impact on the twin
        goals, timing and sequencing, complementarities between actions, and the strength of the evidence
        base.

    303. The SCD team also built on an extensive internal and external consultation process. The
        objective from the conceptual stage of the SCD onward was to get advice from experts in Poland and
        the World Bank as a whole on areas of emphasis and, as the work progressed, on the emerging
        storyline and main messages. These discussions identified a number of knowledge gaps (Box 5.1).

                           Box 5.1 Knowledge Gaps to Be Addressed in the Future

•      Economy-wide impact of reducing labor market duality
•      Mechanisms to smooth shifts in public investment and EU funds absorption
•      Diagnostic of labor shortages where migrants could play an important role
•      Regional transfer formulas, including whether it would make sense to condition regional EU funds on
       performance and on ways to further interconnect administrative regions
•      The impact of the Common Agricultural Policy on mobility out of agriculture
•      Systematic review of housing policy instruments
•      Impact evaluations of labor market interventions

Priority Areas and Links to Shared Prosperity

    304. To ensure shared prosperity, Poland will need a renewed social consensus and a more
        strategic, effective, and accountable state. As summarized in Figure 5.1, to transition toward an
        innovation-led growth model, Poland will need a commitment to competition and improvement in
        product market regulations, more-strategic public investment, and sound macro policies and
        effective fiscal management. To meet the demographic challenge and catch up in the race between
        technical progress and skills while enhancing inclusion, Poland will need to improve equitable
        access to high-quality health and education services, promote activation, and reduce barriers to
        mobility. To ensure fiscal and social sustainability, it will need to ensure that pensions are adequate,



                                                        168
    while environmental sustainability will require commitment to transitioning to a low-emissions
    economy and improved water management. Progress in each of these areas will require consistency
    and commitment to sound policies, coordination between public and private actors, and improved
    trust in government to ensure private sector cooperation. This will only be possible if Poland can
    achieve a renewed social consensus and a more strategic, effective, and accountable state.

                                  Figure 5.1. Pathways to Shared Prosperity




305. Based on the analysis in this report, Table 5.1 sets out nine priority areas and articulates
    how advances in these areas are expected to affect progress toward shared prosperity and
    poverty reduction in a sustainable way over the next five years. During this period, the
    implementation of policy priorities is expected to set the course for progress, although not all
    objectives will necessarily be accomplished within the five-year time frame. The full impact of many
    of these interventions might be achieved in the longer term. However, in many cases, important
    measures need to be put in place urgently to set Poland on the path toward progress in addressing the
    challenges ahead and taking advantage of the current window of opportunity before EU funding
    begins to decline.

306. There are important interlinkages between these areas. Action in some of the priority areas
    will have important complementarities elsewhere. For instance, improved workforce skills will help
    to increase labor force participation and thus generate a more competitive product market, while at
    the same time improving the income-generating potential of the population, thus enhancing
    inclusion. Similarly, increasing labor force participation will help to ensure the sustainability of the
    pension system and address potential labor shortages that could curtail growth. Removing barriers in
    markets and trade, such as through improvements in the functions of the judiciary, would improve
    productivity and have an important effect on inclusion. Each of the priority areas is summarized
    below.

Priorities to Boost Productivity Growth

307. Enhance competition by reducing state control, opening to trade and investment, and
    removing barriers to entrepreneurship and private sector investment. This will require fostering
    an enabling regulatory environment; improving the efficiency of the judiciary; and ensuring the
    predictability, consistency, and transparency of policies. Poland’s regulatory environment suffers
    from discrepancies between laws on the books and the performance of laws in practice, limiting the
    effectiveness of institutions in preventing coordination failures. Late payments, slow administration
    proceedings, excessive reporting requirements, and frequent changes in regulations also surface in
    surveys of Polish businesses. Product markets retain some anticompetitive features such as state
    control and restrictions in retail trade. Improving the predictability of regulations should also help to
    limit uncertainty, an increasingly important concern for businesses. Moreover, enforcing contracts is
    difficult given long delays in the courts. A more efficient judiciary system is of utmost importance to
    secure a safe environment for investors and sustain growth. Bolstering innovation will also require
    balancing the need for greater labor market flexibility and strategic openness to migration with
    improved job security. Finally, financing innovation will require diversification of the financial
    sector through capital markets development and development of venture capital.

308. Shift to a more strategic public investment policy, improving the efficiency of EU funds and
    enhancing R&D policy. This will require investing in growth-enhancing sectors, including
    universities and research centers, and using a long-term life-cycle approach to managing and
    financing transport and ICT infrastructure. It will also require using financial instruments (instead of
    grants) to improve efficiency of EU funds, enabling reinvestment, leveraging private resources, and
    providing incentives for better performance. Finally, R&D policy should be streamlined, and the
    focus of investment should be on basic research.

309. Ensure sound macro policies to reduce uncertainty, including through rule-based fiscal
    consolidation aimed at increasing domestic savings, a simplified and upgraded tax system, and
    more efficient public spending. Sound fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies, along with
    prudent financial supervision are sine qua non conditions to boost investment. Fiscal rules have
    contributed to stability of the Polish public finance, and their credibility needs to be preserved. In
    light of expected weaker inflows of foreign investments and the prospects of lower inflows of EU
    funds after 2020, higher domestic savings will be necessary, and the public sector could play an
    exemplary role. Moreover, Poland has room to strengthen its budget institutions and fiscal
    management to assure higher-quality of public finance, on both the public spending and revenue
    sides.


Priorities to Enhance Inclusion

310. Improve skills of the workforce—ensuring equal opportunities across income deciles and
    regions—and enhance the quality and relevance of education and training throughout the life
    cycle. Reducing the existing skills divide, and improving the quality and relevance of education
    provision and adult learning possibilities, will be needed to ensure shared prosperity. This effort will
    require promoting early childhood education and ensuring equal access throughout the country.
    Moreover, given increased demand for skills driven by technological change, there is a need for the

                                                    171
    educational systems to adapt, fostering the skills required to perform nonroutine tasks and
    socioemotional and higher-order cognitive skills. Given demographic changes, the high
    concentration of older workers in routine jobs, and the overall growing importance of continuous
    skill acquisition of individuals in an innovating economy, shared prosperity will also depend on
    greater efforts to make lifelong and on-the-job training more accessible and relevant. This will
    require concerted efforts by education providers, the private sector, and the government. Higher
    education institutions could play a stronger role in collaborating with the private sector and the
    government to ensure increased access to demand-responsive training, expanding access to a more
    diverse student population, and adapting support services to the needs and living conditions of
    learners. Strong engagement from the private sector is required to ensure that programs are aligned
    with employers’ skill demand. Public sector facilitation of such processes will be required,
    establishing framework conditions that promote the higher education institutions’ engagement in
    adult education and cooperation among key stakeholders, as well as providing targeted support to
    higher education institutions. This includes advancing the legislative framework and designing key
    components of the higher education sector accordingly—namely, quality assurance approaches
    including accreditation, academic promotion systems, and funding schemes.

311. Improve access and quality of health care services. Poland needs to do more to boost health
    outcomes to prepare for the aging of its population. Poland already faces higher mortality and
    morbidity rates than its peers, low affordability due to expensive drugs, and access to care that still
    depends on individual circumstances. Long waiting times result from poor coordination,
    fragmentation, and low and inefficient spending. Given the expected increase in health care costs
    due to population aging, policies and investments are needed to promote improved health outcomes
    while containing costs. This will require improving coordination and reducing fragmentation of
    responsibilities and accountability across levels of government, increasing human and financial
    resources devoted to health, and improving the efficiency of spending through regional and national
    strategic planning. It will also require capacity building for physicians, nurses, and medical
    personnel as well as health system managers. Finally, improved health outcomes will require
    strengthening prevention and health promotion.

312. Increase labor force participation through improved quality and availability of child and
    elderly care services. This will require ensuring that people are not unwillingly excluded from the
    labor market, but more importantly it will require that cross-sectoral policies are well coordinated to
    provide strong incentives to work, particularly for women, such as through concerted efforts to
    increase the availability of childcare and long-term care. Moreover, it will require that social
    protection policies are consistent with this objective by reducing labor disincentive effects.
    Reforming the support system for families with children could improve its effectiveness, address
    work incentives, and reduce fragmentation, while at the same time ensuring consistency with respect
    to households with special characteristics. At the same time, ensuring that activation and
    employment services are more employer-oriented, focused on active job seekers, and accountable for
    results could go a long way toward reducing labor exclusion. Formalizing and operationalizing
    coordination among agencies that provide services to vulnerable populations is critical to ensure
    delivery of a package of integrated services to improve their chances of getting and keeping a job.

313. Reduce labor market barriers by simplifying labor regulations, improving the management
    of road and rail infrastructure, and ensuring affordable housing. To reduce labor market
    segmentation while at the same time guaranteeing labor market flexibility, a reduction in

                                                   172
    administrative burdens and implicit costs associated with permanent labor contracts will be needed.
    Labor market segmentation could be reduced by making all contracts subject to the same tax and
    social contributions regime, simplifying and better communicating labor regulations, streamlining
    legal dismissal procedures, limiting the use of temporary contracts, and strengthening social
    protection. Notably, an individualized type of targeted job and social assistance program could help
    to include those who may otherwise be left out. In addition, other potential barriers to mobility
    include agricultural and social policies that provide incentives for farmers to remain in the
    agricultural sector. While knowledge gaps remain, to the extent that there are disincentives for
    farmers to move to more productive and better-paying jobs, these should be removed. In addition,
    judicial and regulatory barriers could prevent mobility by restricting land use and potentially limiting
    the sale of farm property. A systematic review of the range of housing policy instruments and
    barriers to transferring land could be helpful in identifying regulations that are inconsistent with
    improving internal mobility. Similarly, improvements in the management of regional road and rail
    infrastructure could substantially enhance mobility and access to labor markets. In particular,
    structural reforms are needed to rebalance existing EU funding toward regional and local networks
    and improve the capacity, safety, and sustainability of the current system by securing additional
    revenues for road and rail maintenance beyond 2020.


Priorities to Ensure Sustainability

314. Fiscal and social sustainability of the pensions system will require promotion of private
    pension savings and longer working lives, particularly for women. The recent decision to roll
    back the retirement age will have negative impacts on labor force participation, pension adequacy,
    and budget expenditures. As a consequence of low replacement rates, pension benefits are projected
    to be so low that people will have an incentive to claim disability pensions instead of old-age
    pensions within the next five years, with impacts on labor force participation and the budget. The
    proposed increase in voluntary savings will be insufficient to mitigate these impacts. For men,
    additional savings of about 7 percent of wages throughout the worker’s career would be needed to
    achieve replacement rates that are similar to those expected prior to the rollback in the retirement
    age. The situation for women is much worse: as much as 11 percent in additional savings per year
    would be needed just to compensate for the retirement age rollback by 2060, but an additional 17–18
    percent savings would be needed to ensure a 60 percent replacement rate. Given that this may be too
    much to tolerate, retirement ages for women will likely need to increase to ensure adequate
    replacement rates in the future.

315. Environmental sustainability requires managing the transition to a low-emissions economy
    and strengthening water management. The existing coal-based energy mix, an aging power
    infrastructure, and potential water scarcity as well as other impacts from a changing climate pose
    complex risks for environmental sustainability. Risks related to energy include stranded public
    assets, power shortages, and energy affordability for the bottom income deciles as global and EU
    climate action becomes more pronounced. Air quality is not yet at European norms, and moving to
    lower emissions would assist with air quality, in particular switching from coal to natural gas for
    heating. Meeting these challenges will require developing and implementing a coherent long-term
    energy sector strategy that is consistent with the overarching environmental sustainability goals,
    balances the mix of domestic resources and diverse imports, and firmly supports end-use energy
    efficiency improvement. Adapting to a changing climate requires dealing with substantial
    uncertainty, but the dual challenges for Poland are likely to be increased severity of weather and

                                                   173
    reduced water availability. Managing these risks will require continued investments in flood
    management and an improved governance and institutional framework as well as investments in
    modernizing and rehabilitating existing water systems and promotion of high-efficiency systems.

316. A renewed social consensus and a new, more strategic, effective, and accountable state will
    be needed to achieve shared prosperity in Poland. Although the process of EU integration
    provided a clear coordination device, a new coordination effort is now needed to encourage
    investments in new technologies that will allow the country to enhance its productivity, ensure that
    vulnerable groups are included in the growth process, and foster an inclusive growth process that is
    sustainable and complies with international targets. Just as important as achieving these goals will be
    the process that is undertaken to get there. Efforts to ensure inclusion and accountability in the
    policy design are needed to build trust in institutions. Without this trust, it will be difficult to secure
    cooperation from private agents that can in turn ensure the capacity of the state to provide quality
    service delivery and ensure effective policies in the long run.

Appendix A: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis for Poland

Public debt remains sustainable in the medium term. Public debt climbed to 54.4 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) in 2016, from 51 percent in 2015, due to slower growth and foreign exchange
(FX) depreciation. However, public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain below the standard risk
thresholds in the medium term. In our baseline scenario, we expect public debt to reach 54.1 percent of
GDP in 2018 before stabilizing through 2021. The debt dynamics are driven by primary deficit, growth,
real interest rate, and FX rate. Primary deficit is expected increase to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2018 and the
next years from 0.8 percent to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2016–17 and to contribute to a higher debt
throughout the projection period. The FX depreciation is expected to contribute negatively before
disappearing in 2018. The slowdown in GDP growth reduced the positive contribution to debt dynamics
in 2016. However, the difference between the projected GDP growth and the real interest rate will
become favorable starting in 2017, thanks to recovering growth and gradually falling real interest rates.
Public debt profile is resilient to macro-fiscal shocks. Although the baseline scenario is subject to
several downside risks, the debt ratio remains below the risk thresholds under various risk scenarios.
Public debt profile is resilient to interest rate, foreign currency, and fiscal risks. A negative shock to GDP
growth represents the main downside risk on the debt outlook. For example, a drop in GDP growth by 1.9
percentage points in two consecutive years relative to the baseline, combined with a 0.5 percentage point
drop in inflation and deterioration in the primary balance by 0.9 percentage point in 2017 and a further 1.9
percentage points in 2018, would derail the trajectory and increase the projected public debt level in 2018
to 59.5 percent of GDP before gradually easing to 59.3 percent of GDP by 2021.
Recent debt sustainability analysis highlights risks associated with the rise in short-term debt and
the share of public debt held by nonresidents. After dropping to 8.7 percent in 2013, the share of short-
term debt reached 13.3 percent in 2015 and then fell to 10.7 percent in 2016, which reduced the rollover
risk. The share of public debt held by nonresidents reached 58.6 percent in 2014 (one-off statistical effect
of the cancellation of part of the debt held by the open pension system), and then gradually decreased to
53.4 percent in 2016. The investor base remains diversified. Still, this quite significant participation of
foreign investors in the bond market makes it sensitive to changes in the global investor sentiment.

Appendix B: Sources of Labor Productivity Gains in Poland, 2004 –
14

The analysis of labor productivity trends in the past decade suggests that further improvements are
more likely to come from within-industry gains than from structural reallocation. Labor productivity
of the whole economy increased by 24.3 percent during 2004 to 2014 and can be decomposed into
interindustry reallocation of labor and productivity changes within sectors (figure B.1). In the period
2004–09, labor productivity rose by 7 percent and in the following period, 2009–14, by more than double
that rate: 16.1 percent. Aggregate labor productivity growth can be decomposed into the effects of (a)
interindustry reallocation of labor, and (b) changes in labor productivity in individual industries. The
decomposition was performed following the methodology proposed by Harrison, Horridge, and Pearson
(2000) using the data for 45 industries, while results have been aggregated for presentation purposes.
Sources of labor productivity growth differed significantly between the two five-year subperiods
(2004–09 versus 2009–14), and structural labor reallocation played a major role only during the
first years after European Union (EU) accession, with manufacturing being the main driver. As
shown in Figure B.1, approximately four-fifths of the growth in 2004–09 was attributed to changes in the
structure of employment—that is, net flow of labor from low- to high-productivity industries—while
productivity changes within industries largely canceled out. But in 2009–14, the shifts in employment
structure contributed only one-seventh to the overall labor productivity increase. Contributions of
productivity growth within manufacturing industries (indicated by gray bars) constituted 3.3 percentage
points in 2004–09 and 5.1 percentage points in 2009–14. The largest contributions from individual
manufacturing industries (1.0–1.5 percent) came from food, beverages, and tobacco, as well as
manufacture of metal products. It is worth mentioning that these contributions to aggregate labor
productivity depend not only on the rate of productivity growth in a given sector, but also on its share in
total employment.
Productivity improvements in selected sectors other than manufacturing—trade, health,
construction, and agriculture—played an important role, too. These sectors combined contributed 5.9
percentage points to aggregate productivity growth in 2004–14 (though construction experienced
productivity losses during the first five years of this period, followed by a strong rebound in the next five
years). These efficiency gains resulted from both a reduction of previous excess employment (for
example, a 27 percent decline in agriculture employment) and technical and organizational improvements
at the firm level.
Some sectors—mining and some public services—recorded labor productivity losses. Mining
contributed negatively (−1.5 percentage points) in 2004–14. Negative contributions were also recorded in
some service sectors such as selected professional activities, public administration, and education. Also,
the negative contributions of individual industries to aggregate productivity are clearly more pronounced
in the first half of the analyzed period.

Appendix C: Migration Patterns and Existing Arrangements

Following Poland’s accession to the European              Figure C.1. Number of Polish Migrants Abroad,
Union (EU), outward migration flows rose                          by Destination Type, 2004–15
steeply. EU membership granted Polish citizens
                                                          2,500
access to employment and residence within the
Schengen area, resulting in an outward flow that          2,000
quickly multiplied in magnitude: between 2004             1,500
and 2015, the number of emigrants went up from 1
                                                          1,000
million to 2.4 million, with the latter being
equivalent to about 6.2 percent of the population           500
(Figure C.1).66 The scale of outmigration during              0
this period is deemed to be the country’s second-
largest economic migration wave since the Polish
emigration to the United States in the late 19th and                          non-EU EU
early 20th century. It is one of the largest among

estimated to have left the country since EU accession (World Bank 2016). In contrast to popular
perceptions, there was no massive outflow of health care workers post-accession; however, certain
specialized and highly skilled health professions were much more likely to migrate, such as
anesthesiologists, radiologists, and plastic surgeons (World Bank 2016), and the risk of outflows of
skilled workers from other sectors remains.
Although desirable, significant return migration is unlikely. As Poland solidifies its status as a high-
income country, wage differentials (which are the fundamental drivers of economic migration) will
narrow over time. Although this narrowing may also slow down further outmigration, international
experience argues that few migrants will permanently return from overseas. There is evidence that
suggests that even though emigrants tend to work in jobs for which they are overqualified, their
compensation levels are still higher than those they would receive back home (Brandt and Sicari 2016).67
In fact, there is little evidence of significant return migration so far (EC 2017a), and a recent survey
conducted in the four most popular destination countries showed that a large number of Polish migrants to
those countries had intentions to stay permanently (Brandt 2016). With the most popular destination for
Polish emigrants—the United Kingdom—planning an exit from the EU, the question of what form of
agreement will be reached between the United Kingdom and the EU (or Poland, for that matter) on labor

66
      It should be noted that because of transitional arrangements, only three EU member states granted immediate
     access to their labor markets at the time of accession in 2004: Ireland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Poles
     were allowed to work in five additional countries by the end of 2006. Germany allowed free access in May 2011.
     Poland officially entered the Schengen zone in December 2007. The share of Poles residing abroad is much higher
     than that of other new high-income countries, whereas the share of foreign-born individuals residing in Poland is
     among the lowest in international comparisons (World Bank 2016).
67
     A more careful analysis by Kaczmarczyk (2012) suggests, however, that returns to skills are not necessarily
     higher and may potentially be even lower for migrants than for their counterparts in their home country.
     Olszewska (2011) (as cited in Kaczmarczyk [2012]) reaches a similar conclusion.


                                                          178
mobility remains open. However, should the new agreement exclude Poles from access to the British
labor market, there is a good likelihood that Polish emigrants will choose to move on to other advanced
EU countries rather than return to Poland.
In contrast, immigration into Poland has been rising fast, mostly from neighboring Ukraine,
including mostly young male workers going into low-productivity services. The vast majority of the
more than 1 million non-EU foreign workers entering Poland legally in 2016 came from Ukraine,68 rising
sharply from around 200,000 in 2013. These workers from Eastern Partnership countries are eligible for
short-term employment under Poland’s declaration system (Box C.1). About a third of all foreign workers
are located in Mazowieckie, followed by Dolnośląskie, Wielkopolskie, and Małopolskie voivodeships. A
third of work permit holders are employed in construction and transportation and storage, and 10 percent
are employed in professional, scientific, and technical activities. By skill level, 40 percent were skilled
workers, and 25 percent were unskilled workers in 2016. By comparison, about half of declaration
workers are concentrated in agriculture and construction, which is consistent with the program’s aim to
relieve shortages in labor-intensive sectors in which Poles are reluctant to work.69 Consistent with the
sectoral distribution, more than half of declaration workers are employed in unskilled occupations.
Workers employed on the basis of the declaration system are more likely to be male (two-thirds of the
total) and relatively young: more than 70 percent are younger than 40 years old, and a quarter are younger
than 26 years old.
To a great extent, immigrant labor has               Figure C.2. Job Vacancy Rate in Poland, by Sector,
complemented the domestic workforce,                                         2009–16
taking positions that were hard to fill with
Poles and relieving labor shortages.
Available evidence suggests that immigrants
did not negatively affect the labor market
outcomes of Polish workers (Brandt 2016). In
sectors like construction or services,
immigrants relieve rising labor shortages
(Figure C.2). The reason most often cited by
firms for hiring foreign workers is that they
possess specific skills that are difficult to fill
with Polish labor, indicating that the migrant
workforce is complementary to the domestic
workforce (Janicka and Kaczmarczyk 2010).70        Source: World Bank, based on Eurostat data.

68
     About 1.26 million out of the 1.31 million workers who sought employment through the declarations system in
     2016 were Ukrainian (see Box C.1).
69
     The demand for labor in the construction sector is closely linked to the high number of infrastructure investment
     projects cofinanced by EU funding (Duszczyk, Góra, and Kaczmarczyk 2013).
70
     Other possible responses included, among others, shortage of Polish applicants, or foreigners accept more flexible
     employment, accept lower wages, or work harder.

such services was brought about by a rise in living standards (Duszczyk, Góra, and Kaczmarczyk 2013).
Finally, the overall lack of negative labor market consequences is not surprising given the still low
number of immigrants.

                     Box C.1 Current Immigration Arrangements and Patterns
Non-EU foreign nationals can seek legal employment in Poland by either obtaining a work permit or through
the declaration system. Foreign workers seeking a work permit are subject to a labor market test with two
components: (a) the salary offer has to be comparable (up to and no more than 30 percent lower) to the remuneration
offered to Poles performing similar functions; and (b) the employment of the foreign worker should not have a
negative impact on the local labor market (specifically, the opportunities of job seekers registered at the employment
agency). Employers are exempt from the labor market test for a list of jobs and occupations in shortage as
determined by voivodeships. In contrast, the declaration system is a simplified procedure that permits employers to
declare their intent to hire foreign workers from designated Eastern Partnership countries for short-term employment
of less than 6 months (within a period of 12 consecutive months) without applying for a work permit. Eastern
Partnership Countries refer to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. The declaration
system was created in 2006 and initially limited to the agricultural sector but then quickly expanded in the following
year to all sectors for citizens of, Belarus, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine (and additionally for Moldova in
2009 and Georgia in 2010).

Both types of employment permits have risen in recent years. The number of declarations issued hovered around
200,000 until 2013 but exploded in the past few years, with the number exceeding 1.3 million by 2016. Ukrainians
claim almost all declarations: in 2016, their share was 96 percent of all declarations registered (Figure BC.1.1). In
comparison, the total number of work permits issued amounted to fewer than 80,000 in 2016, and although on an
upward trend, the size of the program is much smaller. The share of Ukrainian work permit holders has risen from
32 percent in 2009 to 84 percent in 2016.

Although Poland’s immigration system has helped fill shortages for low-skilled labor, recent
changes in trends require close monitoring to prevent adverse impacts, especially on low-income
Poles. The declaration system appears to have been effective at responding to labor shortages swiftly
while at the same time channeling informal activities into legal forms of labor flow (Duszczyk, Góra, and

                                                        180
Kaczmarczyk 2013). However, the recent explosion in the number of declarations issued should be
followed closely, especially since there is no cap in the number of declarations that can be issued in a
given year.71 Although the increase occurred across all sectors, it was particularly notable for
“administrative and support service activities”: the number of workers multiplied more than 11 times
between 2014 and 2016 in that sector alone. Concurrently, almost all of the increase (85 percent) came
from low-skilled and unskilled workers, who have the potential to compete with the low-income Polish
population.72




71
     Most countries regulate the flow of low-skilled migrants by imposing a ceiling (quantity) or wage floor (price).
72
     The past two years also coincide with the period when Ukraine’s economy contra cted, which may have acted as a
     push factor that affected migration patterns of Ukrainians.
