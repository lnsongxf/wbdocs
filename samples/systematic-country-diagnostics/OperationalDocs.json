Cambodia\n            sustained an average growth rate of 7.6 percent in\n            1994-2015, ranking sixth in the world, and has now become a\n            lower middle-income economy. Cambodia\u2019s success has ridden\n            on employment creation, although labor productivity gains\n            have been lower than in other fast-growing economies, partly\n            due to lower capital intensity. Growth has also been driven\n            to a large extent by the country\u2019s rich and diverse natural\n            capital which supports the livelihoods of millions of\n            Cambodians. Going forward, Cambodia may not be able to rely\n            on the same factors that drove strong growth and poverty\n            reduction over the past two decades. Declining external\n            competitiveness threatens the sustainability of garments and\n            tourism and poses a challenge to economic diversification\n            and moving up the value chain.

Poland has done\n            remarkably well, boasting strong growth over three decades.\n            Looking forward, this Systemic Country Diagnostic (SCD)\n            argues that a new level of sophistication is required to\n            meet the challenges of a rapidly aging population and\n            evolving global economy. This includes developing a more\n            strategic, effective, and accountable state that can\n            facilitate a strong consensus around consistent policies to\n            foster growth, inclusion, and sustainability. Continued\n            productivity growth will depend on Poland\u2019s ability to\n            transition to an innovation-led growth model. This\n            transition, in turn, will require improved consistency and\n            commitment to sound policies, as well as improved\n            coordination between the public and private sectors.\n            Demographic trends make it critical for Poland to invest in\n            its people, ensuring that everyone can participate and\n            benefit from growth. To that end, policies must be\n            consistent\u2014both across sectors and between local and\n            national government institutions\u2014such that every person has\n            equal opportunity, participates in the labor market, and is\n            able to move to where they are most productive. To grow\n            sustainably, a new social consensus will be needed to\n            confront difficult trade-offs between the needs of an aging\n            population and the associated fiscal costs.

The SCD is presented using a slide deck which lays\n            out the analysis and results. This document provides a brief\n            overview of the approach taken, and sets the stage for the\n            SCD. It also provides additional information: six selected\n            supplementary topical notes, and annexes (data diagnostic,\n            summary of consultations, and sources). The framework\n            adopted by the SCD takes as its starting point that\n            Seychelles is a successful, high-income, small island state.\n            The country now seeks to secure the sustainability of its\n            development progress to date, to accelerate this progress,\n            and to address a high level of public concern being\n            reflected in political discourse over disparities in incomes\n            and opportunities. The SCD examines Seychelles\u2019 economic\n            growth characteristics, the characteristics of poverty and\n            income distribution (inclusion), and the risks to\n            environmental, social and macroeconomic sustainability. The\n            approach is systematic in that it attempts to be as\n            comprehensive as possible, within the constraints of the\n            available data, by harnessing the existing evidence and\n            conducting new analysis where feasible, informed by\n            consultations. Finally, the SCD sorts the 13 constraints\n            identified into five top priorities, five additional\n            priorities, and a further three areas which should be\n            considered for priority action, subject to confirmation from\n            additional analysis (\u2018likely priorities\u2019). This\n            prioritization was based on an assessment of how important\n            each constraint was, directly, to meeting the relevant\n            challenge, indirectly, through its potential impact in\n            helping to loosen other constraints (complementarity), the\n            strength of the evidence base on the importance of the\n            constraint, and, finally, the attainability of addressing\n            the constraint (reflecting factors such as cost, technical\n            difficulty and timeframe)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Seychelles -

Systematic country diagnostic"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Fiji is a small island nation in the\n            South Pacific Ocean with population of 870,000.Nevertheless,\n            Fiji has one of the most sophisticated economies among the\n            Pacific Islands. The economy is the second largest in the\n            Pacific after Papua New Guinea, and it is the most\n            industrially advanced, with substantial services and\n            manufacturing sectors.Fiji has not, however, realized its\n            full economic potential.The 2014 election was a turning\n            point for Fiji in many respects. First, the current\n            government was elected with an outright majority and strong\n            cross-ethnic support. Second, the election saw a genuine\n            political debate, with citizens offered a choice between\n            different visions for the future (Frankel 2014). Third, the\n            election, which was declared free and fair by international\n            observers, paved the way for Fiji\u2019s re-engagement with\n            development partners and created a better environment for\n            private investment.Fiji can build on its relatively strong\n            institutions to deliver faster growth and shared\n            prosperity.The government plans to build on its achievements\n            in poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The national\n            development plan is to double real per capita income by\n            2035.The World Bank\u2019s report Pacific Possible sets out\n            several ideas for accelerating growth in Fiji by 2040. Areas\n            of opportunities include tourism, migration, fisheries, deep\n            sea mining, and the knowledge economy.This Strategic Country\n            Diagnostic (SCD) identifies three pathways, as well as\n            cross-cutting issues. (i) Stronger growth; (ii) Better\n            access to services by all; (iii) Building resilience. These\n            three pathways should be supported by cross-cutting efforts\n            to improve governance, that is, to improve policy and the\n            institutional capacity of the public sector to accelerate\n            progress toward the twin goals.However, it continues to face\n            a number of cross-cutting governance challenges.This report\n            has identified many constraints and many possible policy\n            solutions. But not everything can be done at once:\n            priorities need to be selected. In selecting the priorities,\n            this SCD uses three main criteria. The first is whether a\n            policy is a precondition for making progress in pursuing\n            others. The second is whether a policy is expected to have\n            positive spillovers across different domains (e.g., growth,\n            equity, resilience). The third is whether a policy is\n            feasible, that is, it can be implemented in the medium term\n            given cost, capacity, and political feasibility for action."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Fiji - Systematic country diagnostic"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Fiji - Systematic country diagnostic"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2017/06/28013777/fiji-systematic-country-diagnostic","projn":"FJ-Fiji Systematic Country Diagnostics -- P160757","subtopic":"Public Sector Economics,Economic Policy, Institutions and Governance,Consumption,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Economic Growth,Youth and Governance,Government Policies,Economic Conditions and Volatility,Inequality,Industrial Economics,Macro-Fiscal Policy,National Governance,Economic Theory & Research,Public Finance Decentralization and\n            Poverty Reduction,Fiscal & Monetary Policy","docty":"Systematic Country Diagnostic","teratopic":"Industry,Poverty Reduction,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Governance","count":"Fiji","authors":{"authr":"Barbour,Paul Antony"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!Oceania"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!Oceania"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b085025522_1_0"},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Industry,Poverty Reduction,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Governance","seccl":"Public","prdln":"Country Assistance Strategy","majdocty":"Country Focus","owner":"GMF - East Asia and Pacific 2 (GMF10)","projectid":"P160757","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Oceania"},"1":{"geo_region":"Oceania"}},"repnb":"120106"},"27582205":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/210731497458125854/Chile-Transitioning-to-a-prosperous-society","available_in":"English,English","fullavailablein":[{"lang":"English","entityid":"090224b084cb28c8_1_0","node_id":"27582205"}],"url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/210731497458125854/Chile-Transitioning-to-a-prosperous-society","new_url":"2017/06/27582205/Chile-Transitioning-to-a-prosperous-society","guid":"210731497458125854","disclosure_date":"2017-06-14T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2017-06-14T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2017-06-14T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b084c9f394","chronical_docm_id":"090224b084c9f394","txturl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/210731497458125854/text/107903-SCD-PUBLIC-SecM2017-0182.txt","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/210731497458125854/pdf/107903-SCD-PUBLIC-SecM2017-0182.pdf","datestored":"2017-06-14T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2017-06-06T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Chile - Transitioning to a prosperous society"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Three key characteristics help shed\n            light on Chile\u2019s development performance.

This Systematic Country\n            Diagnostic (SCD) takes stock of Chile\u2019s progress and\n            reflects on the constraints and opportunities that the\n            country is encountering as it continues along a path to\n            eradicate extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. The\n            report provides elements to answer three main questions: (1)\n            what are the critical factors driving output and\n            productivity growth? (2) what are the critical factors that\n            determine inclusion? and (3) how sustainable are the current\n            trends in growth and inclusion? The SCD also identifies a\n            select list of priority areas in which the country faces the\n            greatest challenges in advancing toward the World Bank\u2019s\n            twin goals of poverty reduction and sharing prosperity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Transitioning to a prosperous society"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chile - Transitioning to a\n            prosperous society"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2017/06/28100981/chile-transitioning-prosperous-society","topic":"Economic Growth m1326241 471,Economic and Social Mobility m1326259 1152,Competition Economics m1326985 2111,Economic Growth Policy m1327634 1070,Economic Transparency m1327716 331","projn":"CL-Chile Systematic Country Diagnostic -- P157088","subtopic":"Poverty Diagnostics,Competitiveness and Competition Policy,Poverty Impact Evaluation,Economic Growth,Industrial Economics,Economic Policy, Institutions and Governance,Poverty Assessment,Economic Theory & Research,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Small Area Estimation Poverty Mapping,Poverty Lines","docty":"Systematic Country Diagnostic","teratopic":"Industry,Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction","count":"Chile","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08512c1c9_1_0"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"Spanish","historic_topic":"Industry,Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction","prdln":"Country Assistance Strategy","seccl":"Public","topicv3":"Economic Growth m1326241 471,Economic and Social Mobility m1326259 1152,Competition Economics m1326985 2111,Economic Growth Policy m1327634 1070,Economic Transparency m1327716 331","majdocty":"Country Focus","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"society, economic growth, finance, policy, transition"}},"owner":"WB Off:Lima-Andean Countries CMU (LCC6C)","projectid":"P157088","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"107903"},"27520556":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/620151496155751423/Cambodia-Sustaining-strong-growth-for-the-benefit-of-all-a-systematic-country-diagnostic","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/620151496155751423/Cambodia-Sustaining-strong-growth-for-the-benefit-of-all-a-systematic-country-diagnostic","new_url":"2017/08/27520556/Cambodia-Sustaining-strong-growth-for-the-benefit-of-all-a-systematic-country-diagnostic","guid":"620151496155751423","disclosure_date":"2017-05-30T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2017-05-30T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2017-05-30T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b084d78100","chronical_docm_id":"090224b084c03d91","txturl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/620151496155751423/text/115189-replacement-PUBLIC-SCD-Cambodia-web.txt","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/620151496155751423/pdf/115189-replacement-PUBLIC-SCD-Cambodia-web.pdf","docdt":"2017-05-09T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2017-05-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Cambodia \u2013 Sustaining strong growth for the\n            benefit of all : a systematic country diagnostic"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Cambodia has become one of the world\u2019s\n            leaders in poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

Cambodia\u2019s success has ridden\n            on employment creation, although labor productivity gains\n            have been lower than in other fast-growing economies, partly\n            due to lower capital intensity. Growth has also been driven\n            to a large extent by the country\u2019s rich and diverse natural\n            capital which supports the livelihoods of millions of\n            Cambodians. Going forward, Cambodia may not be able to rely\n            on the same factors that drove strong growth and poverty\n            reduction over the past two decades. Declining external\n            competitiveness threatens the sustainability of garments and\n            tourism and poses a challenge to economic diversification\n            and moving up the value chain. A number of institutional,\n            human capital, and, to a lesser extent, infrastructure\n            constraints hamper competitiveness as well as the creation\n            of a vibrant private sector in Cambodia. In light of these\n            challenges and risks, areas of development for ensuring\n            strong, inclusive, and sustainable growth with shared\n            prosperity in Cambodia going forward were identified, based\n            on analysis and consultations with stakeholders.

Following a detailed analysis\n            of poverty-recent trends, drivers of poverty reduction, and\n            demographic factors-the report provides foundations to\n            answer three main questions: 1) What has driven growth in\n            Panama in recent years? 2) To what extent has this growth\n            been, or not been, inclusive? 3) How sustainable is the\n            growth and more generally, the development model of Panama?"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama Diagnostico Sistematico De Pais"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Panama Diagnostico Sistematico De Pais"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2017/04/27336240/panama-systematic-country-diagnostic-locking-success-panama-diagnostico-sistematico-de-pais","topic":"Water Security and Integrated Resource\n            Management m1326089 141,Environmental Sustainability m1325984 1786,Public Sector Management m1326314 696,Fiscal Sustainability m1326901 1097,Growth, Poverty and Inequality m1327633 1091","projn":"PA-Panama Scd -- P151399","docty":"Systematic Country Diagnostic","count":"Panama","authors":{"authr":"Lopez,J.

Incomes rose, poverty\n            declined, access to several key public services improved,\n            and Lao PDR met a number of its Millennium Development Goals\n            (MDGs). Lao PDR\u2019s asset endowments, geography, and economic\n            and social legacies have intertwined to shape a development\n            experience of strong growth, limited inclusion, and\n            considerable risks to sustainability. This reflects relative\n            abundance of natural resources; landlocked and small size,\n            ethnically diverse but part of a rapidly growing region; and\n            institutions that have not kept pace with the changes in the\n            economy. This Systematic Country Authority Diagnostic (SCD)\n            aims to identify interventions that would deliver sustained\n            growth and edge Lao PDR toward the twin goals of ending\n            extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The SCD\n            employs a framework with three main pathways toward the twin\n            goals, each addressing weaknesses identified in the\n            diagnostics. Sustainably and efficiently managing the\n            country\u2019s natural resources, including collecting and\n            managing resource rents, (Pathway 1) is critical to\n            delivering strong growth and securing resources to build Lao\n            PDR\u2019s endowments of human and physical capital. Pathway 2\n            focuses on unlocking opportunities in the non-resource\n            sectors to increase farmers\u2019 incomes and create non-farm\n            jobs, while Pathway 3 emphasizes improvements in human\n            capital required to increase the ability of people to take\n            on these opportunities. Measures to address the high\n            vulnerability of people in Lao PDR further inform Pathway 3.\n            The SCD also highlights the importance of strengthening\n            institutions and governance, a critical cross-cutting\n            challenge that affects progress in each of the three areas\n            above. The pathways can be easily mapped to the three main\n            outcomes of the eighth National Socio-Economic Development\n            Plan (NSEDP)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao PDR - Systematic Country Diagnostic :\n            Priorities for Ending Poverty and Boosting Shared Prosperity"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lao PDR - Systematic Country\n            Diagnostic : Priorities for Ending Poverty and Boosting\n            Shared Prosperity"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2017/03/27287418/lao-pdr-systematic-country-diagnostic-priorities-ending-poverty-boosting-shared-prosperity","topic":"Economic Transparency m1327716 331,Natural Resources m1326446 1979,Economic Growth m1326241 471,Natural Resources Revenue Collection\n            m1327324 2274,Natural Resources Revenue Management\n            m1325608 2275,Natural Resources Management m1326215 600,Economic Growth Policy m1327634 1070","projn":"LA-Lao Pdr - Systematic Country Diagnostics\n            -- P157142","subtopic":"Natural Resources Management and Rural Issues,Economic Growth,Industrial Economics,Economic Policy, Institutions and Governance,Coastal and Marine Resources,Economic Theory & Research,Energy and Natural Resources,Energy Policies & Economics","docty":"Systematic Country Diagnostic","teratopic":"Rural Development,Energy,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Water Resources,Industry","count":"Lao People's Democratic Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b084a232e2_1_0"},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Energy,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Water Resources,Industry","seccl":"Public","prdln":"Country Assistance Strategy","topicv3":"Economic Transparency m1327716 331,Natural Resources m1326446 1979,Economic Growth m1326241 471,Natural Resources Revenue Collection\n            m1327324 2274,Natural Resources Revenue Management\n            m1325608 2275,Natural Resources Management m1326215 600,Economic Growth Policy m1327634 1070","majdocty":"Country Focus","owner":"GMF - East Asia and Pacific 1 (GMF02)","projectid":"P157142","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"112241"},"27370132":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/950551492526646036/Burkina-Faso-Priorities-for-Poverty-Reduction-and-Shared-Prosperity-Systematic-Country-Diagnostic","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/950551492526646036/Burkina-Faso-Priorities-for-Poverty-Reduction-and-Shared-Prosperity-Systematic-Country-Diagnostic","new_url":"2017/04/27370132/Burkina-Faso-Priorities-for-Poverty-Reduction-and-Shared-Prosperity-Systematic-Country-Diagnostic","guid":"950551492526646036","disclosure_date":"2017-04-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2017-04-18T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2017-04-18T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b084ad40a2","chronical_docm_id":"090224b084ad40a2","txturl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/950551492526646036/text/SCD-Final-april-10-FINAL-002-de-002-04132017.txt","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/950551492526646036/pdf/SCD-Final-april-10-FINAL-002-de-002-04132017.pdf","docdt":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2017-04-18T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Gray cover","versiontyp_key":"1309938","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Priorities for Poverty\n            Reduction and Shared Prosperity : Systematic Country Diagnostic"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The rate of Burkina Faso\u2019s progress\n            towards the eradication of extreme poverty and the reduction\n            of inequalities over recent years has been sub-optimal. This\n            Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is an analytical report\n            prepared by the World Bank Group (WBG) in an attempt to\n            identify and analyze the factors that can help Burkina Faso\n            accelerate its quest towards the achievement of the twin\n            goals of reduced poverty and shared prosperity. The SCD\n            assesses Burkina Faso\u2019s performance in order to identify the\n            constraints and to formulate a set of key priorities to\n            facilitate the achievement of these goals. By focusing on\n            the most significant issues affecting theachievement of\n            these goals, the SCD is intended to inform the formulation\n            of the upcoming Country Partnership Framework (CPF) and thus\n            to facilitate the optimization of the WBG\u2019s assistance to\n            Burkina Faso. The SCD is organized in three parts. Part One\n            establishes a context for the analysis through an assessment\n            of the state of Burkina Faso\u2019s economy and the progress it\n            has made towards the achievement of the twin goals of\n            poverty eradication and shared prosperity.

This framework focuses on\n            two key constraints, these being the limited extent to which\n            productive jobs have been created and the limited degree of\n            access by poor households to a minimal package of services\n            and infrastructure.

Reforms\n            intensified in the second half of the 1990s with steep cuts\n            in public spending, which helped the Government to move from\n            fiscal deficits to surpluses. Inflation was brought under\n            control. Exchange rate stability was restored, and the\n            Government carried out structural reforms to boost exports,\n            liberalize domestic markets, and reduce public sector\n            involvement in the economy.

Peru is\n            characterized by a complex and diverse geography that holds\n            wealth in natural resources and several spatial development\n            challenges.Peru has a remarkable cultural heritage and rich\n            ethnic diversity. Peru\u2019s geography, natural endowments, and\n            diverse population have shaped its unbalanced economic\n            development.Geography and resource abundance have thus led\n            to a spatial concentration of economic activities and\n            opportunities, creating large disparities in development\n            across the country\u2019s territory and its population groups.The\n            virtuous cycle of growth and shared prosperity can be\n            explained in large part by a combination of two main forces:\n            favorable exogenous conditions and successful macro\n            structural reforms.The new headwinds indicate that the past\n            virtuous cycle of growth and shared prosperity may have\n            reached its limit.These new headwinds highlight two\n            structural challenges that have emerged from Peru\u2019s specific\n            endowments, and that constrain the opportunities for income\n            growth of the bottom 40 percent. First, the persistence of\n            large spatial disparities in development consistently\n            undermine the ability of certain population groups,\n            particularly indigenous and Afro Peruvians, from overcoming\n            poverty. Moreover, the capital-centric development model\n            contributes to imbalances within the urban sector.Peru\u2019s\n            second structural challenge relates to the large\n            productivity gap of its private sector relative to its\n            peers, which is constraining the demand for better-paying\n            jobs and income opportunities. Peru\u2019s low aggregate\n            productivity stems in part from substantial misallocation of\n            capital and labor as its more productive firms do not\n            necessarily hire more workers or invest more.The Systemic\n            Country Diagnostic (SCD) prioritizes policy constraints that\n            have the greatest impact on Peru\u2019s structural challenges of\n            reducing the large spatial disparities and boosting private\n            sector productivity. The SCD uses the following selection\n            criteria to identify the constraints with the largest impact\n            on achieving shared prosperity going forward. First, it\n            identifies constraints that significantly affect one or both\n            of the two main structural challenges. Second, it identifies\n            policy constraints that present synergies to overcome these\n            structural challenges. Third, it identifies constraints that\n            support the sustainability of addressing Peru\u2019s structural\n            challenges. Applying the three criteria described above, the\n            SCD identifies a set of constraints that are pivotal to\n            address Peru\u2019s two main structural challenges and should\n            thus be the focus of policies in coming years."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Systematic Country Diagnostic"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Systematic Country Diagnostic"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2017/02/27287614/peru-systematic-country-diagnostic","topic":"Agriculture and Food Security m1326205 435,Inequality and Shared Prosperity m1327655 700,Poverty m1326687 695,Financial Risk Management m1326072 375,Financial Sector and Social Inclusion\n            m1326074 374","projn":"PE-Peru Systematic Country Diagnostic -- P157534","subtopic":"Inequality,Economic Insecurity,Financial Sector and Social Assistance","docty":"Systematic Country Diagnostic","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction","count":"Peru","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b084a23385_1_0"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction","seccl":"Public","prdln":"Country Assistance Strategy","topicv3":"Agriculture and Food Security m1326205 435,Inequality and Shared Prosperity m1327655 700,Poverty m1326687 695,Financial Risk Management m1326072 375,Financial Sector and Social Inclusion\n            m1326074 374","majdocty":"Country Focus","owner":"WB Off:Lima-Andean Countries CMU (LCC6C)","projectid":"P157534","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"112694"},"27287604":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/399191490108962508/Honduras-Unlocking-economic-potential-for-greater-opportunities-systematic-country-diagnostic","available_in":"English,Spanish","fullavailablein":[{"lang":"English","entityid":"090224b08416f158_1_0","node_id":"27287604"}],"url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/399191490108962508/Honduras-Unlocking-economic-potential-for-greater-opportunities-systematic-country-diagnostic","new_url":"2017/03/27287604/Honduras-Unlocking-economic-potential-for-greater-opportunities-systematic-country-diagnostic","guid":"399191490108962508","disclosure_date":"2017-03-21T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2017-03-21T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2017-03-21T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b084a23363","chronical_docm_id":"090224b084a23363","txturl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/399191490108962508/text/103239-SPANISH-V2-Honduras-SCD-Spanish.txt","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/399191490108962508/pdf/103239-SPANISH-V2-Honduras-SCD-Spanish.pdf","docdt":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2017-03-21T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"2","repnme":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Unlocking economic potential for\n            greater opportunities : systematic country diagnostic"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Honduras is Central America\u2019s\n            second-largest country with a population of more than 8\n            million and a land area of about 112,000 square kilometers.\n            It has coastlines on both the Caribbean Sea, including the\n            three Bay Islands, and the Pacific Ocean via the Gulf of\n            Fonseca. Its inland territory is largely mountainous, with\n            plains along the coast, and its rain forests, cloud forests,\n            savannas, pine forests and the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef\n            System boast a wealth of biodiversity. The country\u2019s two\n            largest cities, Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, are home to\n            almost a quarter of its population, yet approximately half\n            of the population lives in rural areas, where most are\n            engaged in semi-subsistence agriculture. This Systematic\n            Country Diagnostic (SCD) explores the drivers of these\n            development outcomes in Honduras, and reflects on the policy\n            priorities that should underlie a development strategy\n            focused on eradicating poverty and boosting shared\n            prosperity.

- Systematic Country Diagnostic"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Kosovo is Europe\u2019s youngest country in\n            terms of history and demographics. Both characteristics are\n            defining the country\u2019s overarching development challenges.\n            The country\u2019s geographical position along major trade routes\n            made its territory a pawn in the hands of powerful\n            neighbors, from the Romans and the Ottoman Empire to\n            Yugoslavia. The considerable amount of self-governance\n            granted to Kosovo under the Yugoslav Constitution of 1974,\n            as a province of Serbia, but not as a constituent republic\n            of the federation, proved politically unsustainable, as\n            temporary gains in self-rule were reversed by Belgrade\n            during the Milosevic era. The period after 1989 was\n            characterized by increased repression and violence,\n            culminating in war and population expulsion in 1998\u201399.\n            During the immediate post conflict period, United Nations\n            (UN) Security Council Resolution 1244 placed Kosovo under UN\n            interim administration. In 2008, Kosovo declared\n            independence. The transition period of supervised\n            independence ended four and a half years later.\n            International recognition has remained partial and has\n            precluded Kosovo from joining the UN as a full member.4 In\n            the wake of these developments, public institutions had to\n            be established from scratch and earn the population\u2019s\n            acceptance and credibility as their own. The remainder of\n            this document is organized as follows. Section two presents\n            the country context, including political and economic\n            conditions, and discusses factors behind recent trends in\n            growth, shared prosperity, and poverty.

Cambodia\u2019s success has ridden\n            on employment creation, although labor productivity gains\n            have been lower than in other fast-growing economies, partly\n            due to lower capital intensity.

Going forward, Cambodia may not be able to rely\n            on the same factors that drove strong growth and poverty\n            reduction over the past two decades.

The world\u2019s\n            largest transcontinental country spans eleven time zones in\n            northern Eurasia. Russia is the main trading partner for\n            many of its more than a dozen neighbors. Russia\u2019s importance\n            to the global climate change agenda is reflected in the fact\n            that it has the world\u2019s largest forest reserves, second only\n            to the Amazon Rainforest in terms of the amount of carbon\n            dioxide it absorbs. Altogether, these characteristics render\n            undertaking this Systematic Country Diagnostic about\n            Russia\u2019s future development course challenging. The analysis\n            identifies general causal chains related to Russia\u2019s\n            interlinked development challenges and opportunities, but is\n            often based on data only available at the national level.\n            From the 1998\u201399 crisis until 2011, Russia experienced\n            nearly uninterrupted strong growth and unprecedented gains\n            in shared prosperity. However, growth dynamics have weakened\n            since 2012, and the end of the commodity super cycle in 2014\n            ushered in a period of difficult economic adjustment. From\n            2012\u201313, growth and shared prosperity trends started to\n            weaken as second-generation structural reforms\u2015strengthening\n            the climate investment, diversifying the economic structure,\n            and closing the infrastructure gap\u2015advanced more slowly.\n            With fiscal pressures rising, the cost of the underlying\n            social contract\u2014in which the state is entrusted with\n            providing jobs, services, and a system of significant\n            transfers and subsidies\u2014is becoming more difficult to\n            sustain. The recent crisis exposed the vulnerability of\n            Russia\u2019s economy and raised questions about the\n            sustainability of past achievements in boosting shared\n            prosperity. Productivity and job growth will remain elusive\n            and ultimately jeopardize the social gains of the past\n            decade without a conducive investment environment, skilled\n            labor, and adequate infrastructure. This diagnostic\n            identifies two pathways where progress is critical for\n            sustainable growth and an expansion of shared prosperity.\n            The first pathway identified areas where new policies are\n            necessary to achieve a recovery in productivity, focusing on\n            infrastructure and connectivity, the regulatory regime for\n            businesses, constraints on innovation by firms, and skills\n            development for individuals. The second pathway identified\n            the main areas for policy reforms to further reduce\n            vulnerability by deepening human capital gains and improving\n            access to public services. The analysis identifies channels\n            through which the labor market can again become a source of\n            raising the incomes of the bottom 40 percent by improving\n            health and education services and strengthening the poverty\n            impact and sustainability of Russia\u2019s social protection\n            system. To achieve these goals, progress is essential in\n            three requisites: fiscal sustainability, governance, and\n            management of natural resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - Systematic country\n            diagnostic : Pathways to inclusive growth"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russian Federation - Systematic\n            country diagnostic : pathways to inclusive growth : Russian\n            Federation - Systematic country diagnostic : Pathways to\n            inclusive growth"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2016/12/27059999/russian-federation-systematic-country-diagnostic-pathways-inclusive-growth-russian-federation-systematic-country-diagnostic-pathways-inclusive-growth","topic":"Social Development m1327660 134,Economic Growth m1326241 471,Poverty m1326687 695,Governance and Growth m1504456 3104,Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Social Protection and Labor m1327194 697,Debt m1326503 450","projn":"RU-Russian Federation Strategic Country\n            Diagnostic -- P153080","docty":"Systematic Country Diagnostic","count":"Russian Federation","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b084816f44_1_0"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"Country Assistance Strategy","topicv3":"Social Development m1327660 134,Economic Growth m1326241 471,Poverty m1326687 695,Governance and Growth m1504456 3104,Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Social Protection and Labor m1327194 697,Debt m1326503 450","majdocty":"Country Focus","owner":"Europe: Russia Country Unit (ECCRU)","projectid":"P153080","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"1":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"2":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"3":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"}},"repnb":"110765","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f - \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f\n            \u0434\u0438\u0430\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044b : \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0438 \u043a \u0438\u043d\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0437\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443"}}},"26957894":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/855161479736248522/Thailand-Systematic-country-diagnostic-getting-back-on-track-reviving-growth-and-securing-prosperity-for-all","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/855161479736248522/Thailand-Systematic-country-diagnostic-getting-back-on-track-reviving-growth-and-securing-prosperity-for-all","new_url":"2017/04/26957894/Thailand-Systematic-country-diagnostic-getting-back-on-track-reviving-growth-and-securing-prosperity-for-all","guid":"855161479736248522","disclosure_date":"2016-11-21T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2016-11-21T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2016-11-21T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b084b07cae","chronical_docm_id":"090224b08471deeb","txturl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/855161479736248522/text/110396-REVISED-4-26-WB-TH-SCD-REPORT-BOOKLET-159PAGE-RevisedApr26.txt","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/855161479736248522/pdf/110396-REVISED-4-26-WB-TH-SCD-REPORT-BOOKLET-159PAGE-RevisedApr26.pdf","datestored":"2016-11-21T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2016-11-10T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Revised gray cover","versiontyp_key":"1309941","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Systematic country diagnostic :\n            getting back on track - reviving growth and securing\n            prosperity for all"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Thailand has made tremendous progress\n            toward the twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and\n            boosting shared prosperity. Notably, Thailand has achieved\n            these gains despite high political instability, with\n            short-lived constitutions and frequent military coups.\n            However, continued instability could affect future growth\n            and prospects for shared income gains. Moreover, poverty and\n            inequality continue to pose significant challenges. Slower\n            growth than in the past, if it continues, will constrain\n            further progress in reducing poverty and promoting\n            inclusion. The Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) of\n            Thailand identifies paths to foster higher productivity\n            -driven growth and shared prosperity. The SCD aims to help\n            the country, the World Bank Group (WBG), and other partners\n            identify key priority or focus areas for progress toward\n            sustained poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The\n            analysis presented is not limited to areas or sectors where\n            the WBG is currently (or anticipates to be) active but\n            rather focuses on the country\u2019s key development challenges\n            and the underlying constraints to meeting the objective of\n            growth leading  to shared prosperity and poverty reduction.\n            Where appropriate, the analysis contrasts the experience of\n            Thailand with its neighbors and peers. This SCD is organized\n            as follows. It begins with an overview of the country\n            context, describing some distinctive country features that\n            have affected Thailand\u2019s development. It then takes a closer\n            look at economic growth in Thailand, analyzing key trends\n            and the likely prospects for future growth.

Vietnam\u2019s past achievements came through\n            a combination of different developments. The purpose of this\n            Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is to identify\n            priorities for supporting Vietnam in sustaining its past\n            success and reaching its own ambitious goals for the\n            future.The SCD assesses achievements and emerging\n            constraints and opportunities for Vietnam. The SCD is\n            designed to inform the upcoming Country Partnership\n            Framework by informing a set of focus areas to help\n            accelerate progress toward the World Bank Group\u2019stwin goals\n            of reducing poverty and achieving share prosperity in a\n            sustainable manner.First, Vietnam\u2019s current model of\n            inclusive growth and job creation will eventually face\n            limits.Second, Vietnam faces both an unfinished agenda and\n            new challenges for inclusion and service delivery. Third,\n            Vietnam needs to reinforce its rapid growth with productive\n            use of its natural assets and environment, and minimize the\n            cost of pollution, unsustainable resource use and climate\n            change on growth. Finally, governance weaknesses are likely\n            to become a drag on future growth and social outcomes.\n            Against this backdrop, Vietnam faces opportunities and risks\n            for poverty reduction, shared prosperity and environmental\n            sustainability.Mitigating risks and making most of the\n            opportunities will require concerted actionson a broad set\n            of priorities.The first priority is targeted and tailored\n            efforts to reduce poverty among ethnic minorities.The second\n            priority is delivering productive infrastructure and\n            competitive cities. The third priority is strengthening\n            economic management and market institutions. The fourth\n            priority is transforming agriculture and use of natural\n            assets.The fifth priority is adapting service delivery in\n            health, social protection, and education to new expectation\n            and an aging population.The sixth priority is augmenting\n            resilience to climate change and generating mitigation\n            benefits while reducing environmental pollution.Finally,\n            attention needs to be given to modernizing Vietnam\u2019s core\n            government institutions to enable them to continue to\n            support a rapidly developing middle income economy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ti\u1ebfp b\u01b0\u1edbc th\u00e0nh c\u00f4ng : Nh\u00f3m \u01b0u ti\u00ean t\u0103ng\n            tr\u01b0\u1edfng to\u00e0n di\u1ec7n v\u00e0 b\u1ec1n v\u1eefn g"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Systematic country\n            diagnostic : Ti\u1ebfp b\u01b0\u1edbc th\u00e0nh c\u00f4ng : Nh\u00f3m \u01b0u ti\u00ean t\u0103ng tr\u01b0\u1edfng\n            to\u00e0n di\u1ec7n v\u00e0 b\u1ec1n v\u1eefn g"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2016/10/26863659/vietnam-systematic-country-diagnostic-ti\u1ebfp-b\u01b0\u1edbc-th\u00e0nh-c\u00f4ng-nh\u00f3m-\u01b0u-ti\u00ean-t\u0103ng-tr\u01b0\u1edfng-to\u00e0n-di\u1ec7n-v\u00e0-b\u1ec1n-v\u1eefn-g","topic":"Economic Growth m1326241 471,Jobs Diagnostics m1503991 2689,Social Protection and Labor m1327194 697,Poverty m1326687 695,Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707","projn":"VN-Vietnam Scd -- P157290","subtopic":"Poverty Diagnostics,Poverty Impact Evaluation,Social Protections & Assistance,Economic Growth,Industrial Economics,Small Area Estimation Poverty Mapping,Poverty Lines,Poverty Assessment,Economic Theory & Research,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Inequality","docty":"Systematic Country Diagnostic","teratopic":"Industry,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Social Protections and Labor,Poverty Reduction","count":"Vietnam","authors":{"authr":"Chandrasekharan Behr,Diji"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08462d3b4_1_0"},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"Vietnamese","historic_topic":"Industry,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Social Protections and Labor,Poverty Reduction","prdln":"Country Assistance Strategy","seccl":"Public","topicv3":"Economic Growth m1326241 471,Jobs Diagnostics m1503991 2689,Social Protection and Labor m1327194 697,Poverty m1326687 695,Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707","majdocty":"Country Focus","owner":"World Bank Office: Hanoi (EACVF)","projectid":"P157290","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"108348"},"26816188":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/179631474899157168/Togo-Systematic-Country-Diagnostic","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/179631474899157168/Togo-Systematic-Country-Diagnostic","new_url":"2016/09/26816188/Togo-Systematic-Country-Diagnostic","guid":"179631474899157168","disclosure_date":"2016-09-26T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2016-09-29T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2016-09-29T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b0845bc15c","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0845bc15c","txturl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/179631474899157168/text/Togo-SCD-Final-2016-09222016.txt","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/179631474899157168/pdf/Togo-SCD-Final-2016-09222016.pdf","datestored":"2016-09-26T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2016-09-19T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Togo - Systematic Country Diagnostic"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Once the \u2018Switzerland of West Africa,\u2019\n            Togo today strives to transition from its status as a low\n            income, fragile state to an emerging economy. Political\n            reforms since 2006 have stabilized the country, but\n            unresolved political issues still present a risk for Togo.\n            With the 2006 GPA and legislative elections in 2007,\n            development partners reengaged in Togo and the country\n            embarked on a new period of recovery. However, the delayed\n            implementation of some 2006 GPA reforms remains a point of\n            contention. Combined with the government\u2019s difficulties in\n            advancing reforms to broaden and accelerate economic\n            opportunities, Togo remains vulnerable to future episodes of\n            conflict.

Economic growth has averaged over\n            5 percent during the past five years, owing to high rates of\n            growth in commerce, transport and services, building, and\n            public works, as well as solid growth in agriculture.\n            However, growth in transport is underpinned in part by trade\n            diversion and smuggling, which are not reliable sources of\n            growth, while large infrastructure investments, though\n            critical for the country\u2019s economic development, are not\n            financed in a fiscally sustainable manner (IMF 2015). Public\n            debt is growing rapidly, and another fiscal crisis could be\n            on the horizon. To accelerate and sustain poverty reduction,\n            Togo will need to unleash a more robust, inclusive, and\n            sustainable growth process, led by private economic agents,\n            and supported and amplified by more effective government\n            policies, public investments, and services.

The purpose of this\n            Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is to identify\n            priorities for supporting Vietnam in sustaining its past\n            success and reaching its own ambitious goals for the\n            future.The SCD assesses achievements and emerging\n            constraints and opportunities for Vietnam. The SCD is\n            designed to inform the upcoming Country Partnership\n            Framework by informing a set of focus areas to help\n            accelerate progress toward the World Bank Group\u2019stwin goals\n            of reducing poverty and achieving share prosperity in a\n            sustainable manner.First, Vietnam\u2019s current model of\n            inclusive growth and job creation will eventually face\n            limits.Second, Vietnam faces both an unfinished agenda and\n            new challenges for inclusion and service delivery. Third,\n            Vietnam needs to reinforce its rapid growth with productive\n            use of its natural assets and environment, and minimize the\n            cost of pollution, unsustainable resource use and climate\n            change on growth. Finally, governance weaknesses are likely\n            to become a drag on future growth and social outcomes.\n            Against this backdrop, Vietnam faces opportunities and risks\n            for poverty reduction, shared prosperity and environmental\n            sustainability.Mitigating risks and making most of the\n            opportunities will require concerted actionson a broad set\n            of priorities.The first priority is targeted and tailored\n            efforts to reduce poverty among ethnic minorities.The second\n            priority is delivering productive infrastructure and\n            competitive cities.

Economic\n            growth has been largely consumption-driven and fueled by\n            remittances. Poverty changes are largely derived from\n            remittances and pensions. Employment has fallen, limiting\n            the role of labor markets in improving living standards.\n            Given that the growth in remittances and pensions will\n            continue to slow, sustainable progress requires a new growth\n            model driven by higher private sector growth and job\n            creation (pathway 1: creating more and better jobs),\n            accompanied by urbanization, and better connectivity and\n            inclusive access to economic opportunities and services\n            (pathway 2: building up and protecting the stock of assets\n            of the population). For Moldova to navigate these two\n            pathways, the report identifies six critical priorities. The\n            top three include governance challenges that affect both\n            pathways: (1) strengthening the rule of law and the\n            accountability of institutions, particularly to unlock the\n            main constraint identified to firm growth and job creation,\n            (2) improving the efficiency and equity of service delivery,\n            for an enabling environment for firms and individuals to\n            access better economic opportunities across Moldova and\n            particularly in rural areas,, and (3) increasing the\n            quality, equity, and relevance of education and training\n            systems, so that Moldovans may become well prepared to\n            access productive jobs. Priority areas also include (4)\n            improving the business regulatory framework, (5) ensuring\n            sound macroeconomic and fiscal management, and (6) reforming\n            the social protection system, particularly pensions.

The SCD is\n            organized into six chapters. Chapter two describes the\n            evolution of poverty and inequality, explores their regional\n            and demographic dimensions, and identifies strategies for\n            accelerating poverty reduction. Chapter three analyzes key\n            economic constraints and opportunities, identifying the\n            drivers of recent growth, describing developments in the\n            real sector and assessing emerging challenges associated\n            with the rise of the extractive industries.

A continental power,\n            Brazil is the fifth largest country on earth (in both land\n            area and population). It covers a vast territory containing\n            the world\u2019s largest rainforest (the Amazon) substantial\n            freshwater resources, valuable agricultural land, and\n            multiple minerals, metals and other natural capital. Its\n            size gives it systemic importance from the environmental\n            point of view as the lung of the earth and also has\n            important consequences for the structure of the economy and\n            political institutions. Brazil\u2019s prospects have attracted\n            particular interest also because it historically was and\n            remains today one of the world\u2019s most unequal societies.\n            Brazil thus finds itself at an important juncture and, to a\n            certain extent, the policy course set today will determine\n            whether the country can sustain the gains of the past and\n            return to a path of solid, inclusive and environmentally\n            sustainable growth. This SCD offers a contribution to the\n            debate about Brazil\u2019s future development. It abstains from\n            formulating specific policy recommendations and rather\n            focuses on highlighting the way in which Brazil\u2019s\n            development challenges and opportunities are closely\n            interlinked. The causal chains identified by the analysis\n            lead to a set of broad priorities, which can serve as\n            background for discussion of concrete reform plans and\n            policies, as well as their feasibility in a complex and\n            fluid political environment. The remainder of this overview\n            first presents the main causal chains traced in this SCD and\n            explains the structure of the report, before providing a\n

matter globally. A continental power,\n            Brazil is the fifth largest country on earth (in both land\n            area and population). It covers a vast territory containing\n            the world\u2019s largest rainforest (the Amazon) substantial\n            freshwater resources, valuable agricultural land, and\n            multiple minerals, metals and other natural capital. Its\n            size gives it systemic importance from the environmental\n            point of view as the lung of the earth and also has\n            important consequences for the structure of the economy and\n            political institutions. Brazil\u2019s prospects have attracted\n            particular interest also because it historically was and\n            remains today one of the world\u2019s most unequal societies.\n            Brazil thus finds itself at an important juncture and, to a\n            certain extent, the policy course set today will determine\n            whether the country can sustain the gains of the past and\n            return to a path of solid, inclusive and environmentally\n            sustainable growth. This SCD offers a contribution to the\n            debate about Brazil\u2019s future development. It abstains from\n            formulating specific policy recommendations and rather\n            focuses on highlighting the way in which Brazil\u2019s\n            development challenges and opportunities are closely\n            interlinked. The causal chains identified by the analysis\n            lead to a set of broad priorities, which can serve as\n            background for discussion of concrete reform plans and\n            policies, as well as their feasibility in a complex and\n            fluid political environment.

the world\u2019s most unequal societies.\n            Until the late-1990s, little progress was made in reducing\n            income inequalities in Brazil, but in the past decade\n            Brazil\u2019s socioeconomic progress has been remarkable and\n            internationally noted. It has been successful in pursuing\n            economic prosperity while protecting its unique natural\n            patrimony. More fundamentally, the changed economic\n            circumstances have exposed shortcomings in Brazil\u2019s\n            development model, epitomized by the struggle to achieve a\n            sustainable fiscal policy. This report argues that the\n            desire for a more inclusive state, after the return to\n            democracy, led to a bias in favor of a large and increasing\n            role for the public sector. Fiscal policy has been\n            constrained by hardwired spending commitments and its\n            sustainability risks being undermined by a burgeoning social\n            security system, which provides substantial benefits to the\n            non-poor. Brazil thus finds itself at an important juncture\n            and, to a certain extent, the policy course set today will\n            determine whether the country can sustain the gains of the\n            past and return to a path of solid, inclusive and\n            environmentally sustainable growth. This systematic country\n            diagnostic (SCD) offers a contribution to the debate about\n            Brazil\u2019s future development. The structure of the SCD is as\n            follows: chapter one summarizes Brazil\u2019s achievements in\n            reducing poverty and boosting incomes of the bottom 40\n            percent (B40), drawing up a profile of the poor and\n            vulnerable, their main assets, access to markets and public\n            services, and susceptibility to various economic risks, as\n            well as the effectiveness of government transfers. Chapter\n            two looks at Brazil\u2019s political institutions to get at the\n            root of the country\u2019s fiscal challenges. Chapter three\n            examines the consequences of these fiscal challenges for\n            macroeconomic management and traces the evolution of\n            Brazil\u2019s macroeconomic policy framework since the days of\n            high inflation in the late 1980s. Chapter four deals with\n            the structural reforms needed to raise the level and types\n            of private investment required to increase productivity\n            growth and competitiveness, with a particular focus on the\n            role of infrastructure. Chapter five reviews the scope for\n            efficiency enhancing and socially progressive reallocations\n            of government expenditures. Chapter six looks at the\n            challenges for improved environmental and natural resource\n            management, and outlines the contours of a future green\n            growth strategy for Brazil. Chapter seven concludes the SCD\n            and draws out the main constraints to Brazil\u2019s development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sumario executive : Retomando o caminho para\n            a inclusao

- Systematic country diagnostic"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Brazil\u2019s prospects have attracted\n            particular interest also because it historically was and\n            remains today one of the world\u2019s most unequal societies.\n            Until the late-1990s, little progress was made in reducing\n            income inequalities in Brazil, but in the past decade\n            Brazil\u2019s socioeconomic progress has been remarkable and\n            internationally noted. It has been successful in pursuing\n            economic prosperity while protecting its unique natural\n            patrimony. More fundamentally, the changed economic\n            circumstances have exposed shortcomings in Brazil\u2019s\n            development model, epitomized by the struggle to achieve a\n            sustainable fiscal policy. This report argues that the\n            desire for a more inclusive state, after the return to\n            democracy, led to a bias in favor of a large and increasing\n            role for the public sector. Fiscal policy has been\n            constrained by hardwired spending commitments and its\n            sustainability risks being undermined by a burgeoning social\n            security system, which provides substantial benefits to the\n            non-poor. Brazil thus finds itself at an important juncture\n            and, to a certain extent, the policy course set today will\n            determine whether the country can sustain the gains of the\n            past and return to a path of solid, inclusive and\n            environmentally sustainable growth. This systematic country\n            diagnostic (SCD) offers a contribution to the debate about\n            Brazil\u2019s future development. The structure of the SCD is as\n            follows: chapter one summarizes Brazil\u2019s achievements in\n            reducing poverty and boosting incomes of the bottom 40\n            percent (B40), drawing up a profile of the poor and\n            vulnerable, their main assets, access to markets and public\n            services, and susceptibility to various economic risks, as\n            well as the effectiveness of government transfers. Chapter\n            two looks at Brazil\u2019s political institutions to get at the\n            root of the country\u2019s fiscal challenges. Chapter three\n            examines the consequences of these fiscal challenges for\n            macroeconomic management and traces the evolution of\n            Brazil\u2019s macroeconomic policy framework since the days of\n            high inflation in the late 1980s. Chapter four deals with\n            the structural reforms needed to raise the level and types\n            of private investment required to increase productivity\n            growth and competitiveness, with a particular focus on the\n            role of infrastructure. Chapter five reviews the scope for\n            efficiency enhancing and socially progressive reallocations\n            of government expenditures. Chapter six looks at the\n            challenges for improved environmental and natural resource\n            management, and outlines the contours of a future green\n            growth strategy for Brazil. Chapter seven concludes the SCD\n            and draws out the main constraints to Brazil\u2019s development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"executive summary"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil -

The second part examines the links between\n            poverty, income distribution and economic growth, through\n            the labor market, against the background of large changes in\n            international capital flows and the unfinished structural\n            reform agenda. The third part, examines the sustainability\n            and vulnerability of the current growth model.

identifies the binding constraints to reducing extreme\n            poverty and promoting shared prosperity in Ethiopia.\n            Achieving those goals requires a two pronged strategy of\n            building on the strengths of past performance as well as\n            introducing new elements. Progress in rural livelihoods\n            drove poverty reduction in the past and will likely do so in\n            the future. In addition, faster, and more inclusive, private\n            sector-led structural change and \u2018getting urbanization\n            right\u2019 are essential going forward. The report identifies\n            two key challenges to sustainable progress: Ethiopia needs\n            sustainably financed infrastructure that enables private\n            investment to flourish and reduces reliance on public\n            borrowing. It must also strengthen feedback mechanisms that\n            inform policymakers of what works and what doesn\u2019t so that\n            the aspirations of a rapidly rising and better-educated\n            working-age population can be met.

accelerate progress on the twin goals of\n            eradicating extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity.\n            The SCD is organized into five chapters. Chapter one frames\n            the issues of poverty reduction and shared prosperity, and\n            situates them in the context of Uzbekistan\u2019s recent\n            development. It reviews the status and drivers of progress\n            in these areas, identifies analytical constraints, and\n            highlights areas for further study. Chapter two describes\n            the necessary conditions for sustaining rapid economic\n            growth and robust quality job creation.

It has been successful in pursuing\n            economic prosperity while protecting its unique natural\n            patrimony. More fundamentally, the changed economic\n            circumstances have exposed shortcomings in Brazil\u2019s\n            development model, epitomized by the struggle to achieve a\n            sustainable fiscal policy. This report argues that the\n            desire for a more inclusive state, after the return to\n            democracy, led to a bias in favor of a large and increasing\n            role for the public sector. Fiscal policy has been\n            constrained by hardwired spending commitments and its\n            sustainability risks being undermined by a burgeoning social\n            security system, which provides substantial benefits to the\n            non-poor. Brazil thus finds itself at an important juncture\n            and, to a certain extent, the policy course set today will\n            determine whether the country can sustain the gains of the\n            past and return to a path of solid, inclusive and\n            environmentally sustainable growth. This systematic country\n            diagnostic (SCD) offers a contribution to the debate about\n            Brazil\u2019s future development. The structure of the SCD is as\n            follows: chapter one summarizes Brazil\u2019s achievements in\n            reducing poverty and boosting incomes of the bottom 40\n            percent (B40), drawing up a profile of the poor and\n            vulnerable, their main assets, access to markets and public\n            services, and susceptibility to various economic risks, as\n            well as the effectiveness of government transfers. Chapter\n            two looks at Brazil\u2019s political institutions to get at the\n            root of the country\u2019s fiscal challenges. Chapter three\n            examines the consequences of these fiscal challenges for\n            macroeconomic management and traces the evolution of\n            Brazil\u2019s macroeconomic policy framework since the days of\n            high inflation in the late 1980s. Chapter four deals with\n            the structural reforms needed to raise the level and types\n            of private investment required to increase productivity\n            growth and competitiveness, with a particular focus on the\n            role of infrastructure. Chapter five reviews the scope for\n            efficiency enhancing and socially progressive reallocations\n            of government expenditures. Chapter six looks at the\n            challenges for improved environmental and natural resource\n            management, and outlines the contours of a future green\n            growth strategy for Brazil. Chapter seven concludes the SCD\n            and draws out the main constraints to Brazil\u2019s development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Systematic country

With economic growth averaging\n            more than 7 percent a year over the past five years on top\n            of an average growth of 6 percent the preceding five years,\n            Sri Lanka has made notable strides towards the goals of\n            ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity (the\n            \u2018twin goals\u2019). The national poverty headcount rate declined\n            from 22.7 to 6.7 percent between 2002 and 2012/13, while\n            consumption per capita of the bottom 40 percent grew at 3.3\n            percent a year, compared to 2.8 percent for the total\n            population. Other human development indicators are also\n            impressive by regional and lower middle-income country\n            standards. Sri Lanka has also succeeded in ending decades of\n            internal conflict in 2009 and steps have been taken towards\n            reconciliation. Sri Lanka\u2019s has had impressive development\n            gains but there are strong indications that drivers of past\n            progress are not sustainable. Solid economic growth, strong\n            poverty reduction, overcoming internal conflict, effecting a\n            remarkable democratic transition in recent months, and\n            overall strong human development outcomes are a track record\n            that would make any country proud.

Today the country is at a crossroads in its\n            development with economic growth down sharply and poverty\n            incidence stubbornly high.

Systematic country diagnostic"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Belize has a rich history that dates\n            back thousands of years. The country was first inhabited by\n            the Mayans with records of their presence dating from 1500\n            BC. The first recorded European settlement was established\n            circa 1638 by the British who called the country the Colony\n            of British Honduras. The official name of the territory was\n            changed from British Honduras to Belize in June 1973, and\n            full independence was granted on September 21, 1981. There\n            were several obstacles in the path toward independence, as\n            illustrated by Guatemala's long-standing claim to the\n            entire territory. It was only in November 1980, after\n            several frustrated negotiations with Guatemala that Belizean\n            diplomacy managed to obtain international support that led\n            to the United Nations passing of a resolution that demanded\n            the independence of Belize, but it was only in 1992 that\n            Guatemala formally recognized Belize\u2019s independence. After\n            independence, Belize successfully implemented a development\n            strategy which emphasized economic diversification and\n            private sector development at a time where the terms of\n            trade were favorable to the country. As a small, open\n            economy, that is also extremely vulnerable to climate change\n            and natural disasters, Belize\u2019s ability to promote faster\n            poverty reduction and greater shared prosperity will depend\n            on how well the country deals with its main sources of\n            vulnerability. In addition to weaknesses in infrastructure\n            and in the skills of the labor force, several studies have\n            pinpointed crime and violence and problems in the financial\n            sector as important deterrents to growth. The analysis in\n            this report confirms the centrality of these two factors.\n            The predicament in the financial sector is largely driven by\n            the small economic size of the country and the lack of\n            competition in the banking sector, a common feature in small\n            state economies that limits the availability of credit to\n            small and medium enterprises. Stability issues in the sector\n            complicate matters as these impose non-negligible risks to\n            the health of the financial sector. On the other hand, the\n            rise in the inflow of migrants from neighboring Central\n            American countries with a history of crime and violence has\n            been raised as a potential cause for high crime rates in\n            Belize, but there is not enough evidence to substantiate\n            that claim at this point. Policy interventions that could\n            help halt the rise in criminality rates include ramping up\n            the quality of education, keeping children at school,\n            promoting education equivalency programs and job training,\n            besides more direct approaches such as investing in safe\n            neighborhood programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Belize - Systematic

Islands - Systematic country\n            diagnostic for the eight small Pacific Island Countries :\n            priorities for ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD)\n            covers eight small Pacific island countries (PIC8):\n            Kiribati, Marshall Islands, the Federated States of\n            Micronesia, Palau, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. The\n            objective of the SCD is to identify the most critical\n            constraints and opportunities facing the PIC8 to meet the\n            global goals of ending absolute poverty and boosting shared\n            prosperity in a sustainable manner. The report is intended\n            to help these countries, the World Bank and other\n            development partners establish a dialogue to focus their\n            efforts around the key priorities and activities that have\n            high impact and are aligned with the two goals. The regional\n            approach of this SCD is driven by the similarity of\n            development challenges faced by these countries and the\n            importance of regional solutions to these challenges. The\n            SCD also highlights that economic opportunities available to\n            the Pacific island countries are limited. While these\n            opportunities have been known for a long time, the\n            experience of most of these countries in realizing these\n            opportunities has been disappointing, reflected in the poor\n            growth performance of the PIC8. A realistic assessment of\n            these opportunities as well as of the measures needed to\n            realize them is essential. In this context, deep sea mining\n            is seen by some of the PIC8 as the next big opportunity,\n            while at the same time many raise concerns about its\n            possible environmental impacts. This is thus an area that\n            would benefit from an objective assessment of risks and\n            opportunities that could inform policy choices in the PIC8.\n            With the liberalization of telecoms markets and investments\n            in fiber-optic cables that connect many of the PIC8, new\n            opportunities to overcome the tyranny of distance through a\n            focus on knowledge products may become available and deserve\n            a critical assessment. The Pacific Possible research program\n            led by the World Bank Group is providing new insights into\n            the potential of these game-changers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pacific Islands -

The analysis in this report focuses\n            on the 2000 to 2014 period, covering the boom years before\n            2008 and the global financial crisis and recovery years up\n            to 2014. It is based on a rich household data set from the\n            National Living Standards Measurement Survey (ENCOVI) as\n            well as on data on malnutrition from the 2014 National\n            Survey of Maternal and Child Indicators (ENSMI). Where\n            relevant and where there are available data, longer times\n            series have been constructed, but the focus of the report is\n            on this 15-year period. The analysis has some limitations.\n            The SCD team identified various countries that could be\n            considered to be Guatemala\u2019s peer and aspirational countries\n            in terms of their income level and population size, and\n            whenever it is relevant to do so, the report benchmarks\n            Guatemala\u2019s performance against the performance of those\n            countries. The report is organized as follows: After the\n            overview presented here in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 provides\n            evidence of the trends in poverty, shared prosperity, and\n            inequality in Guatemala. The first section benchmarks\n            Guatemala\u2019s progress in reducing income poverty against its\n            peer countries. This is followed by an examination of\n            consumption poverty, which is the official measure of\n            poverty used in Guatemala. The analysis highlights the gaps\n            between the two Guatemalas. The chapter ends with some\n            findings concerning the drivers of poverty, specifically\n            focusing on the roles played by prices, labor, and\n            transfers. Chapter 3 attempts to answer the question of how\n            inclusive economic growth has been in Guatemala, looking\n            first at the limited role played by labor markets in helping\n            people to rise out of poverty and at the limited human\n            capital and the dearth of opportunities to increase it. The\n            chapter then discusses the ineffective and inadequate public\n            spending that rives these outcomes and demonstrates the link\n            between limited opportunities and poor outcomes, focusing\n            specifically on malnutrition and vulnerability. Chapter 4\n            analyzes the drivers of growth and the roles and\n            characteristics of key sectors. Important changes in trade\n            policies are then covered, and the chapter ends with a\n            detailed discussion of the main constraints to increasing\n            investment and productivity and to creating high-quality\n            jobs. Chapter 5 focuses on various fiscal, environmental,\n            and social challenges. Major concerns about tax revenues,\n            water resources and land use are highlighted. The final\n            chapter summarizes the priorities that have emerged from the\n            analysis and describes a set of policies or areas of action\n            that have the potential to put Guatemala on a path of higher\n            and more inclusive growth."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Cerrando brechas para generar un\n            crecimiento m\u00e1s inclusivo : Diagn\u00f3stico sistem\u00e1tico de pa\u00eds"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guatemala - Closing gaps to\n            generate more inclusive growth : systematic country\n            diagnostic : Guatemala - Cerrando brechas para generar un\n            crecimiento m\u00e1s inclusivo : Diagn\u00f3stico sistem\u00e1tico de pa\u00eds"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2016/01/26797350/guatemala-closing-gaps-generate-more-inclusive-growth-systematic-country-diagnostic-guatemala-cerrando-brechas-para-generar-un-crecimiento-m\u00e1s-inclusivo-diagn\u00f3stico-sistem\u00e1tico-de-pa\u00eds","projn":"GT-Guatemala Systematic Country Diagnostic\n            -- P155122","docty":"Systematic Country Diagnostic","count":"Guatemala","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b0845930fa_1_0"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"Spanish","seccl":"Public","prdln":"Country Assistance Strategy","majdocty":"Country Focus","owner":"Central America Countries CMU (LCC2C)","projectid":"P155122","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Latin America & Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Latin America & Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Latin America & Caribbean"}},"repnb":"106770"},"26557780":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425151468327849352/Guatemala-Closing-gaps-to-generate-more-inclusive-growth-systematic-country-diagnostic","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425151468327849352/Guatemala-Closing-gaps-to-generate-more-inclusive-growth-systematic-country-diagnostic","new_url":"2016/09/26557780/Guatemala-Closing-gaps-to-generate-more-inclusive-growth-systematic-country-diagnostic","guid":"425151468327849352","disclosure_date":"2016-07-11T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2016-07-12T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2016-07-12T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b084593614","chronical_docm_id":"090224b08443c2ba","txturl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425151468327849352/text/106770-REVISED-PUBLIC-GTM-Report-English.txt","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/425151468327849352/pdf/106770-REVISED-PUBLIC-GTM-Report-English.pdf","datestored":"2016-07-08T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Closing gaps to generate more\n            inclusive growth : systematic country diagnostic"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD)\n            looks at why a country with such great potential has not\n            been able to materialize it.

The world\u2019s\n            largest transcontinental country spans eleven time zones in\n            northern Eurasia. Russia is the main trading partner for\n            many of its more than a dozen neighbors. Russia\u2019s importance\n            to the global climate change agenda is reflected in the fact\n            that it has the world\u2019s largest forest reserves, second only\n            to the Amazon Rainforest in terms of the amount of carbon\n            dioxide it absorbs. Altogether, these characteristics render\n            undertaking this Systematic Country Diagnostic about\n            Russia\u2019s future development course challenging. The analysis\n            identifies general causal chains related to Russia\u2019s\n            interlinked development challenges and opportunities, but is\n            often based on data only available at the national level.\n            From the 1998\u201399 crisis until 2011, Russia experienced\n            nearly uninterrupted strong growth and unprecedented gains\n            in shared prosperity. However, growth dynamics have weakened\n            since 2012, and the end of the commodity super cycle in 2014\n            ushered in a period of difficult economic adjustment. From\n            2012\u201313, growth and shared prosperity trends started to\n            weaken as second-generation structural reforms\u2015strengthening\n            the climate investment, diversifying the economic structure,\n            and closing the infrastructure gap\u2015advanced more slowly.\n            With fiscal pressures rising, the cost of the underlying\n            social contract\u2014in which the state is entrusted with\n            providing jobs, services, and a system of significant\n            transfers and subsidies\u2014is becoming more difficult to\n            sustain. The recent crisis exposed the vulnerability of\n            Russia\u2019s economy and raised questions about the\n            sustainability of past achievements in boosting shared\n            prosperity. Productivity and job growth will remain elusive\n            and ultimately jeopardize the social gains of the past\n            decade without a conducive investment environment, skilled\n            labor, and adequate infrastructure. This diagnostic\n            identifies two pathways where progress is critical for\n            sustainable growth and an expansion of shared prosperity.\n            The first pathway identified areas where new policies are\n            necessary to achieve a recovery in productivity, focusing on\n            infrastructure and connectivity, the regulatory regime for\n            businesses, constraints on innovation by firms, and skills\n            development for individuals.

Within the enabling\n            environment of macroeconomic stability, most of the progress\n            on the twin goals was attributable to higher agricultural\n            incomes. Poverty reduction among households primarily\n            engaged in agriculture accounted for 53 percent of the\n            reduction in poverty from 2006 to 2010 and 77 percent of the\n            reduction in poverty from 2010 to 2013. Despite significant\n            progress on the twin goals, vulnerability to poverty in\n            Uganda is high and the sparse social safety nets and limited\n            access to finance have provided little protection. Change in\n            economic and social policies is required to prevent a\n            slowdown in poverty reduction and an increase in\n            vulnerability. In this context, a comprehensive framework\n            based on the three interrelated blocks of growth, inclusion,\n            and sustainability has been used to identify the challenges\n            to and opportunities for ending poverty and boosting shared\n            prosperity. The first block emphasizes the development of a\n            competitive and resilient private sector to lead the growth\n            process by adequately capitalizing on all the available\n            opportunities. The second block, complementary to the first\n            one, reinforces the need to ensure a fair distribution of\n            the growth dividend across all Ugandans, especially those\n            living in the north and the east, by providing them with\n            access to social and infrastructure services so that they\n            can increase their productive capacity and income generating\n            opportunities. The third block emphasizes the need to\n            undertake the inclusive growth process in a fiscally,\n            socially, and environmentally sustainable manner."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda -

shared\n            prosperity for its citizens and approach European living\n            standards. The country has been at peace since the end of\n            1995, but its development model needs adjustment if it is to\n            join the ranks of prosperous European economies. BiH has a\n            disproportionately large public sector that dates back to\n            Yugoslav times and has only been partly reformed since, and\n            the constitutional arrangements under the Dayton and\n            Washington Agreements had as their aim the cessation of war\n            rather than the explicit goal of building a viable and\n            efficient state. Financial inflows, particularly aid and\n            remittances, have been fueling consumption-based economic\n            growth. These inflows were important in post-war recovery,\n            and propelled the country back to middle-income status.\n            However, reaching high levels of income, creating prosperity\n            and eliminating poverty will only happen if BiH shifts\n            toward an economic model that builds on international\n            integration, especially with the EU, BiH\u2019s most important\n            trading partner and anchor of institutional reform. BiH\n            needs to rebalance its development model in two fundamental\n            ways in order to succeed. First, it needs to unleash the\n            potential of the private sector while reducing the footprint\n            of the very large public sector. Second, the economy needs\n            to shift from an inward focus driven by local consumption\n            and imports to the potential of international integration\n            through investments and exports. To achieve this country\n            needs more (and larger) companies, vibrant small and medium\n            sized enterprises and a business environment that allows\n            them to grow and expand output, employment, and exports."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rebalancing Bosnia and Herzegovina : a\n            systematic country diagnostic"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rebalancing Bosnia

Honduras\u2019\n            persistent poverty is the result of long-term low per capita\n            growth and high inequality, perpetuated by the country\u2019s\n            high vulnerability to shocks. First, over the past 40 years\n            the country has experienced modest growth rates marked by\n            considerable volatility. Second, high levels of inequality\n            have weakened the ability for growth to reduce poverty by\n            limiting the extent to which a large segment of the\n            population is able to fully access physical and human\n            capital. Third, a large share of the population is\n            vulnerable and exposed to regular shocks - both large and\n            small which has exacerbated poverty by destroying or slowing\n            asset accumulation. This systematic country diagnostic (SCD)\n            explores the drivers of these development outcomes in\n            Honduras, and reflects on the policy priorities that should\n            underlie a development strategy focused on eradicating\n            poverty and boosting shared prosperity. After identifying a\n            number of critical factors affecting the country\u2019s\n            development outcomes, the SCD concludes that there is a need\n            for a comprehensive agenda that tackles simultaneously the\n            problems that have kept the country in a low development\n            equilibrium for many decades, as well as emerging challenges\n            that have the potential not only to prevent progress but\n            also worsen the current situation. The SCD also argues that\n            the policy agenda needs to be ambitious and move away from\n            marginal interventions in order to move Honduras from a\n            situation where its economic potentials are just potentials\n            to another where they become actuals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Unlocking economic potential for\n            greater opportunities :

          delta, Bangladesh combines high vulnerability to floods,\n            tropical cyclones, earthquakes, and climate change with one\n            of the world\u2019s highest population densities, with around 159\n            million people living in less than 150,000 sq. km. With the\n            world\u2019s second lowest per capita income in 1975, it was\n            labeled \u2018the test case for development\u2019 in view of the\n            formidable development challenges it faced. Nevertheless,\n            Bangladesh has proven to be remarkably resilient, developing\n            well beyond initial expectations, and has made very good\n            progress with poverty reduction. GNI per capita has grown\n            from around US$100 in 1972 to US$1,314 in 2015, and the\n            country crossed the World Bank threshold for the\n            lower-middle-income group in 2015. As highlighted in the\n            Seventh Five Year Plan background paper on ending extreme\n            poverty, the agricultural labor market in Bangladesh\n            tightened significantly in the decade of 2000s, which led to\n            an increase in the real agricultural wage rate. Three main\n            channels were the primary contributors: (a) relocation of\n            farm labor to rural non-farm sectors; (b) relocation of\n            rural labor to urban activities through the \u2018pull effects\u2019\n            of urbanization, creating employment opportunities for the\n            extreme poor in labor-intensive construction and transport\n            activities; and (c) jobs for the poor created in the\n            manufacturing sector. Robust inflows of remittances from\n            overseas workers contributed to spurring the creation of\n            non-farm employment opportunities in rural areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh

archipelagic coral island provides the\n            country with an extremely rich and diverse marine ecological\n            system. With more territorial sea than land, marine\n            resources have played a vital role shaping the contours of\n            economic development, with nature-based tourism being the\n            key driver of economic growth and fisheries an important\n            sector of employment for the local population. Maldives\n            developed a successful high-end tourism sector, whose\n            sizable rents have been redistributed to the population to\n            address its development challenges. Gross Domestic Product\n            (GDP) per capita increased from $275 in 1980 to $6,666 in\n            2013. This growth rate, which averaged 7 percent between\n            2002 and 2013, is mainly driven by tourism and non-tradable\n            tourism related activities. This impressive track record of\n            economic growth has been supported by capital accumulation\n            through investment in resorts, and by an increase in the\n            labor force mainly benefiting foreign workers. Fiscal\n            revenues generated in the tourism sector have been used to\n            address some of the structural development challenges of\n            Maldives\u2019 economy. This systematic country diagnostic for\n            Maldives aims at identifying the most critical constraints\n            and opportunities facing the country as it works towards\n            promoting sustainable growth, reducing poverty and boosting\n            shared prosperity. In addition to serving as a public good\n            for the government, civil society, research and academic\n            community, and local and international development partners,\n            the findings of the SCD will be used as key inputs in the\n            preparation of the WBG strategy, the country partnership\n            framework, which will outline how the Bank Group\u2019s\n

European Union (EU) accession, Bulgaria\u2019s\n            growth has slowed down and poverty remains the highest in\n            the EU. Bulgaria achieved the highest recorded growth rates\n            between 2000-08 on the back of exceptionally high capital\n            inflows, structural reforms, sound fiscal management and the\n            prospects of EU accession. Employment boomed and poverty\n            fell steeply. Since 2008 \u2013 the year of global economic\n            crisis \u2013 economic growth has been sluggish, poverty on the\n            rise and income gains of the bottom 40 percent. Recently,\n            labor markets and poverty have shown some signs of respite\n            but new growth drivers and a sustained reform commitment\n            will be needed for the current generation of Bulgarians to\n            obtain EU living standards. This Systematic Country\n            Diagnostic (SCD) identifies three policy areas with the\n            potential to transform the economy and achieve this\n            objective: (1) strengthening the institutional and legal\n            framework for good governance; (2) boosting the skills and\n            employability5 of all Bulgarians; and (3) improving the\n            effectiveness and efficiency of public spending.

The Republic of South Sudan emerged\n            from decades of conflict in 2011 as the world\u2019s newest\n            independent country. In an extremely fragile country like\n            South Sudan, reducing extreme poverty is closely linked to\n            finding paths out of recurrent cycles of conflict and\n            fragility. Hence, the systematic country diagnostic (SCD)\n            focuses primarily on poverty reduction. The SCD builds on\n            the 2011 world development report (WDR) analytical\n            framework. Central to the process is the need to build\n            legitimate institutions for security, justice, and jobs. The\n            framework takes into account different time frames,\n            recognizing that at any point in time the required actions\n            involve a blend of measures, which can have an impact in the\n            short, medium, and long term. As the process to strengthen\n            institutions takes root, the country can increase its focus\n            on the institutional and structural issues that underpin\n            poverty reduction, both through the delivery of essential\n            social services, the jobs or livelihood or growth agenda,\n            and the equity or vulnerability agenda.

Although\n            it is hard to be certain, increases in earnings are\n            associated with: (i) a slow structural transformation away\n            from agriculture and into industry and services that led to\n            productivity increases; (ii) agglomeration around key urban\n            areas that supported this structural transformation; (iii)\n            domestic-driven growth, including public-sector investment\n            that led to increases in labor demand, particularly in\n            industry and services; and (iv) a commodity boom that led to\n            higher labor earnings for agricultural workers in the\n            context of lower agricultural employment. Sri Lanka\u2019s has\n            had impressive development gains but there are strong\n            indications that drivers of past progress are not\n            sustainable. Solid economic growth, strong poverty\n            reduction, overcoming internal conflict, effecting a\n            remarkable democratic transition in recent months, and\n            overall strong human development outcomes are a track record\n            that would make any country proud. However, the country\u2019s\n            inward looking growth model based on non-tradable sectors\n            and domestic demand amplified by public investment cannot be\n            expected to lead to sustained inclusive growth going\n            forward.

Chapter one provides the country context. Chapter\n            two discusses the quality of governance, an overarching\n            issue in Madagascar. It has a direct bearing on the pace,\n            the inclusiveness and sustainability of growth. While\n            acknowledging the importance of improving governance for\n            Madagascar, which is a difficult, medium term undertaking,\n            this Systematic Country Diagnostic argues that progress is\n            also possible. Chapter three discusses how amelioration in\n            managing public finances, and increasing revenue in\n            particular, could be used as a lens for improved governance.\n            Chapter four discusses the role and challenges of the\n            private sector, the main driver of growth. Chapter five\n            discusses the challenges for achieving higher human capital\n            in a country with a very young population and some of the\n            highest infant stunting and malnourishment rates in the\n            world. Chapter six discusses the faces of poverty, which are\n            predominantly rural, agricultural and informal.

Chapter one provides the country context. Chapter\n            two discusses the quality of governance, an overarching\n            issue in Madagascar. It has a direct bearing on the pace,\n            the inclusiveness and sustainability of growth. While\n            acknowledging the importance of improving governance for\n            Madagascar, which is a difficult, medium term undertaking,\n            this Systematic Country Diagnostic argues that progress is\n            also possible. Chapter three discusses how amelioration in\n            managing public finances, and increasing revenue in\n            particular, could be used as a lens for improved governance.\n            Chapter four discusses the role and challenges of the\n            private sector, the main driver of growth. Chapter five\n            discusses the challenges for achieving higher human capital\n            in a country with a very young population and some of the\n            highest infant stunting and malnourishment rates in the\n            world. Chapter six discusses the faces of poverty, which are\n            predominantly rural, agricultural and informal.

Bulgaria achieved the highest recorded growth rates\n            between 2000-08 on the back of exceptionally high capital\n            inflows, structural reforms, sound fiscal management and the\n            prospects of EU accession. Employment boomed and poverty\n            fell steeply. Since 2008 \u2013 the year of global economic\n            crisis \u2013 economic growth has been sluggish, poverty on the\n            rise and income gains of the bottom 40 percent. Recently,\n            labor markets and poverty have shown some signs of respite\n            but new growth drivers and a sustained reform commitment\n            will be needed for the current generation of Bulgarians to\n            obtain EU living standards. This Systematic Country\n            Diagnostic (SCD) identifies three policy areas with the\n            potential to transform the economy and achieve this\n            objective: (1) strengthening the institutional and legal\n            framework for good governance; (2) boosting the skills and\n            employability5 of all Bulgarians; and (3) improving the\n            effectiveness and efficiency of public spending.

The backward-looking analysis aims to\n            draw lessons on the determinants of poverty and sustainable\n            and inclusive growth from (a) stakeholder consultations; (b)\n            a poverty profile; (c) a jobs profile; and (d) a review of\n            Cote d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s experience, and a comparison with Ghana and\n            Sri Lanka, countries with similarities to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, but\n            with different growth trajectories. The poverty analysis\n            shows that over the past 25 years, poverty has deepened\n            considerably, in particular in rural areas in the North and\n            West. While the fall in cocoa prices played an important\n            role, consequences of the price shock were amplified by\n            political and social crisis and cuts in social expenditure.\n            The main employment challenge faced by Cote d\u2019Ivoire is a\n            high concentration of employment in low-productivity\n            occupations, such as agricultural and non-agricultural\n            self-employment, particularly among the poor, women and\n            those living in rural areas. Very few individuals hold\n            formal wage jobs, and those who do are concentrated among\n            the more educated in urban areas. In the near- and medium\n            term, job creation will benefit significantly from growth in\n            the self-employment and micro-enterprise sectors. The\n            analysis concludes that Cote d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s poor performance can\n            be attributed to its response regarding four sets of policy\n            issues: (a) lack of agricultural development and\n            diversification; (b) lack of structural transformation into\n            agro-business and non-agrobusiness led by the private\n            sector; (c) inequitable social policies; and (d) lack of\n            good governance. Based on this analysis, the forward-looking\n            part outlines C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s strategic pathways out of\n            poverty, better jobs creation through private sector-led\n            growth and human capital development, and the prerequisites\n            for achieving those goals. For better jobs creation, the\n            main pathways are increased agricultural productivity and\n            diversification into agribusiness and other types of\n            industries. Addressing constraints under these pathways, in\n            particular access to finance, will also promote\n            microenterprises and self-employment. For human capital\n            development, the main pathways are increased and higher\n            quality social spending and an effective social safety net.\n            The last chapter prioritizes key binding constraints and\n            discusses knowledge gaps."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - From crisis to\n            sustained growth : priorities for ending poverty and\n

of\n            countries worldwide that have recently experienced both\n            faster growth as well as a modest decline in inequality.\n            Significant achievements in human development over the years\n            have contributed towards improving labor market prospects\n            for workers, which in turn have spurred demand for education\n            and skills. The country has made remarkable progress in\n            improving human development indicators, including life\n            expectancy, fertility, infant and child mortality,\n            education, immunization rates, and sanitation. Successive\n            governments have exhibited willingness and flexibility to\n            work with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to\n            experiment with community-based approaches to service\n            delivery, and have achieved notable successes in several\n            areas. Accelerating the ongoing employment shift of casual\n            workers and small farmers engaged in agriculture into\n            salaried employment in more dynamic and remunerative sectors\n            of the economy offers by far the most promising exit out of\n            poverty. Given the importance of creation of more and better\n            jobs in the Bangladeshi context, the main role of public\n            policy should be to help ensure that the conditions are in\n            place for strong private sector led job creation and growth,\n            to understand why there are not enough good jobs, and to\n            remove or mitigate the constraints that prevent the creation\n            of more of those jobs. The Bangladesh systematic country\n            diagnostic (SCD) classifies priority areas for action into\n            two main groups: (i) foundational priorities - that is,\n            those which are pre-requisites for faster job creation and\n            growth, and (ii) key public policy areas where concerted\n            action over the next 3-5 years can have a transformative\n            impact on the pace of progress towards eliminating poverty\n            and boosting shared prosperity. This report identifies five\n            key areas where concerted efforts over the next 3-5 years\n            can have a transformative impact on accelerating the\n            creation of more and better jobs: (i) energy, (ii) inland\n            connectivity and logistics, (iii) regional and global\n            integration, (iv) urbanization, and (v) delta management.\n            This report goes beyond presenting just a diagnostic per se,\n            and also includes a number of recommendations and\n            suggestions on how best to tackle these challenges."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - More and better jobs to\n            accelerate shared growth and end extreme poverty : a\n            systematic country

It is a small, mostly\n            mountainous, and largely rural country of about 2 million\n            people, completely surrounded by South Africa. The\n            persistence of poverty and rising inequality are striking\n            for an economy that grew at annual rates of 4 percent per\n            capita over the past decade. Redefining the role of the\n            state will be critical for meeting the twin goals through\n            boosting inclusive growth and avoiding macroeconomic and\n            social risks. In this context, this Systematic Country\n            Diagnostic (SCD) is intended to assess development\n            challenges and identify priorities for rapid progress in\n            achieving the objectives of: (i) eliminating extreme poverty\n            on a sustainable basis and (ii) ensuring shared prosperity\n            by improving the welfare of Lesotho\u2019s poorer citizens.

The SCD concludes by prioritizing the key\n            challenges. Lesotho has an opportunity to eradicate extreme\n            poverty and boost shared prosperity in coming years. It will\n            require shifting to a growth model led by an export-oriented\n            private sector, fortified by higher skilled, more\n            productive, and more entrepreneurial individuals,\n            households, and firms. Lesotho cannot realize this new\n            growth model without redefining the role of the state. For\n            this new model to develop, strong political consensus is\n            necessary to push the difficult reforms needed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Systematic country

moving from low income to uppermiddle-income\n            status. Close public-private partnerships facilitated\n            private sector-led growth in astable macroeconomic and\n            institutional environment. The government implemented an\n            activeindustrial policy to support private sector\n            competitiveness while exploiting global trade nichescreated\n            by preferential access arrangements. As a result, savings\n            were high and reinvested indiversifying the economy.\n            Starting as a mono-cropped, inward-looking economy,\n            Mauritiusmoved toward an export oriented and diversified\n            economy producing textiles, tourism, financialand ICT\n            services. Mauritius is now at a crossroads. On the one hand,\n            it can pursue a path where reinvigorated public investment\n            boosts economic growth and reinforced public assistance\n            enhancesredistribution. On the other hand, it can select a\n            path where private sector identifies constraintsfor growth\n            and the public sector is the enabling agent that removes\n            them, ensuring that proceedsare adequately shared by\n            targeted assistance and improved service delivery. The\n            Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is intended to assess\n            the priorities of Mauritius to accelerate sustainable\n            economic growth while improving the welfare of the less well\n            off. The SCD aims to understand why income growth among the\n            bottom 40 percent of the population has been low relative to\n            the average income. The SCD also addresses how the rate and\n            structure of aggregate growth can be improved to accelerate\n            income growth among the bottom 40 percent of the population,\n            as well as ensure that overall growth is sustainable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritius -

Despite this progress and the recent reductions in\n            income inequality, poverty remains high, largely as a result\n            of low economic growth. This Systematic Country Diagnostic\n            argues that the challenge in El Salvador is not to identify\n            the proximate constraints to growth, but how those\n            constraints are inter-connected and what entry points may\n            help break what can be characterized as \"vicious\n            circles.\" The Systematic Country Diagnostic identifies\n            three inter- connected vicious circles that hamper growth\n            and shared prosperity: 1) a cycle of low growth and\n            violence; 2) a cycle of low growth and migration; and 3) a\n            cycle of low growth, savings and investment. Moreover, it\n            also notes action on the identified entry points will\n            require a \"big push\" (rather than marginal\n            interventions) that help break the existing development\n            dynamics. But this Systematic Country Diagnostic also\n            identifies some strengths that El Salvador could build on to\n            propel growth. Areas of opportunity include migration with\n            the positive impact of diaspora on development, geographic\n            and cultural proximity to large export markets, particularly\n            the U.S., and an industrial base that can support an\n            expansion of the tradable sector. At 20 percent of GDP the\n            manufacturing sector is large by Latina American and by\n            middle-income country standards."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador - Systematic country diagnostic\n            : building on strengths for a new generation"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"El Salvador - Systematic country\n            diagnostic : building on strengths for a new generation"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2015/06/24706162/el-salvador-systematic-country-diagnostic-building-strengths-new-generation","topic":"Trade m1326924 698,Structural Policy and Reform m1326450 1130,Growth, Poverty and Inequality m1327633 1091,Labor Markets m1326488 855,Social Protection and Labor m1327194 697","projn":"SV-El Salvador Systematic Country Diagnostic\n            -- P151397","docty":"Systematic Country Diagnostic","subtopic":"Population Policies,Debt Markets,Access to Finance,Economic Theory & Research,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"El Salvador","authors":{"authr":"Lopez,J.

- Systematic country diagnostic"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Colombia has made impressive strides in\n            reducing poverty and promoting shared prosperity during the\n            last decade. Extreme poverty fell from 17.7 percent in 2002\n            to 8.1 percent in 2014, while total poverty (including\n            moderate poverty) fell from 49.7 percent in 2002 to 29.5\n            percent in 2014. The decline implies that 6.2 million people\n            left poverty in the period. The multidimensional poverty\n            rate, which takes into account education, health, labor,\n            childcare, and housing, has also experienced a remarkable\n            decline from 49 percent in 2003 to 21.9 percent in 2014. The\n            number of multidimensional poor declined by 9.8 million.\n            Shared prosperity indicators followed a similar trend,\n            especially after the second half of the decade. Between 2008\n            and 2013, the income per capita of the bottom 40 percent of\n            Colombians grew at an average rate of 6.6 percent,\n            significantly higher than the national average rate of 4.1\n            percent for the same period. Economic growth that led to job\n            creation has been the main driver of poverty reduction and\n            shared prosperity gains. The economy sustained an average\n            GDP growth of 4.4 percent during the 2000s, almost 2\n            percentage points higher than the previous decade. For the\n            period 2002-2013, economic growth explains 73 percent of the\n            reduction in extreme poverty and 84 percent of the reduction\n            in total poverty. Moreover, price stability, and in\n            particular stable food prices contribute to poverty\n            outcomes. As in the case of poverty reduction, labor income\n            growth is the main determinant of shared prosperity in\n            recent years in Colombia. Labor income represents at least\n            fifty percent of income growth for the poorest 10 percent of\n            the population, and up to 70 percent for those in the fourth\n            decile, in the period 2008-2013. This evidence highlights\n            the importance of high growth and low inflation for\n            achieving the World Bank\u2019s twin goals in Colombia."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -

Diagnosis (SCD) for Mali. The SCD was prepared\n            following a consultative process within and outside the\n            World Bank. It identifies constraints and opportunities for\n            achieving the twin goals of ending poverty and improving\n            shared prosperity by 2030 while acknowledging (i) the need\n            for selectivity in pro-poor interventions, and (ii) the many\n            competing \u2018binding\u2019 reasons for poverty in Mali. The\n            objectives of the twin goals are similar for Mali as the\n            incidence of dollar-a-day poverty exceeds 40 percent of the\n            population. Selectivity means the identification of\n            principal opportunities for poverty reduction in the next 15\n            years, as well as the identification of binding constraints\n            to reaping such opportunities. In the search for\n            selectivity, there is the risk of not identifying the\n            correct set of opportunities and constraints. However, the\n            risk of not being selective would probably have more serious\n            implications as it could lead the government and its\n            development partners to disperse their resources and\n            attention too thinly over too many competing priorities.\n            Selectivity also implies making trade-offs between immediate\n            and longer term objectives. In this document priority is\n            given to the identification of poverty reduction\n            opportunities which could deliver results before 2030, while\n            acknowledging that efforts should not undermine the\n            prospects for poverty reduction and shared prosperity beyond\n            2030. In this regard, particular attention is paid to\n            environmental and fiscal sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Systematic country diagnostic :\n            priorities for ending

Lebanon\u2019s confessional system has also proven\n            extremely vulnerable to external influence, which has bred\n            and exacerbated local conflict and violence.

twin goals of reducing poverty\n            and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable way. This\n            SCD takes into account Tunisia\u2019s historical sociopolitical\n            context and the political economy of past reforms to provide\n            the context for the challenges and opportunities that exist\n            today to make progress toward the twin goals. The economic\n            policies of the two decades preceding the 2011 revolution\n            delivered widely recognized achievements, including growth\n            rates above the regional average, impressive progress in\n            human development indicators and reduced poverty. However,\n            they failed to address, and even exacerbated, the\n            deep-rooted distortions in the economy that closed the\n            channels, in particular, productive employment and job\n            creation, for a more equal and inclusive society. These\n            distortions were also grounded in a tightly controlled\n            social and political space that favored the elite while\n            repressing others. This development model proved to be\n            economically and socially unsustainable. With a new\n            constitution adopted in 2014 and a democratically-elected\n            government established in 2015, there is today an\n            unprecedented window of opportunity for Tunisia to embark on\n            deep structural reforms to open the channels conducive to a\n            more equal and inclusive society and put the country on a\n            path of more sustainable development. The SCD identifies key\n            opportunities to build on Tunisia\u2019s multiple strengths and\n            economic potential to help guide future development\n            policies. It highlights the importance of social and\n            political stability (as well as domestic security) as\n            prerequisites for critical reforms to be undertaken, as well\n            as the importance of voice, transparency, and accountability\n            in all economic and institutional spheres for those reforms\n            to be sustainable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisie - Diagnostic-pays syst\u00e9matique"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Systematic country\n            diagnostic : Tunisie - Diagnostic-pays syst\u00e9matique"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2015/06/25737492/tunisia-systematic-country-diagnostic-tunisie-diagnostic-pays-syst\u00e9matique","topic":"Industry Analytics and Diagnostics\n            m1326714 1231,Gender and Human Development m1326908 919,Diagnosis Related Groups m1327023 1301,Growth Diagnostics m1325997 473,Poverty m1326687 695","projn":"TN-Tunisia Systematic Country Diagnostic -- P151647","docty":"Systematic Country Diagnostic","count":"Tunisia","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08400c4e7_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"World!$!517191"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"World!$!517191"}},"admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","prdln":"Country Assistance Strategy","topicv3":"Industry Analytics and Diagnostics\n            m1326714 1231,Gender and Human Development m1326908 919,Diagnosis Related Groups m1327023 1301,Growth Diagnostics m1325997 473,Poverty m1326687 695","majdocty":"Country Focus","owner":"GMF - MENA (GMF05)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"World"},"1":{"geo_region":"World"}},"repnb":"102298","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Tunisie - Diagnostic-pays syst\u00e9matique"}}},"24848188":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/914791468187801159/Uruguay-Systematic-country-diagnostic","available_in":"Spanish,English","fullavailablein":[{"lang":"Spanish","entityid":"090224b083528837_1_0","node_id":"24848188"}],"url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/914791468187801159/Uruguay-Systematic-country-diagnostic","new_url":"2016/02/24848188/Uruguay-Systematic-country-diagnostic","guid":"914791468187801159","disclosure_date":"2015-07-30T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2016-02-03T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2016-02-03T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b08303cd7f","chronical_docm_id":"090224b08303cd7f","txturl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/914791468187801159/text/98620-SCD-Box393170B-PUBLIC-SecM2015-0227.txt","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/914791468187801159/pdf/98620-SCD-Box393170B-PUBLIC-SecM2015-0227.pdf","docdt":"2015-06-01T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2015-07-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Systematic country diagnostic"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Uruguay currently stands out in Latin\n            America for its higher per capita income, low inequality,\n            low poverty, and virtual absence of indigence.

It will\n            analyze the dynamics behind the progress achieved in the\n            past decade on inclusive growth, and identify a number of\n            key constraints for sustaining and consolidating this\n            progress. The SCD begins, in Chapter two, with a\n            presentation of four characteristics that make Bolivia\n            special, including its State\u2010led development strategy, large\n            natural resource wealth, difficult geography and landlocked\n            condition, and rich ethnic diversity. In chapter three, this\n            SCD presents an in\u2010depth evaluation of the generally\n            positive evolution in growth and in the reduction of poverty\n            and inequality over the past decade. An assessment of the\n            recent past and current context concludes that there is a\n            need for enabling new inclusive growth engines, particularly\n            through increased private investment and higher\n            productivity. Chapter four makes a case for rebalancing the\n            path of inclusive growth, and presents three main challenges\n            in this sense: sustaining macroeconomic and fiscal\n            stability, developing non\u2010extractive sectors with higher\n            productivity and a lower environmental footprint, and\n            reducing gaps and disparities in access to opportunities.\n            The discussion of these challenges reveals a number of\n            priority constraints, a key input for the prioritization\n            exercise. Finally, in chapter five the SCD presents the\n            findings of a prioritization exercise aimed at producing a\n            restricted list of prioritized constraints, as well as a\n            list of knowledge gaps identified in the different parts of\n            the analysis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Systematic country diagnostic  :\n            rebalancing inclusive growth to

However, this system, originally\n            established to balance the competing interests of local\n            religious communities, is increasingly seen as an impediment\n            to more effective governance as it has resulted in a\n            paralysis in decision-making and a general hollowing out of\n            the state. Lebanon\u2019s confessional system has also proven\n            extremely vulnerable to external influence, which has bred\n            and exacerbated local conflict and violence.

Reforms in these areas\n            must be tackled with a sense of urgency if Lebanon is to\n            generate the number and quality of jobs it needs for its\n            citizens and achieve progress towards the twin goals, to\n            avoid further deterioration in the well-being of citizens\n            and, importantly, to manage the added pressures stemming\n            from regional conflicts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646 - \u062a\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0643:\n            \u0628\u0644\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0647\u062c\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0634\u062e\u064a\u0635"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lebanon - Promoting poverty\n            reduction and shared prosperity : a systematic country\n            diagnostic : \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646 - \u062a\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0643:\n            \u0628\u0644\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0647\u062c\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0634\u062e\u064a\u0635"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2015/06/27059626/lebanon-promoting-poverty-reduction-shared-prosperity-systematic-country-diagnostic-\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646-\u062a\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632-\u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f-\u0645\u0646-\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u0631-\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0621-\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0643-\u0628\u0644\u062f-\u0645\u0646\u0647\u062c\u064a\u0629-\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0634\u062e\u064a\u0635","topic":"Inequality and Shared Prosperity m1327655 700,Poverty and Fiscal, Financial and Economic\n            Crisis m1327424 1165,Shocks and Vulnerability to Poverty\n            m1326691 1160,Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707,Jobs and Shared Prosperity m1503933 2672","projn":"LB-Lebanon - Systematic Country Diagnostic\n            -- P151430","docty":"Systematic Country Diagnostic","count":"Lebanon","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa!$!517202"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa!$!517202"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b084815d68_1_0"},"admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"Arabic","seccl":"Public","prdln":"Country Assistance Strategy","topicv3":"Inequality and Shared Prosperity m1327655 700,Poverty and Fiscal, Financial and Economic\n            Crisis m1327424 1165,Shocks and Vulnerability to Poverty\n            m1326691 1160,Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707,Jobs and Shared Prosperity m1503933 2672","majdocty":"Country Focus","owner":"GMF - MENA (GMF05)","projectid":"P151430","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF016717-Trade impact of Syria crisis","repnb":"97498","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646 - \u062a\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0642\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0621\n            \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0643: \u0628\u0644\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0647\u062c\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0634\u062e\u064a\u0635"}}},"25062170":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/444921468184438704/Ha\u00efti-Des-opportunit\u00e9s-pour-tous","available_in":"French","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/444921468184438704/Ha\u00efti-Des-opportunit\u00e9s-pour-tous","new_url":"2016/06/25062170/Ha\u00efti-Des-opportunit\u00e9s-pour-tous","guid":"444921468184438704","disclosure_date":"2016-06-21T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2016-02-03T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2016-02-03T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b0843ede01","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0830ead91","txturl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/444921468184438704/text/99566-FRENCH-REVISED.txt","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/444921468184438704/pdf/99566-FRENCH-REVISED.pdf","docdt":"2015-05-01T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2015-09-21T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Haiti : Opportunities for all - systematic\n            country diagnostic"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This Country Assistance Strategy\n            Document states that Haiti has set itself the goal of\n            joining the ranks of emerging economies by 2030.

The country has comparative\n            advantages, including its proximity and access to major\n            markets; a young labor force and a dynamic diaspora; and\n            substantial geographic, historical, and cultural assets.\n            Areas of economic opportunity for Haiti include\n            agribusiness, light manufacturing and tourism. Building on\n            these opportunities, the Government of Haiti issued in May\n            2012 a Strategic Development Plan (PSDH), aiming at building\n            a new modern, diversified, resilient, competitive and\n            inclusive economy, respectful of its environment and in\n            which people\u2019s basic needs are met. This objective will\n            require ambitious double digit growth rates, a significant\n            break from the past, based on an expansion of agriculture,\n            construction, manufacturing, and tourism. This Systematic\n            Country Diagnostic seeks to identify the most important\n            constraints to and opportunities for inclusive and\n            sustainable growth in Haiti. To identify the key constraints\n            to Haiti\u2019s growth and shared prosperity, an extensive review\n            of the literature (from both within and outside the World\n            Bank) was first carried out. Economic and sector work on\n            Haiti produced in 1980s and the early 1990s had already\n            identified most of the country\u2019s challenges and demonstrated\n            that better functioning institutions, stronger human\n            capital, and improvements in infrastructure were all needed\n            for Haiti\u2019s economic growth and shared prosperity. Rather\n            than listing these again, this report attempts to provide\n            some prioritization and identify the most binding\n            constraints, both quantitatively and through a series of\n            consultations with stakeholders and the country team."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti -

Despite this progress and the recent reductions in\n            income inequality, poverty remains high, largely as a result\n            of low economic growth. This Systematic Country Diagnostic\n            argues that the challenge in El Salvador is not to identify\n            the proximate constraints to growth, but how those\n            constraints are inter-connected and what entry points may\n            help break what can be characterized as \"vicious\n            circles.\" The Systematic Country Diagnostic identifies\n            three inter- connected vicious circles that hamper growth\n            and shared prosperity: 1) a cycle of low growth and\n            violence; 2) a cycle of low growth and migration; and 3) a\n            cycle of low growth, savings and investment. Moreover, it\n            also notes action on the identified entry points will\n            require a \"big push\" (rather than marginal\n            interventions) that help break the existing development\n            dynamics.

Areas of opportunity include migration with\n            the positive impact of diaspora on development, geographic\n            and cultural proximity to large export markets, particularly\n            the U.S., and an industrial base that can support an\n            expansion of the tradable sector. At 20 percent of GDP the\n            manufacturing sector is large by Latina American and by\n            middle-income country standards."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador - Diagn\u00f3stico sistem\u00e1tico de\n            pa\u00eds : construyendo sobre las fortalezas para una nueva generaci\u00f3n"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"El Salvador - Systematic country\n            diagnostic : building on strengths for a new generation : El\n            Salvador - Diagn\u00f3stico sistem\u00e1tico de pa\u00eds : construyendo\n            sobre las fortalezas para una nueva generaci\u00f3n"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2015/05/25218612/el-salvador-systematic-country-diagnostic-building-strengths-new-generation-el-salvador-diagn\u00f3stico-sistem\u00e1tico-de-pa\u00eds-construyendo-sobre-las-fortalezas-para-una-nueva-generaci\u00f3n","topic":"Civil Law m1327064 1044,Civil Service Law m1327061 854,Civil Service Tradition m1326768 2092,Civil Justice m1326753 1937,Civil Service Training m1326321 2090,Public Sector Management Information\n            Systems m1326540 730","projn":"SV-El Salvador Systematic Country Diagnostic\n            -- P151397","docty":"Systematic Country Diagnostic","count":"El Salvador","authors":{"authr":"Lopez,J.

The\n            country covers a land area of 19,700 square miles (51,100\n            square kilometers), with a population of 4.7 million, of\n            which about two-thirds live in urban areas. An upper-middle\n            income-country, with GDP per capita of US$13,876 (current\n            PPP), it is under consideration for membership to the\n            Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\n            (OECD), with discussions scheduled for this year. Costa\n            Rica\u2019s development model centers on four key pillars: its\n            long-standing democracy, an ambitious Social Compact, an\n            outward-oriented economy, and its celebrated Green\n            Trademark. This model has achieved many successes, including\n            sustained healthy growth rates, improvements in social\n            indicators, environmental gains, and one of the lowest\n            poverty rates in the Latin America and Caribbean region.\n            This outward-oriented development model has been successful\n            in attracting FDI and moving Costa Rica up the global value\n            chains over the past two decades. The development model has\n            transformed the country from a rural agriculture-based\n            economy in the mid-1950s to one with high value-added\n            industries that contribute to several global value chains.\n            By 2014, FTZs accounted for 53 percent of exports, and Costa\n            Rica\u2019s economy is very intensive in FDI (4.2 percent of\n            GDP). Finally, Costa Rica has built a world-renowned \u2018Green\n            Trademark,\u2019 centered on conservation, reforestation, and\n            protected areas. It is the only tropical country in the\n            world that has reversed deforestation, increasing the area\n            covered by forests from 26 percent in 1983 to 52 percent\n            today. Reforestation is attributed, in part, to the Payments\n            for Environmental Services (PES) program, which provides\n            incentives to forest conservation and rehabilitation,\n            reaching an average of 310,000 hectares per year of\n            privately owned lands over the past decade. Costa Rica has\n            also set aside 26 percent of its land area for protected\n            areas, including national parks, which have become an\n            important destination for tourists (53 percent of tourists\n            visited those parks in 2012).6 Tourism has become a dynamic\n            sector, contributing 4.6 percent of GDP and 14.2 percent of\n            total exports in 2013. Costa Rica also stands out as the\n            first country to adopt the goal of achieving carbon\n            neutrality by 2021."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica - Systematic country

The SCD is structured\n            as follows: Chapter 2 presents the political and economic\n            context. The economic context describes recent trends in\n            growth, shared prosperity, and poverty reduction and briefly\n            discusses factors behind them.

While Botswana is rightly praised for its\n            management of resource wealth, it is apparent that the high\n            levels of investment by government (in health, education,\n            and infrastructure) are not delivering quality outcomes,\n            making it increasingly difficult to meet the objectives of\n            growth, diversification, and poverty elimination. Indeed,\n            some of the foundations which drove the development success\n            of Botswana over the past half century are being eroded or\n            face risks. In this context, this systematic country\n            diagnostic (SCD) is intended to assess the priorities for\n            Botswana to make rapid progress in achieving the objectives\n            of: (i) elimination of extreme poverty on a sustainable\n            basis; and (ii) ensuring shared prosperity by improving the\n            welfare of the less-well-off in the country. It includes\n            individual chapters analyzing the opportunities and\n            challenges to meeting these objectives with respect to:\n            growth; inclusiveness; and sustainability.

Locking in success : a systematic\n            country diagnostic"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Panama has made significant progress in\n            reducing poverty in recent years. Panama\u0092s progress in\n            reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity compares\n            positively with the Latin American region. Poverty reduction\n            in the country was greater than the Latin American and\n            Caribbean average. Only Bolivia saw greater improvement in\n            shared prosperity, as measured by the growth of the income\n            of the bottom forty percent of the population, than Panama.\n            The rise in the middle class, seen in many countries in the\n            region, was particularly marked in Panama and there has been\n            an overall decline in inequality. This report takes stock of\n            this progress, and reflects on the constraints and\n            opportunities that Panama faces in continuing on its path of\n            shared prosperity and poverty reduction. Following a\n            detailed analysis of poverty; recent trends, drivers of\n            poverty reduction, and demographic factors; the report\n            provides elements to answer three main questions. First,\n            what has driven growth in Panama in recent years? Second, to\n            what extent has this growth been, or not been, inclusive?\n            And, finally, how sustainable is the growth and more\n            generally, the development model of Panama? The report\n            identifies a select list of policy priorities for poverty\n            reduction and shared prosperity in Panama. While reducing\n            poverty in Panama will require attention to all deprived\n            groups, the concentration of the poor in Comarcas suggests\n            that this would be a priority area. The need to pay\n            attention to issues of (i) culturally appropriate economic\n            opportunities, (ii) social assistance, and (iii)\n            infrastructure provision is highlighted. On the social\n            front, the country\u0092s cohesion is threatened by existing\n            inequalities, the crime and violence linked to Panama\u0092s\n            strategic position as a drug corridor, and weak protection\n            of land rights. In the process of reviewing, analyzing and\n            synthesizing the existing data and research on Panama, a\n            series of knowledge gaps were discovered. By discovering and\n            describing these gaps, this report outlines a roadmap for\n            further research on Panama that will benefit the design of\n            specific policies in the priority areas identified in this\n            report and generate information that can lead to the\n            identification of new priority areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Locking in success

 growing economy in the decade leading up to the global\n            financial crisis of 2008. Per capita gross domestic product\n            (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 6 percent in real\n            terms, the best growth performance of any non-oil rich\n            European country. This strong growth performance meant that\n            Albania, which was the poorest nation in Europe in the early\n            1990s, reached middle-income status in 2008. The rapid pace\n            of growth helped the country narrow the per capita income\n            gap with the European Union (EU) from 18 percent of average\n            EU incomes in 1998 to 30 percent in 2012. The association\n            between economic growth and poverty reduction is strong in\n            Albania.
